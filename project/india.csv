Booker prize winner Banu Mushtaq on giving voice to India’s silent sufferings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-village-courts-to-world-stage-how-banu-mushtaqs-stories-of-women-and-margins-won-the-booker/articleshow/121328606.cms,"Banu Mushtaq, author of 'Heart Lamp' holds the trophy after winning the International Booker Prize

Banu Mushtaq, a longtime women’s rights advocate and Kannada writer, won the 2025 International Booker Prize for Heartlamp, a collection of short stories drawn from decades of listening to the silences and struggles of Indian women.

In this conversation with Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, she shares why she writes, how pain becomes protest, and what her win means for voices from the margins

Q: Maybe I'll address Banu first. Why did you choose to write fiction?

Q: But it requires more than just listening. It requires something else to make you write and write with the precision that you have.

Q: The ordinariness of the scenarios that you depict in your stories and the violence which is depicted is not necessarily always physical violence.

Q: There is a sense of universality about the kind of violence depicted because Deepa (Bhasthi) has chosen different phases of motherhood or that of a woman's life or a child’s life, isn't it?

Q: Deepa, what was your principle of curation?

Q: The compilation of stories have different phases of a girl or a woman's life. Was that a conscious decision?

Q (to Banu Mushtaq): Writers do tend to put in a bit of their own DNA. They tend to put in a bit of their own experiences. Would it be fair or would it be too far-fetched to say that there are glimpses of semi-autobiographical elements in these stories?

Q (to Deepa Bhasthi): Banu speaks Dakhni, a fascinating mix of Persian, Dehlvi, Marathi, Kannada and Telugu. But your mother tongue is Havyaka, a dialect that harks back to old Kannada and is spoken by a small community of Brahmins from the Arabian coast. But the rhythm of the English flows beautifully. How did this process come about?

A: What else can I do? I cannot provide any relief to the aggrieved women who approach me with a lot of worries, sorrows and while I take up their cause, earlier as an activist and further as an activist-cum-advocate, I do struggle to get them relief, but, at the same time, I want to document it and show the entire world that patriarchy cannot continue to commit violence against women in this way and it has to be stopped.A: I cannot simply forget their issues. It haunts me like anything and it never allows me to be at peace. I want to be a voice to their worries and I want to voice all their issues and say to the entire world that these women should be compensated, they should be liberated and they should be given their due place and you should not perpetrate this type of all violence against them continuously.Stop it. Somebody has to say no. That's what I'm saying.A: Even along with the women's issue, there is the issue of marginalised people. I wanted to show even marginalised people, and those from the minority community, are human beings. They have their own issues, their own problems. I want to share their experiences with the entire world and to bridge the gap and to open a window.A: Yes, I have addressed patriarchy. Patriarchy is prevalent among all sections of society, all communities and it is universal in nature. And I have addressed this patriarchy and I have challenged the power structure which is subjugating women and compelling them to stay within four walls and which is compelling them to adhere to their orders without questions.A: I see translation as a very instinctive process. I'm not sure I am quite able to intellectualise the politics of choice at the moment, at least maybe it's something that I need to think about for a long time. But that said, I'm very interested in the idea of choice when it comes to the practice of translation, because translation is about choosing one this word over that or one phrase over the other. A lot went into the selection of these stories, first and foremost stories that I personally liked as well, because it is important for me to enjoy the stories I'm working with. And then I wanted it to be a career-spanning selection. I wanted to bring a variety of themes that were being explored in these stories. And what was also interesting for me was even though there are different stories, the underlying theme is always the treatment of women under patriarchal systems.A: These were part of the many factors that I was looking into when I was making these choices. So one of the factors was to look into how women were treated in different situations and circumstances. And, the life cycle of a woman from childhood to girlhood to a new wife and and so on. There are interesting things about the multiple roles that are foisted upon a girl child or the periods of discomfort that she can feel.A: In my stories, there are no very serious autobiographical elements, but day-to-day experiences that women shared with me, that has been the raw material for my stories. As an activist and as an advocate, I meet many women every day. They come and talk to me and sometimes I counsel them, sometimes I get them legal relief.They think me as a counsellor and they start telling so many things which are not necessary for a legal drafting.A: Multilinguality is not as rare as we like to think it is, especially in the South Indian context. We engage with a lot of different languages, at least three, and likely more. So, words or phrases from another language creep into our everyday conversations. And I was very clear from the beginning that I wanted to maintain this multilinguality in the translation and not flatten it out into just English, and I was very aware of the musicality of the Kannada language, which i hopefully managed to preserve by retaining some words. And the decision to italicise or not, I think is super important. It is anothering of the language itself when you do it, and when you don't, it sort of blends into the English that the reader is experiencing in the book as well. And I think somewhere along the way, we all seem to have decided that English is this very precious object which must not be touched and played around with. And I wanted to completely reject that premise because we don't speak like the British, we don't speak like the Americans. And I think that is where the musicality is retained. And when you bring in these everyday experiences of multilinguality into a translation by retaining the Dakini or Arabic or Urdu or Kannada or whatever other languages, I think that is where the retaining of the cadence, the musicality, the rhythm, those things remain in the translation.Q (to Banu Mushtaq): You do not capitulate to any form of othering, but you choose to depict life as it is within the community. You bring in the syncretic culture that we live in, a cross-pollination of experiences of our diversity.A: Our culture teaches us, whether it be Hindu or Muslim or Christian or whether it may be Kannadiga or Tamil or Malayali, the culture of human beings, the culture of neighbourhood. So we are Muslims, and if there was a feast the female elders of the family would bring a plate of sweets, coconut, prawn, flowers, everything to share with our neighbours, who were vegetarian. Though they won't take non-veg food, we used to go to their home and we used to offer them sweets and all these types of things. And they would invite us for their feasts. And this culture of coexistence is there even today. The fabric seems to be tarnished, but it remains there. So, there is no question of othering. There is a question of only inclusiveness.","Banu Mushtaq, a longtime women’s rights advocate and Kannada writer, won the 2025 International Booker Prize for Heartlamp.

BJP win in Chhattisgarh turned the tide in decisive fight against Naxals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-win-in-chhattisgarh-turned-the-tide-in-decisive-fight-against-naxals/articleshow/121328500.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Rendering the CPI(Maoist) headless with the elimination of its top leader Basavaraju , did not come in one single blow but through sustained, intelligence-based strikes aimed at demolishing the Maoist ‘safe havens’ one by one, but which really gathered stream after the change of govt in Chhattisgarh in December 2023.Though home minister Amit Shah had conceived the mission to uproot Left-wing extremism soon after taking over in 2019 — envisaging moving of the security forces into Naxal “strongholds” untouched by administration or policing and introducing the locals there to the Centre’s flagship schemes — the “double engine” model really kicked in with installation of the BJP govt in Chhattisgarh, the state most affected by Maoist violence. Successes had been achieved by then in tackling and eliminating Maoists from their pocket boroughs in Bihar and Jharkhand, and taking the fight to Abujhmad region in Chhattisgarh, where the top Maoist leadership was ensconced, was the next logical step.What has followed after 2023 is seamless coordination between the Centre and its agencies like CRPF, IB and BSF, on the one hand, and the Chhattisgarh govt and state police with its specialised anti-Naxal wings like district reserve guard (DRG) and special taskforce (STF).Over the past one-and-a-half years, these agencies have worked as per a well-laid out strategy to to neutralise the outfit’s senior, middle and lower-rung leadership and cadres, challenge them in what they thought were their “secure” bastions; and push back the Maoists to shrink their area of influence was shrunk to a few pockets dotting the inter-state tri-junctions.The statistics speak for the success of these coordinated efforts — 401 Maoists were neutralised, 1429 were arrested and 1355 surrendered in Chhattisgarh between December 1, 2023 and May 21, 2025.To ensure that the Maoists do not reenter areas freed from their hold, the CRPF has been setting up security camps or forward operating bases (FOBs) there. Since 2019, nearly 555 such camps have been established, increasing security presence and facilitating an administrative push in the surrounding villages. The benefits of development and pressure on the Maoists with sustained operations meanwhile encouraged a wave of surrenders. Maoists, faced with depleted strength due to killing, arrests and surrenders of their cadres, are now appealing for ceasefire and talks. But the Centre is in no mood to relent and is focused on dealing the final blow to Naxalism and eliminating it well within the March 2026 deadline. . Operation Black Forest conducted from April 22 to May 11 and now the Narayanpur operation — which have together eliminated 58 Maoists, including their top leader Basavaraju — are part of that final blow. While Operation Black Forest successfully displaced the senior CPI(Maoist) leadership and the most potent PLGA battalion no 1 from their Karreguttalu Hills hideout on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, forcing them to take refuge in segregated pockets with a depleted arsenal and supplies, the Narayanapur operation has hit them like never before, rendering the outfit headless.Wednesday’s operation also showcases the success of DRG experiment to utilise surrendered Naxals for anti-Maoist operations. DRG had been taking the lead in joint operations, with its commandos well-versed with the terrain and topography of Maoists’ forest hideouts and familiar with their operational tactics. Armed with pinpointed intelligence, DRG achieved its biggest success on Wednesday — Basavaraju, who according to former CRPF DG K Vijay Kumar operated with Ninja-like stealth, was finally cornered and taken down by the very men who he had once commanded.","Home minister Amit Shah had conceived the mission to uproot Left-wing extremism soon after taking over in 2019.

Oral Contraceptives May Triple Stroke Risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oral-contraceptives-may-triple-stroke-risk/articleshow/121324081.cms,"New Delhi: Women who use a combined oral contraceptive (COC)—better known as the pill—are three times more likely to suffer an unexpected stroke than those who don't. These new findings were presented at a conference of European Stroke Organisation in Finland's Helsinki on May 20.The pill is a hormonal contraceptive, containing both oestrogen and progestogen , which prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg each month. A research at Istanbul University in Turkiye has established the connection between cryptogenic ischaemic stroke (CIS) and oral contraceptives. The research analysed 268 women, aged 18 to 49 years, who experienced unexpected strokes, comparing them with 268 women in the similar age group without a stroke history.Studies from 2019 and 2022 highlighted similar concerns. The discovery of direct vascular effects of COCs requires immediate attention. Healthcare professionals acknowledge that extended usage periods and increased oestrogen levels heighten stroke risks.Dr Anuradha Kapur, principal director (obstetrics & gynaecology) and head of the unit at Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, pointed out that while medicines could notably raise the likelihood of ischaemic strokes, they typically required existing risk elements to cause harm.""Think of it as adding gasoline to a fire that has not yet been lit. If you have a genetic factor or already have a risk factor, the pill can be the trigger,"" she clarified.However, research findings demonstrated that the increased stroke risk associated with oral contraceptive use appears to operate independently, as no significant associations were found between contraceptive usage and other documented risk factors.""Our findings confirm earlier evidence linking oral contraceptives to stroke risk,"" said Dr Mine Sezgin of the neurology department at Istanbul University and the lead author of the study. ""What's particularly notable is that the association remains strong even when accounting for other known risk factors, which suggests there may be additional mechanisms involved—possibly genetic or biological.""Dr Renu Gupta, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute Delhi, emphasised that stroke resulted from multiple factors, including genetic, physiological and lifestyle-related risks. She noted that COC could trigger complications in women with underlying health conditions, including undiagnosed thrombophilias or autoimmune conditions.While the researchers note that further prospective studies are needed, they advise clinicians to exercise caution when prescribing the pill to women with known vascular risk factors or a history of ischaemic stroke.Describing the connection between oral contraceptives and stroke, prof Manjari Tripathi, head of the neurology department at AIIMS, explained that COC usage consistently correlated with increased ischaemic stroke risk, particularly in women with pre-existing health risk factors. COC usage increases ischaemic stroke risk by 1.6 to 2 times, with higher risks in women experiencing migraines with aura. The risk intensifies for women who smoke, have high blood pressure, migraines with aura, or a stroke history. The oestrogen component potentially increases blood coagulability and clot formation.Dr Vinit Suri, senior consultant of neurology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, noted that first-year usage presented the highest risk, affected by oestrogen dosage. Modern pills contain lower oestrogen levels, reducing risks compared to older formulations, he pointed out. Risk increases with smoking, hypertension or age above 35. Healthy young women face minimal absolute risk, with pregnancy presenting higher stroke risks than oral contraceptives.""The real risk lies in stacking oestrogen on top of other vascular triggers—smoking, uncontrolled hypertension or migraine with aura—where non-oestrogen methods are clearly the wiser bet,"" said Dr Bhaskar Shukla, consultant neurologist at PSRI Hospital. Informed choice, annual check-ups and the growing menu of highly effective LARC devices mean women no longer have to trade peace of mind for modern contraception, he added.","Women who use combined oral contraceptive (COC) are three times more likely to suffer an unexpected stroke than those who don't.

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies dismantled a high-stakes espionage ring in a meticulously planned three-month-long covert operation, dealing a significant blow to ISI's attempts to carry out a terrorist strike in the national capital. The operation culminated in the arrest of two highly trained individuals, including Ansarul Miya Ansari , a Pakistani operative tasked with gathering sensitive information about Indian armed forces, sources said.The probe also points a finger of suspicion at some staffers of Pak High Commission in Delhi. It's suspected that ISI officers Muzammil and Ehsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish who had been cultivating Indian Youtubers and influencers were in on the plot.The operation kicked off with a vague tip in Jan that a spy had been dispatched by ISI to collect sensitive documents/pictures/Google coordinates and was to arrive in Delhi via Nepal. The sleuths then developed the tip which revealed that an attack in Delhi was being planned and classified information about the armed forces was to be used to plan a terror attack.Despite the high stakes, intelligence officials had to wait till mid-Feb to make headway.The ISI agent had arrived in Delhi and had collected confidential military documents, sources said. The trap was set, and on Feb 15, Ansari was apprehended in central Delhi with sensitive documents while he was on his way back to Pakistan via Nepal.The operation, sources said, was a masterclass in espionage craft, with the agency officials staying one step ahead of the spy at every turn. ""Our men were making efforts to collect information about Pak-backed terror outfits active in different parts of India and sleeper cells providing logistic support to them. After some grenade attacks outside police establishments in Punjab were carried out by ISI-backed terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa Internation (BKI), the agency suspected a larger plot to threaten public safety in north-western India,"" said the source.""In view of this, proactive steps were taken to prevent any such planning of terror attack in Delhi-NCR. Sources were activated which culminated in the tip about this suspect's travel plans.""Ansari was subsequently handed over to the police who then booked him for possessing and attempting to supply confidential documents related to the Indian Armed Forces to his Pakistani handlers. An FIR under the Officials Secrets Act was registered.The investigation also uncovered the role of Akhlaque Azam, a resident of Ranchi, who was providing logistic support to Ansarul in India. The two were in constant communication with their Pakistani handlers, and their conversations were laced with suspicion and intrigue, sources said. Azam was subsequently arrested in March.The analysis of their mobile devices uncovered suspicious conversations between both the arrested accused and their Pakistani handlers, which suggested a larger conspiracy. A few days ago, a chargesheet was filed in court against the two suspects even as further investigation is underway to identify more individuals involved in the conspiracy.But who was Ansari? A deep dive into his background revealed a complex web of deceit and radicalisation. During interrogation, Ansari revealed that he originally belonged to Nepal but had been living and working as a taxi driver in Qatar since 2008, where he was recruited by an ISI operative. Money was the first incentive and the brainwashing about the 'bigger cause' followed. He was asked to go to Pakistan and meet his handler in Rawalpindi.""In June 2024, he visited Pakistan for a month, where he was introduced to high-ranking officials of the Pakistani Army and radicalised by discussing issues like the Babri Masjid demolition and the implementation of CAA/NRC in India. Ansari was also trained in espionage and tasked with procuring secret documents from Delhi,"" a report filed in court reads.The trial is about commence shortly with the court having taken cognisance of the chargesheet. The two arrested men are lodged in high security wing of Tihar jail. A special watch is being kept over them so that they may not attempt to brainwash other inmates, sources said.

After countering the Muslim side's argument that non-Muslims could theoretically form a majority in the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards, Centre told Supreme Court Wednesday that an ill-founded attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta exhibited documents, including the minority affairs ministry's written assurance to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its affidavit in SC, to apprise a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih that the council and boards would never lose their minority character as an overwhelming majority of members would always be Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal had taken nearly 30 minutes on Tuesday to highlight apprehension among Muslims about the council and boards losing their minority character by claiming that the govt, through the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, at least theoretically intended to make non-Muslims the majority in these two bodies. He had asked when the govt never attempted to make non-believers in Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity members in their religious endowment boards, why were waqfs of Muslims singled out. He termed it discrimination on the ground of religion, which violated the fundamental right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 15.Mehta said Hindu religious endowment board members entered temples and even supervised rituals.The charity commissioner, who can be non-Hindu, can appoint archakas (pujaris) and remove them for not performing rituals or for immoral activities, and SC had upheld this by terming appointment of archakas as a secular activity, he added.The SG said Hindu personal laws were codified in 1956, but Muslims continued to be governed by Sharia law. Adjudicating a petition highlighting this discrimination, SC in 1996 had said such a comparison was not possible and reforms in personal law and religious activities were a gradual process.""There cannot be any comparison with Hindu religious endowment boards as they deal with religion and rituals. But the boards deal with management of waqf properties, which is a secular activity, and the state has the power to regulate it through legislation. None of the petitioners has challenged Parliament's legislative competence to enact the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025,"" the SG said.He said the JPC had consulted Archaeological Survey of India on ancient monuments being taken out of the purview of waqf. ASI said while religious activities, which have been going on for years, had not been stopped in protected and ancient monuments, waqf boards managing these monuments as waqfs had unilaterally allowed commercial activities in these ancient spaces, hindering preservation and conservation works.Mehta said in certain cases, waqf boards had restrained ASI from carrying out repair and restoration work in ancient monuments.","Centre says attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.

Supreme Court Rejects Sri Lankan Tamil's Plea, Says India Not A 'Dharamshala' For Refugees

Poll In your opinion, should there be stricter regulations for civil service applicants regarding reservations? Yes, to prevent misuse. No, current rules are sufficient.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to former IAS probationer Puja Khedkar, who is accused of cheating in the civil services process by wrongly claiming reservation benefits under the OBC and disability quotas.A bench comprising Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said, ""What is the grave crime she has committed? She is not a drug lord or a terrorist. She has not committed 302 (murder). She is not an NDPS offender. You should have a system or software. You complete the investigation. She has lost everything and will not get a job anywhere.""The Delhi Police and UPSC both had opposed her anticipatory bail, saying she had defrauded the commission and the public. The Delhi High Court also dismissed her anticipatory bail plea, removing her interim protection. The UPSC had canceled her candidature and debarred her from taking any future exams. Central government also formally discharged her from the Indian Administrative Service, citing Rule 12 of the IAS (Probation) Rules.Khedkar came under public and legal scrutiny after her controversial posting in Pune, which was later changed to Washim by the Maharashtra government following allegations of power misuse.Her case took a serious turn when the state’s OBC welfare minister ordered an investigation into her claims of belonging to the OBC non-creamy layer.She is accused of submitting false certificates to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to pass the highly competitive civil services exams. Reports suggest she used multiple certificates showing different disabilities, including mental illness, low vision, and locomotor issues.A major point of concern has been the use of different names during the application process—Khedkar Puja Deeliprao and Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar—which raised doubts about the number of attempts she made. She was also accused of using the name change to bypass the rule on maximum exam attempts.Before her IAS selection, she was serving as an Indian Revenue Service officer and was posted with the Sports Authority of India. She had previously used the OBC and PwBD (low vision) categories for her IRS post, but later used PwBD (multiple disabilities) and a new OBC certificate to qualify for the IAS.","Former IAS probationer Puja Khedkar is accused of cheating in the civil services process.

The court also observed ""inherent contradictions"" in the wife's statements regarding consent while highlighting the exception of ""implied consent"" in marriage under current rape law.The court observed that Section 377 of the IPC, which penalises certain sexual acts, would not be applicable within a marital relationship, especially in the absence of any allegation of lack of consent.""In the context of a marital relationship, Section 377 of IPC cannot be applied to criminalise non-penile-vaginal intercourse between a husband and wife. Such an interpretation would be in line with the reasoning and observations of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar (case),"" the court said in its May 13 order.Additionally, it observed that the wife had not explicitly stated whether the act was committed against her will or without her consent.The wife alleged that the husband was ""impotent"" and claimed their marriage was part of a conspiracy by him and his father to establish illicit relations and extort money from her family.In response, the husband maintained that the marriage was legally valid and that there was an implied presumption of consent for consensual sexual acts within it, which could not attract charges under Section 377.Noting an ""inherent contradiction"" in the wife's statements, the judge pointed out that she simultaneously accused the man of sexual incapacity while also alleging that he had performed oral sex.""The essential ingredient of lack of consent – central to constituting an offence under Section 377 of IPC post-Navtej Singh Johar (case) between any two adults – is clearly missing. Thus, there is not only a lack of prima facie case, but even the threshold of strong suspicion is not met,"" the court said.""No prima facie case is made out against the petitioner for the offence under Section 377 of IPC. The impugned order directing the framing of charge is, therefore, unsustainable in law and is liable to be set aside,"" it added.The court further noted that acts like anal or oral intercourse fall within the scope of rape under Section 375(a) of the IPC, but also clarified that there was no reason to believe the petitioner would not be covered by the legal immunity granted to husbands under the exception to the rape provision.""There is no basis to assume that a husband would not be protected from prosecution under Section 377 of IPC, in view of exception 2 to Section 375 of IPC since the law (amended Section 375 of IPC) now presumes implied consent for sexual intercourse as well as sexual acts, including anal or oral intercourse within a marital relationship,"" it said.","Delhi high court quashed an order regarding prosecution of a husband under Section 377 for performing ""unnatural"" sex with his wife.

In return, it would want the trading bloc to offer easier access to Indian garments, pharmaceuticals, steel and oil products.The interim agreement will not be limited to tariffs and may also include issues such as intellectual property rights (IPRs), govt procurement, and non-tariff barriers, a senior official said.

CHENNAI: A vacation bench of Madras high court Wednesday clamped an interim stay on operation of amendments to 10 state university laws empowering the CM to appoint vice-chancellors, effectively wresting what is the governor's prerogative in the capacity of chancellor.The contentious provision, which was deemed to have received Supreme Court's assent based on its ruling defining gubernatorial powers, triggered a rare presidential reference recently and a renewed Centre-state power tussle. The bench of Justice G R Swaminathan and Justice V Lakshminarayanan passed the interim orders on a PIL filed by advocate K Venkatachalapathy, challenging the amendments on the ground that these were contrary to the objectives of UGC regulations and functions.""Through Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations for teaching staff, the commission granted power to the chancellor (Governor) to appoint VCs...,"" the PIL states.However, the state, through the amendments, replaced the power of the chancellor with the govt, which is contrary to the process stipulated for appointing VCs,"" the PIL states.""State universities are recognised as universities within Sec 2 (f) of the UGC Act and also recognised by the commission under the applicable regulations. Therefore, any amendments made by state affecting such universities, especially in areas already covered by regulation concerning appointment of VCs, constitute a violation of constitutional distribution of powers,"" it argues.Senior advocate Dama Seshadri Naidu, representing the petitioner, contended at Wednesday's hearing that universities must be protected from political powers. ""The chancellor is apolitical, like a speaker of an assembly... Education should be in the hands of an authority above politics,"" he said.Advocate general P S Raman and senior advocate P Wilson, representing the state, argued that a legislation brought by the govt after getting it passed in the assembly could be stayed only in the event of ""a glaring unconstitutionality or if it is manifestly arbitrary"". ""In the present case, a state legislation prevails over regulations framed by UGC,"" the AG said.So long as it does not contravene a law legislated by Parliament, the state law prevails, he added. Wilson sought an adjournment, saying a petition to transfer all related cases to SC was pending and that arguing the matter now before HC would leave the pending pleas infructuous. He said there was no urgency for a vacation bench to hear the PIL, and requested the court to adjourn the hearing and provide time for the state to file a counter.Wilson accused governor R N Ravi of ""waging war"" against DMK govt. ""The PIL is politically motivated. Except for a grudge to stay the selection process, there is no urgency in issue. Only the process for appointment of vice-chancellors has commenced. The last date for applications is June 5.""

Law requiring registration of waqf properties there since 1923: Govt to SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/law-requiring-registration-of-waqf-properties-there-since-1923-govt-to-sc/articleshow/121324543.cms,"SG: Muslim side made false claims to project misleading picture to SC

NEW DELHI: Producing historical proof that the law mandated registration of all kinds of waqf properties, including those in the 'waqf by user' category, since 1923, Centre on Wednesday told Supreme Court that the legal requirement was deliberately flouted to subserve vested interests, a menace sought to be eradicated by the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta punched holes in submissions of senior advocate Kapil Sibal , who is the lead counsel for the Muslim side challenging the validity of the 2025 law, by pointing out how the petitioners had attempted to portray falsehood and mislead a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih. Mehta said Sibal had made false statements or suppressed provisions relating to several issues.Solicitor General Mehta said senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who is the lead counsel for the Muslim side, had made false statements or suppressed provisions relating to several issues - the content of bill placed in Parliament after incorporating JPC recommendations, ancient Islamic monuments being made out of bounds for religious activities of Muslims, non-Muslims in Waqf Council and Boards, inquiry into waqf land in dispute, and identification of govt land treated as waqf - to project a misleading picture before court.Living up to Sibal's prophecy on Tuesday that if he raised 10 questions on validity of the 2025 Act, the SG would have 11 answers to it, Mehta said the fact that only a Muslim could create a waqf and it must be registered had been mandatory since 1923. However, before the 2014 LS elections, the UPA govt in Dec 2013 amended Waqf Act, 1995, to allow anyone to make a waqf, ostensibly to appease Muslims and for vote-bank politics.Sibal had on Tuesday argued that the requirement for registration of waqf properties had been inserted in the new law in order to appropriate properties of Muslims.""How can someone declare another person's property, even if it had been used for a long time, as a waqf? How can someone declare an encroached govt land as waqf? Should there be no inquiry and proof be asked about it?"" Mehta asked, adding that none of the affected parties had approached the SC and that the challenge was through PILs.He said the govt had appointed a three-member committee comprising distinguished persons to study the waqf property mismanagement issue. In its detailed report in 1976, the committee said concealment of waqf and wilful non-registration of waqf properties was a deeply prevailing malady in administration of waqfs. The committee had recommended that if a waqf was not registered, then the mutawalli could not file a suit.Mehta said in 1984, Parliament amended the Waqf Act and provided that no suit would be maintainable in relation to an unregistered waqf. But because of political reasons, this amendment was never brought into force, Mehta said. ""This provision was there in the Waqf Act, 1995, but was deleted by the 2013 amendment Act,"" he added, referring to the changes the UPA govt carried out before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.He rubbished Sibal's argument that once a govt officer declares a property not to be a waqf, without any judicial adjudication, the Muslims had no remedy. Mehta said every process of identification of govt land or private property was subject to the provisions of Civil Procedure Code and amenable to challenge before a court of law.For govt or a private party to get title over its land, wrongly identified as waqf property and in possession of a waqf, concerned person must approach a civil court for getting ownership title over it, which is a judicial process.He said the minority affairs ministry had assured the JPC in writing and filed an affidavit before the SC declaring that a maximum of four out of total 22 members in the Central Waqf Council and three out of 11 in state Auqaf Boards could be non-Muslims. ""This does not alter the minority character of the council and boards,"" he said, refuting the argument that the number of Muslims on waqf bodies would come down substantially under the new law.He said the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904 and 1958 categorically stated that the religious character of ancient and protected monuments, which are more than 100 years old, would not change, irrespective of their status as waqf property. The arguments will continue on Thursday.",Solicitor General Tushar Mehta punched holes in submissions of senior advocate Kapil Sibal. Sibal is the lead counsel for the Muslim side challenging the validity of the 2025 law. He had argued that the requirement for registration of waqf properties had been inserted in the new law in order to appropriate properties of Muslims.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121324800,imgsize-98608,width-400,resizemode-4/121324800.jpg"

India seeks US duty cuts for labour-intensive sectors

NEW DELHI: India hopes to revert to the pre-April 2 status for its exports, especially in the labour intensive sectors, as part of the bilateral trade deal with US in return for concessions for American imports, including farm products.""Talks are moving positively. Before July 8, we are looking at concluding an interim deal ahead of the first tranche. It will include goods, non-tariff barriers, some areas of services like digital. We're trying that 26% additional duty and 10% baseline tariff shouldn't be there for India,"" an official said.While the reciprocal tariffs were suspended for 90 days, the 10% baseline duty on all countries is in place, making exports uncompetitive. A full-fledged trade deal, which involves coverage of 85-90% of products from both sides, referred to as ""substantial coverage"", is unlikely till Trump administration gets a green light from Congress for reducing levies below the most-favoured nation rates applicable to all countries. tnnIt can, however, remove the reciprocal tariffs imposed on countries, including India.Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal and a team of Indian negotiators is currently in the US holding detailed discussions on a bilateral trade agreement that was agreed to by Trump and PM Narendra Modi by Fall (Sept-Oct). Govt was earlier seeking an ""early tranche"" before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends, but officials indicated that talks have been progressing well.""Good discussions with secretary @HowardLutnick towards expediting the first tranche of India-US bilateral trade agreement,"" Goyal posted on social media on Tuesday after meeting the US commerce secretary.Govt is seeking duty concessions for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather goods, gems and jewellery, plastics, chemicals, shrimps, oil seeds and some Indian fruits. The US has been demanding duty cuts for its automobiles, especially electric vehicles such as Tesla, whiskey, wine, petrochemicals, dairy, and farm goods, including genetically modified crops.While India is open to lowering customs duty for farm products, it is unlikely to allow genetically-modified products to enter the country. If the US-UK trade deal is a pointer, Washington offered concessions on some 100-odd products while managing to extract duty cuts for around 2,500 American goods as well as commitments for more aircraft and other purchases.To ward off tariffs, India too may have to give more than it can get, including more LNG, fertiliser and defence purchases, experts have argued.","India hopes to revert to the pre-April 2 status for its exports, especially in the labour intensive sectors. The reciprocal tariffs were suspended for 90 days, but the 10% baseline duty on all countries is in place. The US has been demanding duty cuts for its automobiles, especially electric vehicles such as Tesla.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121324753,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/121324753.jpg"
"Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad gets interim bail, and gag order from top court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ashoka-university-professor-ali-khan-mahmudabad-gets-interim-bail-and-gag-order-from-top-court/articleshow/121324536.cms,"No criminality in prof's statement, counsel tells SC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted interim bail to Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad but refused to stay the FIR and ordered the Haryana DGP to constitute an SIT of IPS officers to probe the bona fides of his allegedly objectionable statement made during Operation Sindoor.Applying the standards of scrutiny enforced in the case of MP minister Vijay Shah who made ""crass comments"" against Col Sofiya Qureshi, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh perused Mahmudabad's statements and said, ""Everyone has a right to express opinion. But was that the right time to say what he did? When the country was facing a challenge, why make statements on communal lines? Why is he trying to get cheap publicity in such a situation?""The bench said ""no case for stay of investigation is made out"" and barred the petitioner from making any statement on Op Sindoor or related issues. The bench found that while commenting on Indo-Pak hostilities and Pakistan-backed terror activities, Mahmudabad had talked about 'mob lynching' and 'bulldozer justice'.The bench said, ""You (Sibal) say he is Harvard educated. We find that his statement is using words and tractions to evade saying what he intends to say openly. After commenting on the impact of war on armed forces and civilians, he turned to politics.The way the statement is made, it is akin to dog whistling.""The court ordered Mahmudabad to surrender his passport and cooperate with the SIT. The bench also took note of the sit-in by Mahmudabad's colleagues at the police station and the trial court when it remanded him to police custody and said, ""These people must desist from this drama. If they repeat that, we will pass stringent orders.""In its order, the bench said, ""To holistically understand the complexity of the phraseology employed and for proper appreciation of some of the expressions used in the two online posts, an SIT probe is necessary."" It directed the Haryana DGP to constitute the SIT within 24 hours. ""If the SIT/investigating agency finds any other incriminating material against the petitioner, it shall be at liberty to place it on record and seek modification of the interim (bail) order,"" the bench said.Appearing for Haryana govt, additional solicitor general S V Raju said certain important things were found in the police investigation and if needed, it would seek Mahmudabad's custody for further probe.The bench said the SIT would comprise three state cadre IPS officers, who are not natives of Haryana or Delhi and one of them would be a woman. It will find out the bona fides of the statement and examine whether words were cleverly used to hurt the sentiments of the armed forces and women officers.Appearing for Mahmudabad, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who claimed that he was appearing pro bono, said the petitioner could have waited till May 10 (cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan), but there was no criminality in the statement. ""It was a highly patriotic statement,"" he said.Responding to the invocation of fundamental rights on behalf of Mahmudabad, the bench emphasised that citizens also needed to perform their duties.""We do not know what is happening. Everyone talks only about their this and that right as if for the last 75 years, the country is only distributing rights without teaching them what are their duties,"" the bench said.Mahmudabad was arrested on May 18 for his allegedly offensive posts after FIRs were registered on complaints filed by Renu Bhatia, chairperson of Haryana State Commission for Women, and the Jatheri village sarpanch, who is a BJP functionary.",Supreme Court grants interim bail to Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad.

"AJL: ED says Sonia, Rahul Gandhi got Rs 142 crore in 'proceeds of crime' in National Herald case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ajl-ed-says-sonia-rahul-gandhi-got-rs-142-crore-in-proceeds-of-crime-in-national-herald-case/articleshow/121324534.cms,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday told a court here that Congress Parliamentary Party Chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi have enjoyed Rs. 142 crore of “proceeds of crime” linked to alleged National Herald money laundering case.

ED: Gandhis gained from Herald scam, Cong & its donors are victims

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday told a special court here that Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul received Rs 142 crore in ""proceeds of crime"" after acquiring Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) through Young Indian, a company in which they together held 76% stakes.The agency told the court of special judge Vishal Gogne that a 'prima facie' case of money laundering was established against Sonia, Rahul and others in the case involving the acquisition of AJL - publisher of Congress mouthpieces National Herald and Qaumi Awaz - by Young Indian. The court will continue hearing arguments in the case on a day-to-day basis from July 2-8.In its prosecution complaint (chargesheet), ED has made Sonia and Rahul accused No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, besides naming five others, including close associates Sam Pitroda and Suman Dubey.ED's case is based on the charge that Congress provided an interest-free loan of Rs 90 crore to AJL, which owns significant real estate in different parts of the country. When AJL failed to repay, Congress, then led by Sonia, transferred AJL to Young Indian, a newly promoted ""not-for-profit"" in which she was a director along with Rahul, and they together held 76% stakes.As a result, Young Indian ended up controlling assets worth Rs 752 crore, mostly in the form of buildings or land in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Indore, Chandigarh and Patna, allotted to AJL by Congress govts for bringing out National Herald and other party journals.ED has also alleged that Young Indian paid Rs 50 lakh - arranged through a Kolkata-based shell company Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd - to repay AJL's Rs 90-crore loan to Congress as full and final settlement. The company is one of the seven accused named in the chargesheet, which was filed before the court on April 9. Young Indian was launched in Nov 2010, with Dubey and Pitroda as directors and a paid-up capital of Rs 5 lakh, according to the chargesheet. By early next year, they had transferred their shares to the Gandhis, clearing the way for them to acquire assets, and going by an assessment done by the Income Tax department, these were worth Rs 752 crore. The current market value of the assets is worth Rs 2,000 crore, according to the ED chargesheet.Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general S V Raju told the court that the Gandhis and other accused were enjoying proceeds of crime of Rs 142 crore until the ED attached these (AJL) properties (worth Rs 752 crore in Nov 2023).As Raju and advocate Zoheb Hossain, special counsel for ED, pressed the court to take cognisance of the chargesheet, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Gandhis, sought time until July on grounds that voluminous records and documents needed scrutiny. The court allowed ED to proceed with its opening arguments, despite Singhvi's objection.The hearing took an interesting turn when Raju suggested Congress and those who made donations to it were also victims of the alleged scam. He argued that while it was Congress that loaned Rs 90 crore to AJL, assets of the company were transferred to Gandhi-controlled Young Indian and not the party - an interesting line of reasoning which in the coming days may develop into a larger argument about Sonia and Rahul allegedly benefiting at the expense of Congress members as well as its donors.Meanwhile, the court directed ED to provide a copy of its chargesheet in the matter to Subramanian Swamy, based on whose private complaint the agency had lodged the present money laundering case.During the hearing, Raju and Hossain focused on the generation of proceeds of crime, which, Hossain said, not only included those properties obtained from the scheduled offence but also other activity such as getting 'donations' and 'bogus' rentals.""Rental income worth Rs 142 crore received by the accused will be included in this,"" Hossain said. He submitted that the matter pertains to criminal conspiracy allegedly involving three entities - AJL, Young Indian and Congress.On Sonia and Rahul becoming shareholders of Young Indian, the judge asked, ""The underlying allegation is ownership, is implicitly transferred to the first two accused, so who owns the properties as of date, Young Indian or AJL?... In very simple words, if property of 'A' is usurped by 'B', does it become proceeds of crime in the hands of 'B'?""The judge also asked if there is a forensic auditor with ED and said he wants to understand exactly how companies work and in what ways they are allowed to issue shares. Responding to the query, Hossain said he will get back with answers. He added, ""Whenever there is a fraud, then the court will probe into who are the real beneficial owners, which PMLA enables the court to do.""","ED: Gandhis gained from Herald scam, Cong & its donors are victims of the alleged scam.

'Heart Lamp' shines at Int'l Booker: First Kannada title and 1st short story collection to win prize,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-lamp-shines-at-intl-booker-first-kannada-title-and-1st-short-story-collection-to-win-prize/articleshow/121324532.cms,"Navy stitches past with present to sail into future

Kannada writer, lawyer, and activist Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi on Wednesday scripted history by winning the International Booker Prize for 'Heart Lamp', the first Kannada title and the first-ever collection of short stories to be awarded the 50,000 pounds (about Rs 58 lakh) prize.""This moment feels like a thousand fireflies lighting up a single sky - brief, brilliant, and utterly collective,"" said Mushtaq after receiving the award.The award was announced by bestselling Booker Prize-longlisted author Max Porter in his role as chair of the five-member voting panel, at a ceremony at London's Tate Modern. Hailing 'Heart Lamp' as ""something genuinely new for English readers"", Porter termed it a ""radical translation which ruffles language, to create new textures in a plurality of Englishes. It challenges and expands our understanding of translation"".Bhasthi is the first Indian translator - and ninth female translator - to win the prize since it took on its current form in 2016. Mushtaq is the sixth female author to be awarded the prize since then. It is the second time an Indian language book has won the International Booker Prize after Geetanjali Shree's 'Tomb of Sand', translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell, won the award in 2022.Mushtaq's collection of 12 short stories, translated from Kannada into English by Bhasthi, chronicles the everyday lives of women in patriarchal communities in southern India. In her acceptance speech, Mushtaq said it was an affirmation that ""we as individuals and as a global community can thrive when we embrace diversity, celebrate our differences and uplift one another.""The tales in 'Heart Lamp' were written over 30 years, from 1990 to 2023. agenciesThe Navy commissioned INSV Kaundinya , a 20m-long sailing yacht based on a 5th-century fresco at the Ajanta caves , at the Karwar naval base on Wednesday.The wooden ship , stitched together entirely by hand in Goa, will embark on a transoceanic voyage along the ancient trade route from Gujarat to Oman, scheduled for later this year. Naval officials said if the first voyage is successful, the yacht will then sail from Odisha to Indonesia later.The induction of this wooden vessel comes 40 years after the Navy decommissioned INS Bhatkal, its last wooden-hulled minesweeper.""We knew that these stitched ships were used to cross the ocean from very ancient times. We know that Indians were sailing the oceans from the bronze age, from the Harappan period. There's enough evidence of Indians crossing from the ports of Gujarat to Oman and Bahrain and going all the way to Mesopotamia,"" said Sanjeev Sanyal, PM's economic advisory council member, who initiated the whole project.""The problem is that there are no records of exactly what sea-going ships during the Harappan period looked like. There are some texts, like the 'Yukti Kalpa Taru', which we used. We used some testimonies of ancient travellers from other countries who came to Indian Ocean,"" said Sanyal.With no detailed blueprints available, multiple stakeholders put their heads together to get INSV Kaundinya to sail. ""From Sanyal's vision to Malayali shipwright Babu Sankaran's skill, and from the Navy's oversight to the Goan shipyard Hodi Innovations' determination, the stitched ship replica is a model for successful collaborations,"" said Commodore Srikant Kesnur (retd).INSV Kaundinya is named after India's first known mariner who, according to legend, established the Fuhan dynasty after marrying a Naga princess.""Kaundinya is not mentioned in Indian records, but we know of him from records of Cambodia and Vietnam. We can only guess where he came from, but just as a hint, there is still a gotra called Kaundinya that lives along the Odisha-Andhra coast, and it is possible that Kaundinya is actually not his first name but his gotra name,"" said Sanyal.","Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi win International Booker Prize for 'Heart Lamp' It is the first Kannada title and the first-ever collection of short stories to be awarded the prize.

NEW DELHI/RAIPUR: CPI (Maoist) chief Nambala Keshava Rao , alias Basavaraju - mastermind of some of the deadliest Maoist attacks in the country - was killed in Chhattisgarh 's Narayanpur on Wednesday in an intelligence-based operation conducted by the state police's District Reserve Guard (DRG).Twenty-six other Maoists were also eliminated. A massive haul of modern weapons and explosives was recovered. One DRG man was killed in the encounter that broke out in Boter village and the jungles of Lekawada.Apart from being a founder member of the outfit, born from the merger of People's War (PWG) and MCC in 2004, 70-year-old Basavaraju was part of its top decision-making/strategising bodies like the politburo, central committee and central military commission. He operated with extreme stealth, having been spotted only a few times in Abujhmarh region and on a handful of occasions, outside.Basavaraju, who carried a cumulative bounty of over Rs 10 crore declared by NIA and various state govts, would shuffle between different 'combat zones' and act as a bridge between the cadre and the brass. A trained engineer, he would often be part of ambushes. Not surprisingly, his body was found with an AK-47 next to it.Home minister Amit Shah confirmed his death and referred to him as ""the backbone of the Naxal movement"". ""The outfit is now headless,"" a senior intel officer told TOI, hailing his killing as the biggest success against Maoists in the last 25 years.Though Maoists had lately been haemorrhaging, having lost hundreds of their cadre and many of their top members in combats with security forces, Basavaraju's death will rank as one of the most severe blows.""Modi govt has resolved to eliminate Naxalism before March 31, 2026,"" Shah said while applauding the ""brave"" security forces and agencies for the breakthrough. He added that after completion of the 21-day Operation Black Forest on May 11, 54 Naxalites had been arrested and 84 had surrendered across Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Maharashtra. The PM too hailed the ""remarkable success"". ""Our govt is committed to eliminating the menace of Maoism and ensuring a life of peace and progress for our people,"" he posted on X.It was also celebrated by Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai. ""More surrenders are bound to follow,"" he told TOI while commending DRG personnel for their bravery. The personnel in DRG, largely comprising surrendered Maoists, enjoy the advantage of being familiar with the Abujmarh terrain as well as with the Naxals' operational tactics.Basavaraju, an engineer and alumnus of REC (now NIT), Warangal, was an 'operations' man who believed in military-style assault, understood technology and was a proponent of extreme violence. The attacks planned under him were deadly, with Hidma, who leads the PLGA battalion No. 1, executing them to a T, former CRPF DG K Vijay Kumar told TOI.News of Basavaraju's killing began swirling in the morning. The confirmation came after diligent verification and was immediately celebrated. ""We have got him, it is him,"" a senior officer involved in the operation said.Deputy CM and home minister Vijay Sharma said the operations went on for 72 hours. It was preceded by elaborate planning over 15 days before state police got confirmation of Basavaraju's presence in Orchha region of Abujhmarh. According to a police officer, they gathered inputs from Andhra Pradesh police and surrendered cadres to zero in on Basavaraju.Police learnt that Basavaraju was among a clutch of top Maoist functionaries camping in Abujhmarh, protected by hardcore PLGA cadres and senior Marh division members. Once their camp was located, DRG teams set out from four districts - Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Kondagaon.Gunfights broke out in a patch of dense jungle, some 15-20 km from Orchha. The guns fell silent on Wednesday when the Maoists broke off and retreated.A police statement said several other senior-level Maoist cadres were either killed or seriously injured in the encounter. It would take 24 hours for the troops to return, and more details would be known then.","Nambala Keshava Rao, alias Basavaraju, mastermind of some of the deadliest Maoist attacks in the country, was killed in Chhattisgarh.

Wayne Gretzky’s son Ty Gretzky followed a different path while honoring his father’s legendary hockey legacy

While Wayne Gretzky is known around the world as the “Great One” of hockey, his eldest son Ty Gretzky has built a name for himself outside the NHL spotlight — all while preserving the legacy of his father through coaching, entrepreneurship, and family pride.Born on July 9, 1990, Ty Gretzky is the second child of Wayne and Janet Gretzky and the first of their sons. Although Ty didn’t pursue a professional hockey career like his iconic father, the sport still plays a significant role in his life. In fact, Ty co-founded The Gretzky Hockey School in 2014 with Wayne, a venture that gives young athletes across North America a chance to learn hockey fundamentals from the family that helped shape the sport.“He was my hockey guy. He loves hockey,” Wayne said about Ty during a 2021 episode of The Steam Room podcast. “We do hockey camps all over North America. He is one of my best friends and I love it.”Interestingly, Ty wasn’t named after a hockey legend — but rather a baseball icon. “I named Ty after Ty Cobb because I love baseball,” Wayne shared. It’s a nod to the family's appreciation for multiple sports, even as hockey remains central to their identity.Outside of hockey, Ty is a devoted husband and father. He married Sara Marie Cusick on February 29, 2020, in a glamorous Gatsby-style wedding in Brooklyn, New York. Together, they’ve welcomed two daughters, Sicily in 2021 and Vienna in 2023, adding another generation to the Gretzky legacy.Ty has also paid homage to his father through creative ventures like Gretzky’s Basement, a Toronto pop-up replicating Wayne’s famous memorabilia room filled with artifacts from his historic career. It’s an immersive tribute to both Wayne’s impact on hockey and the family's role in keeping that legacy alive.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message Although Ty Gretzky may not have skated on NHL ice, he has built a legacy rooted in family, tradition, and the values passed down by one of hockey’s greatest — a quiet leader off the rink who continues to inspire the next generation.","Ty Gretzky was born on July 9, 1990.

Panthers surge early, but Brad Marchand steals spotlight with fiery outburst

Paul Maurice’s cryptic reaction and Bobrovsky’s uncalled hit controversy

Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Final between the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes wasn’t short on fireworks—and we’re not just talking goals. While Florida dominated the scoreboard with a convincing 5-2 win, the real headline-stealer was Brad Marchand ’s mid-game ejection following a heated confrontation with Shayne Gostisbehere.Sergei Bobrovsky stood tall in goal, stopping 31 shots, while Carter Verhaeghe led the charge with a goal and an assist. The Panthers’ offensive depth was on full display as Rodrigues, Nosek, Bennett, and Luostarinen all contributed. However, despite the commanding performance, it was Marchand’s boiling point that became the talk of the night.Midway through the third period, with the Panthers cruising 4-1, tensions escalated fast. It started when Shayne Gostisbehere fired a puck directly at Marchand after dodging a heavy hit attempt earlier in the play. Marchand responded with fury—dropping his gloves and engaging in a full-blown scrap.According to Sportsnet, “Marchand was IRATE after he was given four minutes for roughing and a game misconduct for his tussle with Gostisbehere.” Gostisbehere, meanwhile, received only a minor, giving the Hurricanes a two-minute power play advantage.When asked about the confrontation post-game, head coach Paul Maurice was blunt yet evasive: “Yeah, I’ve got one. I’ll be keeping that to myself.” That response only added fuel to the debate, especially since another incident involving Andrei Svechnikov went uncalled. Svechnikov appeared to make contact with Bobrovsky’s head near the crease earlier in the game, but referees let it slide—prompting outrage online.One fan noted, “This looks like an intentional knee to Bobrovsky’s head by Svechnikov... should definitely be looked at.”Also Read: “Don’t think it’s justified”: Brad Marchand slams Leafs fans, says Toronto backlash is ‘crucifixion’ not criticism Despite the chaos, the Panthers now lead the series and have momentum on their side.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.The Lakers, built around LeBron James and Luka Doncic, also struggled defensively and were eliminated in the first round by the same Timberwolves squad. Their roster imbalance has forced front-office discussions about aggressive retooling.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

Al-Nassr dominate as Cristiano Ronaldo scores late

Eyes on history as Cristiano Ronaldo nears 1,000-goal mark

On 21 May 2025, Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 935th career goal in Al-Nassr 's 2–0 win over Al-Khaleej in the Saudi Pro League to further extend his legendary status, a stoppage-time penalty from the icon helped Al-Nassr to the three points, bringing the Portuguese star even closer to his career milestone of 1,000 career strikes while simultaneously reinforcing his status as the greatest goalscorer in football history.For all their attacking threat, Al-Nassr were pushed hard by a stubborn Al-Khaleej outfit but were in control for much of the match. The first half ended without any goals, but it was Colombian forward Jhon Durán who broke the deadlock in the 75th minute, calmly finishing inside the area to give the home side a well-deserved lead.The visitors did everything they could to earn an equalizer, which allowed for space on the counter for Al-Nassr. Then, in the dying seconds of the game, Cristiano Ronaldo was badly tackled inside the box, winning a penalty. Stepping up, the 40-year-old slotted home obliquely in the 97th minute, securing his 935th career goal and sealing the outcome.Ronaldo's 98th goal in 110 appearances in the Saudi Pro League keeps him among the top scorers in the league. His role remains crucial for Al-Nassr as they push for a strong end to their domestic season.Cristiano Ronaldo's goal record rises to 935, and he is now just 65 goals from the elusive 1,000-goal club — a milestone no player in the modern era has ever achieved. With the sun setting on his career, Ronaldo nevertheless continues to be pivotal to the Al-Nassr frontline.The Saudi club's contract reportedly runs to the end of June 2025, with the possibility of a one-year extension or a final transfer — but nothing has yet been made official.

Social media buzz and public reaction





A Japanese manga artist known for her unsettlingly accurate predictions has sparked widespread concern, leading to a surge in travel cancellations to Japan., often called, has captured global attention for her chilling predictions, including a major disaster anticipated for July 2025. With a track record that reportedly includes predictions of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the death of iconic figures, Tatsuki’s latest prediction has left travellers reconsidering their plans, citing fear, anxiety, and a desire to avoid potential danger.The impact of her warning is already being felt in the travel industry, with agencies reporting significant drops in bookings as the feared date approaches. Airlines, hotels, and tour operators are bracing for continued losses. Here, you can explore Tatsuki's predictions, her history of accurate foresight, and the response from concerned travellers seeking reassurance or alternative destinations.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her booka compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years.While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Some of her most notable forecasts are catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region. This disaster, which claimed over 18,000 lives and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis, occurred in the same month and year Tatsuki had predicted. Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, adding to her reputation as a modern-day seer.In a revised edition ofpublished in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms have become hotbeds of speculation and debate, with the hashtag #July2025Prediction trending across multiple countries. Some users have expressed deep concern, while others have dismissed the claims as mere coincidence or sensationalism. Online forums dedicated to earthquake preparedness have also seen a surge in activity, with members sharing safety tips and evacuation plans in case of a worst-case scenario.","Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga.

Two-time All-Star Jean Segura retires



After over a decade of consistency in MLB Jean Segura has officially announced his retirement, drawing the curtain on a memorable 12-year career that took him across six franchises and left a lasting impression on fans and teammates alike.The announcement was made through CAA Sports, Segura’s agency, via Instagram on Wednesday. The post honored the 35-year-old infielder’s accomplishments, stating, “Congratulations to Jean Segura on an incredible MLB career.” With that, the baseball world took a moment to reflect on one of the game’s most quietly impactful players.Segura’s journey began with the Los Angeles Angels, but he soon found his rhythm during stints with the Milwaukee Brewers and Arizona Diamondbacks. It was in 2016, while donning a Diamondbacks uniform, that Segura reached peak form—leading the National League with 203 hits and notching a career-best 6.6 WAR. His consistency at the plate and relentless energy on the field made him a fan favorite and a nightmare for opposing pitchers.One of his most memorable chapters came during his two-season run with the Seattle Mariners from 2017 to 2018. Acquired in a blockbuster trade that also brought Mitch Haniger to Seattle, Segura quickly lived up to his nickname in the Pacific Northwest—“Jean, Jean, the hitting machine.”He posted a .302 batting average, with 7.1 bWAR, and made the 2018 American League All-Star team. His three-run homer off Josh Hader in the All-Star Game that year remains one of the highlights of his Mariners tenure.Despite his individual brilliance, team success often eluded Segura. He reached the postseason only once, during the Philadelphia Phillies ’ 2022 World Series run. Though the Phillies ultimately fell short against the Houston Astros, that playoff appearance was a long-overdue reward for a player who had consistently delivered throughout his career.His final stint in the majors came in 2023 with the Miami Marlins, closing out a career stat line that includes a .281 batting average, 1,545 hits, 110 home runs, 513 RBIs, 211 stolen bases, and an OPS of .729.For fans who followed him from Milwaukee to Miami, Jean Segura’s career was never about flash. It was about reliability, heart, and a tireless work ethic. As he steps away from the game, the legacy he leaves behind is one of grit, grace, and a bat that never stopped swinging.Also Read: Why Juan Soto’s effort against the Red Sox is raising eyebrows among fans, teammates and pundits alike","Two-time All-Star Jean Segura retires after 12-year MLB career.

Top stock market recommendations:Nifty had an inside bar formation after closing at a four day closing low on Tuesday. With 24800 breached with heavy volumes earlier this week, the same is now likely to act as resistance for sell on rise on Nifty as the index is now open to hit 214300 / 24100 on downside. After a 3300+ point rally from its April panic low to May high’s the index has barely retraced 450 odd points from its recent highs. With the price action seen from the start of this week, it is fair for the index to retest 200 DMA support on downside which currently reads below 24100.Bank Nifty has broken from its 6 week rising trendline in Tuesday’s closing trades. This puts the index back on track to retest its polarity support of its original 5 year rising trendline. Targets for this breakdown hint for a 1000-1200 odd point breakdown from Tuesday’s closing.A follow up move on downside breaking Tuesday’s low yesterday also confirms the same.After a 22% rally from its recent low, Bosch is showing signs of exhaustion. With price action seen on Tuesday, the stock has closed below its previous week’s high as well as at a 4 day low. A 6% to 8% cool off is expected to play out given the heat up seen on the stock.Computer Age Management Services (CAMS) has given a sloping trendline breakout on Friday last week, while the price on Tuesday is more of a pullback on the breakout seen on charts of CAMS. This pullback is likely to act as a buy on dip for an upside of 4200 odd.Flag breakout on the daily chart is seen on charts of ONGC, with the neckline being crossed in last week’s trade. Highest closing for the month is seen on daily charts which is likely to add traction on the upside to the tune of 5-7%.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Computer Age Management Services, and ONGC are the top buy calls for today.

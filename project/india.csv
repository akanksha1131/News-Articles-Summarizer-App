'We want productive people': Donald Trump says US companies can hire Indians under 'Gold card' program,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-want-productive-people-donald-trump-says-us-companies-can-hire-indians-under-gold-card-program/articleshow/118591351.cms,"Donald Trump. (AP)

A new opportunity for Indian graduates

Revenue generation

Trump wants to offer wealthy immigrants ‘gold cards’ for $5 million

Gold card to replace current visa system

US President Donald Trump has announced a new visa program that will offer a ""gold card"" with a potential pathway to US citizenship for $5 million, that could significantly benefit Indian graduates and investors. This initiative, which Trump expects to generate significant revenue, is set to replace the existing EB-5 visa program.Speaking about the program at his first cabinet meeting of his second term on Thursday, Trump said that the new program would allow American companies to hire Indian graduates from US universities. He highlighted how current immigration policies have prevented skilled professionals, particularly from India, from staying in the country after completing their education.Also read: Donald Trump plays gold card to US citizenship to entice the world's wealthy ""A person comes from India, China, Japan, lots of different places, and they go to Harvard, the Wharton School of Finance... they are made job offers, but the offer is immediately rescinded because you have no idea whether that person can stay in the country,"" Trump said.He acknowledged that many of these graduates return to their home countries and become successful entrepreneurs. ""They go back to India, or they go back to the country where they came from, and they open up a company, and they become billionaires. They're employing thousands of people,"" he said, pointing out the economic loss for the US.""We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,"" Trump added.Many countries around the world have citizenship or residency-by-investment programs. In Europe, countries like Portugal offer ""golden visas,"" granting permanent residency to foreigners who invest at least €500,000 ($524,000) in a qualifying fund.Trump sees the gold card visa as a potential source of income for the US. ""If we sell a million, that’s $5 trillion dollars,"" he said, adding that the revenue could help reduce national debt.Also read: Trump’s gold card visa scheme likely to impact Indians planning to apply for green cards through EB-5 route The program will replace the EB-5 visa, which currently grants residency to investors who invest at least $1 million in businesses that create jobs. Trump believes the gold card will attract wealthy individuals who will contribute to the US economy.""They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it's going to be extremely successful,"" he said.Trump expressed confidence in the demand for the new visa, saying, ""I happen to think it’ll sell like crazy. It’s a market. But we’ll know very soon.""Congress, meanwhile, determines qualifications for US citizenship, but the president said ""gold cards"" would not require congressional approval.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who was also present at the meeting, said the gold card visa program would replace the current visa system for foreign investors but did not provide many details.He confirmed that the initiative would take the place of the EB-5 visa, which grants permanent residency to foreign investors who invest around $1 million and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US.Also read: Trump’s $5 million 'gold card' visa: What it means for Indians stuck in green card backlogs Lutnick criticized the EB-5 program, calling it ""poorly overseen and poorly executed,"" and said the new gold visa system would be a better alternative.""We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,"" he said about future gold card applicants.It remains unclear how recipients would be selected, whether there would be any restrictions, or if a limit would be set on the number of visas issued.In the fiscal year 2024, the State Department issued more than 12,000 EB-5 visas, marking a record high for the program.","US President Donald Trump has announced a new visa program that will offer a ""gold card"" with a potential pathway to US citizenship for $5 million.

'Failed state thriving on instability and handouts': India slams Pakistan at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/failed-state-thriving-on-instability-and-handouts-india-slams-pakistan-at-un/articleshow/118589983.cms,"India's Permanent Mission to the UN in Geneva, Kshitij Tyagi

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday strongly criticised Pakistan at the 58th Session of the UN human rights council, calling it a ""failed state that thrives on instability and survives on international handouts.""Indian diplomat Kshitij Tyagi delivered a scathing response, accusing Pakistan of spreading falsehoods and using the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) as a ""mouthpiece"" to push its agenda against India.""It is regrettable to see Pakistan's leaders and delegates continuing to spread falsehoods handed down by its military-terrorist complex. Pakistan is making a mockery of the OIC by abusing it as its mouthpiece. It is unfortunate that this Council's time continues to be wasted by a failed state which thrives on instability and survives on international handouts. Its rhetoric reeks of hypocrisy, its actions of inhumanity, and its governance of incompetence. India remains focused on democracy, progress, and ensuring dignity for its people. Values that Pakistan would do well to learn from,"" Tyagi said.Also read: 'Committed firmly to shield human rights,' EAM S Jaishankar tells UN Tyagi further lambasted Pakistan for its continued focus on Kashmir, saying that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh would always remain an integral part of India. He pointed to the region's significant political, social, and economic progress in recent years, contrasting it with Pakistan’s internal turmoil.""The Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. The unprecedented political, social, and economic progress in J&K in the past few years speaks for itself. These successes are a testament to the people's trust in the government's commitment to bring normalcy to a region scarred by decades of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism,"" he said.Highlighting Pakistan’s alleged human rights abuses and its harbouring of UN-sanctioned terrorists, Tyagi said, ""As a country where human rights abuses, persecution of minorities, and systematic erosion of democratic values constitute state policies, and which brazenly harbours UN-sanctioned terrorists, Pakistan is in no position to lecture anyone.""Tyagi's remarks were made in response to Pakistan's ""baseless and malicious references"" regarding Kashmir. He urged Islamabad to focus on addressing its internal governance failures rather than fixating on India.""Instead of its unhealthy obsession with India, Pakistan should focus on providing actual governance and justice to its own people,"" he said.His remarks echo India's consistent stance on the Kashmir issue .

48hr deadline set to trace missing SLBC workers in collapsed tunnel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/48hr-deadline-set-to-trace-missing-slbc-workers-in-collapsed-tunnel/articleshow/118589371.cms,"HYDERABAD: Telangana's govt set a two-day deadline from Wednesday evening for the team of experts working to trace the eight workers buried under the collapsed Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel since Feb 22.""We have not lost hope and are working in the belief that they (the workers) are still alive,"" said Telangana irrigation minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy even as the state mobilised an array of specialised forces, including the Indian Army, Marine Commando Force, special forces of the Indian Navy,Border Roads Organisation (BRO), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and rat miners, to carry out rescue operations.On Wednesday afternoon, tunnel experts and disaster management officials inspected the tunnel. The team included BRO tunnel expert Col Parikshit Mehra, BRO former DG Gen Harpal Singh, and BRO former ADG KP Purushothaman, along with NDRF personnel.According to Uttam Kumar Reddy, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) that malfunctioned during the accident will be cut into pieces using gas-cutters and welding machines and removed from the tunnel. Meanwhile, the accumulated fine silt will be cleared manually and with the help of a small Bobcat machine.Silt removal will begin from the far end of the tunnel, progressing towards the entry point. Additionally, two 100 HP pumps will be employed to dewater the tunnel and manage the silt, Uttam said at Domalapenta, near the tunnel site.Govt is also exploring alternative access routes to expedite the rescue operation.This includes a proposal to create a bypass around 300 meters from the TBM area and reach the trapped workers by drilling. This bypass would facilitate the movement of manpower and machinery to the collapsed section of the tunnel where the roof gave way and where the TBM parts are now lodged, officials said.Uttam Kumar Reddy acknowledged that the scale of slush inside the tunnel had slowed down rescue efforts, but emphasised that the safety of the rescuers was govt's top priority. He said, ""We assessed the situation thoroughly and devised clear strategies to minimise risk for the rescuers and move forward efficiently.""Real-time monitoring of tunnel conditions is underway, with advanced imaging systems in place to assess structural stability.This ensures that rescue teams can continue their efforts without jeopardising their safety or that of the trapped workers.Earlier in the day, ministers Uttam and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy met senior officials, including Col Mehra, Navy officer VK Prasad, NDRF DIG Mohsen Shahedi, rat miners and BRO representatives to discuss effective ways to expedite the rescue operation.","Telangana's govt set a two-day deadline from Wednesday evening for the team of experts working to trace the eight workers buried under the collapsed Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel since Feb 22.

The bill has been put in the priority list by the govt as part of its legislative business .The bill was referred to the JPC in August 2024 after it was introduced in the Lok Sabha by minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju.The parliamentary panel adopted the report with majority vote while all 11 MPs from opposition parties in the panel had objected to the report. They had also moved dissent notes.The 655-page report was submitted to both the Houses of Parliament earlier this month. The panel while doing away with the ""Waqf by User"" provision, going forward, has allowed only existing ""Registered Waqf by User"" to be recognised as waqf.This will exclude the cases where the properties are under dispute or owned by the govt. As per the report, the panel had supported inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf boards, which can go upto four and recommended transfer of dispute investigation authority from district collectors to senior state govt appointees.The state waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community, ensuring broader representation.",The bill has been put in the priority list by the govt as part of its legislative business.

Silkyara tunnel heroes say Telangana battle tougher: 'Men trapped inside are silent',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silkyara-tunnel-heroes-say-telangana-battle-tougher-men-trapped-inside-are-silent/articleshow/118587404.cms,"‘In Silkyara we could hear them, here it’s just silence’

DEHRADUN: The tunnel has collapsed. Water and silt flood the narrow passage.Deep underground, there are eight men - trapped, unheard, unseen. At the mouth of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana, hundreds of rescuers battle against time, fighting to bring them back.Among them are three men who have been there before - and done that. Though in a different catastrophe, high up in the hills of Uttarakhand.Over a year ago, they had stood at the opening of another collapsed tunnel, overseeing another desperate mission. Then, too, hope hung by a thread. A diary entry would perhaps read: Silkyara, Uttarkashi. 41 men, 17 days.In the swirling dust and tension, the men who once defied the odds in Uttarakhand are fighting to do it again in Telangana even as they admit the battle this time is harder.A senior supervisor from the Silkyara tunnel project, Shashi Bhushan Chauhan , now standing at the SLBC collapse site, told TOI on Wednesday: ""Life has come full circle for us."" The words hang heavy in the damp air, thick with the smell of wet earth and diesel fumes. His voice is hoarse with exhaustion. It was in Nov 2023 that Chauhan first became a footnote in history, working beside an auger machine in the race to free the workers trapped inside Silkyara's blocked tunnel.This time, the crisis is different. The SLBC tunnel is narrower - just 33 feet wide compared to Silkyara's 45 feet. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) is stuck. Water and sludge keep pushing in. Communication lines? Non-existent. The men trapped in are silent. And silence is the worst kind of omen in a rescue mission. But Chauhan and his team - a mechanic and an industrial fabricator from the Navayuga Group - do not deal in omens. They deal in steel, sweat, and a deep, unspoken understanding of what it means to pull men from the earth before it swallows them.""The teamwork feels the same as it did in Silkyara - everyone pushing forward, driven by a single mission,"" Chauhan said. ""But there's one crucial difference. In Silkyara, we could hear them. We knew they were there, that they were holding on. Here, there's only silence. No voices, no signals, nothing. That uncertainty makes this even harder. We don't know their condition, and that makes every second feel heavier.""Another rescuer explains why this operation is even more challenging. ""The auger machine we used in Silkyara? That's not an option here. There's too much water, too much silt. The ground is shifting, unpredictable. We dewater, and more water rushes in. We clear the silt, and fresh sludge takes its place. Every step forward feels like one step back.""Hope, however, comes in the form of men who are built for the impossible. A six-member crew of ' rat-hole miners ', the underground warriors who crawled through Silkyara's debris to bring the last workers to safety, are standing by, ready to descend into the unknown again.""Our team arrived on Sunday. We're waiting,"" says Wakeel Hasan, their leader. ""When the moment comes, we go in."" No bravado, no unnecessary words.Just the quiet, unwavering certainty of men who have walked into darkness before and come out carrying lives.","Eight men trapped in collapsed tunnel in Telangana. Rescuers battle against time, fighting to bring them back. Among them are three men who have been there before - and done that.

Supreme Court stays Centre's green clearance exemption order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-centres-green-clearance-exemption-order/articleshow/118587341.cms,"MUMBAI: Supreme Court has stayed a recent notification by the Centre placing certain projects out of the purview of prior clearance under the environment impact assessment norms and issued notice to the environment ministry on a public interest litigation (PIL), reports Swati Deshpande.NGO Vanashakti had on Feb 16 moved the PIL, saying the notification significantly diluted the stringent environmental clearances (EC) regime. It sought quashing of a Jan 29 notification by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change doing away with mandatory prior EC for construction projects with a built-up area up to 1,50,000 sq m in cases of industrial sheds, and school, college and hostel for educational institutions.The PIL filed in SC by an NGO against the Centre's move exempting certain projects from prior green nod also challenged a Jan 30 memorandum which clarified that educational institutions would include private technical institutions, professional academies, universities along with warehouses, industrial sheds, housing machinery etc.The SC bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan on Monday heard senior counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan for the NGO and issued notice to Centre. The next hearing is on March 28. The SC order said, ""In the meanwhile, there will be stay of operation and implementation of the notification dated 29th January, 2025 as well as office memorandum dated 30th January, 2025.""The new notification excludes all such projects from the purview of environment impact assessment or EIA, 2006 as against the current criteria, which requires prior EC for all building and construction projects having a built-up area above 20,000 sq m. The PIL said, ""General conditions have been made inapplicable to building construction projects thereby seriously affecting the process of appraisal of all such projects in eco-sensitive areas, protected areas under Wildlife Act, critically and severally polluted areas and projects located at inter-state boundaries.""If the new notification is enforced, it ""would potentially destroy the land, water and air environment and ecology due to unregulated construction activities which would have a disastrous effect leaving a magnitude of environmental footprint that would be impossible to determine and reverse,"" said the PIL, stressing that a built-up area of 20,000 sq m is itself a fairly large size of 2.16 lakh sq ft, but the new, higher cut-off would mean 16 lakh sq ft of construction would not need any prior EC. The notification would have done away with the need for prior EC for a large number of projects in Mumbai, legal experts said.","NGO Vanashakti had on Feb 16 moved the PIL, saying the notification significantly diluted the stringent environmental clearances (EC) regime.

"CBSE double-boards plan all about 2nd chances, choices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/cbse-class-x-students-can-skip-subjects-retake-exams-under-new-norms/articleshow/118563069.cms,"NEW DELHI: Starting in 2026, students appearing for the Class X Board examinations under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will have the flexibility to choose between two exam sessions — one in February 2026 and another in May 2026. Candidates will also have the option to appear for both examinations if they wish. Additionally, students will be allowed to skip specific subjects in the second attempt if they are already satisfied with the scores they have achieved in the first examination as well as particular subject(s) in the first attempt as well.On Tuesday, CBSE approved the draft guidelines for introducing the twice-a-year Board exam system. These guidelines are now open for public review, giving stakeholders the opportunity to submit suggestions and feedback until March 9. The final policy will be formulated and officially implemented after considering the feedback received.As previously reported by The Times of India, the first phase of the Class X Board examinations will be conducted from February 17 to March 6, 2026, while the second phase will take place from May 5 to May 20, 2026. Both examinations will follow the existing full syllabus and prescribed textbooks. The examination centres allotted to students will remain the same across both editions.Regarding examination fees, CBSE has decided to increase the fees, which will be collected at the time of application filing for both attempts.The Board has clarified that no separate supplementary exams will be conducted under this system. Instead, the second session of the Board examination (May 2026) will serve as the supplementary exam for those who wish to improve their scores. There will be no provision for special examinations in any circumstances.The decision to conduct Class X Board exams twice a year aligns with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which suggested that the ""high-stakes"" nature of board exams should be reduced. To implement this, students are now being given the opportunity to appear for board exams on two occasions during a single academic year.According to the newly proposed norms, the list of candidates (LOC) will be finalised in September of the preceding year. This means that for the February 2026 exam, the list will be finalised by September 2025. No new candidates will be allowed to register for the May 2026 exam if they were not part of the September 2025 list.CBSE has further stated that once the LOC is finalised, candidates will not be permitted to change their subjects. However, there is some flexibility in subject selection. If a candidate wishes to modify their subject choices, they can skip a subject in the first examination (February-March) and opt for a different subject in the second examination (May). However, if a candidate completes all subjects in the first exam, they will have to take the same set of subjects in the second exam if they choose to reappear.The new exam framework categorises subjects into seven groups: Language 1, Language 2, Elective 1, Elective 2, Elective 3, Regional and Foreign Languages, and Remaining Subjects.For practical and internal assessments, the Board has decided that these evaluations will be conducted only once per academic year. No separate certificates will be issued after the completion of the first examination in February-March.The final passing certificate and marksheet will be issued only after the May examination. This document will include the marks obtained in both exam sessions (if the candidate appeared in both) as well as the best of the two scores for each subject.By offering students this flexibility, CBSE aims to reduce stress and pressure while ensuring that students have multiple opportunities to achieve their best possible scores.","Starting in 2026, students appearing for the Class X Board examinations will have the flexibility to choose between two exam sessions.

The flyover was meant to eliminate the signal at TIDEL Park and ensure uninterrupted flow of traffic on the stretch from SRP Tools to Madhya Kailash.Under the new plan, vehicles going from Thiruvanmiyur towards Madhya Kailash should turn left, use the flyover, and merge onto OMR. However, a bus and auto stand at the turn and the short 100-metre gap before the ascent created bottlenecks. Similarly, Thoraipakkam-bound motorists heading to Thiruvanmiyur should now take a one-km detour via the old U-bridge, forcing many to drive on the wrong side to save time.The ₹89.6 crore flyover, inaugurated by deputy chief minister Udhayanidhi Stalin and highways minister E V Velu, follows the ₹18.5 crore U-bridge opened in Nov 2023 on the same stretch.EOM/ MSID:: 118563139 413 |","The flyover was meant to eliminate the signal at TIDEL Park junction and ensure uninterrupted flow of traffic on the stretch from SRP Tools to Madhya Kailash.

NEW DELHI: Opposing the plea that the six-year disqualification for convicted persons from contesting polls be turned into a lifelong ban, Centre has told Supreme Court that the present law was constitutionally sound and it should be left to Parliament to decide on amending the law and the judiciary should refrain from passing direction.In an affidavit filed in SC, the Centre argued that there was nothing wrong in imposing time-bound penalty as other grounds of disqualification - such as holding an office of profit, unsoundness of mind, insolvency and not being a citizen of India - were not permanent but time-bound and disqualification was tied to the existence of a supervening circumstance.According to Section 8 of Representation of the People Act, the period of disqualification kicks in six years from the date of conviction or in case of imprisonment, six years from the date of release.Challenging the provision, advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, now with BJP, filed a petition seeking SC's direction to do away with time-bound penalty and bar a convicted person for life from contesting MP/MLA election, forming political party or becoming office-bearer of a political party.Disputing the contention, the Centre said, ""Disqualifications made under the impugned sections are limited by time as a matter of parliamentary policy and it would not be appropriate to substitute the petitioner's understanding of the issue and impose a lifetime ban. As a matter of judicial review, the court can declare the provisions to be unconstitutional and declare them to be inoperative, however, the relief that he is seeking amounts to rewriting of the provision as it effectively seeks to read 'lifelong' instead of 'six years' in all sub-sections of Section 8 of the Act.""The govt said whether a lifetime ban would be appropriate or not was a question that was solely within the domain of Parliament. ""Numerous laws provide for penalties limited by time, in the same manner as in the impugned Act. It is submitted that this is in line with well-established principles governing penal law. By confining the operation of the penalty to an appropriate length of time, deterrence is ensured while undue harshness is avoided,"" the affidavit said.""The issues raised by the petitioner have wide-ranging ramifications and clearly fall within the legislative policy of Parliament and the contours of judicial review would be suitably altered in such regard. SC has held that legislative choice over one option or the other cannot be questioned in courts over its efficacy or otherwise,"" it added. ""A lifetime disqualification is the maximum that can be imposed under the provisions and to impose such a disqualification is certainly within the power of Parliament.""The prayer of the petitioner amounts to rewriting of the statute or directing Parliament to frame a law in a particular manner which is wholly beyond the powers of judicial review. It is trite law that courts cannot direct Parliament to make a law or to legislate in a particular way,"" the affidavit said.","The govt said whether a lifetime ban would be appropriate or not was a question that was solely within the domain of Parliament.

After AAP general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak announced Arora's candidature, the latter said on X, ""Humbled and grateful to the leadership of AAP for reposing faith in me to contest the Ludhiana West by-election. As someone deeply connected to my hometown, I look forward to serving my people with dedication and sincerity.""On speculation that Kejriwal may go to Rajya Sabha, Arora told TOI, ""Kejriwal ji has no interest in coming to Rajya Sabha and if at all he had a wish to come to the upper House, any of the sitting MPs of AAP would have given up their seat to make way for him. He does not have to wait for the outcome of an assembly bypoll."" An industrialist from Ludhiana, Arora was elected to RS in 2022.

7 BJP MLAs join Nitish Kumar cabinet: Changed power dynamics at play in Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-bjp-mlas-join-nitish-kumar-cabinet-changed-power-dynamics-at-play-in-bihar/articleshow/118584163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Is the stage set for a shift in power dynamics within the ruling NDA in Bihar ? Is it the beginning of BJP 's assertion over JD(U) in Bihar? Well, the answer to these questions is ""yes"" if today's cabinet expansion in the state is an indication to go by.Chief minister Nitish Kumar inducted 7 new faces in his ministry - all of them members of his alliance partner the BJP. The cabinet expansion, which was pending for almost a year, was finalised after BJP chief JP Nadda had a meeting with Nitish Kumar.Today's expansion, possibly the last one ahead of year-end assembly elections, has ensured that the two main NDA partners in the state - the BJP and the JD(U) - have representation in the ministry proportional to their numerical strength in the assembly. The BJP, which won 74 seats in the 2020 assembly elections now has 21 ministers while Nitish Kumar's JD(U), which won 43 seats, has 13 including the chief minister.Also read: BJP gets nervous every time Nitish Kumar picks up his phone,' Congress reacts to Bihar cabinet expansion The 2020 assembly elections marked a significant shift in number dynamics within the ruling NDA in Bihar. For the first time, the BJP, which was the junior partner in the alliance for over 15 years, overtook the JD(U) in the numbers game and became the senior partner of the alliance. However, the BJP then did not stake claim to the chief minister's post and kept its pre-poll promise of forming the NDA government under Nitish Kumar.In all earlier assembly elections after 2000, when Jharkhand was bifurcated out of Bihar, the JD(U) always won more seats than the BJP and was the dominant partner. For almost two decades, Nitish Kumar was the undisputed leader of the alliance.However, going ahead, this may change and the cabinet expansion was perhaps the first big indication.""The cabinet expansion is the first sign of BJP assertion over JD(U) and it is the beginning. In the coming days, the BJP will assert more as the party realises this could be its best time to dominate in Bihar,"" says political analyst and former professor of Patna University N K Choudhary.Choudhary has an interesting take on why Nitish can't complain about BJP dominance. ""Politics is not for social service. For almost two decades, Nitish Kumar ensured that state BJP leaders played second fiddle to him. He he could do that because he was a tall and undisputed leader. But that seems to be changing now and the last elections saw JD(U) become a junior partner in alliance. The BJP on the other hand has a very strong national leadership at present and it is natural that it will not play second fiddle any more,"" Choudhary adds.Those who know Nitish Kumar's style of governance in the last 20 years would agree that if given a free hand, the Bihar chief minister would not have opted for cabinet expansion with elections in the state just months away. But the BJP, confident with its electoral successes in Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi, would surely have other plans for the state.Also read: Who are 7 new ministers in Nitish Kumar's cabinet and why BJP picked them A close look at the names picked up by the BJP would show that the party has carefully used the exercise to plan for the assembly elections.The list of new ministers includes a JD(U) leader who has represented Bihar Sharif, in the CM's pocket borough Nalanda, for five times, thrice on a JD(U) ticket before crossing over to the BJP in 2015.Another notable entry is Krishna Kumar Mantu, the MLA from Amnour in Saran district, who was recently in the news for organising a ""Kurmi Chetna Rally"" in Patna. This is interesting because Nitish Kumar belongs to this powerful OBC community and one wonders why he would want a leader who is mobilising Kurmis for BJP in his cabinet.Nitish Kumar, who has earned the dubious distinction of ""Paltu ram"" due to his alliance flip-flops, faces a tough road ahead. It will be interesting to see how the JD(U) chief who has dictated terms in the past negotiates a demanding BJP going ahead.","Nitish Kumar inducted 7 new faces in his ministry - all of them members of his alliance partner the BJP.

What Canada’s potential exit from Five Eyes means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-canadas-potential-exit-from-five-eyes-means-for-india/articleshow/118582864.cms,"Driving the news

According to a Financial Times report, a proposal by Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to US President Donald Trump , to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles. The Five Eyes alliance—comprising the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—has been a cornerstone of Western intelligence cooperation since World War II.

, to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles. The Five Eyes alliance—comprising the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—has been a cornerstone of Western intelligence cooperation since World War II. The move comes at a time when Trump has openly derided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, repeatedly referring to him as ‘governor Trudeau’ in a veiled assertion of US dominance over its closest ally. Trump’s vision for Canada—jokingly or not—as America’s “51st state” has intensified with economic pressure, including a fresh wave of 25% tariffs on Canadian imports, set to take effect in March 2025.

Navarro has denied the report, calling it ""crazy stuff,"" but the idea is consistent with Trump’s America First approach, which has often questioned traditional alliances. While it remains uncertain whether this proposal will gain traction within the Trump administration, the implications are significant—not just for Canada but also for India, a country with growing intelligence ties to Five Eyes members.

Cracks in the Five Eyes?

For nearly 80 years, the Five Eyes alliance has been the gold standard for intelligence-sharing among Western nations. Born out of World War II codebreaking cooperation between the US and the UK, the alliance has grown into a sophisticated network coordinating signals intelligence (SIGINT), counterterrorism efforts, and geopolitical monitoring. Expelling Canada—a founding member—would mark an unprecedented rupture, one that intelligence officials warn could embolden adversaries like China and Russia.

“Sitting where I’m sitting and looking at the array of threats that are coming at us, we need all the partners we can get,” a Five Eyes intelligence official told the FT.

Former CIA official Dennis Wilder echoed the sentiment, describing the Five Eyes as “by far the most successful intelligence-sharing arrangement in world history.” Disrupting it, he warned, would be “met with cheers from Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang.”

Yet, within Trump’s MAGA movement, skepticism toward America’s traditional allies is growing. The Trump administration has frequently accused Canada of taking advantage of the US economically and politically, positioning Ottawa as a target for policy changes that reflect Trump’s aggressive trade and national security priorities.

Between the lines

India’s calculus

For India, this shift in US foreign policy presents a mixed bag. On one hand, a weakened Five Eyes could mean less coordination on global intelligence matters, reducing the quality of intelligence India receives. On the other hand, a sidelined Canada might be forced to recalibrate its diplomatic approach towards India.

Canada has used intelligence from Five Eyes in its accusations against India, most notably in the case of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Khalistani terrorist killed in Canada in 2023. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly cited Five Eyes intelligence when accusing India of involvement in the killing—claims New Delhi has vehemently denied. If Canada were removed from the alliance, its access to such intelligence could be curtailed.

, a Khalistani terrorist killed in Canada in 2023. Canadian Prime Minister publicly cited Five Eyes intelligence when accusing India of involvement in the killing—claims New Delhi has vehemently denied. If Canada were removed from the alliance, its access to such intelligence could be curtailed. From India’s perspective, this could be beneficial. The Five Eyes framework has allowed Canada to access intelligence that it might not be able to gather independently. Without Five Eyes support, Ottawa may find it harder to substantiate allegations against India in future diplomatic disputes. This could lead to a reduction in tensions and a potential recalibration of India-Canada relations, especially after Trudeau steps down on March 9, 2025.

Final thoughts

The proposal to remove Canada from Five Eyes is more than just a bureaucratic reshuffling—it represents a fundamental shift in the way alliances are structured under Trump’s vision of US foreign policy.

The move signals a more transactional US approach to alliances, one that prioritizes short-term leverage over long-term strategic cooperation. If intelligence-sharing becomes a tool for economic and political coercion, many other countries may need to rethink their reliance on US-led security frameworks.

The US is by far the largest contributor to Five Eyes intelligence, and any fragmentation within the alliance could undermine coordinated intelligence efforts on issues like cyber threats, counterterrorism, and China’s military movements in the Indo-Pacific.

There are risks for India as well. A weakened Five Eyes could mean less effective intelligence cooperation between India and its key partners like the US and UK. New Delhi has been working toward closer intelligence collaboration with Five Eyes members, with discussions in recent years about potentially expanding the alliance to include India, Japan, and South Korea. If Five Eyes fractures, it could derail these efforts and weaken India’s intelligence-gathering capabilities.

In the Trump era of shifting alliances and growing geopolitical tensions, the intelligence-sharing framework of the Five Eyes is facing a seismic challenge.This proposal is not an isolated event but part of Trump’s broader strategy to reshape global alliances based on ideological alignment with his nationalist agenda. The Five Eyes network has been the backbone of Western intelligence for decades, facilitating deep cooperation on signals intelligence (SIGINT), counterterrorism, and cyber threats.However, Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement has been increasingly skeptical of traditional alliances, particularly those with nations governed by left-leaning leaders. JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, has called Britain “the world’s first truly Islamist country” due to its growing Muslim population, raising further concerns about the administration’s willingness to work with historically close partners. Meanwhile, Australia and New Zealand—both under left-leaning governments—have also seen their strategic importance questioned by Trump’s allies.(With inputs from agencies)","A proposal by Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to US President Donald Trump, to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles.

Panel: Give ‘exemplary penalty’ to curb ‘sarpanch patis’ practice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/impose-exemplary-penalties-to-curb-practice-of-sarpanch-patis-in-pris-suggests-panel/articleshow/118584389.cms,"NEW DELHI: To curb the practice of proxy participation of husbands and other male relatives often referred to as “Sarpanch patis”, “Mukhiya Patis” and “Pradhan Patis” in place of elected women ‘pradhans’ in gram panchayats, an advisory committee set up by the ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has suggested that “exemplary penalties” should be enforced for proven cases of proxy leadership .The committee has also suggested a robust reporting mechanism through helplines and womens watchdog committees for confidential complaints about proxy leadership, with whistleblower rewards in verified cases.The report on “Transforming Women’s Representation and Roles in Panchayati Raj Systems and Institutions: Eliminating Efforts for Proxy Participation” submitted to the secretary of the ministry has also suggested a detailed roadmap on the way forward with interventions ranging from behavioural change through capacity-building and mentorship, and establishing a monitoring framework from the grassroots to the top.The advisory committee was set-up by the ministry in September 2023 following the Supreme Court’s order of July on the issue. Besides research of available literature and extensive consultations with the state govts, the report is based on interactions of four intensive regional workshops involving 14 States.Secretary MoPR, Vivek Bharadwaj told TOI that they are developing an action plan which will be discussed and shared with states for consultation and execution. “To begin with we will be launching a capacity building programme exclusively for elected women representatives next week which will be looking at leadership and its challenges from the women’s perspective to equip them better to execute their roles,” Bharadwaj said.On the suggestion for penalties and punishments in cases of proxy leadership, he said that they are considering setting up a committee of secretaries of states going forward to study and decide how legal measures can be standardised and executed on the ground to create deterrence.The 73rd Constitutional (Amendment) Act 1992 mandates one-third reservation of seats for women in the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). However, 21 States and 2 UTs have expanded this Constitutional provision and extended reservation for women to the extent of 50% in the PRIs. In nearly 2.63 lakh panchayats — out of the 32.29 lakh elected representatives approximately 15.03 lakh (around 47%) are women.Some of the key policy interventions and structural reforms suggested by the committee include creating gender-exclusive quotas in some Panchayat subject committees and ward-level committees on the lines of Kerala; appointing women’s ombuds-persons and federation of women Panchayat leaders. The report also calls for institutionalising gender-responsive budgets in Panchayat meetings.The report also calls for leveraging technology to combat the problem by adopting interventions like virtual reality (VR) simulation training; integrating AI-powered query-driven replies to provide real-time legal and governance guidance to women elected representatives in vernacular languages.For stepping up monitoring, it is recommended that WhatsApp Groups of women representatives could be created and linked with officials of Panchayats and Block Officials to help solve the day-to-day problems. Also the MoPR’s Panchayat Nirnay Portal can serve as a platform for citizens to track elected Pradhans’ participation in meetings and decisions for public accountability and discouraging proxy leadership.The committee has also recommended direct mentorship of elected women pradhans by the MLAs and MP and dedicated women-only monitoring councils at district and block levels, comprising experienced women ERs and retired officials.",The committee has also suggested a robust reporting mechanism through helplines and womens watchdog committees.

NEW DELHI: After the breakthrough in developing a hyperloop test track (422m) by IIT Madras with support from Indian Railways , the government is now planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport, said minister Ashwini Vaishnaw . It may be the longest hyperloop track in the world.""The first tube will go a long way in developing technologies. The time has come when after the first two grants of $1million each (nearly ₹9cr), the third grant of $1million will be given to IIT Madras for further developing the hyperloop project in a nice way. And once we see the commercial or rather pre-commercial where the product is ready, then within the railway set-up we will start the first commercial project. We will decide a site, which can be used for good commercial transportation of 40km-50km and then we will go for it,"" Vaishnaw said while addressing the closing ceremony of Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition by IIT Madras.Sources said the test track for commercial operation will help railways assess viability of the technology. The hyperloop track can allow speeds of up to 1,200kmph. The successful development of the first test track, which was completed in Dec last year, will be the base for future development.Hyperloop systems are expected to dramatically reduce travel times between cities, offering an alternative to traditional rail and air travel. The hyperloop concept envisions high-speed, low-pressure pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,200 kmph.The hyperloop system was first conceptualised by Swiss professor Marcel Juffer in the 1970s. In 1992, Swissmetro SA was set up to develop this project, but it went into liquidation in 2009. At present, there are eight promising hyperloop projects in the world, including Virgin Hyperloop which has been actively testing its systems in Nevada.

NCW takes suo motu cognizance of 'shocking' incident



NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a state transport bus early Tuesday morning when it was parked at Swargate bus stand in Pune, just a few meters away from the police station.The victim stated that while waiting for a Phaltan-bound bus at 5.45 am on Tuesday, a man approached her, addressing her as 'Didi', and directed her to another platform claiming her bus had arrived. He led her to an unoccupied 'Shiv Shahi' AC bus in the station premises, news agency PTI reported.Initially reluctant to enter the unlit bus, she was persuaded by the man who suggested she could verify using a torch. The woman reported to police that he followed her inside and committed the assault before escaping.The police have identified the suspect as Dattatraya Ramdas Gade (36) through CCTV footage. He has previous cases of theft and chain snatching, according to Swargate police station officials.The police said that they have deployed multiple teams to apprehend him.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar called the incident ""extremely shameful, painful, and infuriating"" and said that there is only one punishment and that is death penalty.""I have personally instructed the Pune Police Commissioner to closely monitor the investigation and ensure immediate arrest of the accused. CM Devendra Fadnavis has also taken the incident seriously and has given the necessary instructions to the police.

The victim is stable right now...""The DCP noted that despite the presence of numerous people and buses, the victim initially continued her journey to Phaltan, discussing the incident with a friend over phone while travelling.Following her friend's counsel, she alighted within city limits and reported to the police station, Patil explained.Officials confirmed the victim was stable and provided a clear statement, leading to registration of a rape case under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.The DCP revealed Gade's previous cases in Shikrapur and Shirur police jurisdictions, with eight teams now pursuing his capture.A canine unit has been deployed in the investigation.This incident has sparked criticism from opposition leaders who criticised the home department, under chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, for inadequate handling of rising crime in Pune.The Shiv Sena (UBT) workers smashed window panes and damaged furniture in the security office, while women activists raised slogans against the BJP-led Maharashtra government, according to news agency PTI.“The incident that took place here, it happened in front of security cabin. If a woman is raped in front of security cabin, nobody has the right to sit there,” Vasant More justified the vandalism while talking to ANI.NCP (SP) representative and Baramati MP Supriya Sule criticised the BJP-led government over the incident.She highlighted the presence of nearby police posts and regular patrols in the area.""Still such an assault takes place at Swargate, which shows that anti-social elements do not have any fear of law. The home department has failed to curb crime in Pune. The trial of this case should be held in a fast-track court and the accused must get a severe punishment,"" Sule told reporters.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal noted increasing rape incidents in the state. He emphasised that MSRTC buses are vital for Maharashtra's transport, yet now face such incidents.""When the Nirbhaya gangrape incident took place in Delhi, people changed the regime.

Ensure a fair and time-bound investigation into the incident, leaving no room for delay or negligence.2. Extend all necessary support to the victim, including medical assistance, psychological counseling, and security to safeguard her well- being.3.

On Jan 29, India witnessed Isro's 100th rocket launch when GSLV-F15 rocket launched navigation satellite NVS-02. He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has laid down guidelines for constitutional courts to scrutinise the proportionality of punishment awarded to an errant member by a legislature, thus permitting judicial scrutiny of the penalty, breaking through a self-imposed restraint to extend its jurisdiction to a matter that has traditionally been considered the domain of legislatures.This verdict by Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh, delivered Tuesday, builds upon the apex court's ruling in Raja Ram Pal case (cash for query) in which a five-judge bench led by CJI Y K Sabharwal had analysed the powers, privileges and immunities of members and said that Parliament and assemblies had the power to expel its members for reasons in addition to the grounds laid down in the Constitution for their disqualification.Also read: 'Imposing life ban on convicted lawmakers solely in Parliament's domain,' Centre tells Supreme Court Upholding Parliament's decision to expel the MPs found guilty, the five-judge bench had said, ""The power of expulsion is not contrary to a democratic process. It is rather part of the guarantee of a democratic process. Further, expulsion is not a decision by a single person. It is a decision taken by the representatives of the rest of the country. Finally, the power of expulsion does not bar a member from standing for re-election or the constituency from electing that member once again.""The verdict penned by Justice Surya Kant, which quashed Bihar legislative council's decision to expel RJD chief whip Sunil Kumar Singh, said the power of legislatures to punish an errant member was not absolute and beyond judicial scrutiny and brought definitiveness to Raja Ram Pal ruling's general finding - ""Non-existence of standards of judicial review is no reason to conclude that judicial scrutiny is ousted. If standards for judicial review of such matters as at hand are not yet determined, it is time to do so now.""Also read: SC quashes RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh’s expulsion for comments on Nitish Kumar The Justice Kant-led bench laid down guidelines for constitutional courts to apply the proportionality test in scrutinising the punishment awarded to a member by the legislature, thus formalising the contours of judicial scrutiny of the punishment and to determine whether it was excessive or disproportionate to his/her proven misconduct.Recognising the complexity of circumstances and situations inside the House leading to varied behaviour of ruling and opposition members, Justice Kant said, ""Determination of what constitutes a disproportionate measure is inherently complex and context-dependent.""""Such assessment requires a nuanced scrutiny of the specific circumstances surrounding each case.

Shah said that Lord Shiva is more than a symbol…”a benevolent consciousness who embodies both destruction and protection, each playing a vital role in our lives”.The home minister said the Isha Yoga Centre created by Sadhguru is not just a pilgrimage but has become a global center for yoga, sadhana, devotion, self-knowledge and liberation. He said the centre serves as a bridge connecting people, especially the youth, with spirituality. Shah commended Sadhguru for not only inspiring the youth towards spirituality but also offering them a profound and intelligent understanding of religion.Praising Sadhguru for guiding the world to the path of a meaningful and conscious life, Shah said that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought global recognition to Yoga by commemorating International Yoga Day, Sadhguru has given a new dimension to Yoga throug Adi Yogi. He highlighted that despite its ancient roots, Yoga remains highly relevant in the modern world and continues to evolve dynamically.Shah said that any account of India’s spiritual history is incomplete without mentioning rich Tamil culture. “Tamil Nadu is a land enriched with countless living examples of spirituality and has carried forward an unbroken legacy of wisdom and spirituality,” he underlined.",Home minister Amit Shah said Shiva is not just a deity but an eternal presence.

Everybody thinks that you are (acting) hard..but there is no soft way of doing this, as I see it. It is a great mission that he (Shah) has taken up.

""The ball is now in the governor's court,"" a senior Lokayukta official said.The case revolves around allegations that Kumaraswamy illegally approved a 550-acre mining lease to Sri Sai Venkateshwara Minerals in Sandur taluk, Ballari district, enabling large-scale illegal mining. The 2011 Karnataka Lokayukta report by Justice N Santhosh Hegde first flagged these alleged violations. Kumaraswamy had been under threat of arrest but secured bail in 2015.The key allegation is that Kumaraswamy bypassed Minerals Concession Rules and ignored the chief secretary's advice while approving the mining lease. However, Kumaraswamy has maintained his innocence, stating he never signed the disputed file.The initial request for prosecution sanction was made to the governor on Nov 21, 2023.

A minor's consent is legally irrelevant, HC said. ""The accused misled her by promising marriage,"" she observed.Following the 16-year-old's complaint, FIR was lodged in May 2019. The girl said the accused sexually exploited her multiple times after promising to marry her. But when she conceived and approached him for marriage, the man refused. The accused was convicted by a special Pocso court and sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.He had challenegd the decision. Challenging the decision, he said claimed the relationship was consensual. Justice Joshi-Phalke held the accused's intentions were dishonest from the outset. ""It is not merely a case of breach of promise, but of seduction as well. A false promise was made, and the survivor was subjected to sexual assault.Since the survivor was below 16 years, her consent is not relevant.

NEW DELHI: In an order that is likely to have wider ramifications, J&K and Ladakh high court has said that if a highway is in bad shape ""due to different nature of construction activities"", NHAI or its concessionaire cannot collect toll tax from commuters.Hearing a PIL on the Pathankot-Udhampur stretch of NH-44, a bench of Chief Justice Tashi Rabstan and Justice M A Choudhary Tuesday ordered NHAI to collect only 20% of the toll, with immediate effect, at two toll plazas - Lakhanpur and Bann - till the highway from Lakhanpur to Udhampur is fully operational.HC also directed NHAI not to establish any plaza within 60 km of NH-44 and instructed removal of such structures within two months. ""Further, there should not be mushrooming of such plazas in the two UTs only with the sole aim and objective of minting money from the general public,"" it said.Though NHAI has the power to suspend or reduce 'user fee', popularly known as toll, on unfinished or dilapidated NHs, it has rarely used this provision. Poor maintenance, riding quality and diversions during expansion of projects have been major irritants for commuters as they are made to pay full user fee without getting the desired benefit.One Sugandha Sawhney had filed the PIL seeking exemption of toll at Lakhanpur, Thandi Khui and Bann plazas on the national highway from Pathankot to Udhampur, where construction is underway as a part of the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway project. The petitioner had submitted that about 60% to 70% of this stretch is under construction since December, 2021, yet NHAI was collecting toll at Lakhanpur, Thandi Khui and Ban plazas despite the rules saying that collection of fee should commence within 45 days from the date of completion of the section.While passing the order, the court said, ""This is based on the principle that tolls are collected to provide users with the benefit of well maintained infrastructure. If this highway is in a deteriorated condition and uncomfortable to drive on, it is considered unfair for commuters to continue paying tolls, rather the same is violation of fair service. Certainly, the commuters and drivers must be feeling frustrated by the poor state of this particular highway they are paying to use. The basic premise is that tolls should be a form of compensation for road users in exchange for smooth, safe, and well-maintained highways.""The court took note of the NHAI submission that due to different nature of construction works being carried out at this highway, service roads and diversions have been provided for the movement of traffic; meaning thereby the 4-lane NH at most of the places has been reduced to single lane.","J&K and Ladakh high court said that if a highway is in bad shape ""due to different nature of construction activities"", NHAI or its concessionaire cannot collect toll tax from commuters.HC also directed NHAi not to establish any plaza within 60 km of NH-44 and instructed removal of such structures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118587124,imgsize-869069,width-400,resizemode-4/118587124.jpg"

Moreover, if police invoked Sections 196 and 197 of BNS, police were mandated to have issued notice to the parents to first seek explanation from them on the allegations.""Police said that when the match was on, a passerby, Sandip Varadkar, heard the boy's slogans, which police said were ""vulgar in nature"".

Probe by CID into Badlapur encounter to continue: Judge

MUMBAI: In partial relief to five policemen indicted for the custodial death of an accused in the Badlapur school sexual assault case , a sessions court has ""kept in abeyance"" findings of a magisterial inquiry questioning legitimacy of the alleged encounter.Thane additional sessions judge D R Deshpande agreed that the magistrate's findings appear to be ""in excess of jurisdiction"" and that if they take effect it may render any revision application filed by indicted cops ""a futile exercise"". He asked the govt to keep the report, particularly paragraphs 81 and 82, in abeyance till the next hearing.Para 81 questioned whether use of force was justified and emphasized that the policemen were in a position where they could have better handled the situation, while para 82 said there were grounds of suspicion regarding their action if forensic reports were considered.The judge has directed that the probe by the crime investigation department (CID) into the custodial death should continue as it was being done independent of the report. The five indicted cops include a senior inspector, an assistant inspector, a head constable and two constables.Akshay Shinde, who was arrested in Aug 2024 for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor girls in the toilet of a school, was shot dead in a police van on Sept 23 while being taken from Taloja jail to Navi Mumbai for questioning. He was an attendant at the school.Police claimed he snatched a gun, opened fire, and was killed in retaliatory firing. The magistrate had raised doubts on the policemen’s claims of opening fire in selfdefence. His report said there was substance in the allegation by the dead man’s parents that it was a fake encounter.The indicted cops filed a revision application before sessions court, questioning the findings. They argued that the magistrate’s role was limited to determining cause of death and an inquiry transcending this purview to assess evidence and record findings was erroneous under Section 196 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. They urged the court to quash and set aside the “unwarranted findings”, saying the magistrate “overstepped his jurisdiction” by indicting them.A lawyer for one of the cops sought that the effect and operation of the findings be stayed to prevent prejudice to him.Special public prosecutor Ajay Misar submitted that the CID was probing the matter independent of the report. Taking the sessions court through the magistrate’s report, he said the “sort of confusion created due to inconsistency occurring in scientific evidence vis-a-vis the indisputable facts” necessitate “assistance of further scientific tools and tests”.The court said it would keep the findings in abeyance till the next hearing, but the CID probe should continue. The order noted a policeman’s apprehension that the findings may impede his legal rights and said addressing the apprehension was “needful”. The court said the accused's family must also be given an opportunity to be heard or oppose the revision application. Findings which “appear” to be “in excess of jurisdiction” have to be kept in abeyance until the family is heard, the judge said.It then directed the policemen to implead the accused’s parents as respondents and issued notice to them. The court posted the matter for further hearing on March 5.","Akshay Shinde, who was arrested in Aug 2024 for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor girls in the toilet of a school, was shot dead in a police van on Sept 23 while being taken from Taloja jail to Navi Mumbai for questioning.

PUNE: The first cases of avian influenza virus (H5N1) in domestic cats in India were reported from Chhindwara district in Madhya Pradesh, raising concerns about the bird flu pathogen mutating and infecting humans.""H5N1 is classically an avian virus, but certain mutations allow it to replicate in mammalian hosts. This adaptability raises concerns because influenza viruses have the potential to trigger pandemics, as seen in past outbreaks like Covid-19,"" a scientist said. Scientists from ICAR-NIHSAD and Union govt's animal husbandry department have documented the cases this Jan in Chhindwara, which borders Nagpur - where several big cats died of bird flu in Dec last year.The scientific team identified the virus as belonging to the 2.3.2.1a lineage, a variant of H5N1 that has caused outbreaks in poultry across India. ""These cases represent the first documented instances of this particular strain infecting domestic cats in India,"" the study says.It found that all infected cats exhibited symptoms such as high fever, loss of appetite, and lethargy before succumbing to the illness within one to three days after sample collection. The study identified 27 mutations in the virus found in cats. Scientists called for enhanced surveillance in domestic poultry, wild birds, and mammals, including pets and humans, given the virus's ability to jump between species.""Although human infections have been rare, we must anticipate the virus adapting to efficient transmission to and between humans. Human-to-human transmission is still not efficient, but ongoing changes in the virus signal to us to stay vigilant and prepared even for a pandemic,"" virologist Jacob John said. On the virus's potential to cause a global outbreak, John cautioned: ""H5N1 is new for humans. We do not have immunity against it. If human-to-human transmission becomes efficient, as an extension of the present pattern of mammalian transmission, it is going to be a concern.""","H5N1 is classically an avian virus, but certain mutations allow it to replicate in mammalian hosts.

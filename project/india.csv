Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should there be stricter laws for preventing domestic violence and murder? Yes, definitely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

Sonam Raghuwanshi News: Sonam agreed to marry fearing her refusal would kill her father; plotted to eliminate Raja just 5 days after wedding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sonam-agreed-to-marry-fearing-her-refusal-would-kill-her-father/articleshow/121762207.cms,"Poll Should the legal system consider mental and emotional coercion in marriage cases? Yes, it should be considered No, it complicates cases too much

LUCKNOW: Accused of plotting to murder her husband during their honeymoon, Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.This facet came to light during interrogation of Lalitpur native Akash Rajput, who said Sonam feared her father would die of heart attack if she did not marry as per his wish.According to Rajput's statement, Sonam's father Devi Singh suffers from a serious heart condition, and she was reportedly convinced that her refusal to marry Raja would trigger a fatal heart attack.Despite her personal reluctance and reported feelings for another man, Sonam got married just to fulfil her father's wish and, to safeguard his health thereby.Investigators believe that soon after Sonam married Raja, her lover Raj Kushwaha got agitated by the union and police allege this resentment was at the root of the plot to eliminate Raja just five days after the wedding.Police said Rajput revealed the murder plan was hatched and discussed in a café located next to Sonam's residence near Nandbagh colony in Indore.This proximity raises further questions about the extent of Sonam's knowledge, if any, regarding the plan, although current police statements point at her coerced marriage as primary motive for her actions leading to the murder.Police are now working on corroborating Akash Rajput's testimony and are interrogating Raj Kushwaha, believed to be the central figure in the murder case.","Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.

GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Friday issued a shoot-at-sight order in the India-Bangladesh border town of Dhubri after dusk to rein in what CM Himanta Biswa Sarma described as ""a communal group"" fomenting trouble over the past week.The immediate trigger for the directive to enforcement agencies, including Rapid Action Force and CRPF reinforcements, was a purported poster campaign by the group for ""Dhubri's integration with Bangladesh"".The town has been on the edge for several days following mob violence over offal being found near a place of worship.CM, who was in Dhubri district to take stock, said police found at least three provocative posters put up by a group identified as Nabin Bangla at different locations there.""Since the last one week, maintaining law and order in Dhubri has been challenging.

The next day, offal was allegedly dumped at another location, leading to stone-pelting at night, Sarma said.CM said a large herd of cattle illegally brought to Dhubri from Bengal by a ""new beef mafia"" was another reason for the disturbances. ""I have ordered an inquiry into this. I have directed the authorities to arrest whoever has started this cattle trade.""Sarma declared that he would camp in Dhubri for two days on Eid next year to ensure something like this didn't recur. ""We are fully committed to ensure enforcement of law and order in the district and defeat all communal forces,"" he said.CM alleged last week that beef had been ""weaponised"" in the state.Dhubri has the highest Muslim population among all districts of Assam, constituting 90% of the demography.

Trump-Musk feud continues? White House orders review of SpaceX contracts after fallout: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-musk-feud-continues-white-house-orders-review-of-spacex-contracts-after-fallout-report/articleshow/121841289.cms,"Elon Musk with Donald Trump in Oval office (File photo)

The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions following President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk , according to four sources familiar with the directive who spoke to Reuters.The administration instructed these agencies to examine Musk's contracts to prepare potential actions against the entrepreneur and his enterprises, these sources indicated. Pentagon officials are also evaluating whether to limit SpaceX's involvement in a new American missile defence initiative, as Reuters reported on Thursday.While the ultimate intention regarding SpaceX's current federal contracts worth approximately $22 billion remains unclear, the assessment will mark the administration's follow-through on Trump's June 6 statement to journalists aboard Air Force One, where he mentioned possible termination of business and subsidies for Musk's ventures, stating ""We'll take a look at everything.""A White House spokesperson, responding via email to Reuters, avoided specific questions about Musk's operations, stating the ""Trump administration is committed to a rigorous review process for all bids and contracts."" Nasa's spokesperson separately indicated the agency would maintain collaboration with industry partners to achieve presidential space objectives.Sources familiar with the directive indicated the contract review aims to enable swift administrative action should Trump decide to move against Musk, who previously served as a senior presidential adviser and led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).One source characterised the review as ""for political ammunition.""The feasibility of legally cancelling existing contracts remains uncertain. However, the situation highlights governance experts' worries about political and personal influences potentially affecting government spending, national security and public interest matters.Another Reuters report on Friday cited three people familiar with the project, claiming that the feud called into question the role of Musk's SpaceX in the new US missile defense system. Until recently, the White House considered a plan for SpaceX, Musk's rocket and satellite venture, to partner with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril to construct crucial elements of the project, dubbed ""Golden Dome. "" These people said the administration instructed the Pentagon to prioritize a network of satellites for the purpose.A new framework aimed at tracking and preventing potential missile attacks against the United States is currently under consideration, which could reduce SpaceX's involvement. Three individuals stated that one option might initially forego SpaceX's satellite capabilities to focus on expanding existing ground-based missile defence systems instead.Scott Amey, a contracting specialist at Washington's Project on Government Oversight, noted the situation's paradox, where Musk's contracts face similar subjective political scrutiny that his DOGE team applied to numerous other contracts, emphasising that decisions should prioritise public and national security interests over personal disputes.SpaceX has become essential to American government aerospace and defence operations, managing satellite launches and potentially overseeing a crucial component of Trump's ""Golden Dome"" missile defence system.Despite Musk's recent attempts to moderate his presidential criticisms, including his (now-deleted posts) impeachment call and allegations linking Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his outbursts highlighted government dependence on SpaceX.Before his reversal, Musk suggested decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently America's sole means of transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station under a £5 billion Nasa contract.Additionally, SpaceX is developing a classified satellite network for the National Reconnaissance Office, strengthening its relationship with American defence and intelligence communities.The feud between Musk and Trump intensified after the Tesla owner criticised Trump’s key domestic bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump’s name appeared in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files—a post Musk subsequently deleted. In response, Trump called Musk “a big-time drug addict” and mocked his appearance during a recent Oval Office visit.However, the tensions seemed to ease when Musk expressed ""regret"" saying he went too far. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote Wednesday on the platform he owns. In response, the White House signalled a possible softening of tone. “The President acknowledged the statement that Elon put out this morning, and he is appreciative of it,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions. The move follows President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk.

Iran strikes back after Israel's Operation Rising Lion; Netanyahu warns 'more is on the way',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-strikes-back-after-israels-operation-rising-lion-netanyahu-warns-more-is-on-the-way-what-happened-overnight/articleshow/121840211.cms,"'Everyone will feel it': Iran



'More is on the way': Netanyahu



Iran calls it response to 'criminal aggression'



'The world cannot stay silent': IDF



'Second barrage of missiles from Iran': IDF confirms



'I think it's been excellent': Donald Trump







A tense escalation unfolded across the Middle East overnight, as Iran launched back to back, and overnight missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and early Saturday. The move came in response to what Iran described as Israel’s earlier attacks on its territory.The confrontation began with Israel’s ""greatest military operations in history,"" against Iran.In a sweeping and highly coordinated attack on Thursday night, Israeli warplanes and drones, some of them reportedly smuggled into Iranian territory in advance, struck deep inside the Islamic Republic.Key targets included parts of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, ballistic missile production sites, and command centers. The strike also killed top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv, following a warning from its military that ""everyone will feel it.""Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had cautioned that Israel ""should expect severe punishment"" in response to its sweeping attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials.""In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime's most significant enrichment facility, and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,"" declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a defiant video address. ""The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker.""Netanyahu also addressed the people of Iran directly: ""To the proud people of Iran, we are in the midst of one of the greatest military operations in history, Operation Rising Lion. The Islamic regime, which has oppressed you for almost 50 years, threatens to destroy our country, the State of Israel. More is on the way.""That promise of escalation was swiftly realised — by both sides.Late Friday night, Iran responded with a salvo of ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli territory. Explosions thundered over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as sirens blared and the Israeli military urged residents to take cover.Buildings shook under the pressure of near-simultaneous detonations, with several of them likely the result of Israel’s air defence systems intercepting incoming threats.In a pointed statement, Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the retaliatory attacks.""Using a combination of precision-guided and smart systems,"" the IRGC said, ""Iran targeted military centers and airbases that served as the source of the criminal aggression against our country.""The IRGC added that its missiles struck Israeli military-industrial centers that produce missiles and other war equipment, stating that ""field reports, satellite imagery, and intercepted intelligence indicate that dozens of ballistic missiles effectively hit strategic targets.""""Despite claims of interception, the enemy failed to counter the waves of missile strikes launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" the statement continued.But Israel maintained it had successfully intercepted a significant portion of the threat.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) released footage of a Navy missile ship intercepting five Iranian drones over Israeli waters early Saturday. ""Attached is documentation of the interception of two drones launched earlier today from Iran,"" the IDF posted on social media platform X.The IDF also published a map highlighting areas across Israel currently under threat from Iranian attacks, warning, ""Israeli civilians are currently being targeted by the Iranian regime. The world cannot stay silent.""Inside a fortified command center, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant conducted ongoing situation assessments. According to an Israeli official who spoke with CNN, the leadership is ""fully engaged in real-time military coordination and strategic planning.""The attacks did not cease after Netanyahu's fiery speech. Minutes after his video was posted, more Iranian missiles were launched, with renewed explosions reported in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The tension inside Israel remained palpable as citizens were urged to stay inside shelters.Also read: Iran-Israel war: Iran airspace shut, international flights from India to take longer Israel also confirmed Iran's continued strikes and second barrage of missiles from Khamenei-led country.A senior Iranian official, speaking to CNN, warned that Iran is prepared to escalate even further: “Iran will intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that tries to defend it.”Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran while reaffirming support for Israel. ""Of course we support Israel in its actions,"" Trump told CNN. ""Iran better agree to a nuclear deal before there is nothing left.""“I think it’s been excellent,” Trump told ABC News about the Israeli strikes. “We gave Iran a chance, and they didn’t take it. They got hit—hard. As hard as you can get hit. And there’s more coming. A lot more.”Trump wrote on his Truth Social: ""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance! ""As the skies over the Middle East lit up with missile trails and fireballs, the world watched anxiously, hoping the night’s violence would not spiral into a broader regional war. But with both sides promising more to come, a return to calm appears distant.","Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv, following a warning from its military that ""everyone will feel it"" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had cautioned that Israel ""should expect severe punishment"" in response to its attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121840271,imgsize-823664,width-400,resizemode-4/121840271.jpg"

Brittany Mahomes: The Truth About Pregnancy, Staying Active, And Being An NFL Wife

Chiefs Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes Trent McDuffie & Xavier Worthy Press Conference | JANUARY 14, 2025





Patrick Mahomes may have fallen just short of a historic Super Bowl three-peat at the end of the 2024 NFL season, but his life off the field has never looked brighter. As 2025 kicks into high gear, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is thriving in both his personal and professional life, celebrating the arrival of his third child and preparing for yet another demanding NFL season.The Mahomes family welcomed a new member on January 12—a baby girl named Golden Raye. She joins her siblings Sterling Sky, born in February 2021, and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, born in November 2022. With the addition of Golden, the Mahomes household has grown to five, and the couple seems perfectly content with that number.Brittany Mahomes, Patrick’s wife and longtime partner since their high school days, shared her thoughts on growing their family during a candid chat on the WHOOP Podcast. “Nope. We're done, we're done for a while. Three,” she said with a smile. “I don't know, I mean I feel like you can never like say you're done, but I think three is all I need.”Patrick Mahomes echoed his wife’s words in a press conference shortly after Golden’s birth. “I'm good with three for right now,” he stated. “We'll see down the line, maybe. But my goal was always three. So, we've had three. And we'll stick there for a while and see if we need to come back and get another one later on.”The couple, who began dating in 2012 and married in a stunning Hawaiian ceremony in 2022, have navigated life’s biggest transitions together—from college sweethearts to NFL fame, and now parenthood. Their bond remains strong as they juggle high-profile careers and family responsibilities.As a three-time Super Bowl champion, Mahomes isn’t taking his foot off the gas. He’s already back in action, attending OTAs with the Chiefs ahead of his ninth season. The team is gearing up for a global showcase, with their season opener set in Brazil against the Los Angeles Chargers—marking an international milestone for both the franchise and the league.Away from the stadium lights, Mahomes also opened up about the support he receives from Brittany, especially in terms of inspiration. “I admire my wife Brittany's confidence,” he told People. “Whether it's in business, or supporting our family, she always leads with strength and purpose. That kind of confidence is powerful; it pushes me to be better every day.”With family fulfillment and football focus going hand-in-hand, Mahomes seems more driven than ever. Whether it’s leading the Chiefs into another title run or being a present father at home, his commitment to excellence remains unwavering.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce preparing for a graceful NFL exit? 5 veterans who might retire after the 2025 season","Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany welcomed a baby girl on January 12.

NFL star Josh Allen is basking in post-wedding bliss after marrying actress Hailee Steinfeld , but not everyone is celebrating. While speaking to reporters following the Buffalo Bills’ minicamp this week, Allen finally broke his silence on his intimate Southern California wedding with the Pitch Perfect star, calling it the best decision of his life. Yet, as heartfelt as his words were, the internet had other plans—drawing comparisons to his ex-girlfriend Brittany Williams and even referencing Travis Kelce’s own high-profile romance.Speaking to the press on June 10, Josh Allen glowed as he shared: “None other than marrying my best friend. She makes everything easier. I don’t really focus on the other stuff; that was the most important decision I’ll make in my life, and I made the right one.”The couple tied the knot at the end of May, with Steinfeld recently posting a photo from the wedding to her Instagram newsletter page Beau Society, captioned, “We’re married! More to come…” She stunned in a classic gown with sheer opera gloves and a sleek bun, while Allen opted for understated elegance.While many fans congratulated the couple and admired their wedding glow, others brought drama to the celebration. Social media erupted with comments questioning Allen’s public praise of Hailee, especially in contrast to his past with Brittany Williams. One user asked, “So Brittany didn't make it easier since you was with her for 8 years and Hailee is living in the house SHE helped build?”Others were more blunt—“This is the only ring he will ever receive,” one fan wrote, clearly throwing shade at Allen’s postseason record.Another predicted doom: “They will be divorced in less than 5 years.”Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld gives first clear look at massive engagement ring after secretive romance with Josh Allen With NFL stars increasingly becoming tabloid staples—thanks in part to Travis Kelce’s whirlwind romance with Taylor Swift—fans have started pitting these celebrity-athlete relationships against each other.

Wayne Gretzky’s fortune and assets are shaping Paulina’s multi-million dollar legacy

The Steinway powerboat is more than just a toy—it’s a Gretzky family heirloom in the making





As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario.

Ros Gold-Onwude on how Kevin Durant is fitting in with the Warriors | THE HERD (FULL INTERVIEW)

Kevin Durant was speculated to be dating former adult actress Lana Rhoades in 2021





Kevin Durant is single and dedicated to his game. It is what is evident from several interviews where he was prodded about his personal life. Durant is among those who want to keep their personal lives fairly private and want people to focus only on his game. However, his personal life was not always under wraps. Durant made it to the gossip columns when he got engaged to the player Monica Wright in 2013.However, the engagement did not culminate in marriage, and the couple parted ways in 2014, almost a year later. Several rumors have swirled after that about the women Durant has dated; however, he has remained tight-lipped on the matter and didn’t add fuel to those.Recapping the media reports that talked about Durant’s dating history, here are the rumored relationships that the Phoenix Suns star had in his life.Kevin Durant’s personal life is almost incomplete without the mention of Monica Wright, a friend from his high school days who became his fiancée later. Monica Wright was also a player, just like Kevin, and both met at the 2006 McDonald’s All-American Game, where they were standout players from their respective teams.How Durant and Wright’s relationship bloomed is not known in public circles, but they grabbed headlines when they broke the news of their engagement.ESPN reported in 2013 that the Minnesota Lynx star shared the news with fans after a win over the Phoenix Mercury in a Sunday game.However, the engagement remained short-lived. The duo separated ways in 2014 after calling off the engagement. Later, Kevin commented about the relationship during an interview with GQ in 2015:“I had a fiancée, but… I really didn’t know how to, like, love her, you know what I’m saying? We just went our separate ways.”Wright cited the ‘differences of values’ as the reason for the break-up.After that, no stable relationship happened in Durant’s life. However, his personal life has always been under the scanner and drew fans’ attention whenever he was spotted with a woman on a public platform.The Sun reported in 2021 that after the breakup with Monica Wright, Kevin Durant dated Jasmine Shine, a model.Both kept their relationship extremely private; however, they were spotted at various NBA events together, fueling the rumors around their relationship.In 2021’s report, The Sun further mentioned that Kevin put an end to the relationship in 2016 to focus on the play-offs. He reportedly asked her to leave the house as the playoffs approached, marking the end of the relationship.A sports gossip reporter claimed Rosalyn Gold-Onwude to be the new woman in the Phoenix superstar’s life in 2017. Inquisitr, a publication, picked up the news from the gossip site and went on to declare them a new couple in the town.Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, however, firmly denied the speculations and said:“This year, there was a rumor I'm dating Kevin Durant. I'm not. I would not date any player on our team. It's better professionally… to not do that.”Both parties did not say anything on the matter, rubbishing the speculations as merely rumors.From 2018 to 2020, Durant was linked with Cassandra Anderson, a real estate agent; Crystal Renee, actress/singer; and Apryl Jones, reality TV star. The NBA star kept mum on his personal life and didn’t confirm any of the rumored relationships.The murmurs around the private life of Kevin Durant again spread in 2021. This time, a former adult actress, Lana Rhoades, reportedly said that an NBA star took her out for a date. Though she didn’t drop the name, the NBA player was highly speculated to be Durant.The actress, reportedly, dropped further hints by saying that the NBA star was a Libra. Coincidentally, Durant was the only Libra in the Brooklyn Nets roster at that time. However, no official announcements from either party were made, leaving the claims to be mere speculations.After 2021, the sports gossip reporters linked Durant to Brittney Elena, too. However, the rumors surrounding this duo were verified as ‘100% false’ by BlackSports Online.Also Read: “How you think I got so great?” - Kevin Durant torches trolls in blistering online showdown over his legacy Kevin Durant is single and is quite a mysterious man when it comes to his personal life.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Breaking: Diamondbacks pitcher Justin Martinez out for the rest of 2025 MLB season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/breaking-diamondbacks-pitcher-justin-martinez-out-for-the-rest-of-2025-mlb-season/articleshow/121838008.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Justin Martinez's injury timeline and impact on the Diamondbacks' bullpen

What Justin Martinez's long-term absence means for Arizona’s 2025 outlook





Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Justin Martinez has been ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season with a sprained right ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his throwing elbow. Manager Torey Lovullo announced on MLB Network Radio that the injury is serious and that Martinez is likely to be out for a full 12 to 13 months.The UCL sprain was originally discovered after he felt tightness in his elbow while pitching the ninth inning on June 9; he immediately called for the training staff and received an MRI the following day. Not every UCL sprain needs Tommy John surgery, but the 12- to 13-month timetable for recovery is an obvious red flag. The club will assess the state of the ligament and decide the best course of action from there, though, as Martinez will be getting a second medical opinion.The void leaves an already maimed Arizona bullpen with another hole to patch up. Closer Kendall Graveman was placed on the 15-day IL with a hip impingement, and fellow reliever A.J. Puk had started the season on the 60-day IL with a flexor strain. As injury-plagued starters, Corbin Burnes and Jordan Montgomery both ended up needing Tommy John surgeries. In their place, Arizona has brought up Kevin Ginkel and Bryce Jarvis from Triple-A Reno and added right-hander Tayler Scott to the 40-man roster.Optioned RHP Jeff Brigham to Reno; transferred RHP Cristian Mena to 60-day ILAlthough this was a disappointing roadblock, it could be a blessing in disguise. Martinez's deal comes with a club option for 2032, worth only $3 million, which is usually automatically picked up if a player would need surgery or would remain on the injured list for a certain amount of time. That would give the Diamondbacks some breathing room financially if he has to go under the knife.Also Read: Justin Martinez secures five year 18 million contract with Diamondbacks Martinez had an impressive season last year from a performance standpoint, providing 72⅔ innings of 2.48 ERA ball, with nearly a 30 percent strikeout rate and a 58.9 percent groundball rate. His extension was a show of faith from the team that his long-term upside would pay off. The absence of Martinez will stretch the bullpen depth for Arizona, but the club hopes he leads a full recovery and returns to being one of the most important late-inning weapons for 2026.",Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Justin Martinez has been ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season with a sprained right ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his throwing elbow.

As Indiana Pacers chase a historic NBA title and Indiana Fever rise, Caitlin Clark and Tyrese Haliburton embrace Indiana’s passion, pride, and future.







The state of Indiana is buzzing with basketball energy—and two of its brightest stars are proudly carrying the torch. With the Indiana Pacers holding a 2-1 lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals, and Caitlin Clark emerging as the face of the Indiana Fever, the basketball world is watching the Hoosier State with new intensity. Both Clark and Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton have become emblematic of a new era in Indiana hoops—one defined by loyalty, pride, and mutual admiration.Even while recovering from a quad injury, Caitlin Clark has been a familiar face courtside at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, showing unwavering support for the Pacers. She’s not just cheering—she’s a bit of a good luck charm. The Pacers are 8-0 when Clark is in attendance, a streak that dates back to last year’s playoffs.Speaking to “ESPN” earlier this week, Clark opened up about her connection with Tyrese Haliburton and their shared desire to stay in Indiana for the long haul. “Ty and I would both tell you this is where we both hope to stay the rest of our careers,” she said. “People are like, ‘It’s a small market.’ But no, that’s what makes it fun. These people, this is what means the world to them.”She went on to describe the electric atmosphere in Indianapolis as the Pacers return to the NBA Finals stage for the first time in 25 years.“We haven’t hosted a Finals game in 25 years, and I’ve never seen this type of excitement. People are lining up three hours before the game. I literally just got the chills thinking about it,” Clark added.Clark made these comments during an interview with “ESPN” earlier this week, referring to both her and Haliburton’s hopes for the future in Indiana.The synergy between the two franchises is clear, with Clark noting how the city’s passion extends to both teams. “And they’re the same for the Fever,” she said. “I think it’s just like [Pacers coach] Rick [Carlisle] said, ‘In 49 other states it’s basketball, but here it’s just really different.’ I’m really fortunate to be able to play here, and he’s the same.”Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton and Caitlin Clark's friendship is winning hearts during the NBA finals As Clark returns to practice after a two-week absence, the Fever sit at 4-5 in the standings, holding third place in the Eastern Conference.

Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia who recently mocked the Indian economy, mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"". In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, Bhatia asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive at the time of grieving.""Do you really think the 4th largest economy in the world should still be having plane crashes due to systemic failures? Time to question what truly makes a nation great,"" Bhatia posted.Social media users reminded him that there have been 55 deadly plane crashes in the US in 2025 alone to which Bhatia retorted that US has a greater number of flights as well.""Sabeer wants the attention he has lost. He wants to remind the world that he still exists,"" one wrote. ""Vulture spotted,"" another wrote. Interestingly, Bhatia engaged with all comments and even ran a poll on whether he should take an Air India flight or not.""Of course I’m deeply saddened and devastated by the loss of life. But that distracts from the real question: Why did it happen and what can we do as a society to prevent it from ever happening again?"" he wrote.""In all the angry replies I’m getting, people are responding as if their own families were on the plane. Telling me to put my phone down. So much hate, so much emotion. Where’s the logic? Do you really go through life like it’s a Bollywood movie?"" Bhatia wrote.""The right words aren’t “devastated” or “pained by the tragic loss” — those center the speaker. Say instead: “The families of the victims are in our thoughts and prayers.” It’s about them, not you,"" he added.""In the past few days of vitriolic backlash, I keep hearing the term “colonial mindset” — as if the West looks down on India. That’s simply untrue. What shocks people in the West isn’t India — it’s the poor decisions of its leaders. If anything, that is the real colonial hangover,"" he said.","Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"" In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, he asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121834649,imgsize-36708,width-400,resizemode-4/121834649.jpg"

The journey from fear to quiet appreciation

How to make a Father’s Day card



Things to write on the Father’s Day card



When it comes to family, especially where it is just a mother, child, and father, a father remains an underrated parent. He is the one who silently provides for the family, takes care of needs and wants, and much more.And in all honesty, Father’s Day should be more than just a date on the calendar. The day should be one of celebration, honouring the silent fathers and father figures in your life, and cherishing the support they bring to you.And in 2025, Father’s Day will be celebrated on Sunday, June 15.In many cases, fathers are the backbone of the family. While the mothers hold the fort within the home, managing one thing after the other, the fathers work tirelessly outside the home to ensure the family is provided for and protected. They show up every day, are responsible for many different tasks, offer quiet advice and support, and much more.But when it comes to closeness, many would agree that children always remain closer to their mother, as compared to their father. Many fathers don't even hear ‘thank you’ as often as they deserve. And yes, they are not the most expressive of people, but that does not mean they don’t feel deeply. Which is why Father’s Day is the perfect chance to offer them the appreciation and love they deserve.As children, many of us grow up seeing our fathers as strong and authoritative figures, and they are the ones children are most afraid of. One statement by the mom ‘Let your father come home, I will tell him what you did’ was enough to send shivers down our spine. And as most childhood is usually spent in fear, with time, that fear transforms into deep respect and love. We begin to notice the wrinkles on his forehead, the greys in his hair, and the way he silently makes sure everything is okay. The love that was once felt, hidden beneath strict rules or reserved smiles, begins to reveal itself in full. That’s when we realise just how much our fathers have done for us, even if they never said it aloud.And as we mature, we realise just how much our father missed out on, especially when it came to love.And so, this Father’s Day, surprise him with something beautiful and heartfelt, be it as simple as a card or a big gift.You don’t need expensive products to make a beautiful card for your dad. Sometimes, the simplest DIY card carries the most meaning.Just buy basic materials from the stationery store, like some thick chart paper in whichever colour your dad likes most, some sketch pens and markers, some glitter highlighters, some unique stickers, and the like.And from the printing shop close to home, print a photo of you and your dad, one of the most precious memories, and this will be the highlight of the card.Once everything is set, fold the chart paper in half to start making the card. Decorate the front page with a drawing, quote, or simple design like a tie, or a moustache, and make it extra glittery for some bling.Then on the other side, paste a picture of you and your dad, and below the picture write something meaningful and wholesome. And while this message should come from your heart, if you feel you are at a loss for words and ideas, here are some suggestions.Dear dad, I know you do not talk too much, but your actions have always spoken louder. Thank you for being my rock and support all this time. With love, (your name).Papa, you have taught me more about life than any TV show or a social media video could. And honestly, I will never know how you did it. Thank you for everything.Without you, I would not have been the strong kid I am, the kind daughter I am, and the honest human everybody praises me for. Thank you for showing me all these qualities early in life.From helping me walk when I was a little girl, to helping with my last minute scholarship approvals as I grew up, thank you for everything you did and continue to do for me. With love, your little one.Dear pops, you have always made sure I had everything I needed, and even more. Be it the last minute charts for my SST class or the one missing stone from my bracelet. And I can never thank you enough for it all.Dear papa, this is just a small, small appreciation for all the big, big things you did. A father, a superhero, a teacher, a guide, how many hats will you don?Dad, the older I get, the more I understand why you said ‘even 20 rupees matter’ or told me ‘when you will get older you will understand’. These lessons will stay with me forever. Thank you for everything.Dear dad, from the silent hugs you gave me, to the extra pocket money I found in my wallet, I always knew you were behind it all. Thank you for being so wholesome and precious.Dear papa, I saw you and Dada ji be the quiet strength of the family, be it conflicts or illness, and I hope and wish that someday I will be half as good as you two. Thank you for everything.Papa, I always saw how you put us first, over your own choices, and the world’s, and mere words will never be able to make up for it. But just know, I love you with all my heart and will continue to.Dear dad, this Father’s Day, I just wanna tell you that even when you didn’t say it, I knew you were proud. And that meant everything to me. Thank you.To my dear, dear papa, Happy Father’s Day. You are the man who raised me right, with ethos, love, and everything bright. Thank you.","Father’s Day should be more than just a date on the calendar. The day should be one of celebration, honouring the silent fathers and father figures in your life.

There are many bonds in life that are worth celebrating for the emotions and value they hold for us. They make life a more memorable experience and give us moments that are cherished forever. One such relationship is that between a father and his child. While moms are expressive with their emotions and more open to communicating their feelings, dads are the silent pillars of strength and love who might not share how much they love you, but their love is always evident in their actions.While one should celebrate the special relations in one's life every day, a day dedicated to a forever bond like a father-child relationship must be honoured. Thus, this year make sure to celebrate Father's Day in a memorable way.In 2025, Father's Day is being celebrated on June 15th, the third Sunday of June.The first-ever day honouring fathers was celebrated on July 5, 1908, when a West Virginia church hosted a Sunday sermon in memory of the 362 men who had died in the previous December's explosions at the Fairmont Coal Company mines in Monongah. However, this was a one-time commemoration and not an annual holiday.In 1909, Sonora Smart Dodd, a woman from Spokane, Washington, one of the six children raised by a widower made the first initiative to establish an official day that was the male equivalent of a Mother's Day. She approached the local churches, YMCA, shopkeepers and government officials with the idea and was successful enough that on June 19, 1910, Washington State celebrated the nation's first statewide Father's Day.Slowly, the holiday spread wide enough that in 1916 President Wilson honoured the day by using telegraph signals to unfurl the flag in Spokane by pressing a button in Washington, D.C.In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge urged the state governments to celebrate Father's Day. Thus, in 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson issued a proclamation announcing the third Sunday of June as the day to honour fathers and in 1972 President Richard Nixon signed the law to federally recognise Father's Day. Over the years, Father's Day is celebrated in the United States on the third Sunday of June, which is on June 19, 2025, this year.Today, Father's Day is recognized in over 110 countries and is celebrated on the third Sunday of June in many. The day not only honours the paternal figures in everyone's lives but also helps in strengthening those bonds. People go on a father-daughter date, plan a picnic and make elaborate gifts for their father figures.In order to honour and celebrate Father's Day, fathers and children plan a variety of stuff.In terms of gifts, children present their fathers with ties, wallets, latest gadgets, books, personalized cards and more.Some plan quality time with family dinners, outdoor trips, sports competitions and even celebrations with dedicated cakes.Another very cute and emotional act of service is that children do the chores their fathers usually perform, like mowing the lawn, repairing broken things or even getting the groceries.Many father-child pairs even partake in community activities like marathons, cooking contests, church services and more.Below are some FAQs people generally ask about Father's Day.In 2025, Father's Day will be celebrated on the third Sunday of June i.e. June 15th.Father's Day is not a federal holiday in the US but is celebrated across the nation.No, all countries don't celebrate Father's Day on the same day.

Which is the best time to measure Blood Pressure and why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/which-is-the-best-time-to-measure-blood-pressure-and-why/articleshow/121790876.cms,"Why the timing matters



What is the best time



In the morning: 30 minutes after waking up



In the evening: before going to bed



Why not take BP immediately after waking up



How often should you take your reading



Keep these in mind



Relax first:

The proper posture:

Why Consistency is Key

Take note



Both High blood Pressure (Hypertension) and Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension) can be worrying, though the latter can be fixed with better diet and is (usually) not a matter of much concern, unless it is causes visible symptoms such as dizziness, weakness etc. On the other hand, those with Hypertension have to stay extra vigilant, and monitor their BP on a regular basis, to prevent issues such as heart attack and stroke. However, when it comes to monitoring your BP, what is the right time to do so? We'll take a look...Blood pressure naturally fluctuates all through the day due to factors such as exercise, stress, food intake, water intake (dehydration can affect BP), and even body position (lying down, slouching, sitting up) Because of these variations, measuring BP at random times can give inconsistent results. For near optimum results, it is important to measure your blood pressure at consistent times and under similar conditions each day. It is also important to make a note of those readings for future reference and medication.Experts suggest that the best time to take your first blood pressure reading is about 30 minutes after you wake up, but before eating or drinking anything, especially caffeine. (water is okay) This is because immediately after waking up, your body is still adjusting from sleep, and blood pressure readings may not be stable or accurate.Also, food and caffeine can temporarily raise blood pressure, so measuring before these helps avoid false readings.If you are tracking your BP as per the doctor's recommendation, then taking a second reading before going to bed is also helpful. (2 hours after meals) This helps track how your blood pressure changes throughout the day and gives a fuller picture of your cardiovascular health.Right after waking up, your body is still not fully active, and is getting adjusted to waking up gradually. Blood pressure can be irregular during this time, influenced by the body's ""fight or flight"" response and other physiological changes. Measuring too early can give a falsely high or low reading, that can worry you.For people monitoring their blood pressure at home, it is advisable to take readings at least twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening. Taking multiple readings on different days helps identify patterns and ensures accuracy. If you take two readings at a time, wait about 3 minutes between them and record both. If the readings differ significantly, take a third reading, and then calculate an average. Make sure you use the same machine, and the same posture for the reading everyday, as different machines might give different results.Sit quietly for at least 5 minutes before taking your blood pressure. Avoid talking or moving during measurement.Sit in a chair with your back supported, feet flat on the floor, and your arm supported at heart level on a table or ledge. Do not take your BP while lying down/slouching on the bed/sofa.A cuff that is too small or too large can give inaccurate readings. The cuff should fit snugly on your bare upper arm, about 2-3 cm above the elbow crease.Do not smoke, exercise, consume alcohol, eat food, or drink caffeine for at least 30 minutes before measuring your blood pressure.A full bladder can raise blood pressure, so it’s best to measure after using the restroom.Taking two or three readings per session and averaging them gives a more accurate assessment.Crossing legs can raise blood pressure readings by several points, so keep your feet flat on the floor.Measuring your blood pressure at the same time each day under similar conditions helps track true changes rather than fluctuations caused by external factors. This consistency is important to track your BP and help your doctor gauge the further line of treatment.If you measure blood pressure right after exercise, smoking, or caffeine intake, your reading might be artificially high. Similarly, stress, talking during measurement, or improper posture can also skew results. These inaccuracies can lead to unnecessary worry or missed diagnosis of hypertension. Hypertension should not be ignored. It can be warning signs of many cardiovascular diseases.","Experts suggest that the best time to take your first blood pressure reading is about 30 minutes after you wake up.

Why one should keep a bucket of water while sleeping in an Air Conditioned room,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/why-one-should-keep-a-bucket-of-water-while-sleeping-in-an-air-conditioned-room/articleshow/121779310.cms,"Air conditioners dry out the air



A natural humidifier



Better air quality and comfort

Better sleep



As the temperature soars and weather conditions worsen, air conditioners have become a necessity. But while instant heat relief comes from these machines, they do have some health implications of their own. One easy, age-old home remedy that can balance this out is having a bucket of water in your AC room. While it sounds strange at first, this little act can go a long way in bringing comfort and well-being into your life when the hot weather season arrives.Another reason to have a bucket of water in your AC room is to neutralize the drying effect of air conditioners. ACs operate by pulling out heat and humidity from the air. As much as this is great for cooling, it also results in the air within the room getting incredibly dry. This dryness can lead to dry skin, chapped lips, itchy eyes, and throat and nasal irritation that can be uncomfortable. Sinus sufferers and people who suffer from other respiratory diseases may experience added symptoms in air-conditioned areas.A water bucket is a natural humidifier. Because the water evaporates slowly into the air, it keeps a healthier level of humidity in the room, that is not detrimental. This added moisture will keep your skin hydrated, ease breathing, and also improve sleep.The natural evaporation is slow and calm, which makes it a quieter and safer choice than electric humidifiers.Low humidity isn't just bad news for your body—it can be bad news for your environment, too. Wood furniture can crack and split, and houseplants can start to wilt in overly dry conditions. Having a bucket of water in the room helps to balance and preserve a more comfortable indoor environment. Even static electricity, which gets more prevalent as air gets drier, can be lessened when humidity is regulated.Sleeping within an AC-cooled dry room at times irritates a dry throat or stuffiness, interrupting the sleep. By adding moisture to the room through a bucket of water, you create a more natural habitat that causes your body to sleep more smoothly. It's a cheap and non-invasive way of supporting your health without spending money on costly appliances.To get the best out of it, place the bucket of water in a window or room corner where there is good air circulation. Alternatively, you can add some drops of essential oil or some lemon peels floating on the water for a pleasant smell. Just remember to change the water daily to avoid stagnation or mosquito breeding.Employing a water bucket in an AC room sounds like something from the Stone Age, but it's a low-cost, easy, and amazing hack to maintain air moisture and quality. Especially during Indian summers that are as hot as the sun itself, the trick will help ensure dryness issues never develop, making your air-conditioned paradise healthier and easier to breathe. At times, the most effective solutions may be found in the most primitive ones, and this is an excellent example of how nature and city living might go hand in hand.(source:instagram@ Sameer bhatia official)","A water bucket is a natural humidifier.

Fatty Liver: 5 drinks that can cure fatty liver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-drinks-that-can-cure-fatty-liver/articleshow/121767044.cms,"Green tea

Lemon water

Beetroot juice

Black coffee

Apple cider vinegar

Imagine being able to sip your way to a healthier liver. One would be shocked to know that taking certain fluids that are available almost at every household can help in the reduction of fatty liver. Supported by science, some natural beverages—such as green tea, beetroot juice, and even black coffee show promising results in the reduction of liver fat and enhancing overall liver function. Let's take a closer look at five such beverages that may be healing your liver, sip by sip.Green tea is loaded with rich antioxidants, especially catechins, which help reduce liver inflammation and oxidative stress. The compounds present in green tea are known to improve liver function by enhancing fat metabolism and lowering stored fat in liver cells.If one consumes 2-3 cups daily, it may help decrease liver enzyme levels and support better weight management, both of which are crucial in managing fatty liver. It is most effective when consumed without sugar or milk, and is most beneficial when combined with a healthy diet for optimal results.Drinking lukewarm water with lemon in it daily helps cleanse the liver naturally. Lemons are rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, which boost the production of liver detoxifying enzymes like glutathione.Lemon water also aids in better digestion, stimulates bile production and supports toxin removal from the body. Regular intake of lemon water on an empty stomach can help reduce liver fat accumulation over time, especially when combined with a healthy diet and proper hydration.Beetroot juice is rich in betalains and betaine, both compounds with protective effects for the liver. These nutrients ensure the removal of toxins from the body, decrease oxidative damage, and facilitate liver cell regeneration. Consume beetroot juice 2–3 times weekly to enhance the levels of liver enzymes and decrease liver fat accumulation. Its high nitrate content also enhances blood circulation, making it an important constituent of a liver-friendly diet.Black coffee is the most researched coffee for liver health. It has chlorogenic acid and caffeine, which are both anti-inflammatory and inhibit fat accumulation in liver cells. 2–3 cups of coffee every day are associated with a reduced risk of liver fibrosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Black coffee consumption without adding sugar or cream increases its benefits and promotes long-term liver protection.Apple cider vinegar (ACV) contains acetic acid, which increases metabolism, aids digestion, and can potentially lower liver fat. Adding one tablespoon of ACV to a glass of water before meals can help break down fat and enhance insulin sensitivity. With time, this will reduce liver fat buildup.

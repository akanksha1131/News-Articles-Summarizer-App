With gender & urban-rural gaps still on, India clears literacy exam with 80.9%

Committed to give remaining S-400s to India by 2026, says Russia

Today's morning news wrap covers updates related to business, defence, education and international relations. US commerce secretary Lutnick expressed optimism about forthcoming US-India trade deal, citing the strong rapport between US President Trump and PM Modi as a key facilitator. Meanwhile, seismic activity rocked the region as a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck near the Greece-Turkey border. In Pakistan, controversy erupted as Punjab assembly speaker Malik Ahmed Khan defended LeT leader Saifullah Kasuri, linked to the Pahalgam attack, by attending a rally with him and Talha Saeed. Back in India, the latest PLFS data revealed an overall literacy rate of 80.9%, with Mizoram, Lakshadweep, and Kerala leading the charts. On the defence front, Russia reaffirmed its commitment to delivering the remaining S-400 units to India by 2026, ahead of a planned visit by Putin later this year.Speaking at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum in Washington, Lutnick noted that the strong and positive rapport between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi paves the way for smoother trade negotiations.""Earlier countries get a better deal. That's the way it is. So those who come in, you know, July 4th to July 9th, there's just going to be a pile. I think India is trying hard to be one of the earlier countries, which I appreciate. But these, these kind of deals used to take two or three years, and we're trying to get them done in a month, which is, you know, just not the ordinary DNA of trading relationships between countries. But what I hope to achieve is we would like market access, we would like our businesses to have reasonable access to the markets of India,"" he said.

When questioned by reporters, the speaker of the assembly of Pakistan’s largest province dismissed concerns, claiming Kasuri—implicated in the Pahalgam terror attack—should not be treated as an accused without due investigation. He also pointed to a personal link to Kasur, the town that hosted the May 28 rally.Talha’s appearance alongside Kasuri surfaced at a time when foreign policy circles were abuzz with discussions about Kasuri and his jihadist associates celebrating what they claimed was revenge for Pakistan’s partition following its defeat in the 1971 war.

'We are not looking for war': Shashi Tharoor says Brazil backs India's anti-terror stance against Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-not-looking-for-war-shashi-tharoor-says-brazil-backs-indias-anti-terror-stance-against-pakistan/articleshow/121586302.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading an all-party delegation to Brazil, on Monday reiterated India’s firm message to terror groups and their facilitators across the border, stating, “I want to say once again if Pakistan had not chosen to expand the conflict, we would not have targeted Pakistani military facilitators. We are not looking for war. We are looking only to send a message to terrorists, but through them, we want the message to be heard by those who are providing them safe haven, by those who are financing them, training them, equipping them, guiding them and sending them across the border.”Speaking in Brasilia after meeting Brazil’s top presidential adviser Celso Amorim, Tharoor said Brazil “fully sympathises” with India’s concerns on cross-border terrorism, especially in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and India’s subsequent response through Operation Sindoor ""It was a wonderful meeting... we have worked closely together... it was an easy conversation...we are finding lots of areas of agreement and cooperation...we know that Brazil will fully sympathise with what India is concerned about,"" Tharoor said, referring to Brazil’s solidarity on the issue. Amorim reaffirmed Brazil’s position, saying, “Even if the reasons may be sad, it is a satisfaction to receive our Indian friends... we reiterated our condemnation of all acts of terrorism against the civilian population in India.""Tharoor emphasised that India’s military actions were carefully calibrated and not aimed at escalation. He underlined the lack of accountability in Pakistan following the Pahalgam attack and added that the delegation’s mission was to “seek greater sympathy and understanding” globally for India’s counter-terror strategy.""The reason we have come is very much to seek greater sympathy and understanding on the part of our friends... for the situations in the recent months, in particular the really serious attack on the country by terrorists in Kashmir,"" Tharoor noted, while also expressing gratitude for President Lula da Silva’s personal condolence call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Following their high-level diplomatic meetings, the delegation also held discussions with the India-Brazil Friendship Front, headed by Senator Nelsinho Trad, and with senior officials including Ambassador Maria Laura da Rocha, Secretary General of Foreign Affairs.The Indian delegation includes MPs from various parties: Shambhavi Chaudhary (LJP), Sarfaraz Ahmed (JMM), G M Harish Balayogi (TDP), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, Bhubaneswar Kalita (all BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), Milind Deora (Shiv Sena), and former Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is leading an all-party delegation to Brazil.

'What if China stops Brahmaputra water?': Himanta Biswa Sarma shuts down 'Pakistan's new scare narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-if-china-stops-brahmaputra-water-himanta-biswa-sarma-shuts-down-pakistans-new-scare-narrative/articleshow/121584347.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday hit back at Pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative, calling it a “baseless attempt” to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.Responding to a viral claim, “What if China stops the Brahmaputra’s water to India?”, Sarma issued a fact-driven rebuttal in a strongly worded post on X.His response came as India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in a diplomatic move following the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.“After India decisively moved away from the outdated Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is now spinning another manufactured threat,” Sarma wrote on X.“Let’s dismantle this myth, not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,” he added, emphasising that the Brahmaputra is an Indian river that gains strength downstream, not one diminished by upstream influence.Sarma highlighted that China contributes only around 30 to 35 per cent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, primarily from glacial melt and limited rainfall over the Tibetan plateau. In contrast, 65 to 70 per cent of the river’s volume is generated within India, thanks to monsoon rains and tributaries in the Northeast.Using hydrological data, the chief minister noted that while the river’s flow at the Indo-China border (Tuting) ranges between 2,000 and 3,000 cubic metres per second, it swells dramatically to 15,000–20,000 m³/s in Assam during monsoon season. This, he said, proves India’s dominant role in sustaining the river.“The Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream. It is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory,” Sarma said.He further argued that in the unlikely event China did attempt to reduce the river’s flow, it could even benefit India by reducing the annual floods in Assam that displace hundreds of thousands.Sarma also pointed out that China has never officially threatened to weaponise the Brahmaputra and dismissed such speculation as fear-mongering.Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, he said that the country, which has long relied on the Indus Waters Treaty, is now “panicking” as India asserts its water sovereignty.“Brahmaputra is not controlled by a single source. It is powered by our geography, our monsoon, and our civilisational resilience,” he said.The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river that originates from the Mansarovar region near Mount Kailash in southwestern China. It flows through Tibet, enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, and continues through Assam before making its way into Bangladesh, where it eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.",Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hit back at Pakistan’s latest water- related scare narrative. He called it a “baseless attempt’ to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121584794,imgsize-1023533,width-400,resizemode-4/121584794.jpg"

The DDA shall file a compliance affidavit within a period of three months from today. We make it clear that when we say due process of law before demolishing any structure at least 15 days’ notice shall be served upon the concerned persons.”Justices Karol and Masih, who in principle do not want to dismiss any petition during the partial working day period, said the petition by residents of unauthorised colonies in Batla House area will be heard in July.Hegde said he apprehended that the authorities would act in full swing during the interregnum and pleaded for stay. But the bench refused.The petitioner said the colony comprises a diverse group of individuals, including retired police personnel, govt employees serving in various departments and public offices as well as women, children and senior citizens. Any banket order for demolition would affect their fundamental right to live and right to shelter.The DDA had issued notices on May 26 and 27 to many residents of unauthorised colonies in the Batla House area to vacate the land in question. “Several affected properties, including those situated at Muradi Road, Batla House, are presently inhabited by families who have resided in the locality for decades, and who possess documentary proof of possession, such as electricity bills, house tax receipts, water bills, General Power of Attorney (GPA) documents, and sanctioned building plans. Yet, in spite of their legitimate claims, these residents have been denied an opportunity to be heard, and are now at imminent risk of displacement,” the petitioners claimed.","The Supreme Court rejected pleas of some residents of Muradi Road, Batla House, Jamia Nagar in Delhi to stop the impending demolition drive.

SC seeks Union’s response; plea challenges ‘push back’

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a petition by a man alleging that his mother, released after detention of three years following a Foreigner Tribunal identifying her as a Bangladeshi, may have been forcibly pushed into Bangladesh despite her plea against the tribunal’s order pending in SC since 2017.Appearing for Iunuch Ali, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and A G Masih that she was picked up by Dhubri police and allegedly pushed back into Bangladesh.“How can the Dhubri SP determine whether she is a Bangladeshi immigrant? Was she produced before a magistrate after being detained? The son does not know her whereabouts. The Centre must inform him about her whereabouts,” Sibal said. SC issued notice to Centre on this plea.Sibal also questioned the ‘push back’ of illegal Bangladeshi migrants and this is unknown to the process of law. He said the only legal process available is ‘deportation’. The petitioner said, “The law does not recognize push back, i.e arresting foreign nationals and taking them to the international border and either casting them away or pushing them across international borders without any verification and acceptance by the authorities of the other country.This is illegal, not permitted by any law.”Petitioner's mother Monowara Bewa was declared a foreigner by Dhubri Foreigners Tribunal on March 17, 2016. The Gauhati HC upheld the tribunal’s order on Feb 28, 2017. Her appeal against the HC order is pending adjudication in the SC for the last eight years.In the meantime, the SC in another case in 2019 ordered that foreigners cannot be kept in detention indefinitely and must be either deported to their native country or released on bail. The Centre had said that deportation is dependent on the host country accepting their citizen. Based on this 2019 judgment, Bewa was released in Dec 2019.She was detained again on May 24, as the drive against illegal Bangladeshi immigrants picked pace after the terror attack on tourists at Pahalgam and the ‘Op Sindoor’ by Indian armed forces against terrorist bases in Pakistan. The petitioner said her detention was in violation of her rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution.","SC seeks Union’s response; plea challenges ‘push back’ of illegal Bangladeshi migrants.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26.

BSE Sensex closed at 81,373.75, down 77 points or 0.095%.Market experts anticipate continued positive momentum through June, supported by robust Q4 GDP data, potential RBI rate reductions and steady institutional capital flows.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The market structure favours continuation of the ongoing consolidation phase. There are global headwinds like renewed tariff concerns that will restrain a breakout rally. At the same time there are domestic tailwinds that will support the market at lower levels. President Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium is a clear message that the tariff and trade scenario will continue to be uncertain and turbulent. This headwind will impact markets. On the domestic front the tailwinds are getting stronger with the latest Q4 GDP growth data coming at 7.4%, which is much better-than-expected.”“Trends in consumption expenditure and capital expenditure are promising. This along with low inflation and the expected continuation of the rate cutting policy provide the perfect setting for sustained economic growth in FY26. The only challenge is the tepid earnings growth. If leading indicators suggest a recovery in earnings growth there is a high probability of the market breaking out of the present range and moving higher.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Trading Strategy: Buy on Dips; Support: 94500-93500; Resistance 96500-97500

Gold price prediction today: Investors face uncertainty regarding their gold investment decisions due to multiple factors affecting market sentiment. The ongoing geopolitical conflicts, coupled with evolving US-China trade negotiations, have created ambiguity in the precious metals market. What is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Gold prices slipped from a two-week high after US President Donald Trump postponed the implementation of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9, easing immediate trade tensions and reducing safe-haven demand. This delay came after the EU requested more time for negotiations, leading to a temporary pullback in bullion prices.However, geopolitical risks continued to support underlying demand, with Russia launching the largest aerial assault of the war on Ukraine and Israel intensifying military strikes in Gaza.Meanwhile, gold remained under pressure from a stronger US dollar, as the dollar index hovered near the 100 mark amid rising US bond yields and mixed economic data.A US trade court initially blocked Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, only for a federal appeals court to reinstate them a day later, injecting uncertainty into markets.On the economic front, US consumer confidence came in stronger than expected at just under 100, compared to a forecast of 87.1, while core durable goods orders rose 0.2% against expectations of a 0.1% decline.However, preliminary US GDP remained in negative territory, reinforcing concerns about slowing growth. The April PCE Price Index rose 2.1% year-on-year, slightly below the 2.2% estimate, suggesting softening inflation pressures. Weekly jobless claims exceeded expectations, adding to mixed economic signals.Minutes from the Fed’s May meeting revealed growing concern about the dual risk of rising inflation and unemployment, with policymakers indicating that rate cuts remain possible later this year but are not imminent. Geo-political tensions are once again on the rise and comments from President Trump’s administration on EU and China are also keeping market participants on edge.Focus this week will be on US Jobs market data, manufacturing and Services PMI from major economies and Governor Powell’s speech. RBI and ECB monetary policy statements will also be in radar this week.",Gold prices slipped from a two-week high after US President Donald Trump postponed the implementation of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9.

Amit Kumar Singal, a 2007-batch IRS officer serving as Additional Director General at the Directorate of Taxpayer Services, was arrested alongside his associate Harsh Kotak in connection with an alleged bribe of Rs 25 lakh.CBI officials confirmed on Monday that raids at Singal’s residences in Delhi and Punjab led to the seizure of approximately Rs 1 crore in cash, 3.5 kg of gold, and 2 kg of silver. The operation followed a complaint by Sanam Kapoor, owner of La Pino’z Pizza, who alleged that Singal demanded a total of Rs 45 lakh to settle an income tax notice issued earlier this year.According to the complaint, Singal had leveraged his previous position as Joint Commissioner in the Customs Department, Mumbai, to establish business connections with Kapoor, including a franchise agreement via Parker Impex, a firm registered in his mother's name. Additional contracts were reportedly arranged with other firms linked to Kotak and his family.

For persons aged five years and above, the national literacy rate was 79.7%. The disaggregated literacy data across all states and Union Territories was based on nationally representative sampling.The PLFS captures detailed literacy data across age groups (5+ and 7+), gender, and rural-urban categories for all states and Union Territories. For persons aged seven and above, male literacy at the national level was 87.2%, while female literacy stood at 74.6%. For the 5+ age group, male literacy was 85.6% and female literacy was 73.7%.States with the lowest literacy rates in the age 7+ category were Bihar (74.3%), Madhya Pradesh (75.2%), and Rajasthan (75.8%). In the 5+ age group, Bihar again ranked lowest at 73.2%, followed by Madhya Pradesh (73.7%) and Rajasthan (74.9%).Urban India continues to report higher literacy levels than rural areas.

The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India.

As allegations of medical negligence and administrative failure emerge, here are 10 things to know about the case that has prompted interventions from the NHRC, NCW, and national leaders:On May 26, the minor girl was allegedly lured with chocolate near her aunt’s house and taken to a maize field where she was raped and physically assaulted. She sustained serious neck and internal injuries.She was first admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur. Due to her critical condition, she was referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on May 30.According to her uncle, the child was kept waiting for 2-3 hours inside an ambulance outside PMCH before being admitted. Despite her condition, proper care was allegedly delayed, and the family claims she was only admitted after they raised a ruckus.The family alleged that doctors gave the child sedatives through the night, and she died the next morning. They also claimed they had to spend Rs 25,000 at the government hospital.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took suo motu cognisance and issued notices to the chief secretary and DGP of Bihar, calling the incident a serious human rights violation.A detailed report has been sought within two weeks.National Commission for Women (NCW) Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar also took suo motu cognisance, demanding a probe into the role of the hospital authorities and police, and calling the delay in treatment ""gross negligence.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government of prioritising elections over justice.

India Hosts G20, Pakistan Hosts Top 20 Terrorists? Priyanka Chaturvedi Blasts Islamabad in UK

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.Last week, Sikh separatists urged the Carney government now not to ask the Indian Prime Minister, bringing up India’s alleged loss of cooperation within the investigation into the killing of separatist chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had accused the Indian government of involvement in Nijjar’s homicide but did no longer publicly offer assisting evidence—an allegation India has always denied. The ensuing diplomatic fallout brought about both nations expelling diplomats, mentioning antagonistic activities.Prime Minister Carney has but to remark directly on the Nijjar case. However, even as outlining his plans to use change as a means to reset ties, he asserted that Canada isn't responsible for the current strain in its dating with India. In response, India has expressed hope that Carney will take a more measured approach than his predecessor. New Delhi has indicated its willingness to work with Ottawa, provided the relationship is grounded in mutual accept as true with and sensitivity. India has additionally referred to as on Canada to ensure robust security for its diplomats and take firm movement in opposition to extremists and separatist elements undertaking anti-India sports.","Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance.

At that time, elections were supposed to be announced in two to three months,” news agency PTI reported Pawar as saying.The Ladki Bahin scheme, launched in August 2024, offers Rs 1,500 per month to eligible women aged 21 to 65 years with an annual income below Rs 2.5 lakh. Though it was designed to empower poor women, scrutiny revealed thousands of ineligible recipients, including over 2,200 government employees.Pawar, who also heads the state’s finance department, clarified that the aid already deposited will not be withdrawn. “When the scheme was unveiled, the government had appealed that only eligible women apply but that didn't happen. A scrutiny is being conducted. Only the needy women will get the monthly payout,” he said.Also read: No legal action against ineligible Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme beneficiaries, says Ajit Pawar His admission drew strong reactions from the opposition. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut demanded Pawar’s resignation, accusing him of enabling a misuse of public funds to gain electoral advantage. Raut said the finance department had presided over a “loot of government money for the sake of votes”.Earlier, Maharashtra minister Aditi Tatkare confirmed the government had disqualified 2,289 ineligible government employees after examining nearly two lakh applications. In a recent post on X, she assured the public that such scrutiny would continue regularly. “After realising this, such beneficiaries are not being given the benefit of the scheme,” she wrote.The Ladki Bahin scheme was credited with boosting the Mahayuti alliance’s performance in the November 2024 assembly elections. However, it has also led to budgetary strain. Social Justice Minister Sanjay Shirsat conceded that the government was under pressure, saying, “It is a reality that the monthly amount of Rs 1,500 cannot be raised to Rs 2,100.” He added that the scheme would continue even if it required the state to borrow funds.A;so read: Raut says CM, dy CMs indifferent to people’s issues in the state Shirsat also criticised the finance department for diverting funds from his ministry without notice. In March, he alleged that Rs 7,000 crore had been slashed from the Social Justice Department’s budget, and on Monday, he called for a law to protect such departments from arbitrary cuts.According to official guidelines, beneficiaries must meet income and residency criteria and provide Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. Newly married women can present a marriage certificate if their name does not appear on a ration card. While the scheme aims to support women’s economic independence, the government now faces growing scrutiny over its execution.","Mahar Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar says the state government made a ""mistake"" in extending financial benefits to all applicants of the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana without sufficient scrutiny.

MUMBAI: Rajit Gupta of Kota emerged at the top of the JEE Advanced 2025 rank list, securing 332 out of 360 marks. Gupta, whose father himself ranked 48th in Rajasthan's Pre Engineering Test of 1994, will join IIT Bombay 's computer science department.Nipping at Gupta's heels, Saksham Jindal from Hisar in Haryana, the son of doctor parents, matched his score but fell just short on tie-breaking metrics - based on higher positive marks. Gupta got 335 and Jindal got 333. Majid Husain stood third with 330. This year the list saw more ties - ranks 6 and 7 both scored 321, and 8 and 9 shared a score of 319 - making the race not just close, but highly competitive.The coaching hub of Kota, often in the news for negative reasons, had cause to celebrate Monday as an unprecedented 42 from the city ranked in the top 100 - its best showing since the exam's current format was adopted in 2013.Devdutta Majhi from West Bengal, who gave up her violin during her JEE Advanced preparation, emerged as the top-ranking female candidate in the country. With an All-India Rank of 16 and a score of 312, her preparation was largely self-led, with some mock tests and doubt-solving sessions. She also turned to her mother to clear her doubts. In Aug, she will join the Indian Institute of Science.Of the 1.8 lakh candidates who sat through both the papers on May 18, only 54,378 made it past the finish line. Among them, 9,404 are women. It was not just the achievers that drew attention - this year, the cutoffs also reduced. The minimum qualifying marks for the general category nosedived to 74 from last year's 109. With just 7 marks needed per subject-physics, chemistry and math-the subject-wise cutoff also reduced, down from 10 a year ago.Across social categories, the dip was uniform. OBC and Economically Weaker Sections candidates needed 66 marks (18.5%), while SC/ST candidates qualified at 37 marks-10.28% - with a subject-wise minimum of 3.While students from the IIT Bombay zone dominated the upper echelons of the merit list, it was the IIT Hyderabad zone - encompassing the southern states - that sent the largest cohort across the qualifying line. As many as 13,000 candidates from this zone made the cut. Close on its heels was the IIT Delhi zone, with 11,370 qualifiers, followed by the IIT Bombay zone, contributing 11,226 aspirants to the pool of those eligible for counselling.Analysis showed that the top 10 ranks closed at 317 this year, down from 329 in 2024.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Delhi have emerged as top performers in tackling the challenge of adult literacy and education. The 2024-25 Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Assessment Test (FLNAT), conducted under ULLAS - Nav Bharat Saaksharta Karyakram, has thrown up encouraging results among states that submitted the certification data in time.Data compiled by the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), exclusively accessed by TOI, showed that the top performers ranged in the late 90s in terms of success percentages, while the relative laggards - Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh - were over 85%.The FLNAT programme was rolled out in phases between July 2024 and March 2025, with over 1.77 crore adult learners tested in all.By May 2025, only 34.3 lakh were officially certified, reflecting a national average of about 19.4%. However, this figure is skewed due to pending certification data from the March 2025 phase, which included over 49 lakh participants whose results were still being processed.Under FLNAT, which is a nationwide assessment of foundational literacy and numeracy skills, ""states/UTs identify illiterate populations, educate them, and then conduct a test to reveal outcomes,"" said a senior official of ministry of education (MoE).TN recorded a flawless performance, certifying all 5,09,694 learners who appeared in FLNAT - a 100% success rate. ""This is attributed to strong administrative oversight, pre-exam preparation, and local mobilisation through community volunteers and panchayat support,"" the official said. Tripura was close behind, certifying 13,909 of 14,179 learners, with a success rate of 98.1%. Delhi also performed exceptionally, certifying 7,901 of 7,959 candidates, with a 99.3% success rate.On the other hand, states like Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh posted lower certification rates despite moderate participation. Uttarakhand certified 8,109 of 9,459 learners (85.7%); Gujarat, 1,853 of 2,128 (87.1%); and Himachal Pradesh, 14,500 of 15,351 candidates (88.3%). ""While these states didn't perform poorly in absolute terms, their outcomes were among the lowest of those with fully declared results,"" said a senior official of department of school education and literacy.One encouraging finding is the high participation of women. In Madhya Pradesh, more women appeared in FLNAT than men - 8.52 lakh versus 8.11 lakh men. Similar trends were seen in Jharkhand and Odisha. This indicates a growing awareness and desire for literacy among adult women, who increasingly see education as a means of empowerment and dignity.","The FLNAT programme was rolled out in phases between July 2024 and March 2025, with over 1.77 crore adult learners tested in all.

LeT ultras boast about revenge for 1971, mock 'Modi's missiles & bullets'

NEW DELHI: The line, ever so thin, between the Pakistani state and terrorists, is fast disappearing post-Operation Sindoor. Speaker of Pakistan's Punjab assembly, Malik Ahmed Khan, has now come out in defence of Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri, by attending a rally alongside the US-designated terrorist, and Talha Saeed, son of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed Asked by reporters, the speaker of the assembly of Pakistan's biggest province brazened it out by saying Kasuri, one of the masterminds of the Pahalgam terror attack , should not be seen as an accused without an investigation. He also cited a personal connection to Kasur, the town where the May 28 rally was organised.The presence of Talha alongside Kasuri came to light when foreign policy circles were already discussing Kasuri and his jihadi comrades gloating over what they called their success in avenging the partition of Pakistan after its loss to India in the 1971 war.Video footage from the rally showed Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri arriving with a posse of guards carrying American M4 carbines and being serenaded as the ""conqueror"" of India. Flower petals were showered on him.While addressing the gathering, the Lashkar terrorists boasted about their involvement in protests against former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, which forced her to flee and take shelter in India.Kasuri and Muzammil Hashmi, both designated as terrorists by the US, claimed credit for their role in the coup during rallies organised last week. ""We emerged victorious against you in Bangladesh last year,"" they said.Expectedly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been the target of hateful vitriol that marks proceedings of jihadi congregations. ""Tum hamein apni goli se darate ho, Modi hum tujhe paigham dete hain, humare bachche teri missailon se nahi dare, hum teri goli se kya darenge (Modi, you scare us with your bullets, our children were not scared of your missiles, you think we are worried about your bullets),"" Hashmi said during a rally by Pakistan Markazi Muslim League, the political front of Lashkar-e-Taiba, in Gujranwala on May 28.At another rally the same week, Kasuri drew parallels between the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war and recent events, stating that his group had avenged the past defeat.""I was four years old when Pakistan was dismembered in 1971. The then Indian PM Indira Gandhi had declared that she had drowned the two-nation theory in the khaleej (Bay of Bengal). On May 10, we took the revenge of 1971,"" Kasuri said while addressing his supporters in Rahim Yar Khan.He also referenced the brutal Indian air strikes on Muridke, which resulted in the death of fellow terrorist Mudassar, and expressed anguish over being barred from attending the funeral. ""I was not allowed to attend his funeral. On the day of his funeral, I cried a lot,"" Kasuri said.","Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri attended a rally alongside the US- designated terrorist, and Talha Saeed, son of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed.

""Today, India is emerging as a global leader in space-aviation convergence,"" he said.""There are three foundational pillars driving India's aviation sector: A vast market - not merely a collection of consumers but a reflection of India's aspirational society. A strong demographic and talent pool where young innovators are pioneering breakthroughs in AI, robotics, and clean energy. And finally, an open and supportive policy ecosystem which will take aviation to unprecedented heights,"" the PM said.The seamless Digi Yatra app for paperless domestic travel came in for special praise, with Modi urging other countries to adopt the same. ""Digi Yatra stands as a secure and smart solution, serving as a model of inspiration for the Global South.""He also spoke about the work being done in the fields of sustainable aviation fuels, green technologies and reducing carbon footprint.""The new Indian Aircraft Act aligns aviation laws with global best practices, ensuring a streamlined regulatory framework, ease of compliance and a simplified tax structure which presents a significant investment opportunity for major international aviation companies,"" he said.","India's flyer footfall is projected to more than double from the current 24 crore to almost 50 crore annually by 2030. By 2047, the number of airports will expand to 350 - there are 162 currently in operation. cargo is expected to increase from 3.5 to 10 million metric tonnes by the end of this decade.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121580610,imgsize-677311,width-400,resizemode-4/121580610.jpg"

Congress has slammed Centre's move to send all-party delegations abroad, calling it a sham.""When on mission against terrorism, to carry India's message to the world, it's distressing that people at home are calculating political allegiances. Is it so difficult to be patriotic?"" he wondered in a post on X that appeared to echo the exasperation of his colleague Shashi Tharoor, who has been at the receiving end of attacks from party spokespersons for agreeing to head one of the all-party delegations.Explaining his post, Khurshid said the need of the hour is to speak in a single voice in favour of the country, irrespective of party affiliations, as the delegations have been doing on foreign soil. ""When I say, is it so difficult to be a patriot? - that is the question that has to be asked of those who are putting out tweets and saying things that I believe are not very encouraging when you want to do something for the nation,"" he wrote.Khurshid's remarks Friday backing abrogation of Article 370 while addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia had caused a stir. He had said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to J&K following the decision - something that is diametrically opposed to Congress' official stance of revocation of special status for J&K being a disaster.Sharing Khurshid's remarks on Monday, BJP stepped up its attack on Congress. ""Congress, for the sake of petty political gains, puts party interest, parivaar interest above national interest. Hope they will realise that Salman Khurshid is not a super pravakta (spokesperson) of any party, he is putting nation first.

NEW DELHI: Is President Donald Trump punishing India for buying Russian oil or is there more behind the sudden flare-up in Washington’s tone? A 25 percent tariff bombshell, threats of further penalties, and caustic rhetoric from the US President have pushed US-India ties into an uneasy zone.Beginning August 1, Indian goods entering the US will be hit with heavy duties, and the White House has cited India’s defence and energy ties with Russia as the trigger.Now, in a significant escalation, President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian goods, citing continued purchases of Russian oil -- a key revenue source for Moscow’s war in Ukraine. This second wave of duties is set to take effect in three weeks and will be stacked on top of the 25 percent tariff already entering force Thursday.Also read:But the timing, the tone, and the tangled web of political subplots suggest a more complicated motive -- one that mixes strategic pressure with personal politics.At the heart of this diplomatic storm are three converging factors: a stalled trade deal, India’s refusal to toe Washington’s line on Russia, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dismissal in Parliament of any ceasefire claim which Trump says he brokered between India and Pakistan.What began as a trade grievance has now evolved into a multidimensional standoff, as both nations weigh how far they’re willing to bend before relations snap.Trump’s latest salvo was delivered on his social media platform, Truth Social, where he announced a 25 percent tariff on Indian goods, effective August 1, and threatened to raise it even further. He linked the move directly to India-Russia energy imports and military purchases.“India has not been a good trading partner,” Trump told CNBC. “They do a lot of business with us, but we don't do business with them... They are buying Russian oil and fuelling the Russian war machine.”Trump further claimed, “India has the highest tariffs of anybody. We do very little business with India.”Trade discussions between the two countries have stalled after five rounds of negotiations failed to produce an interim agreement. Indian officials insist a sixth round is planned for the end of August, and that talks are still ongoing. A statement from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry emphasised that the government would take “all steps necessary to secure our national interest.”A Reuters report quoting Indian trade officials said the tariffs may be temporary and could be revised if a deal is struck later this year.The timing of Trump’s aggressive posturing on India has also drawn attention to a parallel controversy in Washington: dissatisfaction among Trump’s core MAGA base over the lack of action on the Jeffrey Epstein files.While campaigning in 2024, Trump had pledged to release Epstein-related records. However, that promise has not materialised, with the Justice Department and FBI denying the existence of a “client list.” A Wall Street Journal report claimed Trump had been briefed in May that his name appears in documents related to Epstein, though the White House called it “a fake news story.”In light of this domestic pressure, critics argue that Trump may be using India as a convenient geopolitical scapegoat.“This is classic Trump,” said a US-India analyst quoted in a BBC report. “Deflect from domestic failures by creating an external enemy. And India’s ties with Russia offer just enough substance to justify a punitive campaign.”Adding to the tension was PM Modi’s address in the Lok Sabha on July 30, in which he categorically denied any foreign mediation during Operation Sindoor -- India’s limited military operation against Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack.“No world leader asked for suspension of Operation Sindoor,” Modi said, responding to opposition leader Rahul Gandhi’s challenge to clarify the extent of US involvement.This statement ran counter to Trump’s long-standing claim that he helped de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan. Earlier, the US President had said on Truth Social, “I settled a war a month. India-Pakistan was one of them.”Indian officials confirmed that the only contact from the US came via Vice President J D Vance, who warned India that Pakistan may launch an offensive. PM Modi reportedly told Vance that India would retaliate forcefully: “Each bullet would be met with a shell.”While some saw PM Modi’s statement as a necessary correction, others believe it may have added fuel to Trump’s wrath.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University believes the tariff hike has less to do with Trump’s bruised ego and more to do with calculated strategy.“No, Trump is not doing this because of the Epstein file. And he's also not doing it because of what Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Parliament,” Prof Kumar told The Times of India.“The reason he's doing it is strategic -- he’s doing it for all countries, not just allies, and not necessarily in response to unfriendly nations either.”“President Trump may not even be aware of what PM Modi said in Parliament. Essentially, Trump thinks he can put pressure on India, and that India will accept the terms -- including very high tariffs, somewhere around 25 percent or more.”According to Kumar, Trump’s broader goal is to exert pressure on nations to fall in line with Washington’s geopolitical goals -- primarily isolating Russia.“He's trying to gain a negotiation advantage by putting multiple charges on countries, and also sending a message to Russia. If Russia doesn’t go for a ceasefire in Ukraine, then secondary tariffs would hit a number of countries, including India,” he said.Trump’s tactics also include posturing on Pakistan, a nation he has historically criticised. But recently, he has praised Islamabad for nominating him for a Nobel Peace Prize and reportedly offered support for Pakistan’s entry into the energy export market -- including potential sales to India.“Trump is also trying to show some bonhomie with Pakistan,” Prof. Kumar said. “But let me tell you, that’s a bluff. Pakistan is in bad shape. No major investor is looking at Pakistan right now. It doesn't have reliable reserves, and companies have burnt their fingers there before.”India, meanwhile, has brushed off the suggestion that it might buy oil from Pakistan. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters, “I have no comments to offer in this matter.”Despite the aggressive rhetoric from Washington, India has remained measured. The MEA has reiterated its commitment to a multi-aligned foreign policy.“Our bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country,” said Jaiswal.“India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership,” he added, pointing out that India’s defence and energy purchases are guided by national security and economic needs.Russia remains India’s top oil supplier, accounting for nearly 40 percent of crude imports -- a major shift from just 0.2 percent before the Ukraine war. Indian oil companies have shown no signs of halting imports despite the tariff threats from Washington.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal , addressing Parliament, said: “The government gives utmost priority to safeguarding the welfare of farmers, labourers, exporters, MSMEs, and industrialists.”Trump’s assertion that India’s purchases are prolonging the Ukraine conflict has been met with scepticism in New Delhi. Indian officials have quietly pointed to the hypocrisy of Western nations, including members of the EU, which continue to conduct substantial trade with Russia.“India, so far, hasn’t reacted strongly,” said Prof. Kumar. “The statement that came from the ministry recently was measured and cautious. It tried to show a mirror to both Europe and Pakistan, pointing out that the European Union still has billions in trade with Russia, and even the US continues some imports.”Still, Kumar warns that Trump’s tactics may escalate further. “If there's no deal, Trump won't stop at 25 percent tariffs. He might go higher and add penalties for BRICS membership or trade with Russia. India expects any negotiated deal to cap tariffs between 20 to 25 percent.”He added that India must also push back on energy realities. “India should convey to the US that if we shift our oil imports away from Russia, and buy from the same market as Europe, oil prices will shoot up by $15 to $20 a barrel. That will hurt everyone — including the US and Europe.”India is bracing for the upcoming visit of a US trade delegation later this month. New Delhi hopes that the talks will lead to a mutually acceptable deal on tariffs, even as it makes clear that foreign policy decisions -- especially on Russia -- will not be dictated from outside.“NSA has already reached Moscow. The external affairs minister is also expected to visit. These visits send a message that India will pursue an independent foreign policy based on national interest,” Kumar said.“India should be ready for a deal -- but only on trade and tariffs. On strategic autonomy and foreign policy, especially with Russia, India should stand firm.”Despite the looming deadline, India’s official stance remains open to negotiation.“India believes negotiations are still possible. A US team is expected later this month. India would rather have a bad deal than no deal,” Kumar noted.But he cautioned against retaliatory tariffs as a diplomatic strategy. “Even if India raises tariffs on US imports in retaliation, it won’t change Trump's behaviour. In fact, it might provoke him to go even harder. That’s not good advice at this point.”President Trump has made it clear -- through tariffs, penalties, and strong words -- that he views India’s energy policy and trade practices as incompatible with US interests. But whether this coercive approach results in diplomatic breakthrough or deeper strain remains to be seen.“The August First deadline is the August First deadline — it stands strong, and will not be extended. A big day for America!!!” Trump declared on Truth Social.For now, India appears unwilling to compromise on its strategic autonomy. With economic stakes rising, the coming weeks will reveal whether the world’s largest democracies can navigate this impasse, or whether Trump’s hardline tactics will deepen the divide.","President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on Indian goods, effective August 1.

The election for the VP post has been necessitated following the resignation of Jagdeep Dhankhar last month.Shinde also met PM Narendra Modi and congratulated him on the success of Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev. The twin interactions were seen as significant.

Shinde said Modi praised his son, who got the opportunity to lead a multi-party delegation to convey India's message of zero tolerance to terrorism.Shinde also rejected suggestions that his frequent visits to Delhi were linked to 'differences' with Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, saying they were working together for development.

Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south. In a sharp rebuke, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the move reflected Washington’s inability to cope with a shifting global order.""Sanctions and restrictions have unfortunately become a defining feature of the current historical period,"" Zakharova said in response to a media query on the US decision to tighten tariffs against countries in the Global South.""Unable to accept the erosion of its dominance in an emerging multipolar international order, Washington continues to pursue a neocolonial agenda, employing politically motivated economic pressure against those who choose an independent course on the international stage.""Zakharova asserted that no sanctions or tariff wars would stop the evolution of the international system.

NEW DELHI: Enraged by what it termed ""one of the worst and most erroneous orders we have come across"", Supreme Court has pulled up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case. Questioning Kumar's competence in deciding criminal cases, SC, in an unprecedented order, directed he shouldn't be given any criminal case for adjudication till he retires, and must be made to sit with a seasoned judge of the HC in a division bench.""The judge has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what's wrong with judiciary at the level of HC,"" Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said.SC said at times ""we are left wondering whether such orders are passed on some extraneous considerations or it is sheer ignorance of law. Whatever it be, passing of such absurd and erroneous orders is unpardonable"". It said the erroneous order was not an exception as Justice Kumar had passed similarly unpardonable ones over a period of time, which left them with no option but to take the extreme step.The case pertains to sale of goods and payment between two businessmen.The seller had delivered goods worth Rs 52.34 lakh out of which he was paid Rs 47.75 lakh. As the balance amount was not paid, he lodged a criminal case, leading to the other businessman to move HC for quashing the case.While allowing criminal proceedings in the case, a single bench of Justice Kumar justified his decision, saying that the complainant would not be in a position to pursue the civil litigation as it will take years and he will have to put more money to pursue the litigation. ""To be more precise, it would seem like good money chasing bad money. If this court allows the matter to be referred to civil court on account of civil dispute between the parties, it would amount to travesty of justice and O.P. no.2 (complainant) would suffer irreparable loss and he might even not be in a position to emerge from the financial constraints to pursue the matter,"" he had said.Expressing shock over the stand taken by the judge the SC bench said, ""Is it the understanding of the high court that ultimately if the accused is convicted, the trial court would award him the balance amount? The observations recorded... are shocking. It is an extremely sad day for one and all to read the observations... It was expected of the high court to know the well-settled position of law that in cases of civil dispute a complainant cannot be permitted to resort to criminal proceedings as the same would amount to abuse of process of law.""It was expected of the HC to understand the nature of the allegations levelled in the complaint. In substance the HC has said in so many words that the criminal proceedings instituted by the complainant in a case of pure civil dispute is justified because it may take considerable time for the complainant to recover the balance amount by preferring a civil suit,"" it said.The bench quashed the order and directed that the case be reconsidered by the HC but by another judge.""The chief justice of the high court shall immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the judge concerned. The chief justice shall make the judge concerned sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge of the HC. We further direct that the judge concerned shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office. If at all he is to be made to sit as a single judge, he shall not be assigned any criminal determination,"" the apex court said.","Supreme Court pulls up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday led a massive protest rally in Jhargram, denouncing the alleged attacks on Bengali-speaking migrants outside the state and accusing the BJP of orchestrating a campaign to harass Bengalis in the name of citizenship and voter list revision.“How can someone be branded as Bangladeshi if he or she speaks in Bengali?” Banerjee questioned while addressing the gathering. “This is nothing but a conspiracy to harass our people,” she added.She also warned that she would expose the BJP if attacks on the Bengali language and its people continue. “If you attack Bengali language and Bengal's people, I will expose BJP before the world,” she said. “If you attack Bengali language and Bengal's people, I will not stay silent,” she added.The rally, centered around the message that the Bengali language and identity “will never be silenced,” saw Banerjee walking nearly three kilometers through the tribal region. She was joined by senior Trinamool Congress leaders, cultural figures and local residents carrying placards that read ""Banglar Apoman Sojjyo Hobe Na"" (Insult to Bengal won't be tolerated) and ""Bangla Amar Ma"" (Bengal, my mother).The rally witnessed widespread participation from migrant families, students and local leaders, as Banerjee positioned herself as the defender of Bengali pride, language and identity.The protest was held in response to allegations of harassment and discrimination against Bengali-speaking migrants in different parts of India.She also expressed strong objections to what she called a deliberate attempt to marginalize Bengalis. “What right does the Assam government have to send NRC notices to people of Bengal?” she questioned.Banerjee further alleged that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter list was being used as a tool to bring the National Register of Citizens (NRC) through the backdoor. “The SIR exercise is being undertaken to bring NRC through the backdoor. People are already dying by suicide out of fear,” she alleged.She cautioned officials against excluding genuine voters from the electoral rolls. “Not a single elector should be omitted from the voter list in the name of Special Intensive Revision,” she asserted. Taking a dig at the BJP, she said, “They are trying to make a BJP list, not a voter list.”Slamming the BJP's demand for citizenship documents, Banerjee said, ""Do BJP leaders themselves have their birth certificates? What right do they have to question the identity of others?""","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee led a massive protest rally in Jhargram.

Finland-based thinktank exposes US double standard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finland-based-thinktank-exposes-us-double-standard/articleshow/123151870.cms,"NEW DELHI: European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports against India's 13% since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, while G7+ tankers are currently transporting more than half of those barrels, data published by CREA (Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air) shows.Indian govt sources here said this further spotlighted Western hypocrisy in targeting India for securing its energy interests, while ignoring similar action by other countries. European Union has been procuring not just energy but also fertilizers, chemicals, iron, steel and transport equipment from Russia.""These figures only vindicate India's emphasis on ensuring for its citizens regular and affordable energy supplies,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.Seen in the backdrop of the US on Wednesday doubling tariff on India to 50% for ""fuelling the Russian war machine"" by buying its oil and last month's EU sanction on Indian refining entity Nayara Energy, the Finland-based independent think-tank's latest report exposes what New Delhi describes as West's ""double standard"" in singling out India.The report says Moscow has raked in EUR 923 billion (92,300 crore) so far from fossil fuel exports such as oil, natural gas, coal, refined fuels and intermediaries.Of this, EUR 212 billion (21,200 crore) came from EU countries compared with EUR 121 billion (12,100 crore) from India. China remained the top bu-yer of Russian energy with a tab of over EUR 200 billion (20,000 crore).The report points out the growing role of G7 tankers in transporting Russian oil since the EU's June sanctions. This underlines the disconnect between western policy and practice pointed out by New Delhi. ""Since Jan, the G7+ share in Russian oil transport has increased from 36% to 56%,"" it says. More than half of Russian seaborne oil exports were transported in G7+ tankers in June, reflecting a six percentage point increase over May.Use of western tanker fleet means those shipments were compliant with the price cap and other terms of the sanctions. India argues it has helped prevent a flare-up in oil prices by buying Russian oil, accounting for about 9% of daily global supply. That is also the key consideration that led the US and the EU to opt for a price cap - rather than choking off the flow with sanctions - for curbing funding for Moscow's war efforts without spooking the oil markets.Overall, however, the report does say that ""Russian fossil fuel revenues in second quarter of 2025 dropped by 18% year-on-year - lowest in a quarter since the invasion of Ukraine. This occurred despite an 8% increase in volumes exported in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025.""Read | Trump tariffs: Exporters on edge, fear losing orders","European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports.

""Withdrawing sanction to prosecute is unheard of in criminal jurisprudence,"" he said.Referring to Tiwari's ""politically motivated petition"" argument, Justice Bhuyan told Naidu, ""This is a malady not confined to Tamil Nadu alone.

SC judges take exception to order against HC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-judges-take-exception-to-order-against-hc-judge/articleshow/123151364.cms,"NEW DELHI: Top judges of Supreme Court have taken strong exception to the order passed on Tuesday by a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan castigating an Allahabad high court judge for lack of knowledge in criminal law and de-rostering him from hearing criminal cases for life, and are mulling steps to remedy an unpleasant situation created in breach of repeated SC rulings.A concerned Chief Justice of India B R Gavai consulted his senior colleagues and is now discussing ways and means to remedy the order that has created difficulties for the chief justice (CJ) of one of the oldest high courts of India, at Allahabad.SC has repeatedly ruled that the CJ of an HC is the master of the roster and he alone can allocate, roster and assign cases to single, division and three-judge benches in HC and that his discretion is not amenable to judicial orders.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan ordered the Allahabad HC CJ to ""immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the concerned judge"" and ""make the judge sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge"". They also said, ""We further direct that the concerned judge shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office"".Irrespective of the folly of the HC judge, SC, which gives primacy to principles of natural justice, passed the caustic and damaging order against the judge without giving him an opportunity to explain why he passed the impugned directive.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges, and said, ""The judge concerned has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what is wrong with the Indian judiciary at the level of HC.""TOI spoke to a number of former CJIs, who too expressed concern over the manner in which the bench led by Justice Pardiwala proceeded to castigate the HC judge, stressing that errors in HC orders are not uncommon and are regularly appealed in SC.A judge's mistake in appreciating legal points or facts in a particular case cannot empower SC, while deciding appeals against an HC judgment, to castigate the judge who authored that judgment and take punitive measures like de-rostering him, which, the ex-CJIs said, was the sole prerogative of the HC CJ.Incidentally, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had fixed timelines for the President and governors to grant or refuse assent to bills passed by state assemblies, while granting ""deemed approval"" to bills pending with the TN governor. The President has since sent a reference to SC seeking its opinion on whether the apex court has the power to fix timelines for her and governors when the Constitution does not provide for the same, and whether SC can use powers under Article 142 to grant deemed approval to bills.In the case of Braj Kishore Thakur vs. Union of India (1997), SC had ruled: ""Higher courts must remind themselves constantly that higher tiers are provided in the judicial hierarchy to set right errors which could possibly have crept in findings or orders of courts at the lower tiers. Such powers are certainly not for belching diatribe at judicial personages in lower cadre. It is best to remember the words of a jurist that 'a judge who has not committed any error is yet to be born'. ..""In Rajasthan vs Prakash Chand (1997), another three-judge bench said ""that the administrative control of HC vests in the chief justice alone. On the judicial side, however, he is only the first amongst equals. The CJ is the master of the roster. He alone has the prerogative to constitute benches of the court and allocate cases to the benches so constituted. The puisne judges can only do that work as is allotted to them by the chief justice or under his directions. No judge or judges can give directions to the Registry for listing any case before him or them which runs counter to the directions given by the chief justice."" This ruling was made applicable to SC by a three-judge bench's judgment in 2018.","Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges.

The Tamil Nadu govt has submitted a list of 45 welfare schemes (launched by states and Union govt) named after various political netas. We do not wish to name the schemes in order to cause embarrassment to political parties. ""While directing the AIADMK MP to deposit Rs 10 lakh within a week with the TN govt for utilisation in welfare schemes for the underprivileged, the CJI said, ""Time and again we have observed that political battles are to be fought in the electoral arena.Courts are not the place to fight political battles.""Interestingly, the CJI-led bench withdrew Shanmugam's writ petition before the HC to the SC and dismissed it terming it as ""fully misconceived and an abuse of the process of law"" for singling out the TN scheme and not challenging similar schemes prevalent in other states and at Centre.It allowed appeals of DMK and TN govt to set aside the HC order. DMK was represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and P Wilson. Rohatgi said SC had permitted use of photographs of the President, PM, CM and cabinet ministers in public advertisements to generate awareness among citizens about welfare schemesand that no political party in office has been immune to this phenomenon.For TN, senior advocate A M Singhvi supported the contentions of the party and said the scheme was meant to set up camps in every nook and corner of the state to enable and facilitate people of TN to avail full benefits of existing welfare schemes. Wilson said the AIADMK MP had approached Election Commission with the same allegation on July 21 for action against DMK and three days later, moved the HC alleging that EC was not taking action.Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the AIADMK MP, attempted to convince the court that a conjoint reading of a series of orders passed by SC on the issue took one to the conclusion that no welfare scheme could be named after political netas.After imposing a cost of Rs 10 lakh on Shanmugam, the bench said if the amount was not paid by the MP within a week, he would be liable for contempt of court proceedings.","Supreme Court rules that no exception can be taken to Tamil Nadu govt's 'Ungaludan Stalin' scheme, which translates into 'Your's Stalin' Set aside Madras HC's July 31 interim order restraining use of names of political personalities in any govt scheme.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123151296,imgsize-1701173,width-400,resizemode-4/123151296.jpg"

A dedicated helpline has also been set up to address grievances raised by boards.Going by the information shared by the ministry at the time of portal’s launch on June 6, it is estimated that there are over 9 lakh waqf properties in India. It was shared then that the central waqf portal will follow a three-tier verification system comprising the ‘maker-checker-approver’. After a mutawalli enters property details as the ‘maker’, it will be followed by validation by waqf board officials and approval by the designated govt authority after verification of records to enable its entry into the ‘Umeed’ portal.The 663 ‘makers’, who have initiated the process of uploading details, include 193 are from Odisha, 102 from Uttarakhand and 69 from Andhra Pradesh. No makers have initiated the process in Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Sikkim, Goa, Ladakh and Lakshadweep.Of those who have submitted details — 27 are from Himachal Pradesh. 11 from Odisha, five from Manipur, four from Andhra Pradesh, three each from Rajasthan and Punjab, two from Uttarakhand and one each from UP, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Delhi.“About 140 grievances/suggestions have been received from across the country as on July 28 and their resolutions have also been uploaded on the portal to help other boards to understand and handle the portal’s functioning effectively,” Rijiju said.The ministry has also advised establishment of Project Management Units (PMUs) at the Central, state/UT, Waqf board, and district levels to ensure that the details of all properties are uploaded on the Portal.","Only 69 ‘makers of waqf’ have submitted details of property on the website.

Doubtful conduct of an accused not enough for conviction: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doubtful-conduct-of-an-accused-not-enough-for-conviction-sc/articleshow/123150746.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that the doubtful conduct of an accused cannot be the sole criterion to convict him if there is no other evidence to prove his involvement in a crime and acquitted a murder convict who was sentenced to life imprisonment.Setting aside the trial court and high court's order of conviction, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said: ""In this context, we deem it necessary to sound a note of caution. While the conduct of an accused may be a relevant fact under Section 8 of Indian Evidence Act, it cannot, by itself, serve as the sole basis for conviction, especially in a grave charge such as murder. Like any other piece of evidence, the conduct of the accused is merely one of the circumstances the court may consider, in conjunction with other direct or circumstantial evidence on record. To put it succinctly, although relevant, the accused's conduct alone cannot justify a conviction in the absence of cogent and credible supporting evidence"".The trial court and Chhattisgarh high court had relied on the conduct of the accused, who had allegedly approached the police and lodged an FIR admitting that he committed the offence, to pronounce him guilty.But the apex court said an FIR of a confessional nature lodged by an accused person is inadmissible as evidence against him, except to the extent that it shows he made a statement soon after the offence, thereby identifying him as the maker of the report, which is admissible as evidence of his conduct under the Act.""Additionally, any information furnished by him that leads to the discovery of a fact is admissible under Section 27 of the Act. However, a non-confessional FIR is admissible against the accused as an admission under Section 21 of the Act and is relevant,"" the bench said.The prosecution told the bench that the accused himself had gone to the police station and lodged the FIR and he also led the investigating officer and the panchnama witnesses to a place where he had kept the clothes worn by him during the incident. These were enough to convict him, it submitted.The bench, however, rejected the plea and said, ""The legal position, therefore, is this - a statement contained in the FIR furnished by one of the accused in the case cannot, in any manner, be used against another accused. Even against the accused who made it, the statement cannot be used if it is inculpatory in nature nor can it be used for the purpose of corroboration or contradiction unless its maker offers himself as a witness in the trial. The very limited use of it is, as an admission under Section 21 of the Act, against its maker alone, and only if the admission does not amount to a confession"".","The trial court and Chhattisgarh high court had relied on the conduct of the accused, who had allegedly approached the police and lodged an FIR admitting that he committed the offence.

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court's Jalpaiguri circuit bench has commuted the death sentence of 22-year-old Aftab Alam to life imprisonment without parole for 20 years, ruling that justice must not be ""bloodthirsty"" and punishment should focus on reform, not revenge.Aftab had been convicted of murdering his maternal uncle Mehtab during a robbery attempt at the victim's Dhupguri home in north Bengal on July 28, 2023. The trial court sentenced him to death, calling his act a ""betrayal"" against the man who had sheltered him after his father's death.But Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Uday Kumar said in a 47-page ruling issued Aug 1 the trial court relied ""more on emotion than facts"" and failed to prove that Aftab's conduct met the ""rarest of rare"" threshold required for capital punishment. ""The recent alteration in the names of jails from 'prisons' to 'correctional homes' is for a reason,"" the bench wrote. ""It reflects the transition from the basic bloodthirsty instinct of society to take revenge to a more civilised policy. .. One should hate the offence and not the offender.""HC said Aftab had not lived with his uncle for years, having moved to New Delhi before returning to Dhupguri. ""The 'position of trust' approach cannot be applied,"" the judges wrote, adding that the trial judge's assumptions about betrayal lacked evidence.""At the time of the offence, the appellant was long gone from the shelter of his uncle and was no longer under his tutelage.""Mehtab was stabbed to death in his sleep while wife Moumita survived the attack. Aftab was joined by five alleged co-accused, all minors. The court said the killing appeared to be ""a spontaneous reaction"" rather than a premeditated act of vengeance, citing the use of Aftab's Aadhaar card to check into a hotel nearby before the robbery.Rejecting the trial court's claim that Aftab was a ""veteran criminal"", the bench said his actions showed ""unprofessionalism"" typical of immature offenders. ""Lack of remorse in gestures & postures of the accused at trial cannot be an indicator that he cannot be reformed,"" the court said.","Calcutta high court's Jalpaiguri circuit bench commuted the death sentence of 22-year-old Aftab Alam to life imprisonment without parole for 20 years.

"Tackling untouchables: IISc patents tech to deal with MLPs, textile waste",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tackling-untouchables-iisc-patents-tech-to-deal-with-mlps-textile-waste/articleshow/123150650.cms,"BENGALURU: In the global battle against waste, two streams stand out for their notorious resistance to recycling: multi-layered plastics (MLPs) and synthetic textiles. Dubbed “untouchables” in the recycling world, these materials are complex, chemically diverse, and largely destined for landfills or incineration.But a new technology developed at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) may offer a viable and scalable path forward. The breakthrough comes in the form of “SaLSO”, short for Solvent-Assisted Layer Selective Opening, a patented process created by Prof Suryasarathi Bose and his team at IISc’s department of materials engineering.Used extensively in packaging (like potato chips) for their barrier properties and durability, MLPs are nearly impossible to recycle due to their mixed composition. At the same time, synthetic textile waste from polyester-based and nylon-based clothing continues to swell landfills and leach microplastics into ecosystems.“Together, MLPs and synthetic textiles represent a mounting global challenge. MLPs alone form a market worth over $168 billion, while the textile industry generates more than 92 million tonnes of waste each year, a significant chunk of it synthetic. Recycling efforts have struggled to keep pace, hamstrung by technical and chemical limitations,” the researchers pointed out.The new patent builds on earlier work by the team — which has been reported — where SaLSO was tried on Polyurethane and Epoxy, and found to be efficient in transforming those difficult to recycle materials.In the current process that has been granted a patent, SaLSO separates the individual components of complex plastic and textile waste streams, allowing each material to be recovered and reused in high-value applications. “It’s a solution that’s not just technically impressive but also environmentally sound. It is a game-changer. We’ve developed a process that works on materials considered unrecyclable — category-7 plastics, mixed polyester textiles —and turns them into usable, upcycled products,” Bose told TOI.His co-researchers, Indranil Dey, Ashish and Siddharth, echoed the sentiment, adding that SaLSO could play a catalytic role in scaling up circular economy solutions across sectors that currently have limited recycling pathways.What makes SaLSO remarkable is its simplicity and sustainability. The process uses only seawater and bio-acids — naturally occurring and even edible chemicals — to separate polymers like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from complex waste matrices.The result? A recovery yield of more than 99%, achieved without toxic solvents, high temperatures, or energy-intensive steps.In lab trials, the team processed a variety of real-world waste, including snack packets with aluminum linings and flour bags, using a reactor that currently handles about 500 grams of MLP per batch. While small-scale now, the system is designed for easy scale-up to industrial capacities.The extracted polymers are not just recycled, they are upcycled. “...The feedstock produced can enhance the performance of lower-quality plastics, creating stronger, more durable materials without adding virgin polymers or fillers. And the applications go far beyond theory,” Bose added.With industrial trials in the pipeline and conversations ongoing with potential partners, IISc hopes to bring SaLSO to market soon. If widely adopted, the technology could radically expand the boundaries of what’s considered recyclable, bringing circular economy principles to industries that have long lacked them.","Multi-layered plastics (MLPs) and synthetic textiles are notoriously difficult to recycle.

Rajouri-based organisation Al-Huda Educational Trust — an alleged front for JeI’s illegal transactions — was named the fourth accused.JeI was first declared a banned organisation by Indian govt in Feb 28, 2019, for its activities against the security, integrity and sovereignty of the Union of India. On Feb 27, 2024, the prohibition for the “unlawful association” was extended for five more years under UAPA Section 3(1).According to the prosecution, Amir Mohammad Shamsi, who had earlier served as JeI’s Amir-e-Jila in Rajouri, conspired with Abdul Hamid Ganai, then Amir-e-Jamaat of the outfit, to collect funds through Al-Huda Educational Trust despite JeI having been declared a proscribed association in Feb 2019.“Witness statements and financial documents revealed that Shamsi received Rs 1.8 lakh from Mushtaq Ahmad Mir, a Pakistan-based terrorist affiliated with Hizbul Mujahideen, and disbursed Rs 1 lakh to Ganai for furtherance of separatist activities,” the prosecution informed the court.Special NIA judge Sandeep Gandotra noted that while disclosure statements recorded before executive magistrates were inadmissible, independent evidence — including statements of trustees and local donors under CrPC Section 164 — substantiated the prosecution’s case. The court held that cumulative evidence, including trust deeds, money transfers, and corroborative witness testimonies, justified the framing of charges under IPC Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) and UAPA Sections 10, 13, 20, 22C, 38, and 39.Meanwhile, proceedings under CrPC Section 512 have been initiated against fugitive accused Mir, who is believed to be operating from Pakistan.","The accused are Amir Mohammad Shamsi, Abdul Hamid Ganai and Mushtaq Ahmad Mir.

The CM said in his letter that a bill should be brought in the current session of Parliament for restoration of statehood.“The restoration must not be viewed as a concession but as an essential course correction, one that prevents us from sliding down a dangerous and slippery slope where the statehood of our constituent states is no longer regarded as a foundational and sacred constitutional right but reduced instead to a discretionary favour bestowed at the will of the central govt,” Omar wrote in his letter.On Aug 5, 2019 the Centre had nullified the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution and reorganised J&K state into two Union Territories — J&K UT and Ladakh UT. The Supreme Court had on Dec 11, 2023 upheld govt’s decision nullifying Article 370 but had observed that J&K’s statehood should be restored as soon as possible.National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah supported Omar’s letter, saying Congress has convened a meeting of all opposition leaders in New Delhi on Thursday and that he would discuss the issue there.The opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) welcomed Omar’s letter “for a collective push toward restoring statehood to J&K”.However, PDP said it was concerned about the “selective focus on statehood”. “The party wholeheartedly supports the call for statehood and stands ready to back any meaningful initiative that fulfils promises made to the people in Parliament, public forums, and before the Supreme Court, but it is disheartening to see that NC, under CM Omar Abdullah’s leadership, has not demonstrated equal urgency or clarity on the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status,” PDP said.Dr Abdullah dismissed PDP’s concerns and said it was PDP that had brought BJP to J&K by allying with it in 2015.Omar argued in his letter that federalism is anchored in the recognition of a state’s right to exist and function with dignity, autonomy, and constitutional protection. “If the Union were to assume and exercise the unilateral authority to downgrade a state to a UT, regardless of the justification it would mark a fundamental departure from the constitutional scheme. The circumstances may vary, but the precedent it sets is profound and unsettling. This is a constitutional red line, one that must never be crossed,” the letter said.“It (statehood to J&K) is an issue that goes beyond regional interests and touches the very core of India's constitutional values and democratic ethos. The act of reducing J&K from a state to a Union Territory in 2019 and the prolonged delay in restoring its status as a full state, you would agree, has profound implications for the future of Indian polity.”On July 16, senior Congress politicians Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi had written a joint letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressing for restoration of J&K’s statehood and had urged govt to introduce legislation in the current Monsoon Session of Parliament to restore statehood to J&K and grant constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule to the UT of Ladakh.","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has written to all national parties, including BJP, asking for restoration of statehood to J&K.

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh STF gunned down dreaded mafia criminal Ashish Ranjan alias Chhotu Singh, a resident of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, in an encounter near Shivrajpur Chauraha under Shankargarh police station limits in Prayagraj in the wee hours of Thursday.Ashish, wanted in at least four high-profile murder cases, including that of gangster Aman Singh, opened fire with an AK-47 rifle and a 9mm pistol at the STF team, prompting retaliatory action in which he was critically injured and later declared dead, said Additional DG, law and order, Amitabh Yash.ADG Yash said that acting on a tip-off that Ashish was en route to Prayagraj to possibly execute a major criminal plot with an associate, the STF laid a trap near Shivrajpur.“When intercepted, Ashish fired at the police team with lethal intent. STF officers JP Rai, Prabhanjan, and Rohit narrowly escaped bullets. In self-defence, the STF retaliated, injuring Ashish, who was rushed to a nearby hospital but succumbed to injuries,” said ADG Yash.From the spot, police recovered a loaded AK-47, 9mm pistol, large cache of live cartridges and spent shells, and a motorcycle. A case under multiple sections, including attempt to murder and Arms Act, has been lodged, and further investigation is underway, the officer added.STF said that Ashish had a long criminal history and was the prime accused in three high-profile murder cases in Dhanbad, including, the murder of police informer and coal trader Neeraj Tiwari in Katras on September 5, 2021.

TCS Salary Hike: TCS to roll out hikes for majority of staff from Sept 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tcs-to-roll-out-hikes-for-majority-of-staff-from-sept-1/articleshow/123149301.cms,"



Bengaluru: TCS, which is planning to cut 2% of its workforce—over 12,000 mid and senior employees—this year, surprised its staff by announcing salary hikes for eligible associates up to grade C3A and equivalent (freshers to mid-level), covering nearly 80% of its workforce. This comes at a time when many of its peers have either deferred salary hikes or placed them on hold.The salary hike will be effective from Sept 1, according to an internal communication sent out by CHRO Milind Lakkad and CHRO-designate K Sudeep on Wednesday. When TOI reached out to TCS, the company said, ""We can confirm that we will be issuing wage hikes to around 80% of our employees effective Sept 1, 2025.""During the April earnings presser, TCS indicated that it might have to defer its annual increments, a rare deviation from its April cycle, coinciding with clients' downbeat sentiment emerging from a slowdown and tariff-related uncertainty. Even in the June quarter earnings, Lakkad said the company has not made any decision yet regarding wage hikes. TCS's June quarter results reflected lacklustre performance attributed to weak macroeconomic conditions, cautious client sentiment, delayed decision-making, and the winding down of the BSNL deal. Its revenue for the June quarter fell 3.1% year-on-year in constant currency and 3.3% sequentially, as geopolitical uncertainties dampened demand.Last year, TCS implemented salary hikes ranging from 4.5% to 7% for its associates, with high performers receiving double-digit increases. However, the company has not disclosed the average hike in its communication. News of this year's salary increase comes amid a challenging period marked by cautious client spending and delayed decisions in key markets like the US and Europe. Nevertheless, the company remains optimistic about a turnaround, anticipating stronger demand in the second half of the year.Indian IT CEOs have adopted a cautious tone in their commentary on wage hikes. When TOI asked Infosys CEO Salil Parekh about the timelines for wage hikes, he said, ""We concluded our compensation increases for Q4 and Q1 of the last fiscal year….Now that this cycle is complete, we are beginning to evaluate the timing for the next round—as we do after every cycle. During Covid, the standard cycle was disrupted, leading to two increases over 18 months. There are no changes planned. We will stick with our existing process and announce the next cycle at the right time.""","TCS announced salary hikes for eligible associates up to grade C3A and equivalent (freshers to mid-level) This comes at a time when many of its peers have either deferred salary hikes or placed them on hold.

Indians Outrage in Dublin After Vicious Attack on Amazon Techie, Demand for Justice in Ireland





: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe.We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.","A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals in Ireland.

A representative from the group confronted Nisarg at a grocery store and released the video of the entire encounter. Nisarg, in the video, admitted that he felt horrible about what he did and what he was going to do.""I need to maybe get help or something,"" he said in the video, though the person confronting him was not convinced that Nisarg was genuinely repentant or whether he was just scared that he got caught.The group has now revealed the detailed chats, as Nisarg was not arrested at the scene, though two patrol vehicles from San Diego Police Department arrived at the scene. They told the activist that since the group that caught Nisarg was not law enforcement, Nisarg could not be arrested based on their claim but his phone would be checked and his engagement with an alleged minor would be investigated.In the chats, released by People v Preds, Nisarg and the activist posing as a 14-year-old exchanged messages on August 2. The activist asked Nisarg if he had engaged with someone of his age before.The conversation went on with the activist asking Nisarg for a photo of him before he caught him at the grocery store where Nisarg apparently came to buy lube to use it later on the 14-year-old he thought he was chatting with.After he was taken by the San Diego Police for interrogation, he denied all the allegations and he was let off as no charges were framed against him.The University of California also came under fire for not immediately suspending the professor.

‘People were sold a lie’: Oceangate whistleblower warned of Titan risks before 2023 implosion; was aware ‘there would be an incident’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/people-were-sold-a-lie-oceangate-whistleblower-warned-of-titan-risks-before-2023-implosion-was-aware-there-would-be-an-incident/articleshow/123154417.cms,"AP file photo





David Lochridge, a former employee of Oceangate, has reiterated longstanding safety concerns following the release of a US Coast Guard report that identifies significant failures by the company as the primary cause of the 2023 Titan submersible disaster.""I always hoped that what happened wouldn't happen. But I just knew if they kept carrying on the way they were going and with that deficient equipment, then there would be an incident,"" Lochridge was quoted as saying by the BBC.""There is so much that could have been done differently. From the initial design, to the build, to the operations - people were sold a lie,"" he said.OceanGate was developing a new submersible designed to take paying passengers to the site of the Titanic wreck. However, in June 2023, the vessel tragically imploded during a dive, killing all five people on board, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.The whistleblower was dismissed by OceanGate in 2018 after raising concerns about safety issues related to the submersible. He had joined the company seven years prior as its director of Marine Operations.""As the director of marine operations, I'm the one responsible for everybody,"" he said, reported the BBC.""I was responsible for the safety of all Oceangate personnel and all of the passengers that were going to be coming in the sub.""As chief pilot, his duties involved planning dives and personally operating the submersible, taking passengers 3,800 meters below the surface to view the Titanic. Ensuring safety was a central part of his role.The submersible that would later be named Titan was initially developed in collaboration with the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), with plans to construct its passenger hull with carbon fibre, a material that is not used for deep-diving subs, which typically rely on titanium or steel.Despite initially trusting the expertise of the APL team, Lochridge’s confidence began to wane by mid-2016 as OceanGate ended its partnership with APL and moved the design and construction of Titan in-house.""At that point, I started asking questions… and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,"" said Lochridge. ""When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,” he added, noting visible flaws in the material.Lochridge was called to a meeting with Rush and other Oceangate employees after he submitted a report listing out the issues he was seeing.""I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do,” Rush said in the meeting in response to Lochridge raising safety concerns, reports the BBC.Lochridge contacted the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which deemed his case urgent due to public safety risks and placed him under its whistleblower protection program. OSHA forwarded concerns to the US Coast Guard in February 2018.By July 2018, OceanGate sued Lochridge and his wife, alleging breach of contract and other claims. He responded with a countersuit for unfair dismissal. But by December 2018, they decided to drop the case.OceanGate pressed ahead with its plans to reach the Titanic at full speed.","David Lochridge, a former employee of Oceangate, has reiterated longstanding safety concerns.

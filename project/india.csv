""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA, he said he is “back in NDA for good” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124732757,imgsize-896340,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-70.jpg"

Pm Modi Responds To Trump's Diwali Message, Emphasizes Partnership And Shared Values

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on early Wednesday thanked US President Donald Trump for his phone call and warm Diwali greetings.

Why solar-powered prosperity in Thar desert is a mixed blessing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-solar-powered-prosperity-in-thar-desert-is-a-mixed-blessing/articleshow/124731664.cms,"Rajasthan’s Thar desert is glowing with solar panels, powering India’s clean energy dreams. But behind the boom lies a quieter story that goes unsaid — of vanishing camels, felled khejri trees, and fading pastoral life

Solar rush, sore communities

Fight for land and beyond

Economy’s leap, ecology’s slide

Oil, cement, solar, rising incomes

Balancing sun and sand

The Thar desert is dancing, but not to the tune it once knew. Ever since Barmer struck oil in 2004, the desert was catapulted from obscurity to the frontline of India’s energy story. Solar fields — in neat military lines — sprawl where flocks once grazed, and a Rs 80,000-crore crude refinery waits in the wings. Jaisalmer, once a sepiatinted tourist postcard of camels and its famous fort, is adding cement to its desert identity. Prosperity has found a new postcode, dragging people from the margins to the mainstream.Yet, beneath the sheen of progress, another story simmers: of cultural identity of its people and centuries-old pastoral traditions fading, camels and sheep disappearing, vital khejri trees falling to the axe, and the fragile biodiversity fraying. The region is at a crossroads, caught between progress and preservation, megawatts and memories.In Jodhpur’s Bhadla panchayat, Sadar Khan recalls when the 25,000 acres of govt land around his village were still pasturelands — grazing grounds for sheep, goats and cows. That changed in 2014, when the govt carved out 14,000 acres for a mega solar park. “I had 250 animals once. With no pastures left, I had to sell. The few I keep now are only to remember who we were,” he says, pointing out to the blue sea of solar panels that occupy the horizon.But the development has been lopsided, says Khan. “The park brought in investment of about Rs 10,000 crore, but we do not have a doctor, nor a school offering classes beyond class 8,” he says.Solar plants have also mushroomed across Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Barmer. For investors, it’s a dream run: secure a power purchase agreement (PPA) for 25 years, instal panels, and enjoy stable returns without much operational hassle. For villagers, it has meant leasing out one-crop or unproductive land for Rs 30,000 an acre, annually. But there are hidden costs. Lakhs of khejri trees were felled, ponds and sacred groves levelled, and grazing lands erased.For men like Sumer Singh Bhati and his community of herders and farmers, this is not just land, it is also identity. Supported by thousands from Jaisalmer, Barmer, and Bikaner, Bhati has rallied against the large-scale diversion of pastureland and sacred groves — “orans”, in local parlance. “We are not against development, but against the erasure of our ecosystem and culture,” Bhati says. On Sept 26, nearly 15,000 villagers marched in protest, with a sit-in at the Jaisalmer collectorate. The struggle is about ‘ jeevika ’ (livelihood) and ‘ pehchaan ’ (identity), Bhati says. The protest was called off on Oct 19 after the govt assured the protesters that 8,000 acres of community forest land would be notified and safeguarded from destruction, with no allocation for solar or cement projects. However, Bhati said they had also submitted a separate proposal seeking protection for an additional 80,000 acres of community forests, which remains pending at the collectorate level. “We will resume our protest if the 8,000 acres are not formally declared as a protected area,” he said.The desert economy once revolved around livestock — camels, cattle and sheep. But their numbers are dwindling rapidly. The 2019 livestock census showed a 13% fall in sheep and a 35% decline in camels. Professor Anil Kumar Chhangani of Bikaner’s Maharaja Ganga Singh University warned the numbers today would be far worse. “If the census were to be conducted today, the numbers could be appalling. Besides the rapidly falling animal population, about 25 lakh khejri, ker, kumta, jal and rohida trees — central to the Thar desert’s biodiversity — have been felled,” Chhangani claims.The last known census of khejri trees ( Prosopis cineraria ), Rajasthan’s state tree, was conducted by the Central Arid Zone Research Institute in 2015. This study across 12 dry districts, such as Jodhpur and Nagaur, found the density had fallen to fewer than 35 trees per hectare from about 90 in the 1950s and 60s. The institute attributed the decline to groundwater overuse, fungal attacks, and land development.Recently, Bikaner’s master plan has proposed to convert 27,000 bighas (625 acres) of pastureland into commercial and residential use. “Pastures are oxygen for animals, birds, reptiles, and people. Sacrificing them is ecological suicide,” Chhangani cautions.Barmer was once dreaded as a ‘Kala Pani’ posting for officials. Today, oil and thermal power have turned it into an emerging economic frontier.Its per capita income — Rs 1.5 lakh per annum in 2023-24 — doubled in the past five years, nearing the state average of Rs 1.7 lakh. Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Jodhpur, too, boast incomes above the state average. Besides being home to large-scale solar and wind farms, Jaisalmer has recently attracted investment of Rs 18,000 crore in the cement sector, spanning seven plants. In Pachpadra, a Rs 80,000-crore refinery is set to start commercial operation, promising to change the region’s future forever. With 40GW (1 gigawatt = 1,000MW) of solar plants already installed and another 50GW planned, much of it in the desert region, Thar’s development is reaching for the skies, promising more prosperity.Rajasthan accounts for India’s largest solar power capacity, at 20%. It is critical to the country’s global climate commitments, and the target of 500GW by 2030. But the question is not whether solar is important, it is about saving the desert’s soul: its trees, animals, and the pastoral life it is proud of.Chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma promises to plant 10 saplings for every khejri tree that is felled. But people like Bhati and Khan dismiss it as tokenism. Replanting cannot replace centuries-old groves or restore lost pastures, they say.","Rajasthan’s Thar desert is glowing with solar panels.

"‘Harappan site’s trade infrastructure predates Silk Route by 2,000 years’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/harappan-sites-trade-infrastructure-predates-silk-route-by-2000-yrs/articleshow/124731242.cms,"PUNE: Bronze Age traders crossing Gujarat stopped at well-organised roadside facilities that offered shelter, food, security and stables for their pack animals.A new multidisciplinary study by Pune-based Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts, and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, published in L’Anthropologie (Elsevier, 2025), has identified a 4,000-year-old Harappan settlement at Kotada Bhadli in Kutch as the earliest known caravanserai — a fortified rural stopover that supported long-distance trade between 2300 and 1900 BCE. The findings now push back the origins of organised trade infrastructure in the subcontinent by over 2,000 years.Lead researcher Prabodh Shirvalkar from Deccan College told TOI: “This is the first confirmed archaeological evidence of a caravanserai in the Harappan world — a type of infrastructure previously known only from later historical periods.”Excavated between 2010 and 2013 in collaboration with Gujarat State Archaeology Department, the site has now been reinterpreted using advanced techniques— including ground penetrating radar, magnetic and satellite surveys, isotopic and lipid analyses, and three forms of dating, Shirvalkar added.Researchers, including Esha Prasad and Yadubirsingh Rawat, said the finding bridges a key missing link in the trade mechanism of the Indus Valley Civilization, revealing how long-distance overland trade was supported by an organised system of rest stops and logistical hubs — a structure previously thought to have emerged only in the early historic or medieval periods.While the existence of Harappan trade with Mesopotamia and inland India is well-established, the mechanism of how merchants, animals and goods actually moved across land remained unclear.The new study proposes that Harappan commerce depended on a network of small fortified stopovers, strategically placed along trade routes between urban centres like Dholavira, Lothal and Shikarpur in Gujarat.Earlier excavations revealed a multi-roomed central building, fortified walls with bastions, and large open spaces that were likely used to hold animals and goods — all consistent with a caravanserai’s layout.Shirvalkar added that the site was small, strategically placed and fortified, but non-urban — designed for short halts rather than permanent residence. By identifying caravanserai-like traits — fortification, animal pens, open spaces, food waste and imported goods — the paper said that Harappans maintained an organised trade infrastructure two millennia before the Silk Route “The Harappan economy was not just about city markets and ports like Dholavira or Lothal. It had a logistical backbone. Caravanserais that sustained traders on long inland routes,” Shirvalkar said.","A 4,000-year-old Harappan settlement at Kotada Bhadli in Kutch is the earliest known caravanserai.

NEW DELHI: As residents across the national capital celebrated Diwali with fireworks on Monday night, Delhi's air quality took a sharp hit, with the majority of monitoring stations entering the 'red zone'.Although the Supreme Court had permitted the use of green firecrackers between 8 pm and 10 pm on the festival day, celebrations continued well beyond the allotted hours.Data showed that 36 out of 38 monitoring stations recorded pollution levels in the 'red zone', indicating 'very poor' to 'severe' air quality across the city.Morning visuals on Tuesday reveal Akshardham, partially obscured by haze. Stage II (GRAP-2) measures are in effect across Delhi-NCR.By 10 pm, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was classified as 'very poor' at 344, with four stations reporting 'severe' levels above 400. According to the SAMEER app developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the worst-hit areas were Dwarka (417), Ashok Vihar (404), Wazirpur (423), and Anand Vihar (404).The city’s 24-hour average AQI, reported daily at 4 pm, also remained in the 'very poor' category at 345, higher than Sunday’s 326, according to official data.In the afternoon, 31 stations recorded 'very poor' air quality, while three fell under the 'severe' zone.Authorities warned that air quality is likely to deteriorate further, slipping into the 'severe' category more broadly on Tuesday and Wednesday.The CPCB categorises AQI between 0 and 50 as 'good', 51 and 100 as 'satisfactory', 101 to 200 as 'moderate', 201 to 300 as 'poor', 301 to 400 as 'very poor', and 401 to 500 as 'severe.'Transport emissions contributed 15.6 per cent to Delhi's pollution on Monday, while other sources, including industries, accounted for 23.3 per cent, data from the Decision Support System (DSS) showed.On Sunday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR. The decision followed a review by the GRAP sub-committee on Saturday and forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).Earlier, on October 15, the Supreme Court had allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR between 6 am and 7 pm, and again from 8 pm to 10 pm on Diwali eve and the day of the festival.Residents of Delhi reported breathing difficulties and eye irritation following a surge in air pollution after Diwali celebrations.Speaking to media, Sagar, a resident of the national capital, held people accountable for the dip in air quality.He said, ""Pollution hasn't just been increasing today; it's been increasing for years. Everyone blames politicians, but the people themselves are like this. People aren't improving themselves. You'll get firecrackers, but it's up to you whether to burst them or not. Then they'll complain that the government isn't doing anything. There are problems in breathing, irritation in eyes.""Ashish Ranjan, a local who came to Kartavya Path for running, also complained about the breathing difficulties. He said, ""There are difficulties in breathing during running time. I cannot breather properly.""","36 out of 38 monitoring stations recorded pollution levels in the'red zone', indicating'very poor' to'severe' air quality.

NEW DELHI: When the air quality station at RK Puram reached peak PM2.5 levels of 1,476 micrograms per cubic metre around midnight, its real-time hourly data went missing from Delhi Pollution Control Committee's website for five hours. The data was available again from 6am, showing a downward trend at 1,187ug/m3, followed by 1,064ug/m3 at 7am.Experts alleged that several stations of DPCC, Central Pollution Control Board and India Meteorological Department stopped showing hourly data after PM10 and PM2.5 levels were close to crossing the 1,000 mark around midnight. They claimed that due to the data gaps, the 24-hour average readings of some stations were skewed. Most stations saw a spike in pollution levels around midnight.At Nehru Nagar, the most polluted station on the Diwali night, the highest hourly PM2.5 concentration was 1,763ug/m3 at 10pm. However, the hourly data for 11pm is unavailable. The station also recorded data gaps from 1am to 5am.Similarly, CPCB's ITO station recorded hourly PM2.5 levels of 923ug/m3 at 1am on Tuesday and 967 at 7am. However, the data is missing for six hours in between.At NSIT Dwarka station of CPCB, PM10 readings were unavailable from 12am to 5am. At 6am, PM10 levels touched 817ug/m3, but data was again unavailable for three hours during the day.Things were no different at IMD's Ayanagar, where hourly PM10 data was missing for five hours while PM2.5 levels were unavailable from 2am to 4am.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said many stations blanked out on Monday night. This is not an issue with stations run by one monitoring agency; all four agencies, IITM, IMD, DPCC and CPCB, faced this issue, he pointed out.""The observed pattern shows that most stations stopped providing data when they approached 1,000ug/m3 while there were stations such as Anand Vihar, Nehru Nagar, Mundka, etc. that recorded values above 1,000ug/m3, indicating that the technology of monitoring isn't an issue, at least in terms of being available. This is not the first time that the stations have stopped providing data; we have observed this over the past years too,"" said Dahiya.He added that if some stations couldn't monitor beyond a certain limit, these stations should be upgraded to the similar technology as Anand Vihar and Nehru Nagar. If the issue was manual, it should be investigated and shouldn't be repeated in the future. ""Such missing data hampers data-driven insights, understanding the contribution of certain activities, their impact on health as well as skews the daily pollution level recordings, giving a false sense of lower air pollution levels,"" Dahiya emphasised.Activist Bhavreen Kandhari said data gaps during high pollution hours meant ""we are losing sight exactly when it matters most"". She pointed out, ""Transparency in air quality monitoring must be treated as a public health imperative, not an option.""Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, claimed, ""All data is available on CPCB and DPCC, there is no missing data. You have to check."" Hinting at AAP, which also raised the issue, he said, ""Those who are saying there is missing data, you know what their intentions are.""CPCB, DPCC, Commission for Air Quality Management and IMD did not reply to TOI's queries on missing data.","Air quality station at RK Puram reached peak PM2.5 levels of 1,476 micrograms per cubic metre around midnight. Its real-time hourly data went missing from Delhi Pollution Control Committee's website for five hours. Data was available again from 6am, showing a downward trend at 1,187ug/m3.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124731838,imgsize-79392,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/air-pollution-in-delhi.jpg"

Poll Do you think the political situation in Bihar will improve before the elections? Yes, there's potential for improvement No, it will likely worsen

Dissent rules, both in INDIA bloc and NDA



PATNA: Just a fortnight before the first phase of polling in Bihar, partners in the INDIA bloc, which seemed to be in a disarray till Sunday, appeared going into the damage-control mode on Monday with some withdrawing candidates against each other on certain seats. RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies. It dropped 31 MLAs and nominated new candidates. Congress has fielded candidates for 61 seats, while the Left comprising the CPI-ML, CPI and CPM announced its list of 30. On the other hand, the VIP led by former minister Mukesh Sahani has come up with its list of 15 candidates, which means the INDIA bloc partners still have some friendly contests on at least six seats.Opposition bloc leaders said they were hoping the clouds of uncertainty would clear by Oct 23, the last date of withdrawal of candidature for the second phase.Significantly, JMM withdrew from the Bihar contest after a stalemate over their seat-sharing deal with INDIA bloc. “Unfortunately, JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls despite my intentions and plans. This is only because of RJD’s ‘political’ immaturity. Congress should have mediated to accommodate JMM, but we are sorry to say that it too did nothing,” said senior JMM legislator and state urban development minister Sudivya Kumar.There was consensus in INDIA bloc over the CM face till Monday night. Despite RJD being the largest bloc with 143 seats to its share, Congress has so far refrained from announcing Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face although he is the coordination committee chairman. Also, INDIA bloc members have not come together in a show of unity for a long time and have been speaking through the media only, adding to confusion in the opposition bloc.In seat-sharing, things looked moving in some direction when RJD didn’t announce its candidate from Kutumba seat against Congress candidate and party’s state chief Rajesh Kumar. RJD had earlier announced it would field its candidate from this seat after the conflict intensified between the two partners, in alliance for the past 35 years.On the other hand, Congress candidate Aditya Kumar withdrew his nomination from Lalganj seat on Monday, in a relief to RJD nominee. RJD had fielded Shivani Shukla, daughter of jailed strongman Munna Shukla, from this seat.In another development, VIP candidate Sakaldeo Bind withdrew his candidature from Tarapur seat in favour of RJD candidate. A visibly annoyed Bind soon resigned from the party and lent his support to BJP candidate and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, a VIP spokesperson said.“Things are moving in the right direction and the situation will be more clear by Oct 23, the last date for withdrawal of candidature,” Congress legislature party leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan said on Monday. However, another bloc partner CPI haven’t withdrawn candidates against Congress in three seats.Initially, JMM announced to go solo after seat talks failed but suddenly on Monday urban development minister Sudivya Kumar said, “JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls.” Kumar said, “Hemant Sorenji and JMM has always been following coalition dharma. Even when RJD had one MLA in 2019, we gave them seat in cabinet. Again now, we accommodated them. But what we got is deceit,” he said.Purnia MP Pappu Yadav, who earlier merged his party with Congress, asked the latter to break alliance with RJD on Monday, blaming the latter for not following “coalition dharma”.Things don’t look good in the rival NDA as well as former Union minister and BJP leader Raj Kumar Singh launched sharp attacks on his party for giving tickets to persons with criminal antecedents. He appealed to the people not to vote for opposition candidates such as Osama Shahab, son of RJD politician late Mohammad Anant Singh and RJD candidate from Mokama Veena Devi.","RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies.

Orsini had reportedly arrived in Delhi from Hong Kong before she was deported.“She was denied entry in line with the visa rules.

NEW DELHI: India restored its embassy in Kabul Tuesday, following the announcement during Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India that it would upgrade its technical mission to the level of embassy. As per the understanding reached between the 2 sides, India will designate the head of the mission in Kabul as chargé d'affaires, eventually appointing an ambassador, and the Taliban are expected to send 2 diplomats to New Delhi by November this year.The diplomats will work out of the Afghan embassy here, even in the absence of a formal recognition by India of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the name used by Taliban for Afghanistan. The elevation of diplomatic ties clears the path for expansion of economic cooperation between the 2 countries, allowing India to contribute more meaningfully to the development of Afghanistan, even as its position on recognition remains largely aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi’s unprecedented visit to India and the decision to ramp up diplomatic ties came in the middle of mounting tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan that saw deadly border skirmishes while Muttaqi was still in India.“In keeping with the decision announced during the recent visit of the Afghan Foreign Minister to India, the Government is restoring the status of the Technical Mission of India in Kabul to that of Embassy of India in Afghanistan with immediate effect,” said the Indian government in a statement, adding the decision underscored India’s resolve to deepen its bilateral engagement with the Afghan side in all spheres of mutual interest.The government also said that the embassy will further augment India’s contribution to Afghanistan’s comprehensive development, humanitarian assistance, and capacity-building initiatives, in line with the priorities and aspirations of Afghan society.India had shut its embassy after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in August, 2021. However, following security assurances from Kabul, India started to run a technical mission from the premises in June 2022, mainly to oversee distribution of Indian humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.The Taliban see Muttaqi’s visit as marking a new phase in the relationship. Significantly, both sides committed to respecting each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and, in a message to Pakistan, also unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from “regional countries”. Taliban’s backing of India’s sovereignty over J&K had also angered Pakistan, leading to lodging of a formal protest by Islamabad with Kabul.Earlier this week, the Taliban also dismissed Pakistani claims about India’s role in fomenting tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan as baseless and illogical.""These accusations are groundless. Our policy will never involve using our territory against other countries. We maintain relations with India as an independent nation and will strengthen those ties within the framework of our national interests,” said Afghanistan’s defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob. The 2 countries agreed to a ceasefire this week after talks in Doha.“At the same time, we will preserve our relations with Pakistan based on good neighborliness. Our aim is to expand relations, not create tensions. Pakistan’s accusations are unfounded, illogical, and unacceptable,” added the minister.Aligning with the global community on the issue of recognition for the Taliban government, India has also continued to raise issues related to the need for a more inclusive government in Afghanistan and respect for rights of women and children. Russia remains the only country to have formally recognised the government in Kabul, while others like China and Pakistan have accepted Taliban ambassadors and diplomats.","India restored its embassy in Kabul Tuesday, following the announcement during Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India.

KULLU: A 27-year-old Canadian paraglider died after crash-landing into the Dhauladhar mountains in Himachal Pradesh last week, while two foreign pilots were rescued from the upper reaches of Kangra and Kullu districts on Monday. In keeping with her wishes, Megan Elizabeth from Canada was cremated in Bir as per Hindu rituals on Tuesday.All three paragliders had taken off from the 8000-ft Bir-Billing site near Dharamshala, which draws adventure-seekers from across the world. Elizabeth took off at 9.45am Saturday (Oct 18), but was forced to crash-land below a rocky cliff in the Dhauladhar mountains, around 40km away, at an altitude of 4,000m (13,120ft).A search and rescue operation was launched as soon as Kangra administration was informed of the accident. A team from Billing Paragliding Association (BPA) carried out helicopter sorties in the Dhauladhar mountains and dropped its leader, Rahul Singh, near the site where Elizabeth had crash-landed on Saturday evening, as there was no space for landing a chopper. Singh was to find Elizabeth and help her survive until a full rescue team arrived, but he couldn’t locate her and spent the night on a cliffside.On Sunday morning, four more BPA team members were air-dropped, and they managed to locate her body.“Elizabeth was forced to crash-land either due to a sudden weather change or because of a problem with her glider. She used the reserve glider while crash-landing, but I guess she was flying at a low altitude and hit the rocks while landing. She sustained serious head injuries,” said BPA founder-director Suresh Thakur.BPA members carried Elizabeth’s body down for over 1,000m (nearly 3,300ft) until a chopper could airlift it to Kangra, where an autopsy was conducted. The two paragliders rescued Monday were Russian Nikita Vasiltsov and Austrian Jakob Krammer. Nikita (38) had crash-landed near Patalsu peak in Pir Panjal range near Manali, around 70km from where he took off, at an altitude of around 4,000m.Hundreds of ‘free flyers’ (solo pilots) from around the world gather in Bir-Billing in Oct every year, which is considered the best time for cross-country flights.

Opposition sources said Congress general secretary KC Venugopal held a discussion with Tejashwi, following which Gehlot, state in-charge Krishna Allavaru and RJD will hold talks on Wednesday.The state netas of ‘Mahagathbandhan’ alliance partners are likely to hold a press conference on Thursday to show a picture of unity ahead of launching the poll campaign. The urgency comes amid the disappointment over delayed finalisation of seat sharing in a difficult challenge of Bihar elections against the BJP-JDU combination.The Congress brass is learnt to be frustrated with RJD over the protracted seat-sharing process, with sources claiming that even Congress could not finalise its tickets till late because it did not know the seats that were coming its way. ‘“The process started two months ago,” a senior politician said. Also, Congress insiders are miffed at the way allies have been “treated“ by RJD. There is a regret that JMM has not been accommodated, “which should have been”, with sources pointing out that even VIP of Mukesh Sahani got its share after the intervention by the Congress brass.“The elder partner should have been accommodative of all allies to ensure a better chemistry and optics,” an opposition neta said.The “unaccommodative attitude” is being blamed for allies having fielded candidates against each other in around 10 seats, with Congress and RJD facing off against each other in four seats. However, sources said keen attempts are underway to completely remove or minimise the “friendly fights”.What is seen to have hurt the optics is the absence of a joint release of seat sharing and candidates, which has “undercut” the atmosphere created by a united statewide “Voter Adhikar Yatra” of allies headed by Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi.Now, the alliance is trying to reinvigorate the partnership by first holding a joint show of state leaders, followed by a joint campaign which will involve Rahul and other senior netas. The issue of announcing a CM candidate is another challenge. Congress netas said only one party, RJD, has a CM candidate, which is good enough as projection.They argue that leaving it unsaid would have fulfilled some “political objectives” but RJD’s insistence has created complications — hinting that the alliance may oblige RJD. “There should be a joint press conference soon by state netas, let’s see what happens there,” a senior neta said.Most minor allies have indicated that they have no reservations about an upfront projection of a chief ministerial candidate in the state.",Ashok Gehlot to meet RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav to resolve Bihar election-related issues.

"Charges against Sonam Wangchuk ‘flimsy, childish, baseless’: Wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/charges-against-sonam-wangchuk-flimsy-childish-baseless-wife/articleshow/124727934.cms,"SRINAGAR: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife Dr Gitanjali J Angmo submitted Tuesday a detailed representation to Ladakh administration , National Security Act (NSA) advisory board, and Union home ministry, calling the charges against her husband “flimsy, childish and baseless”.The representation responds to the NSA order issued on Sept 27 and the grounds of arrest dated Sept 28, following the Sept 24 police firing in Leh that left four people dead and over 70 wounded during violent protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.“We have stated that the accusations against Sonam Wangchuk, based on videos, are very flimsy. His video speeches have been taken out of context,” Angmo said. “The NSA charge sheet cites several videos, but we have provided full versions with subtitles and transcripts to show that the allegations are baseless.”Angmo, co-founder of Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh, said one of the videos cited by authorities was “grossly misinterpreted”. “In one clip, he refers to revolutions in Bangladesh and Nepal and Gen Z but clearly says ours should be peaceful. Authorities twisted this to claim he was calling for similar protests in Ladakh,” she said.Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike for Sixth Schedule safeguards and statehood on Sept 9, accusing Centre of delaying talks on Ladakh’s democratic rights. The home ministry had announced a new round of talks for Oct 6, but violence broke out on Sept 24, prompting him to break his fast. Authorities later arrested more than 70 people, including Wangchuk, who was subsequently moved to Jodhpur jail.Angmo said her husband’s case “is not about law and order but about silencing a voice that speaks for Ladakh’s people”.“NSA is meant for terrorists and smugglers,” Angmo said. “We have clearly stated that Sonam poses no threat, has never been a threat, and his arrest is an attempt to silence his voice and the peaceful movement for Ladakh’s statehood.”She questioned the timing and relevance of the charges. “The FIRs mentioned are old, and the videos are one year old. How can such videos incite a protest now?” she asked.She said 11 videos were listed, including unrelated ones. “For instance, during last year’s long march, Sonam was held briefly in New Delhi. When some youths in Ladakh observed a spontaneous bandh, it was attributed to him and his supporters. People love him — their actions were voluntary,” she said.According to Angmo, officials also misread Wangchuk’s remarks on the Ladakh Scouts. “They allege he demotivated the force in case of war with Pakistan or China.

Bihar Polls: RJD Announces Candidate List for Bihar Elections, 143 Contenders

Poll Did Nitish Kumar's behavior during the rally raise concerns for you? Yes, it was concerning. No, it was normal behavior.

NEW DELHI: RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav once again questioned chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s health and fitness to continue leading the state, sharing a video of him from a recent rally.Posting the clip on X, Tejashwi wrote, “If the chief minister is healthy, then why is he acting like this while reading a written speech?”The footage showed Nitish Kumar attempting to garland BJP candidate Rama Nishad during a rally, only to be stopped by JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha. The chief minister then handed the garland to Nishad, and as she accepted it, he placed it around her neck himself. Turning to Jha in apparent irritation, Nitish remarked, “.”In the same rally, Nitish Kumar had launched a pointed attack on his rival Lalu Prasad Yadav, accusing him of doing “nothing for women” during his tenure and installing his wife, Rabri Devi, as chief minister when he was forced to step down over the fodder scam. “Some people only cared about their own wives or their own families, but we work for the benefit of all people,” Nitish said, while highlighting the state government’s work for women’s empowerment over the past seven years.Also read: From ‘topi’ to tokenism: How Nitish Kumar’s coalition math redefined minority space Tejashwi, meanwhile, used the opportunity to renew his criticism of Nitish’s mental state, a line of attack he has pursued for months. In an earlier post, he had asked, “How does it feel to see the chief minister of a state in such a pathetic condition? Does the honourable chief minister appear mentally healthy to you while engaging in such bizarre antics?” He went on to allege that Nitish’s party, which he called the “special pawn of the BJP,” may have “deliberately put him in this state by feeding him prasad or other food items under some pretext. ”With Assembly elections approaching later this year, the RJD leader has sharpened his attacks, suggesting that Nitish’s behaviour raises serious questions about his ability to govern.","RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav shares video of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.

Bihar Assembly polls: Fewer Yadav candidates fielded by NDA as it looks to consolidate its core base,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-fewer-yadav-candidates-fielded-by-nda-as-it-looks-to-consolidate-its-core-base/articleshow/124728763.cms,"Nitish has fielded only 4 Muslims as against 11 in 2020



NEW DELHI: A push for social engineering in search of additional votes appears to have given way to the governing NDA focusing on consolidation of its traditional support base for the Bihar assembly polls. This turn is most telling in the significant cut in the number of Yadav candidates fielded by its two biggest constituents, BJP and JD(U).BJP has fielded only six Yadavs this time, as against 16 in 2020, while chief minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) has chosen eight candidates, as against 18 the last time. The choice of BJP’s replacements for some of its sitting Yadav MLAs points to its new gameplan: it has gone for a Kushwaha, the most populous OBC community after Yadavs; a Nishad, an increasingly assertive extremely backward classes group; and a Vaishya, the party's traditional supporter, for the Patna Sahib, Aurai and Munger seats, respectively.Since it was elected to office at the Centre in 2014 and emerged as the largest party in Bihar, ahead of RJD and JDU, BJP has tried to expand its support base. Overtures to Yadavs were part of the plan to broaden the tent.In both 2015 and 2020, it disregarded Yadavs’ staunch support for RJD to give them a sizeable number of tickets. The community has a population share of 14.2%; that is three times the number of Kushwahas (4.2%).However, the community, which along with Muslims forms the mainstay of Lalu Prasad-headed RJD, refused to leave his side. If anything, it rallied even more vigorously behind INDIA in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.RJD, the principal member of the opposition alliance, is trying to expand its formidable social coalition of Yadavs and Muslims by giving more tickets to candidates from other communities: something that represents a recognition that the powerful M-Y bloc is not adequate to end RJD’s two-decade-long exile from office. In contrast, BJP has decided to focus on preserving and rallying its more diverse and bigger core bloc of upper castes and a large section of non-Yadav OBCs, EBCs and Scheduled Castes. Ram Surat Rai, the sitting BJP MLA from Aurai who has been dropped this time, said Yadav lawmakers like him have borne the brunt of his party’s focus on its core votes as they were never seen as part of its social coalition.Rai was replaced by Rama Nishad, wife of former MP Ajay Nishad who had contested from Muzaffarpur on a Congress ticket after BJP denied him a Lok Sabha ticket in 2024. Nishads are seen as a swing bloc and wooed by RJD and its ally Mukesh Sahani of VIP. The party also dropped its seasoned lawmaker Nand Kishore Yadav, a seven-time winner and speaker in the outgoing assembly, in favour of Ratnesh Kushwaha from Patna Sahib.JDU, too, has followed a similar playbook. Seen as more vulnerable than BJP, it has fielded 25 candidates from Kurmi-Koeri (Kushwaha) castes and 22 each from upper castes and extremely backward classes.Nitish has this time fielded only four Muslims, as against 11 in 2020, in what is being seen as belated recognition that the community would prefer Lalu to him. A JDU functionary noted that all its Muslim candidates had lost last time, and the community has been vocal in its criticism of the party for siding with BJP in supporting amendments to the waqf law.BJP has named 49 candidates from upper castes and 52 from OBCs, EBCs and Dalits.A BJP functionary noted that both his party and JDU were contesting fewer seats (101 each) than the 110 and 115, respectively, they contested last time. “We had to drop many candidates. And members of some communities were easy choices as these groups are not much inclined to support our alliance,” the BJP neta added.","BJP has fielded only six Yadavs this time, as against 16 in 2020.

The next big wave in Indian dairy

India is a dairy nation, but paradoxically, one that struggles to digest it. Between 60–74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers, according to studies by the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) and market research agencies such as Grand View Research. That makes the country one of the largest pools of lactose-intolerant consumers anywhere in the world.Yet awareness remains startlingly low. Studies by Beanery Foods reveal that fewer than 30% of urban, middle- and upper-class consumers even recognise their own intolerance. This mismatch, widespread prevalence but low recognition, has left the market largely underserved.At present, just a handful of brands are trying to address this gap. Most offerings are niche, metro-focused, or priced at a premium. The result? The everyday Indian consumer, particularly in semi-urban areas, has little access to lactose-free options. And yet, the case for lactose-free is no longer about niche health needs. It is shaping up to be the next big dairy wave in India. It is now mainstream, lifestyle-driven, and powered by rising health consciousness.Medical and nutritional research consistently shows how deep-rooted this issue is. A landmark study by SGPGI Lucknow found that nearly 74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers. Broader estimates place prevalence between 60–66% of the population, with India ranking among the top globally for intolerance.The numbers vary regionally. In Delhi, an earlier multicentre study pegged prevalence at just 27.4%, a reflection of North India’s genetic history of dairy farming and relatively higher lactase persistence. By contrast, in southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh, intolerance rates soar to 66–82%. For a country where milk is both a staple and a cultural symbol, this presents a striking paradox. Dairy is central to the Indian diet, but difficult for most Indians to digest.Despite this vast prevalence, the lactose-free dairy market in India is still at a nascent stage. According to MarkNtel Advisors, the market is projected to grow at a 7% CAGR through 2027, with some segments expected to expand at up to 14.8% CAGR by 2030. And yet, most supermarket shelves in metros stock only two or three brands offering lactose-free variants. The products that do exist are often premium-priced, targeted at niche audiences, and concentrated in big cities. This leaves a clear gap for players who can bring innovation, affordability, and wider distribution to the category, especially into Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets where intolerance rates are high.The opportunity, however, is not confined to those with medical intolerance. A growing wave of health-conscious Indians is embracing lactose-free products as a lifestyle choice. Lactose-free milk is naturally sweeter and creamier because the enzyme lactase breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose, eliminating the need for added sugar while improving digestibility. This makes it attractive not only for daily consumption but also for indulgent formats such as flavoured milk, milkshakes, and desserts.The flavoured milk category is already booming, projected to grow at a 15.4% CAGR from 2024 to 2029, adding more than ₹6,000 crore in value. Similarly, the Indian milkshake market, valued at ₹7.6 billion in 2024, is forecast to reach ₹34.2 billion by 2033, growing at a robust 17.47% CAGR. For brands, this shift reframes lactose-free from a medical necessity into a mainstream lifestyle-driven category that promises both health and indulgence.The rise of no sugar and low sugar beverages in India dovetails perfectly with the lactose-free wave. In 2024, sales of no-sugar beverages doubled to ₹700–750 crore, now accounting for about 10% of the overall beverage market. Within dairy, however, the no-sugar ready-to-drink milkshake segment remains underserved. A few brands have launched protein shakes with zero sugar, but a comprehensive portfolio is missing. This creates space for lactose-free beverages sweetened with natural alternatives such as jaggery and dates, a preference that aligns with consumer demand for clean-label, functional indulgence. Government initiatives like the Eat Right India campaign further reinforce this trend by encouraging manufacturers to reduce refined sugar in foods and beverages.The profile of India’s lactose-free consumer is distinct. Unlike traditional dairy, where consumption cuts across all demographics, the early adopters here are younger, more urban, and more discerning. Millennials and Gen Z, especially those in the 25–30 age group, represent the highest consumption cohort. These are consumers who not only recognise the discomfort of lactose intolerance but also actively seek healthier, cleaner, and more functional options.Geographically, metros like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai are leading the trend, driven by exposure to global lifestyles and higher health awareness. But interestingly, the deeper potential lies in semi-urban South India, where lactose intolerance is more prevalent, with rates as high as 66–82% in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. West India, particularly Gujarat and Maharashtra, is emerging as another hotspot, thanks to a vibrant dairy innovation ecosystem.What makes these consumers unique is not just their health consciousness but their taste preferences. Beanery Foods’ internal studies shows that more than 75% of urban Millennials and Gen Z prefer Indian-inspired flavours such as Rasmalai, Filter Kaapi, or Rose Kulfi over global standards like vanilla or strawberry. They are also overwhelmingly skewed toward clean-label products with over 90% of respondents revealing their preference for beverages without refined sugar, and with strong interest in natural sweeteners like jaggery and dates.Behind the rise of every successful food category in India lies a quiet enabler which is the packaging & processing technology. For lactose-free to scale, packaging technology is now a critical requirement. The UHT milk market in India, already valued at USD 7.75 billion in 2024, is projected to nearly double to USD 15.53 billion by 2034, growing at 7.2% CAGR. This growth is underpinned by one simple advantage which is the fact that UHT packaging allows milk and milk-based beverages to remain safe for six months without refrigeration.In a country where cold chain infrastructure is uneven, this single factor removes one of the biggest barriers to scale. It allows products to travel further, last longer, and remain safe without adding cost or logistical complexity. For retailers, it means lower spoilage and easier inventory management. For consumers, it provides hygienic, ready-to-drink convenience that matches modern on-the-go lifestyles.Solutions like Tetra Pak’s aseptic cartons are playing a critical role in this ecosystem, enabling safe, long-lasting lactose-free products that can reach far beyond metro shelves.Startups are already proving how this category can be reimagined. Zumi, a Hyderabad-based venture, has launched lactose-free, protein-rich milkshakes in flavours inspired by India’s culinary heritage, from Rasmalai to Rose Kulfi. Each 200ml pack delivers 7–8 grams of protein, is sweetened with natural alternatives like jaggery and dates, and comes in hygienic, ready-to-drink Tetra Pak cartons.Backed by Startup India and supported by Tetra Pak’s product development expertise, Zumi represents a new wave of Indian food innovation, clean-label, functional, and rooted in local taste preferences.“We are excited to serve the ever-conscious Indian consumer with our clean, lactose-free, no refined sugar milkshakes and redefine how India snacks and indulges. At ZUMI, our vision is to make better-for-you indulgence a joyful, guilt-free choice for everyone, combining nutrition with exceptional taste”, Thapasya Vijayaraghavan, Founder of Zumi Foods says.Lactose-free is no longer a fringe alternative. It solves a real health challenge that affects a majority of Indians, while also tapping into the aspirations of a younger, lifestyle-conscious consumer base. At the same time, it aligns seamlessly with broader trends shaping the food and beverage industry with cleaner labels, reduced sugar, functional indulgence, and on-the-go convenience.For dairy players, the timing could not be better. The category is expanding steadily, awareness is rising, and packaging solutions have made it possible to distribute safe, long-lasting products across India’s vast geography. What was once a niche product for a select few is now poised to become a mainstream choice for millions.For both startups looking to innovate and established brands aiming to diversify, lactose-free represents more than just an opportunity; it is the next big wave in Indian dairy, carrying the promise of scale, inclusivity, and long-term consumer loyalty.Disclaimer :","Between 60–74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers, according to studies.

This is a double delight for stargazers as it’s rare for two large comets to appear in the sky at the same time. Both comets had their closest flyby of Earth over the past two days, SWAN on Monday and Lemmon on Tuesday.There’s uncertainty over whether these dusty snowballs will get bright enough to be seen with naked eyes. Some estimates suggest that Lemmon may brighten further.Lemmon is the brighter of the two with a current visibility of magnitude 4.5, as per SpaceWeather.com, which technically puts it in visual range.In the -1 to 10 apparent magnitude scale, any celestial object of a magnitude below 6.5 should be visible to the eye. However, as per most accounts, the comet can currently be only seen through a pair of binoculars or a telescope. However, both show up in long-exposure camera shots.The best time to view the comets this week is an hour after sunset, around 7pm. Lemmon appears in the northwest horizon in the Bootes constellation, close to the ‘handle’ of Big Dipper (Saptrishi). It sets around 7.45pm. SWAN is currently a little higher up in the sky, just above the teapot-shaped Sagittarius constellation in the southern horizon.The most recent comet visible to the naked eye was C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) that made an appearance in mid-2020. If it gets any brighter, Lemmon may be the next truly visible comet.The next few days will tell.","Both comets had their closest flyby of Earth over the past two days, SWAN on Monday and Lemmon on Tuesday.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two leaders talked about trade and Pakistan situation. The conversation came on the occasion of Diwali , as he went on to light lamps at the White House.""Let me extend our warmest wishes to the people of India. I just spoke to your Prime Minister today. Had a great conversation. We talked about trade... He's very interested in that. Although we did talk a little while ago about let's have no wars with Pakistan. The fact that trade was involved, I was able to talk about that. And we have no war with Pakistan and India. That was a very, very good thing. He's a great person, and he's become a great friend of mine over the years,"" Trump said.Meanwhile, Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, bringing the total US import taxes on India this year to 50%. The trade talks between the two nations are on.Talking about the China tariff situation, he said, ""... Right now, as of November 1st, China will have about 155% tariffs put on it. I don't think it's sustainable for them. I want to be nice to China. But China has been very rough with us over the years because we had presidents that weren't smart from a business standpoint.""He also addressed the Middle East situation and said, ""We are forging peace all over the world... We're getting everybody to get along. I just got a call from the Middle East. We're doing very well there. We have many countries signed on to peace in the Middle East, and nobody thought they'd ever see that happening.""The Hamas situation, they're pretty violent people. We could put that out in two minutes. We're giving them a chance. They agreed that they'd be very good and straight. They wouldn't be killing people. If they don't honour the deal, they'll be taken care of very quickly. It is total peace in the Middle East; we have levels of friendship with everybody. Every country that hated each other now loves each other. Nobody ever saw anything like it,"" he added.",US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two leaders talked about trade and Pakistan situation.

Ayush & MBBS doctors’ parity: SC refers case to larger bench,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayush-mbbs-doctors-parity-sc-refers-case-to-larger-bench/articleshow/124729412.cms,"NEW DELHI: Can practitioners of Ayurveda , Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) seek parity in pay scales, service conditions and retirement age with MBBS doctors?Given the conflicting judicial decisions on the issue of parity, a two-judge bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran has referred the matter, a source of perennial conflict between AYUSH and MBBS doctors, to a larger bench for an authoritative pronouncement.The bench said, “There is an area of ambiguity insofar as service conditions, especially of retirement age and the pay packages, with reference to the doctors administering different forms of medical treatment, evaluated for the purposes of parity, should be ideally considered, according to us, on the touchstone of, identity of functions, similarity in work carried out and comparable duties assigned.”It said the claim for parity will have to be decided taking into consideration the qualifications acquired, the treatment practices, the functions, work and duties of practitioners of traditional medicine systems, among other discernible features.Distinguishing AYUSH practitioners from MBBS doctors, the bench said, “It is the MBBS doctors, the allopathy practitioners, who are dealing with critical care, immediate lifesaving measures, invasive procedures, including surgeries and even postmortem; none of which can be carried out by any of the practitioners of indigenous systems of medicine.”The order came on a petition filed by Rajasthan , which through solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the state had brought different retirement ages for AYUSH and MBBS doctors to subserve public good and to address the dearth of adequate number of allopathy doctors.Referring to a previous decision, the CJI-led bench said, “It is common knowledge that the footfalls in allopathy institutions are far more than in the institutions administering the indigenous system of medicine… Further, casualty, critical care, trauma management and the emergency interventional procedures are dealt with by allopathy doctors and not by AYUSH doctors.“These aspects, according to us, put the former (MBBS doctors) in a different class altogether, who can be classified differently for service conditions. This has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved: the sufficiency of qualified and experienced MBBS doctors with better pay scales and longer service, both,” it said.“We are of the opinion that there should be an authoritative pronouncement on the issue, and hence we refer the matter to a larger bench. The Registry is directed to place the matter before the CJI on the administrative side,” the court said.","Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) seek parity in pay scales, service conditions and retirement age with MBBS doctors.

SC: Expenditure for exploring business in India part of IT deduction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-expenditure-for-exploring-business-in-india-part-of-it-deduction/articleshow/124729344.cms,"NEW DELHI: More than 25 years after a French oil exploration company was denied business expenditure deductions in income tax assessment, Supreme Court has ruled that even if the efforts of the foreign company failed to materialise into a contract, it cannot be denied expenditure deductions from IT assessment.Pride Foramer SA, incorporated in France and engaged in oil drilling activities, was awarded a 10-year contract by ONGC in 1983 till 1993. Thereafter, it failed to procure another contract till Oct 1998. It produced before IT officials relevant material to show that between 1993-98, it had continuous business correspondences with ONGC regarding hiring of manpower services in respect of expert key personnel for drilling in deep waters and had unsuccessfully submitted a bid in 1996.Between 1993-98, the company claimed business expenditure deductions. This was allowed by the commissioner of income tax but Uttarakhand HC in 2009 reversed the decision. The company appealed against this before SC.A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Joymalya Bagchi faulted the HC’s view that since the appellant did not have an office in India, it could not claim to have carried out business in India.SC said, “This view is wholly fallacious and contrary to the very scheme of the IT Act.”Writing the judgment, Justice Bagchi said, “The issue of ‘permanent establishment’ may be relevant for the purposes of availing the beneficial provisions of Double Tax Avoidance Agreement ... which is not a relevant consideration.”“In an era of globalisation whose life blood is trans-national trade and commerce, the HC’s restrictive interpretation that a non-resident company making business communications with an Indian entity from its foreign office cannot be construed to be carrying on business in India is wholly anachronistic with India’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goal relating to ‘ease of doing business’ across national borders,” SC said.","Pride Foramer SA, incorporated in France and engaged in oil drilling activities, was awarded a 10-year contract by ONGC in 1983 till 1993.

RJD is likely to battle Congress nominees in four seats, and VIP candidates in three. Congress is locked in a straight fight with CPI in four other seats, much to dismay of top INDIA bloc politicians.The seats where INDIA bloc partners would face each other include Vaishali, Sikandara, Kahalgaon, Narkatiaganj, Rajapakar, Bachhwara, Biharsharif, Kargahar, Chainpur, Babubarhi, and Gaura Baura, although there are chances that some candidates may withdraw from the contest as two days are still left for the last date for withdrawal of candidature (Oct 23) for the second phase.With less than a fortnight for campaigning to close, all opposition “top guns” seem to be falling silent and are missing from the campaign scene.RJD’s and Congress’s social media accounts also appear to be largely inactive, with only old slogans being recycled and the visible aggression noticed during the Voter Adhikar Yatra missing. Lack of clarity over the official start of the opposition’s campaign has left candidates to fend for themselves and campaign at their own level.“We are preparing the campaign programme, it will be out very soon,” senior RJD politician Chitranjan Gagan said, but didn’t reveal when campaign would be launched.","Bihar CM Nitish Kumar launched the NDA’s poll campaign from Muzaffarpur.

Why Magadh-Bhojpur matters



NDA's plan to breach Mahagathbandhan's fort



RJD's plan to hold the fort



1.6 lakh new voters



NEW DELHI: Dragging behind anti-incumbency and infighting within the alliance, the BJP and JD(U)-led National Democratic Alliance faces a steep climb in the politically volatile and caste-sensitive Magadh and Bhojpur regions — a contest that could decide whether Nitish Kumar retains power or cedes ground to Mahagathbandhan.In the tightly contested 2020 Bihar assembly elections , the Magadh–Bhojpur region proved to be a silver lining for the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led alliance, where it fiercely battled the JD(U) and BJP-led NDA and came out as a winner.While the Mithilanchal and Tirhut regions delivered narrow victories for the NDA, Magadh and Bhojpur — which together send 69 MLAs to the 243-member Bihar assembly — ensured a strong opposition presence in the Vidhan Sabha.The Magadh region, comprising Arwal, Jahanabad, Aurangabad, Gaya, and Nawada districts, holds 26 seats. In 2015, when chief minister Nitish Kumar was aligned with the RJD and Congress, the NDA managed to win only six seats in the broader Shahabad belt.However, the BJP staged a strong comeback in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, sweeping the Magadh–Shahabad range by winning Pataliputra, Aurangabad, Nawada, Gaya, Jehanabad, Ara, Sasaram, Buxar, and Karakat.The momentum didn’t last long — in the 2020 assembly polls, the tables turned in favour of the Grand Alliance, which captured most of the seats within those parliamentary constituencies.In 2020 assembly elections, the NDA secured just six of Magadh’s 26 seats — five in Gaya and one in Nawada — while the Mahagathbandhan bagged the remaining 20. In Bhojpur, which spans Patna, Nalanda, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas, and Kaimur, the NDA won 13 of 43 seats, as against 30 for the Mahagathbandhan.In the run-up to the election, the BJP is focusing on Magadh seats to ensure a better result this time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently visited Gaya and laid the foundation for development projects worth Rs 12,000 crore, signaling the NDA's focus on this region.Meanwhile, Bhojpuri star Pawan Singh, who had previously rebelled and flirted with contesting independently, has patched up with the BJP. His differences with the party had threatened to split the Rajput vote, especially in the Shahabad and Bhojpur regions, where the caste balance is delicate.BJP leaders believe Singh’s presence will help consolidate upper-caste support and attract younger, entertainment-driven voters who identify with his larger-than-life persona.Additionally, the BJP has fielded several prominent leaders from this region in the upcoming elections. The party has nominated eight-time MLA Dr Prem Kumar from Gaya Sadar and four-time MLA Aruna Devi from Warisaliganj.Meanwhile, the RJD and Congress have mobilised their cadres in this region ahead of the elections. Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav's Voter Adhikar Yatra covered a large part of this region, while Tejashwi's Bihar Adhikar Yatra covered areas missed in the previous tour.Additionally, several NDA heavyweights from this region have jumped ship and joined the RJD ahead of the elections, altering political equations.Former JD(U) MP Jagdish Sharma’s son Rahul Sharma, JD(U) MP from Banka Girdhari Yadav’s son Chanakya Prakash, and former LJP candidate Ajay Kushwaha have joined the RJD.Interestingly, the Magadh region also witnessed the highest voter increase after the special intensive revision exercise by the Election Commission. Magadh recorded an average voter increase of 2.6 per cent, translating to 1.6 lakh new voters.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, compared to 7.89 crore in the list released before the SIR on June 24 this year.According to an Election Commission release, around 65 lakh names were removed during the revision process, bringing the number of electors in the updated draft list, as of August 1, 2025, to 7.24 crore.Bihar will go to the polls in two phases — on November 6 and November 11 — with the counting of votes scheduled for November 14.","Magadh region, comprising Arwal, Jahanabad, Aurangabad, Gaya, and Nawada districts, holds 26 seats.

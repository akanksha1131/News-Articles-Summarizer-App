NEW DELHI: With Aam Aadmi Party ’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjeev Arora winning the Ludhiana (West) assembly bypoll, all eyes are now on who the party will nominate as its candidate for the Upper House in his place. Amid celebrations of the victories in bypolls to Ludhiana and Visavadar in Gujarat at AAP headquarters, party supremo Arvind Kejriwal made it clear that he was not going to Rajya Sabha and that the party’s political affairs committee (PAC) will decide the nominee.The PAC meeting is likely to happen in a week.On Monday, at a press conference where he was flanked by Manish Sisodia and Gopal Rai, party in-charge for Punjab and Gujarat, respectively, Kejriwal called the victories the “semi-final to 2027”. Assembly polls are due in Punjab and Gujarat in 2027.In response to a question on who the party will nominate in Arora's place, Kejriwal joked, “Many times I have been sent to Rajya Sabha by you people but let me tell you Kejriwal is not going to Rajya Sabha...”The name of senior party leader and Kejriwal’s trusted lieutenant Sisodia is doing the rounds, with another senior leader, Satyendar Jain (co-incharge, Punjab), also in the reckoning. There is also talk of the party going for a leader from Punjab as it may want Sisodia to focus on his job as in-charge of Punjab, the only state where AAP is in power, with polls due in 2027.Since Arora’s candidature was announced for the bypoll, opposition BJP and Congress in Punjab have said that following the Delhi debacle, Kejriwal was looking to enter Rajya Sabha, a claim rejected by him earlier too.Meanwhile, after a fierce campaign from BJP and Congress, the victories in crucial bypolls in Ludhiana (West) in Punjab and Visavadar in Gujarat have come as a much- needed shot in the arm for the party, which is still recovering from its crushing defeat in Delhi assembly polls. The party has been trying to reclaim the “alternative” politics ground and disengaged from the INDIA bloc, saying the opposition grouping was formed only for 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Hailing the bypoll win at Visavadar where AAP's former Gujarat president Gopal Italia won, Kejriwal said: “In Feb 2022, we won Visavadar but the MLA later joined BJP. Today, we've won Visavadar again. It shows that people are happy with our work”.",Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjeev Arora won the Ludhiana (West) assembly bypoll.

New Delhi : Disregarding Congress brass’s frowns, its MP Shashi Tharoor has said PM Narendra Modi ’s energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a “prime asset” for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.“The diplomatic outreach following Operation Sindoor was a moment of national resolve and effective communication. It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms,” Tharoor wrote in an article published in The Hindu.“While the immediate military action was decisive, the subsequent diplomatic outreach was equally, if not more, vital in shaping global perceptions and consolidating international support,” the Thiruvananthapuram MP said in the article that was referred to by PMO on its X handle.Tharoor had earlier raised his party leadership’s hackles by praising Operation Sindoor and by agreeing to head one of the parliamentary delegations to sensitise global opinion to the necessity of India’s military retaliation following the Pahalgam terror attack . His party had questioned govt picking members of the delegation.His fresh praise for the PM can only widen the MP’s gulf with the party brass. It also coincides with a fresh flurry of Congress attacks on Modi, this time for not “unequivocally condemning” the US for bombing Iran.Some in the party said Tharoor, unlike many of his colleagues, did not repost on X an article by Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Gaza and Iran.In contrast, BJP highlighted Tharoor’s praise for the PM. Reflecting on his experience of leading the delegation that visited the US and other countries, Tharoor said the very composition of the delegations, featuring MPs from diverse political parties, different states and varied faiths, was a potent message in itself.“It underscored that when it comes to national security and confronting terrorism, India speaks with one voice. This transcended domestic political differences, imbuing our message with greater credibility and gravitas in the eyes of our international interlocutors,” he said.","Shashi Tharoor said PM Narendra Modi’s energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a ‘prime asset’ for India on the global stage. “The diplomatic outreach following Operation Sindoor was a moment of national resolve and effective communication,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122037074,imgsize-669861,width-400,resizemode-4/122037074.jpg"

Raj is seen placing his hand on Devi Singh's shoulder and remaining close to him throughout the mourning.While pictures of Raj consoling Sonam's father had gone viral on social media earlier, this footage has raised suspicion as it shows him making repeated phone calls during the funeral.

Iran late Monday launched a barrage of missiles targeting the US-operated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, triggering loud explosions across Doha and Lusail. The strike came just hours after Qatar closed its airspace as a precaution, and was later confirmed by Iranian state television as a direct response to recent US attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Iranian media hailed the strike as “a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to America’s aggression,” accompanied by martial music during the broadcast. Israeli sources, quoted by Axios, claimed the missiles specifically aimed at US positions within the Al Udeid base -- the largest American military facility in the Middle East.Residents in Doha reported hearing a series of deafening explosions, with AFP noting that the night sky lit up with visible projectiles. While there was no immediate confirmation from US or Qatari authorities regarding the extent of damage or potential casualties, embassies, including India's, swiftly issued advisories urging citizens to stay indoors.US President Donald Trump downplayed the scale of the Iranian retaliation, describing it as “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was ‘set free,’ because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction.”“I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system,’ and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,” Trump added, signalling hopes for a de-escalation.Trump also extended thanks to Iranian authorities for what he described as an “early notice,” which allowed the US to preemptively take defensive measures. “Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same,” he said.In another post, Trump thanked the Emir of Qatar and emphasised that there were no Qatari casualties either. “I’d like to thank the Highly Respected Emir of Qatar for all that he has done in seeking Peace for the Region. In addition to no Americans being killed or wounded, very importantly, there have also been no Qataris killed or wounded,” Trump said.He ended his remarks with a dramatic flourish: “CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT’S TIME FOR PEACE!”“In view of the ongoing situation, Indian community in Qatar is urged to be cautious and remain indoors. Please remain calm and follow local news, instructions, and guidance provided by Qatari authorities,” read an official statement from the Indian embassy in Doha. “The Embassy will also keep updating through our social media channels.”Two US officials later confirmed to Reuters that there were no American casualties from the attack. The officials said Iran had used both short- and medium-range missiles in the strike, with most intercepted before causing significant damage.The missile count, according to Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, mirrored the number of bombs dropped by the US during its recent air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The council stressed that the selected base was “far from residential areas” and posed no threat to Qatar, described as “our friendly and brotherly neighbour.”Qatar’s foreign ministry meanwhile said the situation was “under control,” although the underlying tensions continue to reverberate across the region. Bahrain, which hosts the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, temporarily halted air traffic, adding to the widespread disruption.Amid the uncertainty, airlines adjusted operations in and around Qatar. IndiGo issued a travel advisory, noting, “In view of the evolving situation in the Middle East, some of our flights may experience delays or diversions. These adjustments are being made to ensure operations remain within safe and compliant airspace.”Air India Express confirmed two Qatar-bound flights had been diverted. “As a result of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and the suspension of Qatar airspace, Air India Express has diverted our Doha-bound flight from Kochi to Muscat and returned our flight bound from Kannur,” a spokesperson said.“We are monitoring the situation closely and will take all necessary precautions for the safety and security of our guests and crew… We regret the inconvenience due to circumstances beyond our control,” the airline added.The White House confirmed that US President Donald Trump was in the Situation Room with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General John Caine. Reuters reported that the senior leadership team was actively monitoring developments as the crisis unfolded.The Iranian attack followed a surprise joint US-Israeli strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend -- a move that Tehran had warned would trigger “unpredictable consequences.” Al Udeid Air Base is a critical hub for US military operations in the region, housing the Combined Air Operations Center and the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing — the largest such unit in the world.In a message posted on X just before the attack, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared, “We neither initiated the war nor seeking it. But we will not leave invasion to the great Iran without answer.”","US President Donald Trump downplays scale of Iranian retaliation, describing it as “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered” US officials later confirmed there were no American casualties from the attack.

Israel-Iran conflict: Air India halts all flights to Middle East; Europe and US east coast also affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-conflict-air-india-halts-all-flights-to-middle-east-europe-and-us-east-coast-also-affected/articleshow/122032920.cms,"NEW DELHI: The closure of UAE and Qatar airspace late Monday night as missiles were fired from Iran towards US bases in Qatar and Iraq threw commercial air traffic completely out of gear. Hundreds of lights to and from the region — that houses mega hubs like Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi along with multiple smaller ones like Sharjah — were impacted.Flights headed there from across the world, including multiple Indian cities, were diverted, returned to origin or were put on hold. Flights headed from Lucknow to Dammam; Mumbai to Kuwait and Amritsar to Dubai were among those that turned back to the origin from over the Arabian Sea. And aircraft supposed to take off from there, remained on the ground.Early on Tuesday morning, Air India said it has ceased “all operations to Middle East as well as to and from the East Coast of North America and Europe with immediate effect, until further notice. Our India-bound flights from North America are diverting back to their respective origins and others are being diverted back to India or re-routed away from the closed airspaces.”AI says this due to “the developing situation in the Middle East. ”“We request the understanding of all passengers who may be affected by this disruption that’s beyond an airline’s control. Air India is in continuous consultation with its external security advisors and is vigilantly monitoring the evolving situation. We will keep our passengers informed of any updates. The safety and security of our passengers and staff remain our number one priority,” said an Air India spokesperson.The India market is served by biggies including Emirates Group, IndiGo, Air India Group, Qatar Airways, Etihad and multiple smaller airlines like Akasa, SpiceJet and Air Arabia. Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi are key transit points for travel between India and rest of the world. Dozens of flights to and from India alone were impacted on Monday night itself.In a statement, IndiGo said: “In view of the evolving situation in the Middle East, some of our flights may experience delays or diversions. These adjustments are being made to ensure operations remain within safe and compliant airspace. We recommend checking your flight status regularly. If your flight is impacted, alternate options can be easily explored through our website. We continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with the relevant authorities. We appreciate your patience and understanding.”An AI Express spokesperson said: “As a result of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and suspension of Qatar airspace, Air India Express has diverted our Doha bound flight from Kochi to Muscat and returned our flight bound from Kannur. Air India Express has no aircraft on the ground in Qatar. We are monitoring the situation closely and will take all necessary precautions for the safety and security of our guests and crew, with inputs from the relevant authorities… regret inconvenience. ”The airspace closure in the region started around 9 pm (IST) when Qatar closed its airspace for commercial airliners “to ensure safety of citizens, residents, and visitors.” As a result, a large number of flights headed to Doha — including many from Indian cities — were impacted. The enroute ones diverted to other nearby places like Abu Dhabi or Bahrain; some returned to their origin cities in India; boarding for those about to depart was put on hold and others were suspended till the airspace restrictions remain in force.The point-to-point trafic between India and Doha is rather low, with the majority being one-stop transit flyers. IndiGo, the biggest Indian operator to Doha, saw the maximum impact. Its enroute flights to Doha from Delhi and Hyderabad were diverted to Bahrain and one from Kochi went to Abu Dhabi. Comments were sought from Qatar Airways and awaited till the time of going to press.Air India’s three flights were immediately impacted: one was diverted to Abu Dhabi, other returned to India and the third was put on hold. AI Express put boarding of its Doha-bound flights on hold at Indiana airports. AI Express has flights between Doha and six Indian cities — Kannur, Kochi, Kozhikode, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchchirappalli. Multiple flights headed from the west to Doha diverted to nearby cities including Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.Within an hour, the UAE airspace was also closed. That threw flights completely ot of gear. “At this point, there’s utter chaos and we can’t even guestimate the impact,” said senior official of multiple airlines.","The closure of UAE and Qatar airspace late Monday night as missiles were fired from Iran towards US bases in Qatar and Iraq threw commercial air traffic completely out of gear.

Tharoor has 'exposed' Rahul

NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor , whose frosty ties with the Congress leadership is now an open secret, has yet again taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the global diplomatic outreach following "" Operation Sindoor "".In an article published in The Hindu, Tharoor said: ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a prime asset for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.""""The diplomatic outreach following 'Operation Sindoor' was a moment of national resolve and effective communication. It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms,"" the Congress leader wrote in the article.Tharoor had led one of the seven multi-party delegations to convey India's stand following the Pahalgam terror attack and the military operation.Only last week, Tharoor had admitted to ""differences of opinion with some in party leadership"". Ironically, Shashi Tharoor's latest round of praise for PM Modi comes on a day the Congress made a notable electoral victory in Kerala wresting the Nilambur assembly seat from the LDF after nine years.Tharoor had stayed away from party's campaign in Nilambur bypoll. While the Congress MP had said that he was not invited, the Congress maintained that his name was in the list of star campaigners for the bypoll.The Congress had dubbed the Nilambur bypolls as the semi-finals ahead of the assembly elections in the state next year. The win will give the party a boost as it goes all out to wrest power from the LDF after 10 years.Tharoor's praise for the Prime Minister comes at a time when the Congress has been consistently attacking the Modi government over its foreign policy, alleging that Indian diplomacy is being ""shattered"" and the country stands ""isolated"" globally.Following the Pahalgam attack, Tharoor has made several comments on the India-Pakistan conflict and the diplomatic outreach that are at variance with the stand taken by the Congress party. Led by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress has been questioning the government over US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating a ceasefire between the two countries.The BJP was quick once again to use Tharoor's remarks to target the Congress as it has done several times in the past few months. The party took a swipe at the Congress over Tharoor's article and said the Thiruvananthapuram MP has ""exposed"" Rahul Gandhi. BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said on X, ""Shashi Tharoor admits that PM Modi's dynamism and global outreach are a strategic advantage for India.""The Prime Minister's Office did its bit to return favourt to the Congress MP and shared Tharoor's article on X and said, ""Lok Sabha MP and former Union Minister Dr. Shashi Tharoor writes- Lessons from Operation Sindoor's global outreach.""","Shashi Tharoor has taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party.

‘Ironic for Pakistan to talk about human rights’

NEW DELHI: India on Monday strongly rejected “unwarranted and factually incorrect references” made about the country during the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of foreign ministers’ meeting.“These statements, driven by Pakistan, which has turned terrorism into statecraft, reflect the continued misuse of the OIC platform for narrow political ends,” the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said in a detailed statement.The MEA criticised the OIC for its continued failure to acknowledge the “real and documented threat of terrorism emanating from Pakistan,” citing the recent terror attack in Pahalgam as a recent example.“This reflects a wilful disregard for facts and the global consensus on the fight against terrorism,” the ministry added.India firmly reiterated that the OIC has “no locus standi to comment on India's internal affairs, including Jammu & Kashmir,” which the ministry described as “an integral and sovereign part of India, a fact enshrined in the Indian Constitution and irreversibly settled.”Calling the OIC’s silence and actions troubling, the MEA warned the organisation of the “perils of allowing Pakistan’s propaganda to hijack and politicise its agenda,” and said that continuing on this path would “undermine the OIC’s credibility and relevance.”Responding to comments made by Pakistan at the OIC meeting, India said they were nothing more than a desperate attempt to distract from Islamabad’s “appalling record of state-sponsored terrorism, minority persecution, sectarian violence, and governance failure.”India also rejected Pakistan’s allegation of “unprovoked and unjustified military aggression” and defended its counter-terror operation post-Pahalgam.“Operation Sindoor was a precise and legitimate act of self-defence against terrorist camps operating from Pakistani territory,” the MEA said, adding that Pakistan’s retaliatory efforts were reckless, endangered civilians, and resulted in multiple civilian casualties.In its closing remarks, the ministry said it was “ironic” for Pakistan, a country with an “abysmal human rights record” and a “history of sheltering, breeding and empowering terrorists”, to lecture others on counter-terrorism and human rights.","India strongly rejected “unwarranted and factually incorrect references’ made about the country during the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of foreign ministers’ meeting. “These statements, driven by Pakistan, which has turned terrorism into statecraft, reflect the continued misuse of the OIC platform for narrow political ends,” the ministry of external affairs said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122029099,imgsize-964077,width-400,resizemode-4/122029099.jpg"
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari threatens India over Indus Waters Treaty suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bilawal-bhutto-zardari-threatens-india-over-indus-waters-treaty-suspension/articleshow/122033312.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning on Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.Speaking during the budget session of the National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers.” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the April 23 terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.The remarks came nearly two months after India suspended the IWT. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan-based militants for the assault, triggering fresh tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said.He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict. “We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon,” he said. “Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he claimed.Bilawal also urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will only increase in both countries,” he warned, adding that Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.The former FM also accused India of misusing global platforms to target Pakistan. “When we got off the FATF grey list, India tried hard to reverse it through lobbying and misinformation. But our diplomacy prevailed,” he claimed.He questioned the logic of what he called “PM Modi’s new abnormal”, where any terror incident is met with immediate threats against Pakistan. “We suffer terrorist attacks far more frequently than India — many traced to Indian funding or involvement. Should we adopt the same policy of automatic retaliation? That would mean surrendering our future to the agenda of terrorists,” he said.Bilawal insisted that peace in South Asia was not possible without dialogue and mutual trust. “We are not only fighting for Pakistan’s future, we are fighting for regional stability, for the people of both countries,” he said.The IWT, one of the few surviving agreements between India and Pakistan, allocates water from six rivers in the Indus basin. Under the treaty, India has control over the eastern rivers – Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers – Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.

NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress candidate Alifa Ahmed secured a sweeping victory in the Kaliganj Assembly bypoll, defeating BJP’s Ashish Ghosh by a margin of 50,049 votes—surpassing the 2021 win margin of her late father, Nasiruddin Ahmed, whose passing in February prompted the election in West Bengal’s Nadia district.Congress candidate Kabil Uddin Shaikh, backed by the Left, finished third with 28,348 votes. The byelection, held on Thursday, saw a voter turnout of 69.85% by 5pm and was largely peaceful, aside from a few isolated incidents.Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed gratitude saying, ""People of all religions, castes, races and walks of life in the area have blessed us immensely by exercising their right to vote in the by-elections to the Kaliganj Assembly constituency. I humbly express my gratitude to them. The main architects of this victory are mother, soil, and people. My colleagues from Kaliganj have worked tirelessly for this. I also extend my heartfelt congratulations to them. """"My greetings and salutations to everyone. In memory of the late MLA Nasiruddin Ahmed, I dedicate this victory to the motherland and people of Bengal,"" she said.Alifa, a 38-year-old engineer, left her corporate role at a Kolkata-based IT company to enter politics, drawing inspiration from Mahua Moitra, the Trinamool MP from Krishnanagar—under which the Kaliganj Assembly segment falls. Like Moitra, who traded her career in investment banking for the political arena, Alifa chose grassroots engagement and legislative advocacy over her former profession.Meanwhile, a blast in Kaliganj in Naida district killed a 13-year-old girl prompting CM Mamata to take strict action against the culprits.","All India Trinamool Congress candidate Alifa Ahmed secured a sweeping victory in the Kaliganj Assembly bypoll.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini.

Chandigarh, by contrast, is the most affordable capital.These numbers have been arrived at by comparing the income of the top 5% households in a state/UT with average price of a 110sq m (1,184sq ft) house in its capital city - the middle of the three house size categories for which National Housing Board (NHB) compiles data. In 2022-23, India's gross savings to GDP ratio was 30.2%, and the same ratio has been applied to calculate savings of the richest 5% households.The income of the top 5% of urban families is derived from the average Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) of the top 5% of urban folks in a state. The rural MPCE is considerably lower.In Maharashtra, for instance, the urban MPCE for the top 5% is Rs 22,352 per person per month. For a family of four, the income would be Rs 89,408 per month or Rs 10.7 lakh per annum.Applying the 30.2% saving rate to Maharashtra's top 5% families, their annual savings would be around Rs 3.2 lakh.NHB's data on house prices shows that the per square foot price for a house with a carpet area between 645 sq feet and 1,184 sq feet was Rs 29,911 in March 2025.This means a 1,184 square feet house on average cost over Rs 3.5 crore in Mumbai. With a saving of Rs 3.2 lakh per annum, the top 5% urban families of Maharashtra would have to save for 109 years to afford this house.NHB's average carpet area price is based on the registration data collected from sub-registrar offices (SROs) as well as the valuation data collected from primary lending institutions.A similar calculation shows that for the top 5% urban families in Haryana, it would take 63 years to afford a house of similar size in Gurgaon. In Bhubaneswar, it would take more than 50 years of savings for Odisha's richest 5% urbanites to afford a house.Of the 21 state capitals for which carpet area price data was available from NHB, in 10 it would take more than 30 years of savings to buy a house. Chandigarh is the most affordable, as 15 years of savings will be enough to buy a 1,184 square feet house. Jaipur is the only other city where less than 20 years of savings would suffice.","The top 5% of urban families by income in Maharashtra would have to save 109 years to afford a 1,184 sq ft house.

NEW DELHI: AAP won two, while BJP, Congress and Trinamool Congress picked up one each in assembly bypolls to five seats across Gujarat, Punjab, Kerala and Bengal. Voting was held on June 19, with results declared Monday.In Gujarat, AAP's Gopal Italia clinched Visavadar seat in Junagadh by 17,554 votes, defeating BJP's Kirit Patel. Italia, a former state unit president, secured 75,942 votes as BJP failed to break an 18-year losing streak in the constituency.BJP retained the SC-reserved Kadi seat in Mehsana, where Rajendra Chavda trounced Congress's Ramesh Chavda by 39,452 votes. BJP now holds 162 seats in Gujarat's 182-member assembly. Congress state chief Shaktisinh Gohil stepped down, accepting responsibility for the party's poor performance in both seats.The contest followed the death of BJP MLA Karshan Solanki in Feb. Visavadar had fallen vacant in Dec 2023 after AAP's Bhupendra Bhayani resigned and joined BJP. Bypolls were delayed as Bhayani's election was under judicial scrutiny, until Congress's Harshad Ribadiya - who had filed the case in high court - joined BJP and withdrew his petition this year.Congress last held Visavadar in 2017 under Ribadiya, who lost to Bhayani in 2022. BJP last won the seat in 2007 through Kanu Bhalala. Former CM Keshubhai Patel captured it in 2012 on a Gujarat Parivartan Party ticket.In Punjab's Ludhiana West, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjeev Arora won by 10,637 votes. The seat fell vacant after AAP MLA Gurpreet Gogi died in Jan. Congress's Bharat Bhushan Ashu got 24,542 votes, BJP's Jiwan Gupta 20,323. Ashu, a two-time MLA and former cabinet minister, resigned as working president of the party's state unit, saying: ""I, and not the Congress party, contested the election. So, I must take the responsibility of defeat. ""Calling the twin wins ""a major boost"" ahead of the 2027 state elections in Gujarat and Punjab, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal said: ""Both Congress and BJP contested the elections together... But people rejected them in both places."" He dismissed speculation about replacing Arora in Rajya Sabha. ""I am not going to RS. The party's political affairs panel will decide whom to nominate.""The name of senior party member Manish Sisodia is doing the rounds as Arora's replacement, with another senior member, Satyendar Jain (co-incharge, Punjab), also in the reckoning. There is also talk of the party going for a party member from Punjab as it may want Sisodia to focus on his job as in-charge of Punjab - the only state where AAP is in office.TMC retained Kaliganj in Bengal, where Alifa Ahmed defeated BJP's Ashish Ghosh by over 50,000 votes. Daughter of the late legislator Nasiruddin Ahmed, whose death in Feb prompted the bypolls, the 38-year-old engineer left her IT job in Kolkata to contest. Congress, backed by the Left Front, finished third but increased its vote share to 28,348 - around 3,000 more than in 2021. BJP's vote count dropped to 52,710.In Kerala, Congress wrested Nilambur from CPM in a major win before the 2026 assembly polls. Aryadan Shoukath defeated CPM's M Swaraj by 11,077 votes. Independent PV Anvar, once a Left ally and Trinamool's Kerala convenor, took nearly 20,000 votes, denting CPM's prospects. BJP polled around 8,000 votes, consistent with past performances.Shoukath reclaimed father Aryadan Mohammed's former stronghold after nine years. Anvar had won Nilambur in 2021 as a CPM-backed independent but resigned earlier this year after falling out with CM Pinarayi Vijayan. The result marks first time Congress-led UDF has flipped a sitting LDF seat since current Left govt took office. CPM's M Swaraj has now lost twice in a row after a 2021 defeat in Thripunithara.","Voting was held on June 19, with results declared Monday.

Act VI: From Outlaw to Operator—The Indo-US Nuclear Deal



Epilogue: From Fallout to Future



There’s a running meme on X, the hellhole formerly known as Twitter, where a doctor asks a patient: “Do you have a history of mental illness in your family?” To this, the patient replies: “I have an uncle who believes Iran is close to a nuclear weapon for the last 50 years. ”Perhaps that’s why Operation Midnight Hammer – a blow-by-blow remake of– was carried out with such haste that even half of Donald Trump’s base were still railing against it as the bombs dropped on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan.While Iran’s Godot-like wait for nuclear weapons continues, it’s illustrative to see how India, a nation that didn’t evoke very warm feelings from Uncle Sam in the past, became a nuclear superpower. How did a newly freed, partition-bruised, socialist-leaning, and largely illiterate country go from famine queues and imported milk powder to becoming one of the world’s most improbable nuclear powers?The truth is that politicians of various vintages played a part, irrespective of their worldview or political leanings. Every one of them was of the opinion that the Ayatollahs of Potomac (a delightful term coined by TOI legend K Subrahmanyam, the father of the current external affairs minister) couldn’t be the only ones with the power of the sun in the palm of their hands.As George Fernandes, the erstwhile Defence Minister of India in the Vajpayee government, summed up this grit: “I am not a former socialist; I am a socialist. I am not a former pacifist; I am a pacifist. I am even today an anti-nuclear weapon man. But as a defence minister of the country, I will do whatever is best to protect its border, and if that means nuclear bomb, then why not?”When pressed on how one could do so at the risk of contradicting oneself, Fernandes dug deep into the Lord Krishna rationale that one’s dharma trumps all contradictions, pointing out: “Yes, even at the cost of contradicting oneself, even at the cost of dying.If the security of the country requires me to die, I shall die. It’s about being realistic. It’s about being patriotic.”While with the benefit of hindsight, it might seem inevitable that the land that gave the world the Bhagavad Gita would come up with nuclear weapons, here’s the tale of how it went down.Let’s say you haven’t seen, skipped physics class, and think “fusion” is what happens when you have tandoori gravy momos.To understand nukes, we need to rewind to 1905, when a wild-haired Swiss patent clerk named Albert Einstein wrote four papers that changed science forever.One of them suggested that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. A few months later, he dropped a tiny but terrifying equation: E = mc². That means energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Since light travels really fast — about 300 million metres per second — squaring it makes even a small amount of mass release a huge amount of energy.So, how do we turn that into a weapon? That’s where nuclear physics steps in.Certain heavy atoms like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are naturally unstable. If you shoot a neutron at them, they split — releasing heat, radiation, and more neutrons. Those neutrons hit other atoms, which split too. It’s called a chain reaction — kind of like a viral WhatsApp message, but instead of arguments, you get a mushroom cloud.That’s how atomic bombs work. The ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki used two designs:Both use Einstein’s idea: a little mass disappears, and a huge burst of energy takes its place. There’s also the hydrogen bomb, which is even more terrifying, but beyond the scope of this piece.By the 1960s, nuclear weapons were the privilege of a select five—America, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China—enshrined as permanent members of the global atomic aristocracy, the kind that liked to invade Vietnam in their spare time and host disarmament conferences in their downtime.There is something about nukes and their miasma. Once you have them, you don’t want others to get them. You start doing everything in your power to stop anyone else from joining this super-exclusive club, because deterrence is always more comfortable when it’s a monopoly.And then in 1974, India came knocking—with Smiling Buddha, gatecrashing the party with a silent explosion in the Rajasthan desert. If Israel was the nuclear sphinx, India was the grinning intruder who didn’t wait for an invitation.How did a socialist, beggared and non-aligned country acquire nuclear weapons? It all started with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Fabian socialist who wasn’t beyond making a Faustian deal if it was for the nation’s betterment. While he publicly championed atomic energy for rural electrification, privately he laid the groundwork for a weapons programme.Enter Homi Jehangir Bhabha—part physicist, part institution-builder, all ambition, played with élan by Jim Sarbh in the heavily fictionalised Rocket Boys, whose cheekbones are capable of setting off a different sort of chemical reaction.A Cambridge-trained genius with a velvet accent, Bhabha envisioned a self-sufficient Indian nuclear complex. He set up the Atomic Energy Commission in 1948 and Trombay’s Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) soon after.His three-stage nuclear plan was audacious: heavy water reactors for plutonium, fast breeder reactors for more fissile material, and eventually, thorium-based systems.In 1955, India obtained the CIRUS reactor from Canada, with heavy water courtesy the United States—both under the Atoms for Peace programme. It was a masterclass in strategic procurement.Enter the dragon. In 1962, Chinese troops stormed Indian posts in Ladakh and Arunachal. The result wasn’t just military humiliation; it was psychological trauma. Nehru aged a decade overnight. And two years later, when China tested a nuclear bomb in Lop Nur, India realised it wasn’t just behind—it was vulnerable.And then came the prodigal daughter. Indira Gandhi had no qualms about the world or any delusions about power. By the early ’70s, the scientific community—led by Raja Ramanna, P.K. Iyengar, and M.R. Srinivasan—had weaponised the plutonium harvested from CIRUS.On May 18, 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test in Pokhran, Rajasthan. Codenamed Smiling Buddha, because what better name for a nuclear bomb than the progenitor of peace, the device yielded around 8 kilotons, billed as a “peaceful nuclear explosion”. Canada fumed and threw a Trudeau-level fit. The US imposed sanctions. But much like she did when Richard Nixon threatened her during the Bangladesh Liberation War, Indira Gandhi didn’t flinch.From 1974 to 1998, India lived in nuclear ambiguity. We had tested a bomb—but never declared a doctrine. This era, later dubbed ""recessed deterrence"", saw India perfect the art of silent readiness.Prime Ministers like Morarji Desai were openly anti-nuclear. Others, like Rajiv Gandhi, were more nuanced—calling for universal disarmament while funding missile programmes.In this period, India commissioned the Dhruva reactor for weapons-grade plutonium. Ballistic missiles like Prithvi and Agni were tested under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, overseen by Dr. Abdul Kalam.Still, New Delhi avoided another test. The 1985 NPT Review Conference slammed the door shut on India’s membership. But India refused to sign a treaty that said: “You can’t have nukes, but the P5 can.”By the 1990s, India was ready. And P.V. Narasimha Rao, India’s philosopher-king of pragmatism, knew it. In 1995, with the Clinton administration distracted by Yeltsin’s vodka diplomacy and Pakistani warlords, Rao greenlit preparations for Pokhran-II. Shafts were drilled. Scientists were mobilised. Dr. Kalam, Dr. R. Chidambaram, and their teams stood by.Then, American satellites picked up movement. The CIA raised alarms. A New York Times exposé spooked Washington. Clinton dialled Delhi. Rao, deadpan as ever, stonewalled. The tests were paused.But he didn’t stop the programme. Instead, he ensured everything stayed intact—ready for a more audacious successor.As legend has it, Rao whispered to Atal Bihari Vajpayee before leaving office: “Everything is ready. You just have to press the button.”Rao never took credit. But when the mushroom clouds rose in 1998, they bore his blueprint.On May 11 and 13, 1998, India conducted five nuclear tests. Codename: Operation Shakti.This time, it wasn’t a “peaceful” explosion. It was a declaration. Fission and fusion devices were tested. Thermonuclear capability was claimed (though some scientists later debated the yield).Prime Minister Vajpayee announced: “India is now a nuclear weapons state.” Sanctions came. Condemnations followed. India shrugged.The team that delivered this feat:Pakistan tested six devices in response. South Asia was officially a two-bomb region. But India’s message was clear: deterrence, not domination.Having proven its capabilities, India now wanted respect.In 2005, under Manmohan Singh , India signed the Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement with President George W. Bush. It was historic. For the first time, a non-NPT country gained access to civilian nuclear trade.The deal was backed by the US Congress, the IAEA, and the NSG. It marked India’s transformation from global pariah to trusted partner—without dismantling a single warhead.Critics cried foul. Proponents hailed it as a realpolitik victory. For India, it was simple: we earned the bomb. Now we wanted the fuel.The bomb was never the endgame. It was the insurance policy. A radioactive reminder that India wouldn’t be bullied into compliance or bribed into silence. The scientists were the magicians, the politicians their illusionists. But behind them stood a civilisation that never wanted conquest—only the right to decide its destiny. From Bhabha’s lab bench to Vajpayee’s launch pad, India’s nuclear odyssey was built on a foundation of paradoxes: peaceful atoms turned potent, idealism wrapped in pragmatism, and restraint forged through power.Today, India’s nuclear arsenal isn’t about posturing. It’s about posture—calm, calculated, credible. We built the bomb not to drop it, but to make sure no one else could.So the next time someone scoffs at Indian statecraft, remind them: we cracked open the atom, outfoxed the CIA, kept our doctrine unspoken, and still walked into the world’s nuclear club with our head held high. We didn’t explode to destroy. We exploded to exist. And that, in the final analysis, is how you detonate a dream.","How did a newly freed, partition-bruised, socialist-leaning, and largely illiterate country go from famine queues and imported milk powder to becoming one of the world’s most improbable nuclear powers?

"Mughal Road gets tunnel, Omar Abdullah says ‘major achievement of my govt’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mughal-road-gets-tunnel-omar-abdullah-says-major-achievement-of-my-govt/articleshow/122033386.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Union government’s approval on Monday of 19 major road and tunnel projects worth Rs 10,637 crore, including a key tunnel on the historical Mughal Road linking Shopian, in the Kashmir Valley, with Poonch in Jammu, has caused widespread excitement across Kashmir.The proposed Peer Ki Gali tunnel, which will turn the 84-km Mughal Road into an all-weather road providing a crucial alternative to the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, has excited political leaders across the board. “It is a major achievement of my government,” Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said.Construction of a modern road on the old Mughal Road began in the 1970s, during the government of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, but the project saw little progress. It was revived in 2003 under Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s government, and by 2009 traffic was allowed during the tenure of Omar Abdullah. Though the road is now operational, it remains open only during summer as heavy snowfall on the key stretches of Peer Ki Gali and Bafliaz forces its closure in winter.Over the past eight months the National Conference government has been pushing for the tunnel project on the Mughal Road.“We have been working hard on this and held several rounds of discussions with government of India, particularly the ministry of road transport and highways. Finally, these major projects have been sanctioned,” CM Omar Abdullah told TOI. “The tunnel on the Mughal Road is of crucial importance as it will provide year-round connectivity between Kashmir and Jammu. It holds both strategic and commercial value.”Omar said that ever since he first drove on the Mughal Road in 2009, his party and his government have been advocating for construction of a tunnel. “We’ve been pursuing this for years, and I am glad it has finally received approval,” he said.Among the sanctioned projects is also the Sadhana Tunnel, which will connect Kupwara with the border region of Karnah, at an estimated cost of Rs 3,330 crore. Omar said he will also pursue a tunnel project for Gurez Valley in north Kashmir and intends to raise the matter with the Union government.The Mughal Road also holds historical significance. It was used by Mughal emperors in the 16th century to enter Kashmir. Emperor Akbar took this route to conquer the region in 1586, and his son, Jahangir, is believed to have died near Rajouri while returning from Kashmir.In a separate statement issued in Srinagar, both LG Manoj Sinha and Omar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari for approving these major projects.National Conference was quick to take credit, stating that “under the leadership of J&K CM Omar Abdullah our government has successfully convinced government of India to take up key infrastructure projects like the Mughal Road tunnel and the tunnel to Tangdhar.”A senior NC politician said the projects were sanctioned because J&K’s elected government pursued them with the Union government.","The proposed Peer Ki Gali tunnel will turn the 84-km Mughal Road into an all- weather road providing a crucial alternative to the Srinagar-Jammu national highway. “It is a major achievement of my government,” Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said.

NEW DELHI: After a campaign for assured pension, there is only a small proportion of central govt employees who have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme , offering assured 50 per cent pension, with several seeking further clarifications to exercise the one-time option.As a result, govt has extended the June-end deadline by three months. Employees want to be absolutely sure about the terms of the agreement before deciding to switch to UPS.A concern for employees who joined national pension system from 2004 is the lack of clarity on death benefits. While an assurance was given last week, there are still a few issues that are to be resolved.Under the UPS, while an employee will contribute 10 per cent of his or her salary towards pension, a matching contribution will be made by the Centre, which was 14 per cent under NPS. Under the new scheme, apart from the 10 per cent pension payment, another 8.5 per cent contribution is to be made by the Centre which will not reflect in the balance of the subscriber’s account. While most employees understand the change, there are some who believe that the payout may be lower.Further, some of the all India service officers want to know about the difference in contribution between the Centre and states, which don’t have a scheme yet.An IAS, IPS or Indian Forest Service officer spends time in the state with some of them also opting for central deputation. While the rules are quite clear, some of the officers have raised doubts.Meanwhile, fund managers, who have been asked to conduct outreach programmes, are smelling a rat and allege that some private players are sowing doubts as they stand to lose out on the annuity business under UPS.Employees now have time to exercise the switching option up to the end of September. The option can be exercised by 23 lakh government employees.",Only a small proportion of central govt employees have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme. Employees want to be absolutely sure about the terms of the agreement before deciding to switch to UPS. Concern for employees who joined national pension system from 2004 is lack of clarity on death benefits.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122036654,imgsize-822045,width-400,resizemode-4/122036654.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The statistics ministry will conduct a household income survey in 2026 and it has set up a technical advisory group (TEG) for it under the chairmanship of former executive director at the IMF Surjit Bhalla.This is the first of its kind household income survey that the ministry will undertake to get a better picture of income distribution and welfare and aid in datadriven policy making.“The TEG will guide the national statistics office towards conducting an all-India income distribution survey, tentatively scheduled for 2026. The expert group will provide guidance with regard to finalisation of concepts and definitions, preparation of the survey method and instruments, sampling design and method of estimation, and incorporate best country practices as adopted across the world,” said an official statement.It said that the survey will also strive to assess the impact of adoption of technology on household income (wages). The TEG will also provide guidance for finalisation of the survey results and report, the statement added, “The household income survey is another important initiative of the ministry to generate vital information for deriving income distribution and welfare thereof,” said the statement.In the past, MoSPI made efforts for collecting information on household income along with the consumer expenditure surveys on experimental basis in the 9th round (May 1955 to Sept 1955) and 14th round (July 1958 to June 1959) though no information was released.Later, it undertook collection of data on receipts and disbursements as part of Integrated Household Survey (IHS) in its 19th round (July 1964 to June 1965) and 24th round (July 1969 to June 1970) with the aim of obtaining a complete picture of transactions of household income.The statement said that however these efforts were not continued as it was found that the estimates of income were lower than the estimates of consumption and savings put together.In 1983-84, the NSS again attempted a pilot inquiry on household income to explore the possibility of evolving an operationally feasible collection of data on household income. This too could not transform to an all India survey.“Experience from these surveys showed there were difficulties in collecting reliable income data in the field and to overcome all these issues and having more clarity in the surveys procedures and to oversee the overall activities of the Household Income Survey and in view of the experiences of survey conducted by countries like Australia, US, Canada and South Africa. MoSPI has constituted a technical expert group (TEG). ..,” the statement added.The national sample survey (NSS) has taken a number of initiatives to plug gaps in data in different spheres of social and economic interests. It has started annual surveys on unincorporated sector enterprises, services sectors, forward looking surveys on private sector capital expenditure, etc. with a view to make available data on important macroeconomic indicators, it added.",The statistics ministry will conduct a household income survey in 2026. It has set up a technical advisory group (TEG) for it under the chairmanship of former executive director at the IMF Surjit Bhalla.

Thus, they foreclose the HCs from deciding the plea on merit. Thereafter, they move SC and make a grievance that the condition to deposit the amount is an onerous condition and hence illegal.""""We are not able to countenance such an approach. We strongly deprecate this practice. If an offer to deposit a substantial amount was not made at the very outset of hearing of the bail plea, the HC would have examined it on merit and decided whether the person deserves relief or not,"" it said.""We are conscious of the accused person's right to liberty. But we are also equally concerned about the sanctity of the judicial process,"" the bench said and was ready to dismiss the accused's plea and send him back to jail.However, senior advocate V Chitambaresh told the court the man's wife was pregnant, and he was required to take care of his ailing father and pleaded that he be given interim bail.

The flooded rivers, rivulets, and nullahs of Abujmarh significantly hinder anti-Maoist operations by restricting movement, disrupting logistics, and reducing visibility - factors that provide the Maoists, many of whom are local tribals, a tactical edge.Key rivers like Indravati, Parlakota, Pamulgautam, Godavari, and Pranhita near the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, along with Dina and Bande in Gadchiroli, and Kotri and Doodh in Kanker, severely limit commando mobility. Godavari's tributary, Shabari, and several nullahs in Gadchiroli and adjoining areas make it tough to penetrate deep into Maoist zones.Combat boots sink in wet soil and slip on slushy terrain, said an officer involved in operations. Another warned that sudden torrential rains could maroon troops or cut off rescue routes. Parts of Abujmarh in Bastar are impacted by the Indravati and Godavari rivers, while Kanker's side faces isolation due to Doodh river and other rivulets. In Gadchiroli, Bhamragarh taluka, the gateway to Abujmarh, is often rendered inaccessible.Despite the hurdles, govt, relying on tech & improved infrastructure, is determined to deny Maoists their monsoon advantage and meet the March 2026 deadline to dismantle remaining guerrilla strongholds.","Monsoon fury will pose a major challenge for security forces as they continue operations in Maoist stronghold Abujmarh.

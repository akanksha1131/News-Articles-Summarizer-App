SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been ‘stabilised’ SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123514961,imgsize-418059,width-400,resizemode-4/123514961.jpg"

Framing norms shouldn’t be knee-jerk reaction: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday said online shows by influencers and YouTubers do not enjoy the protection that free speech does. Saying so, it asked five popular content creators to tender public apologies on their channels - they have already apologised to the court - for ridiculing people with disability in their shows.""Influencers commercialise speech. When a speech falls in the ambit of commercial or prohibitive categories, the immunity under right to free speech is not available,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ruled.The case that started with Ranveer Allahbadia's vulgar comments was expanded to cover these five: Samay Raina, Vipul Goyal, Balraj Paramjeet Singh Ghai, Sonali Thakur and Nishant Jagdish Tanwar.AG R Venkataramani said he has held consultations with stakeholders, including I&B ministry, for framing guidelines for speeches on the web world, but added the issue required sensitive handling since it concerns free speech.SC said framing of guidelines should not be a knee-jerk reaction to infractions by a few influencers but must be broad-based, considering the advances in communication technology and the challenges that might arise in future and would need to be tackled to ensure an inclusive society.“Unless effective guidelines are in place, the young generation’s fertile mind would enable them to step around it. Consequences for breaching the line should be proportional to the harm/damage caused. Otherwise, they would think that they would be off the hook by tendering an apology,"" SC said.The influencers faced SC’s heat after SMA Foundation accused them of ridiculing the exorbitant cost of treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disease and disability. Senior advocate Aparajita Singh said influencers must be responsible in their speeches as what they say matters a lot to the younger generation.Singh suggested that apart from tendering apologies, they must carry out activities towards creating an inclusive society.Kant and Bagchi said the influencers present in the courtroom must tender public apologies on their channels and file affidavits detailing the activities they have undertaken towards mainstreaming people with disability. “Degree of repentance should be proportionate to the degree of violation,” the bench said. It said the question of appropriate penalty/cost that may be imposed on them would be considered later.",Supreme Court says online shows by influencers and YouTubers do not enjoy the protection that free speech does.

MYSURU: A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Saligrama taluk, Mysuru district, Saturday.According to police, the 20-year-old woman, married and has a two-year-old child, was found with her mouth and right part of her face ripped open in what seemed to be a controlled blast triggered by an unidentified device. When police arrived, Darshitha was found dead in a pool of blood on the floor of the hotel room in Bherya village, 55km from Mysuru city.Police claimed the suspect, Siddaraju, from Bettadapura in Periyapatna, had brought Darshitha from Hunsur's Gerasanahalli to visit a temple. He allegedly plotted the murder of Darshitha as she refused to marry him, according to police. They reportedly knew each other for 7 years. Siddaraju worked at a hardware shop, while she lived with her parents at Gerasanahalli. Her husband lives in Kerala.Police suspect the accused may have used a pressure-triggering object or electricity to kill her. It's suspected Siddaraju may have electrocuted her by forcibly inserting a cable into her mouth and turning the power switch on, as a two-metre electric cable was recovered from the spot.Siddaraju allegedly attempted to carry Darshitha's body on his shoulder.The hotel staff asked him not to move the body until police arrived, police stated.Mysuru superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhana said police are being assisted by a forensic science expert to identify the object used to kill the woman. He ruled out the use of gelatine sticks or any combustible materials to injure and kill the woman. An investigation is being carried out to identify the object used to cause her severe bleeding in her mouth, which resulted in her death.According to lodge manager Manu, the duo arrived seeking a room around 2pm Saturday. Siddaraju introduced Darshitha as his wife. He went out to get food, returned with a parcel in a plastic cover about 30 minutes later and claimed the room was locked from inside.Immediately, lodge staff force-opened the door. To their shock, they found Darshitha dead in a pool of blood.Manu appeared to suggest it was a mysterious blast since there was no sound of an explosion and there were no traces of gunpowder inside the room.","A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Mysuru district.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed five social media influencers, including India’s Got Latent host Samay Raina, to issue a public apology for mocking persons with disabilities.

Emphasising the difficulty of enforcing such guidelines, the bench remarked, “Article 19... can’t overpower Article 21,” adding, “Suppose a race takes place between Article 19 and 21, Article 21 has to trump Article 19.”Justice Kant had stressed the need to protect dignity: “What we are doing is for posterity. You have to ensure that not a single word is misused by anyone... A framework must be there that the dignity of anyone is not violated.”The petition was filed by NGO Cure SMA Foundation of India. The court previously warned that mocking the disabled cannot be allowed under the guise of free speech and termed the influencers’ actions “damaging” and “demoralising.”Raina, along with podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, was booked by Maharashtra and Assam police.

Security forces launched a search operation on Monday after more than six drones, suspected to be from Pakistan, were spotted hovering above multiple forward areas along the Line of Control in Poonch district’s Mendhar sector the previous night.Blinking lights from suspected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were spotted in Balakote-Langote area around 9.15pm on Sunday.

TMC Boycotts JPC On Corrupt PM, CM Ouster Bills | Calls Modi Govt’s Move Unconstitutional Farce

Saha reportedly tried to escape by scaling the boundary wall of his house in Burwan and throwing his mobile phone into a drain. Both phones were later retrieved from water bodies and are to be sent for forensic examination.Malviya alleged that TMC’s strategy is to loot Bengal and then use such stunts to avoid accountability.

ED unearths NRI quota admission racket in private medical colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-unearths-nri-quota-admission-racket-in-private-medical-colleges/articleshow/123489930.cms,"NEW DELHI: An investigation by ED, assisted by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) and its foreign missions and embassies, has unearthed a massive NRI admission racket, in which private medical colleges were found offering admissions on about 18,000 reserved MBBS UG and PG seats under the quota by using forged documents of non-resident Indians.India's foreign missions have verified that the NRI certificates, seized by Enforcement Directorate (ED) from several private medical colleges and used to offer admissions, were fake, and counterfeit stamps of notaries in the US were provided against these admissions.ED had conducted searches at various medical colleges in West Bengal and Odisha over the last few months, through which it seized crucial evidence. The agency then sent the seized NRI certificates to Indian embassies and missions for verification. Most of them were found to be forged or fake. The probe further revealed these medical colleges were paying agents to have fake NRI documents prepared.The agents also prepared fake family trees of NRIs, wherein these unrelated NRIs were shown as relatives of students to help secure admissions under the NRI quota. In some cases, the agents and medical colleges used documents of one NRI for admissions of multiple candidates, who were unrelated to the NRI sponsor and to each other.The promoters of these medical colleges were found to be behind the illegal admission racket, with their agents spread across the country bringing ""clients"" and helping them generate huge ""proceeds of crime"".The Centre has since revised its NRI admission policy, with the DG of health services issuing fresh guidelines wherein each NRI certificate has to be authenticated by embassies and missions before admission is granted on its basis. This happened after coordinated action involving multiple Union ministries.The MEA too has issued fresh guidelines to its embassies and missions abroad, for strict due diligence in issuance of NRI certificates, outlining the eligibility criteria and clearly delineating 'first degree' and 'second degree' relatives in respect of whom NRIs can get certificates for admissions under the quota in India.The involvement of some NRIs has also come to light. They allowed their names to be used after receiving bribes from the agents of the medical colleges. ""The agents approached and obtained credentials of unrelated NRIs by paying money to them,"" the investigation found.The existing rules specify that the fees of the NRI student must be paid by the NRI sponsor. However, the investigation found that in a majority of the cases fees were paid by the family of the student and not the NRI sponsor, thereby defeating the very purpose of the policy, which is to earn foreign exchange, sources said.Probe revealed many NRI sponsors were not present in India on the dates affidavits were notarised and signed, a senior official said.","ED had conducted searches at various medical colleges in West Bengal and Odisha.

What is Mysuru Dasara



NEW DELHI: Senior BJP leaders have objected to the Karnataka government’s decision to invite Booker Prize-winning author and activist Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate this year’s Mysuru Dasara celebrations. Karnataka minister G Parameshwara, however, countered the criticism, saying, ""This is not a religious issue.""Former minister and BJP MLC CT Ravi argued that it was inappropriate for someone ""whose faith is uncertain"" to lead a religious ceremony.Former Mysuru MP Pratap Simha said while he respects Mushtaq’s achievements, she should preside over literary events, not Dasara. ""It is acceptable when she chairs the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana but not Dasara, a Hindu religious event which begins with pooja to Goddess Chamundeshwari. Does she have faith in Chamundeshwari Devi? Is she following our traditions?"" he asked.Expelled BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal echoed similar views on X. ""I personally hold respect for Banu Mushtaq madam as a writer and activist. However, her inaugurating Dasara by offering flowers and lighting the lamp to Goddess Chamundeshwari seems to be in conflict with her own religious beliefs,"" he said. Yatnal added that Mushtaq should clarify whether she continues to follow Islam or believes in a broader path that aligns with Hindu traditions, stressing that such clarity was necessary before she performed the inaugural rituals.""She may certainly inaugurate cultural or literary events within Dasara festivities, but the religious inauguration itself should be refrained from,"" Yatnal said, using the hashtag #KarnatakaDasara2025.In another post on X, written in Kannada, he said, ""It is not right for the Dasara inauguration to be done by those from other religions who do not believe in Hindu dharma and practices, and who consider flower worship and idol worship to be 'haram'.""However, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya struck a slightly different note, saying, ""I don’t have an objection to anybody. But Mysuru Dasara is an important religious festival of Karnataka, and we only expect that whoever inaugurates it and offers the first prayers should make their belief in Goddess Chamundeshwari public and clear.""Congress-ruled Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara hit back at BJP's objections to Banu Mushtaq inaugurating Mysuru Dasara, saying, ""It is not right to oppose this. This is not a religious issue. Dasara is a national festival.""Chief minister Siddaramaiah had recently announced Mushtaq’s name to inaugurate the Nada Habba (state festival) Dasara celebrations, which traditionally begin with rituals at the Chamundi Hill temple.Mysuru Dasara, the Royal Festival, marks the triumph of good over evil, celebrated for ten days with Vijayadashami as the grand finale when Goddess Chamundeshwari is believed to have slain Mahishasura.Festivities peak from the sixth day, with rituals dedicated to Saraswati, Durga, and Lakshmi, culminating in a grand procession from Mysuru Palace to Bannimantap.Recognised as Karnataka’s Nada Habba (state festival), the event is led by the Mysuru royal family, who continue centuries-old traditions and pujas.","Banu Mushtaq is a Booker Prize-winning author and activist.

Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Monday called CBI probes ""a gallery show right now"" while turning down a plea for an investigation by the central agency into an East Midnapore murder in July. It, instead, said it would hand over the probe to the Bengal CID after taking the case out of the local police station.""The CBI is a gallery show right now. If I give CBI, it will just be a gallery show,"" Justice Tirthankar Ghosh told the father of a 22-year-old East Midnapore youth whose death had prompted the family to move court seeking a fresh autopsy and a CBI probe.Sujit Das and Sudhir Chandra Paik died during a social function in East Midnapore's Khejuri on July 12. Cops, after an initial probe, said the deaths were caused by electrocution but Sasanka (Sujit's dad who moved court) claimed his son was brutally assaulted by Trinamool supporters and cops were shielding the accused. The BJP had declared a local bandh after the deaths.The first autopsy, done by a district hospital in Tamluk, blamed electrocution for the death but a second (at SSKM Hospital) indicated assault as the cause of the death because the body bore bruise marks.Sasanka's counsel, Mayukh Mukherjee, told the judge on Monday that the family wanted a CBI probe as it did not have any faith in cops.""I am taking it out of the local police station and giv-ing it to the CID,"" Justice Ghosh said, responding to the plea. ""The CID additional director-general will constitute a special investigation team under the leadership of a deputy inspector-general and including officers from the CID's homicide section.

RTI wasn't enacted to 'provide fodder for sensationalism': HC

New Delhi: Marks obtained, grades and answer sheets are ""personal information"" protected under the exemption clause of the Right to Information Act, Delhi high court held Monday as it set aside CIC orders to disclose details of PM Modi's bachelors degree from DU, reports Abhinav Garg.HC drew a distinction between ""something which is of interest to the public"" and ""something which is in the public interest"" and pointed out that ""public interest override would not be attracted"" where the information sought has no bearing on the discharge of responsibilities by the concerned public official/functionary (whose personal information is sought).In a 175-page verdict, HC allowed appeals filed by DU in PM Modi's case & CBSE, which had challenged the direction to furnish copies of Class 10 and 12 records of ex-Union minister Smriti Irani.""Thus, it is unambiguously clear that the 'marks obtained', grades, and answer sheets, etc, are in the nature of personal information and are protected under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act, subject to an assessment of overriding public interest... information pertaining to an individual's educational qualifications falls within ambit of 'personal information' under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act,"" Justice Sachin Dutta noted.""Public interest considerations would prevail if the information sought has a bearing on the performance of official responsibilities/functions entrusted to a public functionary, or where the information sought concerns exposure of wrongdoing in the discharge of official functions, financial impropriety, inefficiency and/or has a bearing on the very eligibility (as prescribed under law) for holding a particular office,"" it clarified.Dealing with a batch of petitions stemming from CIC rulings, Justice Datta observed that the ""entire approach of CIC was thoroughly misconceived"". Following an RTI application by one Neeraj, CIC had in 2016 asked DU to allow inspection of records of all students who cleared BA exam in 1978 - the year the PM passed out. HC, however, had stayed the CIC order on Jan 23, 2017.In its verdict on Monday, HC stressed that RTI Act was enacted to promote transparency in govt functioning and not to ""provide fodder for sensationalism"" and further observed that ""what may superficially appear to be an innocuous or isolated disclosure"" could open ""floodgates of indiscriminate demands, motivated by idle curiosity or sensationalism"" instead of an objective ""public interest"" consideration.Citing the landmark K S Puttaswamy verdict on right to privacy by Supreme Court, HC emphasised 'disclosure of academic details sans any overriding public interest, would amount to an intrusion into the personal sphere which is constitutionally protected post. The fact that the information sought pertains to a public figure does not extinguish privacy/confidentiality rights over personal data, unconnected with public duties'.DU challenged the CIC order on grounds that it held the information of students in a fiduciary capacity and ""mere curiosity"" in the absence of public interest did not entitle anyone to seek private information under the RTI law. The applicants had previously defended the CIC's order on grounds that RTI Act provided for disclosure of the PM's educational information in greater public good.In Irani's case, it cited the same exemption clause and said that her educational qualifications were not in the nature of any statutory requirement for holding any public office or discharging official responsibilities.","RTI wasn't enacted to 'provide fodder for sensationalism': HC.

NEW DELHI: Quashing a National Green Tribunal order that had directed ED to examine a matter against a polluting company, which was also slapped a fine of Rs 50 crore, the Supreme Court has observed that the tribunal devoted 145 pages to writing a ruling which was in violation of law and beyond its jurisdiction, and said that ""application of mind is not proportionate to the number of pages"".A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran also appealed to courts and tribunals to refrain from engaging in mere rhetoric by stating the law in general without reference to the facts of the case.Finding fault with NGT's order to involve ED in a pollution case where no scheduled offence was in question, the bench said SC had earlier too questioned the jurisdiction of NGT to direct prosecution of individuals under the PMLA.""NGT should act within the contours of the powers conferred on it which is Section 15 of the NGT Act. Though such power would be available to a court constituted under PMLA or to constitutional courts, it would not be available for exercise by NGT, constituted to ensure effective and expeditious consideration of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources, including enforcement of any legal right and giving relief and compensation for damages to persons and properties.We hence set aside the direction issued to ED; but say nothing on whether there is an offence made out or not, which at this stage is not within our ken,"" the bench said.It also said that there was no basis for NGT to impose a penalty of Rs 50 crore on the company and held that imposition of penalties cannot be done on the basis of the annual turnover of a firm.""The methodology adopted by NGT for imposition of penalty was held to be totally unknown to any principle of law. We fully agree with the observation and add that the rule of law does not permit the state or its agencies to extract a 'pound of flesh', even in environmental matters. Though in the present case there is an observation made that there was admitted turnover of Rs 550 crore; we still notice the absence of nexus between the turnover and the pollution alleged,"" it said.""Before we leave the matter, with some anguish, we cannot but indicate that application of mind is not proportionate to the number of pages. The impugned judgment deals elaborately with environmental law, numerous pollution prevention measures, guidelines and publications issued by various states as also decisions in that regard. It also extracts various reports filed by the Joint Committee, interim orders of NGT and objections raised by industry; which would anyway be available in the records of the case. In the context of the last of the reports having found complete compliance, we cannot but observe that unfortunately this was an exercise in futility. Judicious consideration is the sum and substance of adjudication and the courts/tribunals should restrain themselves from engaging in mere rhetoric by stating the law in general without particular reference to the facts,"" it said.","NGT devoted 145 pages to writing a ruling which was in violation of law and beyond its jurisdiction, says Supreme Court.

The last CJI from Gujarat HC was Justice A M Ahmadi, who served from Oct 25, 1994, to March 3, 1997.Aradhe was appointed as a judge of Madhya Pradesh HC in 2009. Pancholi was appointed as a judge of Gujarat HC in Oct 2014, which makes him one of the quickest to climb the ladder in the hierarchy-sensitive constitutional courts to reach the highest court. When they get appointed by the President, the SC will reach its full strength of 34 judges.Aradhe's career path meandered through the J&K HC where he was first a judge and then acting CJ, a responsibility he was to handle also in Karnataka HC before becoming CJ of Telangana HC in July 2023. He took oath as Bombay HC CJ on Jan 21 this year. Pancholi's career progression has been smoother. He was transferred in July 2023 to Patna HC, where he became its CJ a month back.SC sources said the collegium also decided to transfer as many as 14 judges from different HCs, which included two from Delhi HC - Justices Arun Monga and Tara V Ganju. Sources said while Justice Monga is recommended to be transferred to Kerala HC, Justice Ganju has been recommended to be transferred to Patna HC.It has also decided to transfer Atul Sreedharan from MP HC to Chhattisgarh HC, Sanjay Agrawal from Chhattisgarh HC to Allahabad HC, J Nisha Banu from Madras HC to Kerala HC, Dinesh Mehta from Rajasthan HC to Delhi HC, Avneesh Jhingan from Rajasthan HC to Delhi HC, Sanjay Kumar Singh from Allahabad HC to Madras HC, Rohit Ranjan Agarwal from Allahabad HC to Calcutta HC, Manavendranath Roy from Gujarat HC to AP HC, Donadi Ramesh from Allahabad HC to AP HC, Sandeep Natvarlal Bhatt from Gujarat HC to MP HC, Chandrasekharan Sudha from Kerala HC to Delhi HC and Subhendu Samanta from Calcutta HC to AP HC.","The Supreme Court's five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai on Monday recommended to the govt to appoint Bombay high court chief justice (CJ) Alok Aradhe and Patna high court CJ Vipul M Pancholi as SC judges.

There is no truth in such claims. Searching for conspiracies or mysteries in this is another example of cheap politics.

AHMEDABAD: Just two days ahead of the Aug 27 deadline for US President Donald Trump's proposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, PM Narendra Modi on Monday underlined the challenge of ""self-centred economic policies"" and called on citizens and businesses to embrace Swadeshi - urging them to buy and sell only 'Made in India' products to make the country self-reliant and developed.""I am asking our shopkeepers and traders. Do not sell foreign goods. This will provide a huge boost to the Make in India movement,"" the PM said, adding that he would not cave in to pressure.The pitch for Swadeshi came at a time of uncertainty over whether Trump would Wednesday carry out his threat to slap an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, with many considering the remark about “self-centered economic policies” to be a reference to Washington’s switch to extractive mercantilism.Modi avoided mentioning names but made plain his intent not to succumb to pressure, emphasising that the interests of farmers and small businesses was paramount. “For Modi, the interests of farmers, cattle-rearers and small-scale industries are paramount. Pressure on us may increase, but we will bear it all,” the PM affirmed. He hit out at Congress, saying the party which ruled India for 60-65 years, made the nation dependent on other countries in order to indulge in “import scams”.Seeking to promote Swadeshi, he said : “Festivals are coming... From the land of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi, I am repeatedly urging countrymen to make it their life mantra — whatever we buy will be Made in India, it will be Swadeshi. Whatever items are for home decoration, let them be Made in India. If you want to give a gift to friends, let it be a gift made in India, made by the people of India,” urged Modi, addressing a public meeting in east Ahmedabad.PM laid foundation stones and unveiled projects worth Rs 5,477 crore for Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Mehsana districts in Gujarat.",PM Narendra Modi calls on citizens and businesses to embrace Swadeshi.

I am directing my officers to display details of contractors, officials and the defect liability period of each stretch along highways, so that they are also held accountable,” he said, emphasising the need for quality project preparation and construction.Umashanker, while citing the example of how NHAI had to incur extra expenditure in Gurgaon to take up additional work on NH-48, said that the highway project report did not anticipate the future problems and also did not factor in the need to provide safe and adequate crossings for people given that the highway divides the city into two parts.",Nearly 30% of private cars and jeeps taking the Delhi-Chandigarh highway are using the FASTag Annual Pass.

The riots erupted after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her Sikh bodyguards in retaliation for Operation Blue Star , a military action earlier that year to remove militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar.Following her death, mobs, often armed with voter lists and political backing, targeted Sikhs in Delhi and several other cities. Over 3,000 Sikhs were brutally killed, their homes and businesses looted or burned, and many women faced horrific violence. Eyewitness accounts and later investigations indicated the role of Congress leaders in instigating and organising the violence, while the state machinery largely failed to act.The riots left deep scars on India’s social fabric, fostering alienation among Sikhs and fueling militancy in Punjab. Justice for victims has been slow, with many cases dragging on for decades.Rajiv Gandhi, who was sworn in as Prime Minister soon after Indira Gandhi’s assassination, made a controversial remark about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots during a rally at the Boat Club in New Delhi on 19 November 1984, Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary. He said, “When a big tree falls, the earth shakes.”The statement was widely interpreted as an attempt to justify or downplay the violence against Sikhs, though Congress later maintained he was speaking metaphorically about the impact of his mother’s death on the nation.","Family members of those who lost their life in 1984 anti-Sikh riots will be given appropriate jobs in Haryana government. 121 people from the state were killed in the riots, reported news agency ANI.

Delhi Polls: Kejriwal Attacks Election Commissioner; Shah Says People Will Sweep AAP Out With Broom

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday shot off a barbed response to Union home minister Amit Shah ’s recent interview, in which the BJP leader defended the government's 130th constitutional amendment bill.The bill proposes the removal of lawmakers detained or arrested for more than 30 days in cases carrying a punishment of five years or more.In the interview with news agency ANI, Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister—accused of corruption or facing charges with more than five years’ punishment -- to run the government from jail?""Responding to the Union home minister's question, Kejriwal posed a counter question asking: ""And what about a leader who inducts hardened criminals into his party, helps them wipe off their cases, and then rewards them with positions like minister, deputy chief minister, or even chief minister—should such a minister or prime minister not also be forced to step down? How many years of imprisonment should such a person face?""The AAP convenor further asked: ""Finally, if someone is falsely implicated in a case, sent to jail, and later acquitted, how many years of jail should the minister responsible for framing that false case get?""Kerjiwal had refused to step down as Delhi CM when he was jailed over the alleged scam linked to the scrapped Delhi liquor policy and continued to serve as chief minister from Tihar jail.Referring to the incident, Shah said: ""When the constitution was made, the constitution makers would not have imagined such shamelessness that any CM would go to jail and remain the CM from jail.""Shah said Kejriwal continued to serve as CM as the Delhi high court ruled that there was no provision in the law to remove him from the post.""When the case went to the high court, it was argued that Arvind Kejriwal should resign because he is in jail.The high Court said that we believe that he should resign on moral grounds but there is no provision in the current law. My party believes, the Prime Minister of the country believes that no CM, minister or PM in this country can run the government while being in jail,"" the Union home minister said.Kejriwal attacked Amit Shah over his statement, saying his 160-day government from jail was better than the current BJP-led Delhi government.""When the Centre conspired to frame me in false cases and sent me to jail, I ran the government for 160 days from behind bars. In the past seven months, the BJP government in Delhi has dragged the city into such a mess that people now recall those jail days of governance. At least back then, the power and water were available, medicines were free in hospitals and mohalla clinics, medical tests were free, one spell of rain didn’t throw the city into chaos, and private schools weren’t given a free hand to extort and bully parents,"" the ex-Delhi CM said.BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla lashed out at Kejriwal over his remark, saying: ""During Covid we worked from home. Now they want 'Work from Jail' for the 1st time in India. Can a CM hold meetings from prison? Where will public hearings be held — inside jail rooms? How will we cope if their is any emergency? This fails both on morality and practicality.""In the interview, Shah also expressed confidence that the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025, will be passed, despite the opposition's fierce criticism.Shah said it's aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust, emphasising that the bill would apply equally to all leaders, including those from the ruling party.""I am sure it will be passed. There will be many people in the Congress party and in the opposition who will support morality and maintain the moral ground,"" he said.""The Prime Minister himself has included the post of PM in this... Earlier, Indira Gandhi had brought the 39th amendment (of protecting the President, VP, PM, and Speaker from judicial review by Indian courts)...Narendra Modi ji has brought a constitutional amendment against himself that if the Prime Minister goes to jail, he will have to resign,"" Shah added.Currently, the bill has been referred to a JPC for detailed scrutiny, comprising 31 members from both houses of Parliament. The committee will examine the bill and provide recommendations before it is put to vote.","Union home minister Amit Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister"" to run the government from jail.

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.

Clare initially turned down Tommy Fleetwood before love story started

Clare Fleetwood ’s support during heartbreaking near-misses

Tommy Fleetwood is one of the top-paid golfers in the world as of August 2025. On the PGA Tour itself, he has won more than $31 million in prize money. This statistic makes him one of the biggest-money winners in the history of the DP World Tour, with a career earnings total of around $35 million.Other sources of income have also bolstered Fleetwood, but still has yet to nab a win on the PGA Tour. In addition, he has taken home sponsorship deals with Nike, TaylorMade, and TAG Heuer, benefitting from a significant amount of millions as a result of golf's former Player Impact Program.Fleetwood met his wife, Clare, in 2015, which further blended his personal and professional lives. Clare was then a sports management executive when she became Tommy's client. Their work was the beginning of what would soon become a deeper relationship, despite their 23-year age difference, and after the controversies from the media.Clare explained how she initially turned down Tommy when he first asked her out because the age gap made her feel cautious. But after further thought, she succumbed, and the couple entered a relationship that shocked the golf world.The pair had concerns about whether mixing business with romance would work, but agreed to give it six months to see how it went.So when they did, they were surprised to find that the two arrangements reinforced each other, professionally and personally. Clare, who maintains a cool and calm approach, has regularly been acknowledged as a reason Tommy stays composed and relaxed in stressful situations on the course.Apart from materialistic dividends, there have been some massive emotional ups and downs in Fleetwood’s professional career. Clare has remained his rock through his lowest lows, which include several painful near misses on the PGA Tour.None was more heartbreaking than the one he endured at the Travelers Championship as Tommy once again finished in second place, this time the victim of a late charge by Keegan Bradley to come up one stroke short of the winner. Enticing words like these have shaped his career narrative to date, so near, but not close enough to cement that first PGA Tour title.Going into the last 18 holes of the Tour Championship, Fleetwood was quoted as a fan's favourite, and Clare was back to have his back as always. Friends of the couple say Clare has been a great support to Tommy in dealing with the pressure, and his two losses have only made him more determined and focused towards the future.Also Read: Who is golfer Tommy Fleetwood’s wife Clare?

Pop icon Taylor Swift may dominate the music charts and headlines for her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , but there’s another side to her that doesn’t often make the spotlight: her role as a godmother. Beyond the stadium appearances and sold-out tours, Swift plays a personal role in the lives of several celebrity children, showcasing the depth of her friendships and her influence beyond music.Taylor Swift’s first widely known godchild is Leo Thames King, son of actress Jaime King. Born in 2015, Leo quickly became a part of Swift’s inner circle, with the singer even penning emotional words inspired by the moment.When she first met him, Swift posted a touching photo with the caption, “Meeting my boy.” Jaime King, once a core member of Swift’s famous “squad,” has often spoken highly of her friend, calling her a “beautiful human being.” For King, naming Swift as godmother was “a really sacred thing,” signaling not just a celebrity connection but a genuine trust in the singer’s character.The most notable godparent role Swift holds is with the children of Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.She is godmother to James, Inez, Betty, and Olin — a fact Swift humorously acknowledged while promoting Deadpool & Wolverine, writing, “Shout out to Wade Wilson, aka my godkids’ sperm donor.” Ryan Reynolds later clarified, “Swift is the godparent to my daughters.”Interestingly, the names James, Inez, and Betty are immortalized in Swift’s Folklore album, making her godmother role not just private but also creatively celebrated.Also Read: “She doesn’t include Blake”: Taylor Swift leans on Travis Kelce’s support and no longer values Blake Lively’s advice With five godchildren, Swift’s personal influence in Hollywood runs as deep as her professional success.

The final drive with Walter Gretzky that meant more than the farewell ovation

Lessons from Walter Gretzky that shaped a hockey icon

Wayne Gretzky’s last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career. Yet, for Gretzky, the moment wasn’t only about the sold-out crowd, the ovations, or the history—it was about a quiet car ride with his father, Walter Gretzky.On the 25th anniversary of his retirement, Wayne Gretzky reflected on why he asked Walter to drive him to Madison Square Garden that night. “For my final game, I decided that since my dad drove me to the first game I ever went to, it would be great to drive my dad to my last game,” he told NHL.com.That ride, however, was far from ordinary. Gretzky admitted, “The ride was good, but it was kind of awful in the same sense because every three minutes, he kept hitting my leg and telling me that I could play one more year. I said, ‘No, dad, I’m done.’”While the NHL and fans worldwide treated the day as a fitting farewell to the greatest player in hockey history, Gretzky cherished that personal moment most. To him, it was the perfect full-circle memory, blending his first steps in hockey with the end of his iconic journey.Walter Gretzky was more than just a supportive parent—he was the guiding force behind Wayne’s rise. When officials tried to block young Wayne from moving to Toronto in 1974, Walter stood firm, saying, “No, they can't tell me where to send my own boy… If he will be happy elsewhere, we decide between the family.”Also Read: What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever Walter’s philosophy of family first left a lifelong mark on Wayne, who carried those values into his career and personal life. Though Walter passed away in 2021, his wisdom continues to influence Gretzky, reminding fans that behind the hockey legend was always a devoted son.","Wayne Gretzky's last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career.

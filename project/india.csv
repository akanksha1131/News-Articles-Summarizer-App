He also expressed Russia's willingness to set up manufacturing facilities in India, whilst acknowledging the Indian leadership's focus on prioritising national interests.""Prime Minister Modi has a similar program called Make in India. We are also ready to place our manufacturing site in India. The Prime Minister of India and the Government of India have been creating stable conditions and this is because the Indian leadership has been pursuing India comes first policy and we believe that investments in India are profitable,"" the Russian President said.Additionally, Putin discussed the significance of Russia's import substitution programme within the Brics framework, highlighting SME development and the necessity for swift dispute resolution mechanisms for SMEs in Brics+ nations.He also mentioned the success of new Russian brands replacing Western brands, stating achievements in various sectors including consumer goods, IT, high-technology, and agriculture.""For us, it has special relevance as part of the import substitution program, we advent of new Russian brands entering our market, which are replacing the brands by Western partners who have voluntarily left our market. And our local manufacturers have been quite successful not only in consumer goods but also in IT and high tech,"" he said.""In agriculture, the number of our manufacturers and producers keeps growing. In 1988, the Soviet Union imported grain for $35 billion, and last year, we exported grain to the tune of $66 billion, and this is largely the merit of our farmers and producers. And in all these sectors of the Russian Federation, including high-tech ones, there is an acute need to expand opportunities to sell and export products,"" he added.Putin also called for stronger cooperation amongst Brics nations to support SME growth and requested member nations to evaluate primary areas for collaboration during the forthcoming summit in Brazil next year.""I would ask colleagues of the Brics corporation to analyse the situation on the main areas of cooperation, and we will definitely draw the attention of Brazilian colleagues who will chair Brics next year,"" he said.","Russian President Vladimir Putin praised India for establishing ""stable conditions"" for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) He also compared the "" Make in India "" initiative with Russia's import substitution programme.

From parched earth to green pastures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-parched-earth-to-green-pastures/articleshow/115988556.cms,"Trigger for the project

Public-private partnership

Timing is crucial

In the dust bowl of Khaman Kheda in Madhya Pradesh, Dev Yadav, a local farmer, marvels at his wheat fields. Ever since fresh life was infused into the once-dry local lake in 2022, his crops need three times less water and yields have doubled, which Yadav believes is nothing short of remarkable.“I can now plant two crops of wheat and lentils, even in the drier months,” he says.Just a few kilometres away, in Serwai village, summer used to mean dry waterbodies and plummeting groundwater levels, making livestock rearing nearly impossible.“But so much more is possible now,” says Santosh Patel. “Every family had only about two cows to supply milk for their home consumption. Now that the ‘talaab’ (pond) stays full longer, we can rear more livestock and earn from milk sales,” he added.These stories of prosperity rippling across villages are the humane side of a waterbodies rejuvenation project by ATE Chandra Foundation that manages philanthropic initiatives of the ATE Group, an engineering firm founded in 1939 as part of India’s freedom movement.The foundation, driven by the personal efforts of Archana and Amit Chandra, is focused on improving income and sustainability of small and marginal farmers in India since 2015. While they’ve been partnering with ministries and charities to achieve these and helped conserve 1,500 acres of forests, their standout project has been tackling rural water problems by rejuvenating old waterbodies across India.Since 2016, the foundation has breathed new life into 5,000 lakes, ponds and tanks, spanning 7,000 villages across seven states.The trigger for the project was the epidemic of farmer suicides in Maharashtra. Gayatri Nair Lobo, the foundation’s CEO, recalls how small and marginal farmers, burdened with loans to buy seeds and fertilisers, were pushed to the brink every time monsoons failed.“While loan waivers by the govt only offered temporary relief, we realised we needed a sustainable solution to allow farmers live with dignity, and not on dole-outs,” she says.The foundation knew they had to tackle the problem at its root —dependence on rain. “We explored a few existing solutions and identified one that focused on rejuvenating existing but no longer usable waterbodies,” explains Lobo.Their pilot project, the foundation said, took root at the Akoladev Dam in Maharashtra’s Jalna district, driven by enthused farmers and a demand for nutrient-rich silt that would reduce their need for costly fertilisers.“We figured out that all the lakes and ponds in Maharashtra could hold water three times the capacity of Bhakra Nangal Dam. The demand from farmers and the feedback that we got pushed us to do more,” she further said.However, given the limitations of funding a project solely with the foundation’s resources, they began collaborating with the govt. The public-private partnership allowed them to expand across Maharashtra and initiate pilot projects in other states, including Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, starting in 2022.While the govt bears 30% of the cost to hire necessary machinery, the rest of the cost to rejuvenate a waterbody is covered by local farmers and communities that help remove silt, which, they believe, “creates a strong sense of ownership to maintain the water-bodies in the long run”.With the foundation and the govt joining hands under the ‘Gaalmukt Dharan, Gaalyukt Shivar’ (silt free water res ervoirs and silt applied farms) scheme, farmers such as Dasharath Kalidas Hirve in Bhoom district of Osmanabad are transforming barren stretches into fertile fields.Suresh Survase in Dindegaon is hopeful of a bountiful harvest this year. “Because it will also increase the water holding capacity of our dam and we all will get water for cash crops,” he reasoned.Rejuvenating waterbodies is a multi-step process that the foundation has refined over time. Lobo breaks it down into clear steps. First, dry waterbodies are identified.“We use an app to determine which ones have the potential for groundwater percolation. Next, a local NGO engages with the community to educate farmers about the benefits of silt application and generate demand for the silt.On a predetermined date, machinery such as a backhoe loader or excavator is hired. Farmers line up with their tractors to collect the silt, apply it to their fields, and return for more,” says Lobo, adding that timing is crucial since the work needs to be completed between mid-April and mid-June, when the waterbody is dry.Tapping into local wisdom has been the key, given that many communities have their age-old ways of managing water.“The NGO we select for a district identifies village elders who weigh in, especially on silt quality and application techniques,” Lobo adds. So, how do they prevent future silting?“Our experience shows these waterbodies stay healthy for eight to ten years,” she says, adding that this ensures a higher return on investment. “For a very small cost per litre of water storage, you get a functioning waterbody with all its benefits for almost a decade.”(Know about any such inspiring story?

NEW DELHI: A short while after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Naresh Balyan was granted bail in an extortion case by a Delhi court on Wednesday, he was arrested again by Delhi Police in a separate FIR. Balyan was taken into custody on charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). He will be produced in Dwarka court on Thursday.Reacting to the fresh arrest, AAP said, ""BJP yet again misused its agencies and imposed MCOCA, misusing terrorism laws on the legislators of AAP. This arrest is only to silence Arvind Kejriwal , who is regularly questioning Union home minister Amit Shah on the failed law and order situation in Delhi.""During the hearing of his bail plea in the extortion case Wednesday, Delhi Police informed the court that they would arrest the MLA under MCOCA. ""We will be arresting him right now,"" special public prosecutor Akhand Pratap Singh submitted before the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Paras Dalal, who rejected the prosecution's request for 14-day judicial custody.Advocate Sujan Singh and others appeared for Balyan. The court dismissed their plea for his arrest in a fresh case filed under MCOCA, saying there can be no direction from it to IO, who may proceed as per law. The court said the plea was not maintainable. The court, saying it is not convinced with the investigation carried so far, observed, ""The alleged audio clip which is the main link of alleged criminal conspiracy betweengangster Kapil and present accused/applicant has yet not been forensically examined or verified despite having been seized 15 months back.""Noting that Balyan himself filed three complaints dated Dec 19, 2023, March 7, 2023 and May 5, 2023 of having received threats from gangster Kapil, the court said that the three victims who joined the investigation denied having ever heard about the involvement of Balyan with gangster Kapil's gang.""The investigation cannot pick and choose as to the evidence gathered during investigation. It was the duty of IO to forthwith investigate the authenticity of the alleged audio conversation seized in Aug 2023 and then even the complaints of the accused/ applicant should have been investigated. Till date, no other associate of accused/ applicant has been named or arrested. There is no evidence of any criminal nexus till date and no money trail has been found in the investigation. Even all the allegations are of year 2023 and none of the victims is stated to have been threatened since then,"" said the court.The court also granted one day to Balyan's counsel to file a reply on prosecution's application to collect his voice sample. In the morning, police had moved an application before the court of additional sessions judge Vandana Jain in Dwarka court seeking Balyan's interrogation in relation to the MCOCA case while he was in police custody in the extortion case. The Dwarka court allowed this application. In the evening, police told the court of ACJM Dalal in Rouse Avenue that they were arresting Balyan as he did not cooperate during the interrogation.In a statement, AAP said, ""Delhi is becoming a den of gangsters and extortionists. Balyan is himself a victim who received threats to life and extortion calls from gangsters against whom he filed five written complaints from 2022 and 2023 but no action was taken. On the contrary, false cases have been fabricated by BJP against him. However, people of Delhi are aware of these tactics and will deliver a fitting response in the assembly elections.""","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Naresh Balyan was granted bail in an extortion case by a Delhi court.

The Enforcement Directorate has unearthed a syndicate in Delhi-NCR where a few chartered accountants , company secretaries and crypto traders got together, scripted a cyber fraud racket and collected more than Rs 640 crore.During a search operation between Nov 28 and Nov 30, two CAs - Ajay and Vipin Yadav - and a crypto trader, Jitendra Kaswan, were arrested. Further investigation unearthed a large-scale money laundering racket operated with the assistance of handlers sitting abroad and through closely held chat groups on instant messaging apps.When ED officials raided the premises of CA Ashok Kumar Sharma, in Bijwasan in Delhi last week, associates of the accused attacked the team, injuring an official. The others were saved by CRPF and Delhi Police personnel.

PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""","Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

Badal, in blue 'sewadar' uniform, was at the entrance of the Golden Temple in his wheelchair, serving his punishment. He has a fractured leg.According to the police, the assailant was identified as Narayan Singh Chaura who was immediately taken into custody.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra's caretaker chief minister Eknath Shinde on Wednesday took a cheeky dig at his ally Ajit Pawar - reminding the NCP chief of an early-morning oath as deputy chief minister in 2019 for a stint that lasted just 4 days.In 2019, when the undivided Shiv Sena of Uddhav Thackeray parted ways with the BJP over the chief minister's post, Ajit Pawar rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis to form a government in an early-morning operation that caught everyone by surprise. However, the government lasted for only 4 days as Ajit Pawar failed to muster the support of NCP MLAs.Also read: Fadnavis joins list of CMs who lasted a week or less On Wednesday, when the Mahayuti leaders met Maharashtra governor CP Radhakrishnan, the spotlight was on Shinde who had been upset over being denied a second term as Mahayuti chief minister and had still not cleared the air on assuming the role of deputy chief minister under CM-elect Fadnavis.When reporters asked Shinde if he would take oath as deputy chief minister along with Ajit Pawar in Mahayuti 2.0, the Shiv Sena chief said ""Wait till evening ... .""However, Ajit Pawar, who was sitting next to Shinde, interjected to say that he was definetely taking oath tomorrow along with Fadnavis. ""Sham tak unka samajh aayega (We will know about Shinde by evening), I will take it (oath), I will not wait,"" Ajit Pawar said.Ajit Pawar's readiness to take oath as deputy CM evoked an instant response from Shinde, who responded with a cheeky dig: ""Dada (Ajit Pawar) has experience of taking (oath) both in the morning and evening."" While this evoked laughter all around, it did remind everyone of Ajit Pawar's failed rebellion against Sharad Pawar in 2019.Shinde then was part of undivided Shiv Sena under Uddhav Thackeray - who had plunged the NDA into crisis by refusing to back Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister after their alliance had won a comfortable majority in the assembly.While Shiv Sena and BJP shared a great rapport in Mahayuti 1.0, Shinde's insistence on second term as Mahayuti chief minister after the 2024 assembly election results tested their bonhomie. In the last 11 days, when Shiv Sena made repeated claims for the top post, Ajit Pawar played his cards well and backed the BJP and Devendra Fadnavis to the hilt. While hectic negotiations were on, a Shiv Sena leader admitted that Ajit Pawar's NCP had reduced their bargaining power vis-à-vis the BJP. Little wonder, Eknath Shinde's remarks at Ajit Pawar may well be more than a light-hearted banter between allies.",Ajit Pawar rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis to form a government in an early-morning operation.

Devendra Fadnavis' invitation card for CM oath ceremony has special gift for his mother,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/devendra-fadnavis-invitation-card-for-cm-oath-ceremony-has-special-gift-for-his-mother/articleshow/115970707.cms,"Maharashtra govt formation: What’s in a name? Devendra Fadnavis adds his mother’s name to CM swearing-in invite

NEW DELHI: As Devendra Fadnavis prepares to take the oath as Maharashtra’s chief minister for the third time, a detail on the official invitation has sparked curiosity. The invite for the swearing-in ceremony, issued by chief secretary Sujata Saunik, refers to him as ""Devendra Sarita Gangadharrao Fadnavis,"" incorporating his mother Sarita’s name—a first in his political career.While it is customary for Maharashtra residents to use their father’s name as their middle name, this addition is a departure from tradition. Fadnavis had used only ""Gangadhar"" as his middle name during his previous swearing-in ceremonies in 2014 and 2019, as well as in his affidavit for the recent Assembly elections. The move has been interpreted as a personal homage to his mother, who has been a staunch supporter of his political journey.Sarita Fadnavis , who often shies away from the limelight, expressed pride in her son’s achievements after the BJP’s victory in the state elections. ""Everyone in the party wants him to be chief minister again. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi regards him as a son,"" she said.The invitation detail adds a layer of personal significance to an otherwise political event. Preparations for the swearing-in at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan are in their final stages, with invitations extended to top political figures and dignitaries.Born into a Brahmin family, Fadnavis faced personal loss early in life when his father, Gangadhar Fadnavis—a Jan Sangh and BJP leader—passed away during his teens. Despite these challenges, Fadnavis carved his path in politics, becoming one of the youngest leaders to hold the chief minister’s post in Maharashtra.His wife, Amruta Fadnavis, a banker and social activist, and their daughter Divija are expected to attend the grand event.","Devendra Fadnavis will be sworn in as Maharashtra's chief minister for the third time.

Sukhbir Badal is safe. I condemn this incident. But one thing is clear that a big conspiracy is being hatched to ruin and defame Punjab and Punjabis and behind this many big forces are involved.""He contrasted the Punjab Police's vigilance with the situation in BJP-ruled Delhi, saying, ""Murders are taking place openly in Delhi, shootouts are taking place openly, the entire capital is in the control of gangsters, drugs are being sold everywhere, women are being raped, the entire BJP becomes silent, and their top leaders say that crime is not an issue, law and order is not an issue in Delhi.""Read also: Sukhbir Singh assassination bid: How alert 'sewadar' saved life of SAD leader at Golden Temple The attack occurred at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, where Badal was performing 'sewadar' duties as part of atonement for ""mistakes"" during SAD's tenure from 2007 to 2017. The assailant, identified as Narain Singh Chaura, fired a shot that missed Badal after being deflected by a bystander. Chaura, reportedly a former militant with a criminal history, was overpowered on the spot and arrested.BJP National Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa condemned the attack, terming it a ""grave breach of security and sanctity"" of Sri Harmandir Sahib. He held the AAP government responsible for the deteriorating law and order situation in Punjab.Sirsa stated on social media, ""Shocking and condemnable! An attack on S. Sukhbir Singh Badal in the sacred premises of Sri Harmandir Sahib is not just a security lapse but a grave breach of the sanctity of our religious institutions. AAP Govt has failed to ensure the safety of citizens and uphold the dignity of holy places.""He further criticised AAP leaders, saying, ""Ever since Aam Aadmi Party has come to Punjab, there is no law and order. Gangsters are ruling from jail... Punjab is being run from jail. Today, the law and order situation has deteriorated, and security has deteriorated in Punjab to such an extent that even a single person is not safe.""The assassination attempt has sparked a fresh political controversy, with both AAP and BJP trading barbs over governance and law enforcement in Punjab and Delhi. Authorities are investigating the motive behind the attack and Chaura's links to militant activities.Meanwhile, over attack on Sukhbir Singh Badal, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia condemned the law and order situation in Punjab and said, ""The situation is out of control. If the police had caught the man (accused shooter Narain Singh Chaura) two days ago, then I would have said that the situation was under control...A high court-monitored probe is required in this incident...If the Police knew that this man was roaming there, then were the Police waiting for him to shoot?...""""Narain Singh Chaura, a man against whom at least 30 cases are registered and was roaming there for last 3 days. AAP government says that Police are deployed there. Was the Police sleeping? I have shared videos of the man (accused shooter) conducted recee both today and yesterday. He came close to Sukhbir ji many times. If no one is safe in Golden Temple, then you can imagine what is the law & order situation in Punjab. This is the Punjab where Lawrence Bishnoi was interviewed in jail. This govt also gave protection to those guilty of Sidhu Moosewala killing...Narain Singh Chaura is son of Channan Singh Chaura. Channan Singh's second son is Narender Singh Bajwa who is the right-hand man of Sukhi Randhawa...Whenever there is a Congress govt Narain Chaura comes out...I have shared what connection this family has with Congress,"" Majithia added.Additionally, former Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi also criticised the Punjab goverment and said, ""This is condemnable, this incident should not have happened... This is the failure of the current Punjab government, their immaturity is visible. It has become clear that they are not able to run the administration properly. Such incidents keep happening in Punjab often, but because it happened with Sukhbir Singh Badal, now people are getting to know about it. People are being extorted in cities and villages, money is being collected by threatening them. There is no law and order in the state. The administrative qualities that a leader should have are not there in our Chief Minister. Another direct reason for this attack on Sukhbir Singh Badal is that people have anger and resentment against him which has now come to the fore.""","Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal condemned the assassination attempt on Sukhbir Singh Badal. He praised the Punjab Police for their vigilance in preventing a major incident. He criticised the BJP government for lawlessness in Delhi and other BJP-ruled states. The attack occurred at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, where Badal was performing'sewadar' duties.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115972864,imgsize-948814,width-400,resizemode-4/115972864.jpg"

LUCKNOW: On Tuesday morning, the cargo bay authorities of Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport intercepted and halted the shipment of a fetus destined for Mumbai via flight.The fetus was dispatched by a city-based IVF centre for a Mumbai-based laboratory. However, the IVF centre had not disclosed the presence of the fetus in the consignment package to the courier company who had sent the package to cargo bay for expedited delivery.Upon scanning at the airport cargo bay, the fetus was detected, prompting immediate notification to the courier company representatives.Speaking to TOI, the courier company staff, requesting anonymity, said, ""The fetus consignment has been returned to the IVF centre, as they never informed us about it.""According to specialists, a deceased specimen must be properly embalmed before air transport, otherwise it risks substantial deterioration during transit, predominantly due to swift decomposition triggered by fluctuations in pressure and temperature during flight, potentially resulting in fluid seepage and subsequent damage to the container or coffin.","The fetus was dispatched by a city-based IVF centre for a Mumbai-based laboratory.

'No justification for such actions': Jama Masjid Shahi Imam condemns injustices against Hindus in Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-for-such-actions-jama-masjid-shahi-imam-condemns-injustices-against-hindus-in-bangladesh/articleshow/115941926.cms,"Syed Ahmed Bukhari (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges. Das is currently in custody in Bangladesh.","Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh.

Earlier, our decision was to stop eating beef near temples, but now we have expanded it to the entire state.

Speaking to the media last Sunday, he had said he was open to prohibiting beef consumption in Assam if the Congress submitted a written request. This statement followed allegations by Congress leaders, including Rakibul Hussain, who accused the BJP of distributing beef to secure votes in the recent bypolls in the Muslim-majority Samaguri constituency.","The Assam government on Wednesday announced a complete ban on serving and consuming beef in restaurants, hotels, public functions, and other community spaces.

NEW DELHI: BJP's Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday met Maharashtra governor C P Radhakrishnan and staked claim to form Mahayuti 2.0 ending days of suspense over government formation in the state after the ruling coalition's landslide victory in the assembly elections. However, there is still no clarity if caretaker chief minister Eknath Shinde will join the government as his deputy.Shinde, who addressed the media after the meeting of Mahayuti leaders with the governor, said ""wait till evening"" when asked about his future role in the government. This was after Fadnavis revealed that Shinde was still undecided on joining the Mahayuti cabinet. Fadnavis maintained that Shinde will play a key role in the government but did not elaborate on what that role would be.""I met Eknath Shinde yesterday and requested him to join the Mahayuti cabinet. All of us, including shiv Sena MLAs, want him to be part of the state cabinet. I am sure he will join the government,"" Fadnavis said after meeting the governor.Shinde, who became the chief minister in 2022 after he rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray and joined hands with the BJP, was keen on a second term after the Mahayuti registered a spectacular victory in the just-concluded assembly elections under his leadership. However, the BJP, which won 132 seats in the 288-member assembly, was clear about leading the government this time. With BJP firm on role reversal, Shinde eventually agreed to leaving the top post for the senior partner.""There is no one too big or small in the Mahayuti. We are working as a team. Two and a half years ago, Fadnavis proposed my name as chief minister. Today, I have proposed Fadnavis's name as the next chief minister,"" Shinde said.Immediately after the results were out, Shiv Sena leaders had orchestrated a campaign for Shinde to continue as Mahayuti's chief minister citing the Bihar model where BJP's junior partner Nitish Kumar is leading the government. Shiv Sena leaders claimed that Mahayuti's spectacular victory was due to Shinde's governance as the chief minister and hence he deserved a second term. Four days after the November 23 mandate, Shinde finally announced that he will abide by the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on the chief minister pick.","BJP's Devendra Fadnavis met Maharashtra governor C P Radhakrishnan and staked claim to form Mahayuti 2.0.

Changed Mahayuti dynamics? Ajit Pawar's NCP seeks parity with Shinde's Shiv Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/changed-mahayuti-dynamics-ajit-pawars-ncp-seeks-parity-with-shindes-shiv-sena-citing-partys-strike-rate/articleshow/115939740.cms,"Ajit Pawar (left) and Eknath Shinde

NEW DELHI: Has the dynamics within Maharashtra's ruling Mahayuti changed? Ajit Pawar 's NCP , which had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS, after Mahayuti's dismal performance in Lok Sabha elections, seems to have moved closer to the BJP after the assembly elections.With the Shiv Sena playing hardball over the CM's post attributing the spectacular 'Maha' results to Eknath Shinde 's performance as chief minister, Ajit Pawar threw his weight behind Devendra Fadnavis and helped the BJP counter Sena's pressure games.The NCP has openly sought parity with Shiv Sena arguing that their strike rate in assembly elections is better than Shinde Sena and hence they deserve the same number of seats in the new government.""If we look at the strike rate in our alliance, the BJP is number one, followed by Ajit Dada's group in second place and the Shinde group in third place. So, our strike rate is also good and we demand that we get as much representation as they do,"" senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said as the three allies sit together to decide power sharing in Mahayuti 2.0.Bhujbal's claim is contrary to the facts as Shiv Sena's strike rate of 70.4% (57/81) is slightly better than NCP which owns 41 of the 59 seats it contested at a strike rate of 69.5%. The BJP, meanwhile, was way ahead of its allies with a strike rate of 88.5% - winning 132 of the 149 seats it contested.The BJP and the Shiv Sena had come together in 2022 - after Eknath Shinde led a successful revolt against Uddhav Thackeray leading to the fall of the opposition's MVA government. The BJP then gave the CM's post to Shinde and made Fadnavis work as his deputy in a move that surprised everyone.Ajit Pawar joined the NDA government almost a year later after leading a successful revolt against his uncle Sharad Pawar and became the second deputy chief minister of the Mahayuti government. Both Shinde and Pawar eventually got complete control of their parties, including the official names and symbols.However, after the Lok Sabha elections, Ajit Pawar, who could win only one seat, stared at a tense future in Mahayuti while Eknath Shinde consolidated his position as a Hindutva ally of the BJP. The RSS openly attacked the BJP for including NCP in the alliance.The assembly elections marked the reversal of fortunes for Ajit Pawar as he decimated rival Sharad Pawar's faction of NCP and won an impressive 41 seats. When the Shiv Sena, with 57 seats, demanded the chief minister's post again for Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar played the spoilsport as he openly backed BJP's Devendra Fadnavis who led the saffron party to a record performance of 132 seats.In the last 10 days, while Eknath Shinde sulked and his Shiv Sena bargained hard, Ajit Pawar, who is sure of deputy CM post again, played his cards well and backed the BJP. One of the Sena leaders admitted that Ajit Pawar's NCP had reduced his party's bargaining power vis-à-vis the BJP.The BJP has given Shinde Sena a long rope despite being only 13 seats short of majority in the 288-member assembly. When it comes to a numbers game, the BJP perhaps could do without either of the two allies.However, the BJP, which made a bold statement in 2022 by making junior partner Shinde the chief minister, may not want to do away with the accrued gains by riding roughshod over its Hindutva ally in the state. By unilaterally announcing December 5 as the oath-ceremony date, the BJP has already given a strong signal that it will be calling the shots in Mahayuti 2.0.","Ajit Pawar's NCP had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS.

They are saying that if we come back in a few days then they will let us go,"" Rahul Gandhi said.""This is against the rights of the LoP and against the Constitution. We just want to go to Sambhal and see what happened there, we want to meet the people. My constitutional right is not being given to me.

Hospitals garner 50% share in healthcare FDI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hospitals-garner-50-share-in-healthcare-fdi/articleshow/115985131.cms,"NEW DELHI: Deal-making in India's healthcare sector has surged in recent years, with hospitals now commanding the largest share of foreign direct investment (FDI) within the sector. In FY24, hospitals accounted for 50% of the FDI in total healthcare, translating to $1.5 billion. This marks a significant increase, as the share of hospitals in healthcare FDI has more than doubled from 24% in FY21, and has been rising from 43% in FY20, underscoring their growing prominence.The trend also reflects a strengthening investor preference for hospitals, alongside the traditionally favoured pharmaceuticals sector.Historically, the pharmaceuticals sector, including APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients), has been the investor favourite, attracting multi-billion-dollar deals. However, post-Covid, the hospital and diagnostics sector has come into the spotlight, drawing a wave of investors and culminating in top-dollar buyouts of major chains such as Manipal and Max. Last week, Aster DM Healthcare announced its decision to merge with Quality Care India.""Hospitals have been at the centre of PE interest over the last few months. The size of the Indian market, relatively underserved markets outside the urban areas, high incidence of disease burden and growth in insurance (both public and private), will continue to fuel growth. Given the demand, there is still a long road for growth. Hence the optimism,'' Sujay Shetty, global health industries advisory leader, PwC India said.One of the major deals last year was Temasek's acquisition of an additional 41% stake in Manipal Hospitals for $2 billion, valuing the company at $4.8 billion.""The country needs investment in quality healthcare and healthcare facilities to reach its goal of a $5 trillion economy. The hospital sector is capital intensive and not really a dividend-paying sector. The sector is reinvesting its profits to create infrastructure, which is demonstrated by the largest capital investment cycle undertaken in the history of our sector, the promise of which is showing up in valuations. At Max alone, we are in the midst of doubling our capacity over the next three years at a cost of over Rs 5,000 crore,"" Abhay Soi, CMD, Max Healthcare stated.Further, hospitals have garnered significant investor attention due to a surge in primary market transactions. With six hospitals completing their IPOs, interest from new investors - primarily private equity seeking ownership - has increased, analysts told TOI.Over FY24-27, plans of the 10 listed Indian hospital firms indicate that their combined bed capacity is set to rise by 47%, with most of the expansion planned in north and south India, Tausif Shaikh, a BNP Paribas analyst said in a recent note.During the four-year period, the listing of seven new large hospital chains on the bourses bolstered the growth, collectively raising around Rs 3,600 crore as primary funding during IPO/QIPS (qualified institutional placements), analysts told TOI.","In FY24, hospitals accounted for 50% of the FDI in total healthcare, translating to $1.5 billion. This marks a significant increase, as the share of hospitals in healthcare FDI has more than doubled from 24% in FY21. Trend also reflects a strengthening investor preference for hospitals, alongside the traditionally favoured pharmaceuticals sector.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115985193,imgsize-18784,width-400,resizemode-4/115985193.jpg"
Attack on former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal shows rise of radical fringe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attack-on-former-punjab-dy-cm-sukhbir-singh-badal-shows-rise-of-radical-fringe/articleshow/115985062.cms,"NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal narrowly escaped assassination while undergoing religious punishment outside Golden Temple on Wednesday when an alert plainclothes cop lunged and pushed pro-Khalistan hardliner Narain Singh Chaura 's gun hand upward, causing the shot to go wide. The shooter had come within a few feet of Badal.The timely intervention of ASI Jasbir Singh in Sukhbir's security detail, and a sewadar (volunteer) who helped overpower the gunman, averted a tragedy. The attack, which occurred around 9.30am, was filmed by reporters covering Day 2 of Sukhbir's penance.Police said Sukhbir was unhurt. Clad in a blue sewadar uniform, the SAD president was sitting at the Golden Temple entrance at the time and had a placard around his neck as part of the ""tankhah"" religious punishment pronounced by the Akal Takht for religious misconduct during his father Parkash Singh Badal's tenure as CM from 2007 to 2017.It was the ubiquitous 'Sikh moderates vs radicals' tug-of-war on display as history-sheeter and highly-radicalised pro-Khalistan terrorist Narain Singh Chaura aimed his weapon at former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, scion of the 'moderate' Badal family.According to an ex-IPS officer from Punjab, the sensational assassination attempt by a terrorist who has been involved in serious offences like murder, attempt to murder, possession of arms and explosives and militancy in the past, and was in constant touch with the leadership of Sikh terrorists outfits based in Pakistan, was the manifestation of the discontent and religious extremism simmering in Punjab for almost two decades.Particularly between 2007 and 2017, when the 'moderate' Badals were in office, the 'radical fringe' voices in the Sikh diaspora grew shriller, using social media as a vehicle to influence and indoctrinate new generation that has no living memory of how their families had suffered at the height of Sikh terror and who only seem to have seen the romanticised, pro-Khalistan propaganda fed to them online.""The 'radical extremism' sentiment seems to have only gained momentum in the wake of the farmers' protests/unrest, dominated by agriculturists from Punjab,"" added another officer.Pakistan not only sheltered the leadership of prominent pro-Khalistan outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and Khalistan Tiger Force for the past several years, but also continued to press on the pro-Khalistan pedal through projects like the Sikhs for Justice's 'Khalistan Referendum 2020'.The Sikh diaspora, in which the extremists seem to hold sway, provided funding and resources to pro-Khalistan elements, even as Pakistan-backed actors whipped up communal tensions and ensured a steady supply of arms. That even laws like UAPA could not hold back terrorists like Chaura for long, enabling him to get relief from the courts and go back to extremist activities, made the threat of radicals crushing any moderate voices, even more real.""Those born after 1993, when Sikh militancy had faded out due to a tough police crackdown and dominance of moderate voices, were in the past two decades fed on lies that 1.5 lakh people were killed in the militancy era, when the actual number of deaths was around 22,000, including 1,800 police personnel. Radical voices like Simranjit Singh Mann building a popular base by fighting polls and the emergence of radical leaders like Waaris Panjab De chief Amritpal Singh are proof that pro-Khalistan sentiments have been on the rise in Punjab,"" said a former intelligence officer.The solution, several officers told TOI, lay in promoting moderate voices to neutralise 'radical fringe', strengthening police's hands to deal with extremists and tightening anti-terror laws.","Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal narrowly escaped assassination.

GHAZIABAD: A Congress convoy led by Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was stopped at UP Gate on the Delhi-Ghaziabad border on Wednesday morning while it was on its way to violence-hit Sambhal.The incident triggered a political controversy and derailed peak-hour traffic on Delhi-Meerut Expressway, with a jam stretching back nearly 6km in Delhi, affecting vehicles all the way till Mayur Vihar.After Congress's announcement about the visit a day before, UP Police on Wednesday deployed around 100 cops at the border and put up multiple tiers of barricades on DME to block the Gandhis' route to Sambhal.As the convoy reached the border around 10.30am and was told it cannot proceed, Congress functionaries raised anti-govt slogans while the Gandhi siblings were seen arguing with cops to let them go through.A senior officer of Ghaziabad police said they ""handed over a notice to Rahul Gandhi"" that said prohibitory orders under BNSS Section 163 were in place in Sambhal and the Congress team would not be allowed to proceed. Emerging from their car, the Gandhis said UP Police's action was ""unconstitutional"".Rahul said it was his right as LoP to go to the west UP district where five people were killed in violence during a court-ordered survey of a Mughal-era mosque in Nov.""As LoP, it is my constitutional right to be able to visit Sambhal. I am ready to go alone. I am ready to go with the police but they did not accept that either.

""Maybe the situation in UP is such that they (police and authorities) cannot handle even this much. Then why do they say so arrogantly that they have taken care of law and order?"" she asked.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, who was accompanying the Gandhis, later asked if govt had something to hide. ""Why did they not let us pass,"" she said, alleging that Wednesday's incident proved how ""this govt is muzzling the voice of the opposition"".Later in the day, Rahul posted on X: ""Why is BJP scared - why is it using the police to hide its failures? Why is it suppressing the message of truth and brotherhood?""UP's deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said opposition leaders were doing ""drama"" to get minorities' votes. Brajesh Pathak, also deputy CM, said the clashes are being investigated and opposition should support govt in maintaining peace there. ""They (opposition) should go there (Sambhal) after peace is restored,"" he said.Before the Congress MPs' planned visit, Sambhal district magistrate Rajendra Pensia wrote a letter to Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad police commissioners, and Amroha and Bulandshahr SPs, urging them to stop the Gandhis at the borders of their districts due to ""communal sensitivity"".",A Congress convoy led by Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was stopped at UP Gate on the Delhi- Ghaziabad border.

He claimed the ""forcible takeover"" of his shares was part of a plan by former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Rao stated that soon after the YSRCP tenure began in 2019, the govt appointed PKF & Santhanam for a special audit. It also appointed another Mumbai auditing company for a forensic audit. PKF informed him that they had unearthed irregularities worth Rs 1,000 crore, and the report was submitted to the govt.He stated in the complaint that Vijaysai asked him to talk to Vikranth, who in turn brought the proposal of taking over his shares in KSPL. When he protested, Vikranth warned that criminal cases would be filed against him and his family members. The share transfer was done in a hurried manner without due diligence, Rao alleged, adding that Vikranth told him he was following instructions of Jagan.He further alleged that his 41.1% stake in KSPL and 48.74% stake in KSEZ were taken over for just Rs 494 crore and Rs 12 crore, respectively.

NEW DELHI: Travelling in a night bus in the dacoit-infested Banda district of Uttar Pradesh nearly four decades ago, a station officer of UP police single-handedly fought a gang of armed dacoits which had waylaid the vehicle.When the dacoits fired at him, Ram Yadav whipped out his service revolver and fired at the gang, killing their ringleader.

Yadav eagerly waited the recognition, but it never came. With passage of time, govt appeared to have forgotten about it but Yadav kept writing to his seniors.Decades later, on inquiring with the department concerned, Yadav learnt that the file containing the SP's 1989 recommendation had been lost. He then filed a writ petition before Allahabad HC, but court dismissed it saying it was barred by limitation as almost four decades had passed. He then moved SC.A bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan subsequently sought response from UP govt and also appointed senior advocate Rana Mukherjee as amicus curiae for a dignified resolution.On Wednesday, UP govt counsel Ruchira Goel informed the bench that the DGP after due verification of Yadav's documents had agreed to grant a commendation certificate to him.The bench said Yadav was honest enough to inform SC that he just wanted recognition of his bravery and not money. But the bench felt Yadav should be rewarded for his bravery that went unrecognised for 38 years, and using its discretionary powers, SC directed the state govt to give Yadav an honorarium of Rs 5 lakh.","Ram Yadav fought a gang of armed dacoits which had waylaid the vehicle.

They are not ministers. You were the minister of the department where this alleged recruitment scam took place.

Enforcement Directorate's counsel, additional solicitor general S V Raju, said the beneficial provision of the Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita did not apply as many cases are pending against Chatterjee.When Rohatgi said this reflects the sadistic attitudes of ED and CBI to get him embroiled in case after case so that he does not get out of jail on bail, the Justice Kant-led bench said, ""When the minister is the kingpin in a scam, and SC grants him bail, what message it sends to society? That a powerful and influential person can get bail? On the face of it you are corrupt.""However, the bench was quick to clarify that since the investigation is going on and there is no likelihood of trial getting completed in the near future, the court has to balance the rights of the accused with suitable conditions to ensure there is a fair investigation without any impediments.Rohatgi offered that Chatterjee would stay out of the territory of Bengal for a period of six months if that helped ED to complete investigations without apprehending any obstruction from the accused. ""Chatterjee has been removed from TMC,"" he said, indicating that he does not wield any influence through state govt.Raju opposed the bail, saying Chatterjee was the mastermind of the scam in recruitment of teachers and group C&D employees for schools, and instrumental in depriving nearly 50,000 genuine candidates of their jobs by giving these to undeserving candidates in consideration of bribes. SC reserved verdict on Chatterjee's bail plea.Rohatgi said identical were the charges against TN minister Senthil Balaji, but SC had granted him bail.

NHAI launches rating system for contractors to tackle poor highway maintenance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-launches-rating-system-for-contractors-to-tackle-poor-highway-maintenance/articleshow/115982317.cms,"NEW DELHI: Facing criticism for poor maintenance of highway stretches and the bad riding quality caused by potholes and cracks, the NHAI on Wednesday launched a mechanism to rate contractors engaged in the operation and maintenance of such stretches. Contractors scoring less than 60 out of 100 will be declared “non-performers”, reducing their chances of securing new projects.The scores and ratings will be based on an objective assessment of five main parameters: roughness, potholes, rut depth, surface cracking, patchwork, and ravelling (dislodging of coarse aggregate on the surface). They will be uploaded on the NHAI website and its social media handles, which, officials said, is aimed at encouraging contractors to improve their performance.The focus on highway maintenance has gained significance, considering that over the past 10 years, approximately 95,000 km of national highways and expressways have been widened or constructed.NHAI will deploy network survey vehicles (NSVs) fitted with cameras and sensors on the NH network to assess the condition. Officials said the NSVs will capture details of every 100 meters of the NH and the data will be transferred to a central database automatically within 48 hours for processing and actions.Officials said that to begin with 21,000 km of network under NHAI will be covered and in the next phase another 24,000 km will be brought under this regime. They added that the NSVs will cover every NH stretch once in six months.TOI has learnt that at present 7-8 NSVs are deployed for collecting and feeding data into the system, but till now this was being done manually. “In the new system we will have no manual intervention as the 3D details will be captured by cameras and sensors. This data will be transferred seamlessly and it will be processed within 10 days. Subsequently, the system will generate notices for the contractors concerned for taking corrective action.

NEW DELHI: The Maha political drama over the chief minister's post in Maharashtra's Mahayuti finally ended today with Eknath Shinde proposing the name of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as the next leader of the ruling coalition. However, it is still not clear if Shinde will join the government as deputy chief minister.It took Shinde 11 days to finally agree to a change of leadership after BJP rejected his demand for a second term as chief minister of the Mahayuti.Here's how the drama unfolded after Maharashtra results were announced on November 23.The people of Maharashtra gave an overwhelming majority to the ruling Mahayuti with the ruling coalition winning 230 seats in the 288-member assembly. The BJP achieved remarkable success securing 132 seats on its own, just 13 less than simple majority. Allies Shiv Sena and NCP also performed exceptionally well winning 57 and 41 seats respectively.Immediately after the verdict, chief minister Eknath Shinde attributed the huge electoral success to his government's performance in the last two and a half years. Shinde claimed that the welfare programmes announced by his government, including the Ladki Bahin scheme, were the gamechangers in the elections. Shiv Sena then started its push for second term to Shinde citing his popularity and governance model.The Shiv Sena leaders started an orchestrated campaign for Shinde as chief minister. The party claimed that the BJP had promised to give the top post to Shinde if the Mahayuti won the elections. They put up posters demanding Shinde as leader of Mahayuti and also tweaked PM Modi's ""Ek hain to safe hain"" slogan to claim ""Ek(nath) hain to safe hain."" Some Sena leaders pitched for Shinde citing the Bihar model where BJP's junior partner Nitish Kumar is the chief minister of the state.After four days of silence, Shinde finally addressed a press conference to announce that he will not be an obstacle in the formation of new government and will accept the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah on Mahayuti's chief minister pick. However, he also used the presser to list the achievements of his government and announced that the work done by his government in two and a half years was more than what other governments would do in 10 years. He also called his tenure historic. Shinde also played the victim card and claimed that for him CM meant common man and not chief minister. The Shiv Sena chief cited his humble origins to claim how he as chief minister understood the pains of common man.A day after Shinde's climbdown on CM post, the Mahayuti leaders finally met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda in the national capital on November 28 to discuss the modalities of forming the new government. However, the meeting could not finalise the power sharing agreement and Shinde, Fadavis and Ajit Pawar decided to meet again on November 29 in Mumbai.However, this scheduled meeting of the three Mahayuti leaders in Mumbai could not take place as Shinde suddenly left Mumbai for his native village in Satara. The Shiv Sena leaders added to the suspense as they gave different reasons for Shinde's sudden absence from Mumbai. While one leader claimed he was unwell and hence had gone to village to take rest, another Sena leader claimed that Shinde was planning a big decision and hence had gone to his native village.With Shinde still sulking, the BJP decided to take control and unilaterally announced December 5 as the date for the swearing in of the Mahayuti 2.0 government. The Maharashtra BJP chief announced the date sending out a clear message to Shinde.A day after BJP's surprise move, Shinde announced that a meeting of Mahayuti leaders will be held in Mumbai on December 1. Shinde also returned from Satara to Mumbai signalling truce.However, the proposed Mahayuti leaders's meeting had to be cancelled again due to the unavailability of caretaker chief minister Shinde, who decided to go to his Thane residence as per doctor's advice for rest.The BJP, however, went ahead with its preparations for the swearing in ceremony. It appointed Nirmala Sitharaman and Vijay Rupani as party's central observers for BJP legislature party meeting on December 4.Shinde finally returned to Mumbai on December 3 after visiting a hospital in Thane for medical tests. He held a meeting with concerned officials to take stock of the preparations for the event to be held at Chaityabhoomi on the death anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar on December 6. Following this meeting, Fadnavis went to CM house to meet Shinde.At the legislature party meeting held in Vidhan Bhawan earlier in the day, former Gujarat CM and BJP's central observer Vijay Rupani announced that Fadnavis has been unanimously elected the BJP legislature party leader.Later, Fadnavis alongwith Shinde and Ajit Pawar, met with state Governor CP Radhakrishnan to formally stake claim to form the government, presenting letters of support from coalition partners, including the Shiv Sena and the NCP.However, there is still no clarity if Shinde will join the government.(With inputs from agencies)",Eknath Shinde proposes Devendra Fadnavis as the next leader of the ruling coalition. It is still not clear if Shindes will join the government as deputy chief minister. It took 11 days to finally agree to a change of leadership after BJP rejected his demand for a second term.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115981377,imgsize-1470059,width-400,resizemode-4/115981377.jpg"

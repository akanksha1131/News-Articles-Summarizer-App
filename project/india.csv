Rise of Islamists In Bangladesh Sparks Alarm As Sheikh Hasina’s Son Warns India of Imminent Threat

GUWAHATI: Assam Police and BSF, in a joint operation Sunday, sent 19 illegal immigrants back to Bangladesh. The individuals were apprehended from Nagaon and Karbi Anglong.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma described the move as a ""full Doomsday moment"" for infiltrators. In an X post, he said they had ""disappeared from India, reappeared in their hell hole. "" ""Message is crystal clear - Illegal stay in Assam? Endgame guaranteed,"" he wrote on social media, emphasising state govt's firm stance against illegal immigration.Officials involved in the operation stated that the deportation was part of a broader campaign to address illegal settlements posing a threat to Assam's demographic balance and security. The swift and decisive action serves as a warning to those considering Assam as a potential refuge, they said.This operation aligns with Sarma's ongoing efforts to protect Assam's identity, reinforcing a no-nonsense approach to illegal immigration, officials said.","Assam Police and BSF, in a joint operation Sunday, sent 19 illegal immigrants back to Bangladesh.

Sarod player forced to flee Bangladesh hiding Indian identity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sarod-player-forced-to-flee-bangladesh-hiding-indian-identity/articleshow/126111929.cms,".

KOLKATA: A Kolkata-based sarod player with family roots in Bangladesh and an illustrious legacy in the world of music had to flee the neighbouring country when the venue was vandalised hours before his programme, leaving him shocked and his tabla player still stuck there.Shiraz Ali Khan had a concert scheduled at Chhayanaut in Dhaka on Dec 19. But hours before the scheduled programme, the culture hub was vandalised amid a nationwide spiral of unrest triggered by the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a radical leader who played a key role in last year's anti-Hasina protests.Shiraz managed to ""flee"" to Kolkata on Saturday evening, suppressing his Indian identity on the way. His tabla player is still stuck there and hoping to return on Monday.Shiraz's father is Ustad Dhyanesh Khan, son of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and grandson of Baba Allauddin Khan. Although based in Kolkata, Shiraz's family has roots across the border. His great-grandfather, Ustad Allauddin Khan, was from Brahmanbaria. ""Some years ago, a college in Ustad Allauddin Khan's name (in Brahmanbaria) was attacked. But the attack on Chhayanaut is an unimaginable assault on our culture and shared values,"" Shiraz said.Shiraz arrived in Dhaka on Dec 16, in time for a jazz concert on Dec 17 in Banani. His major classical music recital was scheduled for Dec 19. ""Despite the small gathering of 17-18 people, the experience (in Banani) was heartfelt. I didn't expect that days later, tragedy would hit our musical community. On the morning of Dec 19, I learned about the attack on Chhayanaut. I couldn't believe the building where I was to perform was destroyed. Seeing the disturbing images was beyond belief, especially as someone who holds music and its sacredness in the highest regard,"" Shiraz told TOI.While trying to leave Dhaka, Shiraz was stopped at a checkpoint. ""I was asked if I had foreign currency. Fortunately, I didn't. For the first time, I didn't mention my Indian identity. Aware of anti-India sentiments, I spoke in the Brahmanbaria dialect. My mother, from Brahmanbaria, settled in India after her marriage in 1968. I learned the dialect from her,"" he said.Shiraz's Khan surname helped. ""People thought I was from Bangladesh, not India. I never thought I'd have to hide my Indian identity. I gave my Indian passport and phone to the driver, who kept them in the car's dashboard. I got them back at the airport. I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't concealed my identity. My mother is still in Bangladesh. My Hindu accompanists are also stranded in Dhaka. I won't reveal their names for their safety,"" he said, adding he ""won't return"" to ""Bangladesh until artists, music, and cultural institutions are respected and protected"".","Shiraz Ali Khan had a concert scheduled at Chhayanaut in Dhaka on Dec 19.

India T20Is vs New Zealand:

India T20 World Cup:

Chief selector Ajit Agarkar on Saturday announced India’s squads for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup and the five-match T20I series against New Zealand. The T20I series will begin on January 21 in Nagpur and will serve as India’s final assignment in the format before the global tournament, scheduled from February 7 to March 8.India have been drawn in Group A for the T20 World Cup, alongside Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States. The hosts will open their campaign against the USA on February 7 in Mumbai.Despite a lean run with the bat in the recently concluded T20I series against South Africa, which India won 3–1, Suryakumar Yadav has been entrusted with the captaincy for the marquee event. In 20 matches and 18 innings this year, Suryakumar has scored 213 runs at an average of 14.20, striking at just over 125, without registering a single half-century.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanSuryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanIndia’s T20 World Cup squad sees some major changes. Notably, Shubman Gill , who was India’s vice-captain in the T20 setup, has been dropped, with all-rounder Axar Patel named as the new vice-captain.Gill had struggled to find form since opening the innings. Brought back into the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan, his performances remained underwhelming. In 15 T20 matches since his comeback, Gill has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, failing to register a single fifty.Meanwhile, Sanju Samson, who had performed exceptionally well, including scoring three centuries as an opener, was moved down the order. His Asia Cup performance was mixed, though he finished as India’s third-highest run-scorer with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma (314) and Tilak Varma (213). A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 yielded little impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.In the last T20 against South Africa, Samson opened the innings again and scored a solid 37 off 22 balls, giving India a good start. The team management now plans to return to their original composition of playing a wicketkeeper at the top. Consequently, Jitesh Sharma has been dropped, and Ishan Kishan has been drafted as the second keeper.Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out. Kishan comes off a stellar domestic season in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he captained Jharkhand to their maiden T20 title. He finished the season as the highest run-scorer, amassing 517 runs in 10 games at an average of 57.44 and a strike rate of 197.","Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out.

Why the Mumbai Maidans are being ignored? | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya produced a blistering display of power-hitting to lead India to a commanding 30-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad on Friday, sealing the five-match series 3-1. Pandya’s explosive knock set the tone as India piled up a daunting 231 for 5.Pandya smashed a 16-ball half-century — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals — on his way to a stunning 63 off just 25 deliveries. His innings was laced with five boundaries and five towering sixes.The carnage was complemented by Tilak Varma, who continued his rich vein of form with a fluent 73. Together, the duo stitched a punishing 105-run partnership for the fourth wicket that completely wrested momentum away from the visitors.One of Pandya’s massive sixes led to an unexpected moment off the field when the ball struck a cameraman stationed near the boundary.Showing concern beyond the contest, Pandya immediately walked up to check on the cameraman’s well-being after his innings, ensuring he was attended to and even helping apply an ice pack.Pandya also hugged the cameraman, a gesture that quickly went viral and earned widespread praise from fans.In reply, South Africa began positively and remained in the chase as long as Quinton de Kock was at the crease. The left-hander scored a fighting 65, but once he was dismissed, the innings unravelled rapidly. Varun Chakravarthy spun a web around the middle order, claiming four wickets as South Africa lost seven wickets for 81 runs to finish on 201 for 8.Pandya’s all-round impact and match-defining innings earned him the Player of the Match award.""Winning games is what you play for and it’s always exciting when your contribution helps the team get over the line. No, I actually didn’t know (he has the second fastest fifty for India) until I got out and went back. Our social media guys told me I was the second-fastest,"" Pandya said.Watch the video here ""My first reaction was, “Ah, I missed the top spot!” But happy that Yuvi pa holds that record. Today I just felt it. I actually told my partner beforehand that I was going to step out first ball and try to hit it for six. I was confident it would come off,"" he said.""The situation suited my style; I backed myself and it worked. I took a calculated risk and thankfully it went my way. I’ve always enjoyed the challenge. No matter how many setbacks you face, the aim is to come back stronger, better, and make a bigger impact. When it all comes together, it feels satisfying.

Mahayuti sweeps Phase 1 of Maharashtra local body polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahayuti-sweeps-phase-1-of-maharashtra-local-body-polls/articleshow/126109839.cms,"Image: IANS

PUNE/NAGPUR: BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra's civic elections, winning presidents' posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, mirroring its assembly election performance just over a year ago. Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was reduced to 44 posts.Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.BJP emerged as biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, cementing the position of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena secured 53 posts, while Ajit Pawar's NCP won 37.""We have won 117 presidents' posts, and more than 75% posts are with our Mahayuti partners. This is a repeat of the assembly election,"" Fadnavis said.CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “Compared to 2017, our elected representatives have doubled… This is the biggest win in local elections in the last 25 years for any party.”Final results of the 6,859 councillor seats were not released by the state election commission till the time of going to press. But BJP claimed to have won over 3,000 of these seats.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, Congress checked BJP advances in parts of Vidarbha.Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground. Meanwhile, BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. Shinde expanded Sena’s footprint beyond Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.North Maharashtra backed BJP strongly, especially in Jalgaon under minister Girish Mahajan. In Marathwada, expected gains from leaders such as Ashok Chavan and Munde cousins failed to materialise. Congress won just 28 civic bodies statewide. Sharad Pawar-led NCP managed seven, while Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena secured nine.Vidarbha delivered a fractured verdict. Congress halted BJP in several councils from Chandrapur to Buldhana and Ballarpur to Wardha, while BJP retained dominance in Nagpur, Gadchiroli and parts of Bhandara.Ajit Pawar-led NCP won 35 of 41 seats in Baramati region, the same undivided NCP had won in 2017. NCP (SP), led by Sharad Pawar, managed to win only one seat, while BSP and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) also won a seat each. Three seats went to Independent candidates while BJP failed to open its account.The outcome is seen as a curtain-raiser to municipal corporation polls due Jan 15 and comes amid anger over flood-hit kharif crops and opposition charges that funds were diverted to populist schemes such as Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. Polls also marked first statewide civic exercise after Shiv Sena and NCP splits, consolidating Shinde and Ajit Pawar as undisputed leaders of their factions.Biggest beneficiary remains Fadnavis. After BJP’s poor 2024 Lok Sabha showing — nine of 48 seats — and his offer to resign, he led Mahayuti to an assembly landslide of over 230 seats, with BJP winning 132. Opposition allegations of “vote chori” and EVM manipulation resurfaced but lost traction after civic sweep.Analysts blamed MVA for failing to capitalise on farm distress. Former CM Prithviraj Chavan admitted Congress could not raise youth and farmer issues effectively.","Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.

He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control. The body was recovered and sent to the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital for autopsy. No case has been filed so far. “We are searching for his relatives.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance on Sunday recorded a sweeping win in Maharashtra’s local body polls, winning elections to 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats by securing 207 local body president posts and leaving the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi with a combined total of 44.As per the State Election Commission’s data, the BJP emerged as the single largest party with 117 municipal presidents, followed by the Shiv Sena with 53 and the NCP with 37. On the opposition side, the Congress won 28 posts, Shiv Sena (UBT) nine, and the NCP (SP) seven.Other registered parties accounted for four additional posts, while 28 municipal president seats were won by unrecognised registered parties. Independents secured five posts, the Commission said.Counting of votes for 286 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, conducted in two phases, showed the BJP emerging as the single largest party.Earlier, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis reacting to the results said, “48 per cent councillors have been elected on the BJP symbol, which is a record. The BJP has created another record with 3,300 councillors being elected from the party. BJP candidates have been elected as presidents in 129 municipal councils.In 75 per cent of the local bodies, Mahayuti nominees have been elected as municipal presidents.”He attributed the success to the party organisation and the government’s development agenda, noting, “It is the team effort – the organisation and government. We fought the polls on the development plank. I led a positive campaign on the development agenda. I never criticised any political leader or party. I solicited votes on the development agenda, the work done by the government so far, and our blueprint for the future. ”PM Narendra Modi hailed the results of the local body polls saying people of Maharastra stand with development. He went on to congratulate the Mahayuti for the victory.In a post on X PM said, ""Maharashtra stands firmly with development! Grateful to the people of Maharashtra for blessing the BJP and Mahayuti in the Municipal Council and Nagar Panchayat elections. This reflects trust in our vision of people-centric development. We remain committed to working with renewed energy to fulfil the aspirations of every citizen across the state. I laud the BJP and Mahayuti Karyakartas for their hardwork at the grassroots. ""Mahayuti allies - including BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s NCP - contested in some areas against each other. While opposition parties, mainly Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT), conceded defeat and raised allegations. There were alliances as well as ""friendly fights"" among Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents as well. .State Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal congratulated winning candidates but added, in a comment, that the state election commission “helped” the ruling alliance. Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders accused the Mahayuti of using “money and muscle power” and alleged EVM tampering, PTI reported.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said the victory of Mahayuti was because of ""tampering"" of EVMs. He added the opposition couldn't withstand a ""hailstorm"" of money.His party colleague Ambadas Danve alleged ""money and muscle power"" shaped the Mahayuti win.""The Mahayuti has bagged a larger number of seats as compared to constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, thanks to the muscle and money power deployed by the ruling parties,"" Danve told PTI in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.BJP state president Ravindra Chavan described the results as a “decisive mandate,” claiming Mahayuti had won more than 250 councils, nagar parishads, and nagar panchayats, with BJP candidates securing 134 council chief posts and over 3,000 councillor seats.""The Opposition levelled all kinds of allegations during the campaign, but people saw through them. Uddhav Thackeray himself said he had nothing to offer to the people and that is why his party was rejected. His party could not even win council chairperson posts in double digits,"" Chavan claimed.He went on to say, ""Now, Mumbaikars too would reject the opposition's narrative in the upcoming BMC polls.""Union minister Nitin Gadkari called it an “overwhelming success” and “a victory for our workers.”While the Mahayuti largely dominated the elections, Congress and NCP retained control in some areas, including Chandrapur, Sangli, and Loha, with wins in Palghar for the Shiv Sena and in Nanded for Marathwada Janhit Party.Recounting was ordered in Kamptee municipal council after a narrow 116-vote BJP victory, officials said.","The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance won elections to 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats by securing 207 local body president posts.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.

"Electoral bonds scrapped by SC, trusts now swell BJP coffers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/electoral-bonds-scrapped-by-sc-trusts-now-swell-bjp-coffers/articleshow/126108961.cms,"Vaping, Bhow-Bhow & Shouting Match: A Look At Viral Moments Of Parl As Chaotic Winter Session Ends

NEW DELHI: Rather than having an adverse impact on BJP's coffers, scrapping of electoral bonds in Feb 2024 ended up boosting its donations kitty in 2024-25, with electoral trusts alone disbursing over Rs 3,577 crore to the party.In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts. With electoral bonds scrapped, corporate donors still seeking partial anonymity - as regards party-wise break-up of their contributions - appear to have settled for the electoral trust (ET) route while retaining BJP as the top beneficiary.The party in office at the Centre cornered 83.6% of the nearly Rs 4,276 crore contributions routed through electorate trusts, according to data on the EC website. Compared to 2023-24, this marks an over four-fold rise in corporate donations to BJP through this route. Congress accounted for 7.3% and Trinamool Congress for 3.6% of contributions made through the ET route.The donations via electoral trusts are only a part of total contributions received by parties. The other sources include individuals, corporates, institutions and welfare bodies donating directly. Over the past years, the volume of non-trust donations has consistently exceeded that from contributions via trusts.Of the Rs 3,577.5 crore contribution receipts of BJP in 2024-25 though trusts, Rs 2,180.7 crore was disbursed by Prudent Electoral Trust (ET), Rs 757.6 crore by Progressive ET, Rs 460 crore by A B General ET, Rs 150 crore by New Democratic ET, Rs 30.1 crore by Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore by Triumph ET, Rs 5 crore by Jaybharath ET, Rs 3 crore by Samaj ET, Rs 9.5 lakh by Jankalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh by Einzigartig ET.Congress received Rs 216.3 crore from Prudent in 2024-25, Rs 77.3 crore from Progressive, Rs 15 crore from AB General ET, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 via the trust route.Prudent maintained its position as the top trust donor to political parties, having disbursed a total of Rs 2,668 crore to 15 parties in the last financial year. The Tata Group-linked Progressive ET was a distant second with its total contributions at Rs 915 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 757 crore went to BJP, Rs 77 crore to Congress and Rs 10 crore to eight other parties.Prudent's Rs 2,668 crore kitty was distributed among BJP (Rs 2,180.7 crore); Congress (Rs 216.3 crore); Trinamool Congress (Rs 92 crore); YSR Congress Party (Rs 88 crore); TDP (Rs 40 crore); AAP (Rs 16.4 crore); Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (Rs 10 crore); BRS, JDU, BJD and AJSU (Rs 5 crore each); Sikkim Democratic Front (Rs 2.5 crore); LJP and NCP (Rs 1 crore each); and Praja Shanthi Party (Rs 50 lakh).A B General ET made Rs 460 crore worth of corporate donations to BJP and Rs 15 crore to Congress. The Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore contributions to BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each. Triumph disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati Electoral Trust disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.Congress's receipts in 2024-25 fell way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24 but were higher than its Rs 171 crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC's Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, were no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore receipts in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but also its receipts from trusts, which dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.","In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts.

Congress — survival, not dominance

NEW DELHI: The ruling NDA led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had a lot to cheer in 2025 with decisive victories in Delhi and Bihar - the two states where assembly elections were held this year. For the opposition, 2025 was a year of disappointments. While the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP was defeated in Delhi, the Mahagathbandhan of Congress, Lalu Prasad’s RJD and the Left was decimated in Bihar.But 2026 could be an opportunity for the opposition to bounce back as four states and one Union Territory – West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu , Assam and Puducherry — will vote to choose their new assemblies. Except Assam, which is ruled by the BJP, the opposition has a dominant presence in the other three states.With polls due between March and May 2026, parties have already begun calibrating strategies and sharpening their pitch to voters.In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee ’s Trinamool Congress will be defending its fortress as it seeks to hold off a renewed BJP push, while the Congress and Left will make another effort to recover lost political ground.In Kerala, the CPM-led LDF is eyeing an unprecedented third consecutive term — a feat unheard of in the state’s traditional pendulum-like politics.Tamil Nadu is preparing for another round of the Dravidian duel, with the DMK and AIADMK once again anchoring the state’s political battlefield.In Assam, the BJP-led NDA under Himanta Biswa Sarma will fight to hold the state even as the Congress looks to stage a revival.Meanwhile, in Puducherry, N Rangasamy’s AINRC–BJP coalition faces the challenge of holding together a fragile alliance against a DMK seeking to widen its footprint and a weakened Congress attempting a comeback.A key undercurrent across these contests is the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, extended to several poll-bound states including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The 2026 elections will therefore unfold on updated voter lists — a factor that could change a lot of things.Buoyed by its sweeping win in the recent Bihar assembly elections, the BJP has made its ambitions clear: Bengal is the saffron party's next battleground.Ahead of the 2026 polls, the BJP is pushing hard to turn momentum into seats. Meanwhile, the TMC, which won 213 of the 294 assembly seats in 2021 with roughly 48% vote share, is back in full campaign mode, defending a fortress it has held for over a decade. With the Congress party struggling to regain its footing, the stage is set for a high-stakes political showdown.From a modest presence in 2016 with just 3 seats, the BJP surged to 77 seats and approximately 38% of the vote share in 2021. The 2026 elections will test whether this was a temporary surge or the beginning of a sustained challenge to the TMC's dominance in Bengal.With 213+ seats and 48% vote share in 2021, Mamata Banerjee enters 2026 as the incumbent with the widest lead. She has already begun mobilisation and outreach, but the real challenge is holding this high ceiling in the face of anti-incumbency and a more aggressive BJP than before.From being a dominant force pre-2011 to being almost wiped out in 2021, Congress is now battling for visibility. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s removal and Subhankar Sarkar’s appointment hasn’t yet translated into a loud political message or campaign repositioning leaving Congress still searching for footing.With the future of the opposition's INDIA bloc uncertain and Mamata Banerjee repeatedly hinting that TMC will contest Bengal alone, Congress risks being caught between two compulsions: aligning nationally versus confronting TMC locally.""Bengal is ours, we will fight here alone,” the West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already declared.Additionally, the 2026 elections will be conducted under a Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls. Changes in voter registrations, particularly in minority-heavy or urban constituencies, could significantly impact the margins in key swing seats.Tamil Nadu is gearing up not only for another showdown between Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), but also for a potentially game-changing third force.The entry of TVK under Vijay has made Tamil Nadu assembly elections in the state all the more interesting.The ruling DMK enters 2026 from a position of strength, having secured 133 seats on its own in the previous assembly election. However, the party faces a tougher political landscape this time, with the AIADMK–BJP alliance regrouped and better aligned than in 2021. Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin has already announced that the party will contest the state polls as part of the INDIA bloc, calling it an ideological partnership built on shared goals.The real test, however, lies in whether DMK can overcome anti-incumbency pressures, defend its welfare and governance record, and manage voter expectations on issues like jobs, NEET exemption and power tariffs.The 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly election is a high-stakes battle for the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which is desperately looking for a comeback after two consecutive electoral defeats. The big question for 2026 is whether the renewed AIADMK–BJP partnership can translate into seats. In 2021, the AIADMK-led front won 75 seats, while the BJP remained a secondary force. However, together they remain the largest challenger bloc to the ruling DMK. Edappadi K. Palaniswami has already set the tone, vowing that the front will “shatter Stalin’s dream of winning 200 seats” and predicting that the alliance could cross 210.A key factor that complicates the opposition arithmetic is the entry of actor Vijay with his party, the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), whose decision to contest alone threatens to split the anti-DMK vote.The 2026 Tamil Nadu election is the crucial electoral debut for actor Vijay’s TVK, who has boldly declared the contest as a ""TVK versus DMK"" fight and positioned himself as the alternative to “Stalin uncle”. Vijay has massive youth following and has a potential surprise factor to disrupt the traditional bipolar contest. However, the tragic Karur stampede that claimed 41 lives during one of his pre-poll roadshows casts a significant negative shadow. The incident has been heavily leveraged by the opposition, forcing Vijay and the TVK to defend their competence and win public trust.In Assam, the BJP-led NDA under the leadership of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. who has become one of the party’s most prominent regional faces, will fight to hold the state, aiming to secure an unprecedented third consecutive term.Despite the 75 seats won in 2021, anti-incumbency remains a major underlying challenge. Chief minister Sarma, however, has set an aggressive target, confidently claiming the NDA is capable of winning ""104 out of 126 seats"".The Congress, which won 50 seats in 2021, is desperate for a comeback, led by the newly appointed state chief, Gaurav Gogoi. The party is trying to leverage the ""10-year anti-incumbency"" against the BJP, with Gogoi stating, ""After 10 years of BJP's corrupt and authoritarian rule, the people of Assam want change.""This election is a personal test for Gogoi, who must prove he can translate his Lok Sabha victory into a wider assembly-level revival for the party.Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF won 16 seats in 2021, performing strongly in Muslim-majority pockets. A breakup with Congress or a solo contest could split the opposition vote — benefiting BJP in triangular fights.Kerala heads into 2026 with one of the rarest scenarios in its electoral history — a ruling front attempting to win a third consecutive term. The CPI(M)-led LDF broke the state’s alternating pattern in 2021, winning 99 of 140 seats while the Congress-led UDF slipped to 41, and the BJP once again failed to open its account.The LDF has never won three consecutive assemblies in Kerala’s democratic history. For the CPI(M), which leads the front, this election is critical as Kerala remains the only major state where the Left is currently in power on its own strength. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who will again lead the front, is campaigning on the theme of ""continuity for progress."" Senior CPI(M) leaders, like KN Balagopal, have publicly stated that ""continuity was vital to maintain the momentum"" of development and welfare policies. However, the LDF faces a significant anti-incumbency challenge, which the opposition is leveraging to counter the government’s claims of development.UDF dropped from 47 seats in 2016 to 41 in 2021, still holding a sizable vote share but struggling to convert it. 2026 is the coalition’s best opportunity to regain ground if anti-incumbency builds. A weak result could push UDF further into inertia, shrinking the Congress footprint in another southern state.BJP has contested aggressively for two cycles but holds zero MLA seats in Kerala. If it breaks that barrier in 2026 — even with 1–3 wins — it changes the dynamics of the House. If it fails again, Kerala remains one of the last major states outside BJP’s elected footprint.In Puducherry, N Rangasamy’s AINRC–BJP coalition faces the challenge of holding together a fragile alliance against a resurgent DMK seeking to widen its footprint and a weakened Congress attempting a comeback.The ruling NDA is led by the All India NR Congress (AINRC) and BJP. In 2021, the AINRC won 10 seats and the BJP won 6 seats. This coalition is under immense pressure due to internal discord and anti-incumbency. The internal rift was brought to the forefront by the resignation of a lone Dalit minister AK Sai J Saravanan Kumar, on the decision of the high command.The move triggered strong reactions and exposed deeper fault lines within the coalition and the local BJP unit.The DMK entered the 2021 Puducherry polls with limited ground presence but still emerged with 6 seats, overtaking the Congress to become the largest opposition party. For 2026, the main challenge for DMK would be to widen its footprint in the Union territory and convert influence into numbers.Like in many other states, the Congress is fighting for survival in Puducherry too. Once the ruling party here, it has slipped to the margins since the 2021 election. For Congress, 2026 is not about winning power; it is about preventing irrelevance. A tally of 5–6 seats keeps it alive; anything below that accelerates decline. The grand old party must survive before it can compete.The Election Commission’s SIR of electoral rolls has already raised the pitch in these states, with the BJP strongly backing the exercise while the opposition accusing the poll body of helping the saffron party gain an advantage over its political opponents. 2026 is clearly all set for interesting electoral contests.","The ruling NDA led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had a lot to cheer in 2025 with decisive victories in Delhi and Bihar. But 2026 could be an opportunity for the opposition to bounce back as four states and one Union Territory – West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Puducherry — will vote.

Sikh Nagar Kirtan In New Zealand Disrupted By Protesters; Mann, Badal Urge Centre To Intervene

NEW DELHI: Senior Sikh leader and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday condemned the disruption of a peaceful Sikh Nagar Kirtan procession in South Auckland, New Zealand, expressing concern over the threat posed to religious freedom and communal harmony.Sharing a video of the incident on X, Badal said, “Nagar Kirtan is a sacred Sikh tradition—a joyous religious parade involving the singing of hymns from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, promoting devotion, unity, and sharing of blessings with all humanity. I am glad to note that the Sikh community responded with remarkable restraint and peace despite provocation—true to Guru Sahib’s teachings of ‘Chardi kala’ and ‘Sarbat Da Bhala’. ”“Such intimidation threatens religious freedom and the spirit of universal brotherhood,” he added.Badal further urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene and raise the matter with the New Zealand government to “protect the rights of the Indian diaspora.”On Saturday, a Sikh religious procession in New Zealand was disrupted by a group of ‘Patriot’ protesters. According to reports by the NZ Herald, the group was linked to political leader Brian Tamaki’s Destiny Church, a Christian fundamentalist religious organisation.In a video shared on Tamaki’s social media, members of a group calling themselves the True Patriots of NZ were seen confronting the Sikh procession as it moved along the street. The group described themselves as “Guardians of the Kiwi Way of Life.

Experts on Aravalli

The road ahead

If demography can be a dividend, geography certainly decides its destiny. Few landscapes illustrate this more clearly than the Aravalli Range, an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India.The hills that run for nearly 690 km from Gujarat through Rajasthan and Haryana to Delhi, forming the oldest fold mountain system in the subcontinent, have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate.At the heart of the issue is a simple but emotive question. What exactly counts as the Aravalli range? The answer matters because this classification determines which areas can be mined, built upon, or conserved.A recent ruling by the Supreme Court has accepted a ""standard definition"" proposed by the central government to identify what qualifies as the Aravalli Hills. While the move was intended to bring clarity to long-standing disputes, the definition’s limited ecological lens has raised fresh concerns about environmental protection and sustainable development.In November, the Supreme Court agreed with a proposal by the central government on how the Aravalli hills should be officially identified.The court said that only those hills that rise at least 100 metres above the surrounding land, or groups of such hills located close to each other, will be considered part of the Aravalli range for regulatory purposes.The court also asked the Union government to carefully map the region and prepare a clear plan for managing it. This plan will include rules on where mining can take place and how it should be regulated. The aim is to remove confusion caused by different government records and maps, which have often led to disputes and court cases in the past.Environmental experts maintain the significance of the Aravalli hills is not about how tall they are, but about what they do.The hills work like a natural water storage system, with their rocky structure allowing rainwater to slowly seep underground and refill aquifers. These aquifers supply water to many towns in Rajasthan and big cities such as Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, and Alwar. Studies even show that large-scale mining and cutting of hills damage this process, leading to long-term loss of groundwater.The Aravallis also help slow the spread of the Thar Desert towards eastern India. Scientists warn that if the hills continue to be damaged, desertification could increase, along with dust storms and extreme heat in the Indo-Gangetic plains.Although the region is dry, the Aravalli hills support forests, scrubland and grasslands. These habitats are home to wildlife such as leopards, hyenas, nilgai and many bird species. Conservationists say these ecosystems are fragile and can be easily broken apart by mining and construction.The current controversy is primarily rooted in decades of judicial scrutiny. Since the 1980s, courts have intervened repeatedly to curb unregulated mining in the Aravalli belt, particularly in Rajasthan and Haryana.Multiple Supreme Court orders in the 1990s and early 2000s restricted mining in notified forest areas, citing environmental degradation, air pollution and public health risks. However, enforcement remained weak due to the absence of a universally accepted definition of what constituted the Aravalli range.Mining operators and developers often argued that certain hillocks or plateaus did not legally qualify as Aravallis, even if they were ecologically linked to the system. This ambiguity reportedly created administrative paralysis and prolonged litigation, prompting the Centre to seek a standardised definition.Government officials and legal experts defending the Supreme Court’s ruling argue that the elevation-based criterion introduces clarity into a highly subjective domain. They say that by setting a measurable threshold, authorities can avoid arbitrary decisions and reduce disputes over land classification.In its observation, the top court acknowledged the need to balance environmental protection with economic realities. Mining of stone and minerals in the Aravalli region supports livelihoods and supplies essential materials for construction and infrastructure. A blanket ban, the SC noted, could have severe economic consequences if not backed by clear scientific and legal parameters.The ruling has drawn criticism from ecologists, hydrologists, and civil society groups who believe that the 100-meter threshold oversimplifies a complex landscape like the Aravalli.They point out that many ecologically critical features of the Aravalli system, including recharge zones, wildlife corridors and low-lying ridges, do not meet the elevation criterion but are vital to the range’s environmental function. Excluding these areas from automatic protection, critics say, could open the door to expanded mining and construction.Experts also warn that mining impacts are cumulative, as even shallow or small-scale extraction can permanently alter drainage patterns and soil stability, consequently reducing the land’s ability to absorb rainfall. In arid and semi-arid regions, such damage is often irreversible.Once this order is implemented in full force, which is for mining purposes, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said, ""tomorrow it could be real estate or other things that could begin in the region, which is also the main fear of the locals of the entire region.""Disagreeing with the new definition of Aravalli, Jha said, ""the mountain is not just a piece of rock assembled together. Aravalli, which is the oldest mountain range in the world, is also an ecosystem."" He said, ""If mining is allowed...Aravalli, which is above the ground, is also under the ground. So it's not just the tree cover, green cover, or the national dust shield or weather shield it provides, but at the end of the day, temperature and air quality between Thar and Delhi are maintained because of the shield of the Aravalli. ""Shedding light on the risk arising from the new definition that ""lifts the protection,"" he said, risk is that all of this will be a large-scale plundering of this area and not just by mining, but also by other areas like real estate.""Once we start calling it a forest and not a range, and it falls under a semi-urban landscape or rural landscape rather than a protected landscape, it will be open for any kind of exploitation through economic-commercial activity,"" he told TOI.Talking about the impact on the Delhi-NCR region, which witnesses toxic-air-driven health hazards every year, Jha said, ""Firstly, desertification increases when we compromise with the buffer we have. Secondly, when the dust increases, the PM10 level we have in the Delhi-NCR is pathetic and therefore the risk or the intensity of air quality increases. Aravalli's entire area is also the main water recharge table, so the water sufficiency of the region is also questioned because of mining. ""Magasaysay awardee Rajendra Singh, known as the ""Waterman of India,"" said earlier governments and courts took nature and environmental issues seriously, but that approach has disappeared.""If this decision, meant to benefit one individual, is implemented, only 7-8 per cent of the Aravalli will survive,"" he told news agency PTI, calling for a legal battle as well as mass public mobilisation.The Supreme Court’s directive to conduct scientific mapping is now seen as the critical next step. Environmental lawyers say the outcome will depend on how comprehensively the mapping exercise incorporates hydrology, biodiversity and geomorphology, rather than focusing solely on elevation. Transparency will also be key.Civil society groups have demanded that maps and management plans be made public and subjected to independent scientific review. Without such safeguards, they argue, the process risks becoming a procedural formality rather than a tool for genuine conservation.At its core, the Aravalli debate reflects a broader challenge in India’s environmental governance. How to reconcile development pressures with the protection of natural systems that do not conform neatly to administrative boundaries or numerical thresholds.As climate stress intensifies and water scarcity deepens across north-west India, the fate of the Aravalli range carries implications far beyond the hills themselves. Whether the Supreme Court’s attempt at regulatory clarity strengthens or weakens environmental protection will depend on how the ruling is implemented on the ground, which ultimately remains at the mercy of bureaucracy.For now, India’s oldest mountain range stands at a crossroads, its fate being debated and defined by modern institutions that are only a moment in time compared to the ancient geology they now seek to regulate.","The Aravalli Range is an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India.

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns expressed in certain quarters over the possibility of expansion of mining activities in the Aravali Hills and Ranges in the wake of its new uniform definition, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was absolutely wrong to conclude that the mining is permitted in all landforms below 100 metres height as there has been no relaxation made at all in the Aravali.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravali can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravali is protected and secure,” he posted on X.The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat. Only a very small area is under permitted mining leases and out of this small percentage, nearly 90 % of the mining activity is confined to Rajasthan, followed by about 9% in Gujarat and about 1% in Haryana. No mining activity is permitted in Delhi.Yaav said the Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metre of two adjoining hills of height of 100 metres or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease, said the minister.He also clarified the issue in detail in response to a media query on the sidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s meeting at Unesco World Heritage Site Sundarbans.The question pertained to the recent Supreme Court's acceptance of uniform policy level definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges specifically in the context of regulating mining.Yadav, however, emphasised that all the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease.The Opposition parties had raised the issue in the Parliament during the concluded winter session, claiming that the definition would exclude most of the Aravali range from protection. In the wake of the SC's Nov order of accepting the Centre-backed definition, Congress general secretary and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh called the move a severe blow to the Aravali ecosystem.""The Aravalli Hills extend from Delhi through Haryana and Rajasthan to Gujarat. Over the years they have been devastated by mining, construction, and other activities in violation of all regulations and laws. Now it appears that this sensitive and sprawling ecosystem will be subject to another severe blow,"" Ramesh had posted on X.Referring to media reports, he had said, ""This definition is meant to restrict mining but in reality will mean that 90% of the Aravalli Hills will not be counted as Aravalli any more. Evidently, the Supreme Court has accepted this revised definition. This is bizarre and will have very grave environmental and public health consequences. It calls for an immediate review.""Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too opened a front against the SC recent move, blaming the Centre for pitching for that uniform definition. Yadav on Sunday, however, appealed to everyone to ""stop spreading confusion"" and even explained how the Rajasthan government has been following the definition since 2006.His ministry also explained that all Aravali range states/UT during deliberations agreed to adopt the uniform criterion of “100 metres above local relief” for regulating mining in the Aravalli region as had been in force in Rajasthan while unanimously agreeing to make it more objective and transparent.""All the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease. Similarly, Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metres of two adjoining Hills of height 100 metre or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease,"" the ministry clarified.By defining Aravalli Hills as any landform rising 100 metres or more above local relief, along with their supporting slopes, the entire ecological unit is protected. This prevents piecemeal exploitation of slopes or foothills that are vital for soil stability, water recharge, and vegetation cover.""","The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat. Only a very small area is under permitted mining leases and out of this small percentage, nearly 90 % of the mining activity is confined to Rajasthin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126106665,imgsize-1036421,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-62.jpg"

India Rejects Dhaka Media Reports On Protest Outside Bangladesh HC, Flags Attack Against Minorities

Bangladesh unrest

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday rejected reports of the Bangladesh media as ""misleading propaganda"" over a protest that took place outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi following the “horrendous killing” of Dipu Chandra Das, a member of the minority community, in Mymensingh. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that India is closely monitoring the situation in the neighbouring country and has voiced strong concerns over the continuing atrocities against minorities in Bangladesh.The MEA also clarified that the small group that gathered outside the high commission of Bangladesh was dispersed by police shortly after.In an official statement, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident. The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on 20 December and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh. There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes.Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign Missions/Posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention.""The MEA added, ""India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice.”Security was heightened outside the Bangladesh High Commission even as widespread violence spread across Bangladesh following the death of Osman Hadi and the mob lynching of Dipu Chandra Das.Widespread unrest swept across Bangladesh earlier this week following the death of key student activist Sharif Osman Hadi. Large groups of protesters surged through Dhaka and several other cities as anger mounted.Hadi, the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, succumbed to injuries after an assassination attempt in Dhaka, according to an official statement issued by the ministry of foreign affairs in Singapore. His death triggered massive uproar, with interim leader Muhammad Yunus vowing justice and “no leniency” for those responsible.Amid this rising turmoil, a Hindu youth, Dipu Chandra Das, was lynched by a mob in Mymensingh over alleged blasphemy, and his body was set on fire on Friday. The brutal killing drew strong outrage and condemnation in India, leading to protests outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi.","India rejects reports of the Bangladesh media as ""misleading propaganda"" Protest took place outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi following the “horrendous killing” of Dipu Chandra Das, a member of the minority community.

Three children help ego management

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday shared his views on live-in relationships while addressing a gathering in Kolkata.Speaking during the centenary celebrations of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Bhagwat said live-in relationships reflected an unwillingness to take responsibility. “You’re not ready to take responsibility. This isn’t right,” he told the audience.According to Bhagwat, those who do not wish to marry should choose a life of renunciation. “If you don’t want to get married, that’s fine. We can become sanyasis. But if you won’t even do that, and also won’t take responsibility, then how will things work?” he asked.Bhagwat also spoke about how many children a couple should have. ""The question of how many children a couple should have is a matter for the family, the bride and groom, and society. A formula cannot be given,"" he said.However, Bhagwat said he had discussed with doctors, psychologists, and demographers, who said that marrying early between 19 and 25 years of age, and having three children, was beneficial for health.""I've gained some knowledge by talking to doctors, etc and they say that if marriage takes place early, between 19-25 years of age, and there are three children, then the health of the parents and children remains good,"" Bhagwat said.He added that, according to psychologists, having three children also helps with ego management. ""Psychologists say that having three children helps people learn ego management,"" Bhagwat said.The RSS chief, however, also acknowledged that he was only sharing information he had received from others. “I am a preacher, unmarried. I don’t know anything about this matter,” Bhagwat said.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said live-in relationships reflected an unwillingness to take responsibility.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday defended the party’s high command amid the ongoing leadership issue in Karnataka, saying the “confusion” is at the local level.“The high command hasn’t created any confusion. The confusion exists at the local level. Is it right to put the blame on the high command?” he said while speaking to reporters in Kalaburagi in Karnataka, his home state.Kharge called on the Congress' local leaders to take “ownership” of the internal disputes instead of blaming the high command.The veteran politician also cautioned leaders against claiming credit for the party’s electoral successes.“Everyone has built the party. It’s not the effort of any one individual. Congress has been built by party workers. Congress workers supported us,” he stated, without naming anyone.His remarks come amid the ongoing power tussle in Karnataka between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy, DK Shivakumar , who also heads the Congress’ state unit.It has been widely reported that after the Congress won the May 2023 Karnataka assembly elections—ousting its arch-rival BJP from power—the high command had promised to make Shivakumar chief minister for the second half of the five-year term, while opting for veteran Siddaramaiah initially.Under Siddaramaiah, Karnataka's Congress government completed the first 2.5 years of its term on November 20.The chief minister on Friday expressed confidence that the party leadership would back him to complete his full five-year term.","Kharge called on the Congress' local leaders to take “ownership” of the internal disputes.

NEW DELHI: Train passengers travelling in AC coaches and non-AC passengers on Mail and Express trains will have to pay slightly more from December 26, as the Railway Ministry has increased fares by 2 paise per kilometre for these categories. A passenger travelling 500 km in a non-AC coach will have to pay Rs 10 extra.This is the second fare revision by Indian Railways during the current financial year. The previous fare revision was implemented in July.Under the current fare rationalisation, there will be no increase in fares for suburban services and Monthly Season Tickets (MSTs), which account for the largest share of railway passengers. In addition, ordinary class passengers travelling up to 215 km will not face any fare hike, a move aimed at protecting short-distance and economically weaker travellers, railway ministry sources said.For journeys beyond 215 km in ordinary class, fares will increase by 1 paise per kilometre. In Mail and Express non-AC classes, the fare hike is 2 paise per kilometre, while AC classes will also see a modest increase of 2 paise per kilometre.Indian Railways expects to earn approximately Rs 600 crore during the current year as a result of this fare rationalisation.Officials said that over the last decade, Indian Railways has significantly expanded its network and operations. With more train services, higher speeds, and a strong focus on safety, manpower requirements have increased substantially. As a result, manpower costs have risen to Rs 1.15 lakh crore, while pension liabilities have increased to Rs 60,000 crore. For the 2024–25 financial year, the total cost of operations has reached Rs 2.63 lakh crore.To manage these rising costs, officials said Railways is focusing on higher cargo loading along with limited passenger fare rationalisation.",Passengers travelling in AC coaches and non-AC passengers on Mail and Express trains will have to pay slightly more from December 26.

National Herald Case: Kharge Alleges ED Misuse, BJP Strikes Back With 'Most Corrupt Family' Dig

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Sunday said the arrest of a serving army officer in an alleged bribery case reflects the government’s “zero tolerance” approach to corruption.“The present action has been taken in line with the Government of India’s stated policy of ‘Zero Tolerance Against Corruption.’ The arrest demonstrates the government’s proactive approach to curbing corruption through legal and institutional mechanisms,” a senior defence ministry official told news agency ANI.The statement came a day after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Lieutenant Colonel Deepak Kumar Sharma and Vinod Kumar, a private individual and the alleged middleman, in connection with the case linked to defence-related clearances and favours.The premier investigative agency alleged that the duo acted as “conduits” for the delivery of bribes.Lt Col Sharma, who was serving as deputy planning officer in the Department of Defence Production under the Ministry of Defence, has been accused of “habitually engaging” in corrupt practices, including accepting bribes from private defence firms in return for undue favours.According to the CBI, the officer was in contact with a Dubai-based defence company through its representatives, Rajiv Yadav and Ravjit Singh, who are reportedly based in Bengaluru and managed the firm’s Indian operations.Investigators allege that Yadav and Singh were in regular touch with Sharma and coordinated with him to secure favourable outcomes for the company through illegal means.The case also names Lt Col Sharma’s wife, who is also a serving army officer. Colonel Kajal Bali is currently posted as the commanding officer of the 16 Infantry Division Ordnance Unit in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The FIR further mentions several unidentified individuals and a Dubai-based company.As per the CBI, on December 18, Kumar allegedly delivered a bribe of Rs 3 lakh to Sharma on behalf of the company.During searches conducted at multiple locations, the agency seized large sums of cash. A search of Lt Col Sharma’s residence in Delhi led to the recovery of Rs 2.23 crore in cash, while Rs 10 lakh was seized from the residence of Colonel Bali.The CBI carried out searches across several locations in Delhi, Sri Ganganagar, Bengaluru and Jammu as part of the probe.The officer and the alleged middleman were produced before a court on Saturday and remanded to police custody until December 23.The CBI said further investigation into the case is underway and additional aspects are being examined.","Defence ministry says arrest of army officer reflects government's 'zero tolerance' approach to corruption.

NEW DELHI: The higher reaches of Kashmir witnessed fresh snowfall while the plains received rain on Sunday, bringing relief to residents as Chillai-Kalan, the Valley’s harshest 40-day winter period, set in after a prolonged dry spell, as per PTI.Officials said snowfall was reported from the Gulmarg tourist resort in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district, where around two inches of snow had accumulated.In Sonamarg, located on the Srinagar–Kargil highway, snowfall began early Sunday morning and continued till the last reports were received.Sadhna Top, the mountain pass connecting the Tangdhar sector along the Line of Control with the rest of the Kashmir Valley, recorded moderate snowfall, with about six inches accumulating since Saturday night.Light rainfall was also reported overnight in Srinagar and other parts of the Valley and continued intermittently through Sunday, officials said.The weather department has forecast an increase in snowfall and rain across Kashmir over the next 48 hours.The precipitation has brought much-needed relief after an extended dry spell that had led to a rise in common ailments such as cough and cold, particularly among children and the elderly.The rain and snow on the first day of Chillai-Kalan are traditionally considered a good omen by locals and seen as a sign of ample snowfall in the coming weeks.Authorities said preparations were in place to deal with heavy snowfall, with arrangements reviewed for roads, power and water supply, health services and essential commodities.""I took a review of both divisions, especially areas where it is expected to snow, all districts in the Valley and the higher reaches of Jammu. The administration has finalised all preparations, but, whether that would suffice, will only be known after tomorrow when it starts to snow,"" CM Omar Abdullah said on Saturday.Despite possible hardships, the snowfall is expected to improve air quality and give a boost to winter tourism, which had suffered last year due to a largely dry winter.""Even if we face some hardships due to the snow, I do not think anyone should complain because we have been eagerly awaiting snowfall. It will clear the air, mitigate pollution, and kick off the winter tourism season,"" he added.Chillai-Kalan, also known as the “big cold”, will continue until January 30, after which the Valley will enter the milder Chillai-Khurd and Chillai-Bacha phases.","The higher reaches of Kashmir witnessed fresh snowfall while the plains received rain on Sunday.

"‘Global pecking order has changed’: Jaishankar jibes Western economic model, points to ‘political stagnation’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-pecking-order-has-changed-jaishankar-jibes-western-economic-model-points-to-political-stagnation/articleshow/126092032.cms,"'Global Order Has Changed Forever, No Single Nation Can Dominate All Issues': Says EAM Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: The external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change,” suggesting that India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.Addressing the convocation of an institute in Pune, Jaishankar said the cumulative impact of recent global developments has altered the international pecking order.“The cumulative result of all these happenings is that the global economic and, thereafter, political pecking order has actually undergone a very significant change,” he said, according to ANI.Pointing towards the shifts in the international labour market, the minister said India is increasingly becoming a driver of the global workforce.“We have started to surge in trained human resources at the very time when many developed nations are struggling to find them,” he said, adding, “Since demand and supply invariably develop their own equation, we have entered an era of mobility.”The minister also mentioned that this growing cross-border mobility now places new responsibilities on governments. “We need to ensure welfare, including in conflict situations, and the politics of this mobility needs to be managed,” he said, referring to India’s efforts to protect its citizens abroad.Reflecting on the post-colonial global order, Jaishankar said control over national destinies has shifted back to sovereign states, making policy choices a decisive factor. He noted that while China has “gained the most” since decolonisation, India has “done well, especially in the post-reform era,” and even more so over the past decade.In contrast, he criticised the Western economic model, linking current discontent to past decisions.“Western elites consciously chose to shift production to maximise profits. Their competitiveness has eroded over the years, accelerated by their lifestyle,” he said. “Much of the Western world now feels that they have stagnated, a sentiment that has increasingly come to acquire a political meaning.”Concluding his address, Jaishankar told students that national progress is shaped by leadership and governance. In India’s case, he said, “leadership and governance have led to ups and downs in various phases in our economic growth and in our social transformation,” urging them to see themselves as contributors to a “Viksit Bharat” that is increasingly shaping, not just participating in, the global order.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a ‘very significant change’ He said India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092509,imgsize-487596,width-400,resizemode-4/s-jaishankar-file-photo.jpg"

Bring to justice perpetrators of Dipu’s ‘barbaric killing’, New Delhi tells Dhaka



NEW DELHI: India hit out at Bangladesh and suspended visa operations at its mission in Chittagong on Sunday, amid a wave of protests there with an anti-India hue sparked by the death of radical activist Sharif Osman Hadi , which has seen the lynching of a Hindu man.Describing as ""horrend-ous"" the killing of 25-year-old Dipu Chandra Das, a garment factory worker beaten to death by a mob and set ablaze for alleged blasphemy, MEA slammed attempts in Bangladesh to draw false equivalence between protests targeting its facilities in that country and the one outside the Bangladesh mission in Delhi.India's assistant high commission in Chittagong suspended visa operations over concern for safety of the centre's staff and premises in view of angry protests, which saw demonstrators come close to the diplomatic facility on Thursday despite presence of Bangladesh security personnel.Due to the recent security incident, Indian visa oper-ations at IVAC Chittagong will remain suspended from Dec 21, 2025, until further notice, the Indian Visa Appli-cation Centre (IVAC) said in a statement.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in Delhi urged the interim govt in Dhaka to bring to justice the perpetrators of the “barbaric killing” of Dipu, leading Bangladesh to protest.“The incident should not be conflated with the security of minorities,” foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said in Dhaka, adding, “He was a Bangladeshi citizen who was killed, and Bangladesh took immediate action.Several arrests have already been made.”He also claimed that the protests in New Delhi left the “Bangladesh high commissioner and his family feeling threatened”.The assistant Indian high Commissioner’s residence in Chittagong was pelted with stones by a mob on Thursday, the day Hadi died days after being shot in head by masked gunmen. Thursday also saw massive “anti-India” protests outside the assistant Indian high commissions in Khulna and Rajshahi, and on Wednesday, around the high commission in Dhaka.In an apparent attempt to suggest that the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi faced a security threat of similar severity, media reports Bangladesh said a demonstration by “Hindu extremists” outside the facility over Dipu’s death in Mymensingh threatened its security, drawing a sharp rejoinder from the MEA.India trashed such claims as “misleading propaganda”. There was “no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time,” the MEA said, adding police dispersed the group after a few minutes and visual evidence of these events is publicly available. “We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident,” Jaiswal said.The MEA said about 20-25 youths had gathered outside the Bangladesh high commission on Saturday and raised slogans in protest against the “horrendous killing” of Dipu.“India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities,” Jaiswal said.Pictures of the two protests pointed out the contrast as angry protesters came in close proximity to the Indian facility in Chittagong, while a much smaller crowd stood in protest at a safe distance from the Bangladesh high commission.Exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen had on Saturday introduced another dimension to the horrific killing of Dipu, claiming on X that police had initially rescued him from the mob and asked if police with sympathies for extremists handed him back to the violent crowd determined to kill or they were overpowered. “They held a full-blown celebration — beating Dipu, hanging him, burning him — a jihadist festival,” she said.On Sunday, two more persons were held in the Mymensingh lynching case, taking the total arrests to 12.Internal situation has deteriorated in Bangladesh after the death of Haidi, a prominent face in 2024 anti-govt protests that led to then PM Sheikh Hasina abdicating & fleeing to India. Known for his anti-India utterances, he was a leader of radical group Inquilab Mancho & had shared a map of greater Bangladesh that showed India’s north east as part of his country.",India has suspended visa operations at its mission in Chittagong.

Camera data was reviewed twice daily by field teams, enabling officers to identify a safe capture window.Saturday, teams moved into position to minimise disturbance. ""Margin for error in such operations is extremely small. Every step, from tracking to flight, was planned in advance,"" an officer involved in the operation said.Wildlife veterinarians tranquillised the tigress strictly as per protocol, while ground staff secured the area to ensure there was no civilian movement. Veterinarians conducted a health examination before placing the animal in a specially-designed transport crate with proper ventilation and monitoring access.Her vitals were monitored as the crate was moved to a designated helipad inside the reserve.An Mi-17 helicopter landed at first light, and loading was completed swiftly to limit ground time. Senior veterinarians and forest officers from MP and Rajasthan accompanied the tigress onboard, monitoring her condition throughout the flight.Officials said airlifting was preferred over road transport to sharply reduce travel time and stress on the animal, and to avoid moving through forest corridors and human-dominated landscapes.The operation is being seen as a template for future inter-state tiger translocations approved by NTCA, which has approved translocation of 15 tigers from MP to Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Odisha as part of a broader conservation push.",Three-year-old tigress airlifted from Madhya Pradesh to Rajasthan on an IAF helicopter.

BULANDSHAHR: Ahead of sentencing in the brutal gang rape of a woman and her daughter at gunpoint on NH-91 in UP in 2016 which shocked the nation, one of the survivors - then a 14-year-old schoolgirl and now a 23-year-old woman studying law with hopes of becoming a judge - told TOI from an undisclosed location on Sunday that what she and her family endured in the time since the incident was ""savage and inhuman"" but they stuck together and fought on.""We changed addresses and cities multiple times to avoid recognition and harassment. But every time we were identified and vilified,"" she said, breaking down repeate-dly over the course of the conversation. ""I remember every face. They're not human - they are demons,"" she said of the continuous nightmares.A day after a court in Bulandshahr convicted five of the men involved in the gang rape, she said it has given them hope. ""But it will take a long time - perhaps an eternity - for us to heal. What they did didn't just violate our bodies - it also destroyed our lives, peace, our future."" Her voice sometimes choking with emotions, she added: ""The trauma never leaves you. Nights are the worst. I still wake up frightened.""The family was forced to change houses five times in the past decade. “But how long can we keep hiding our identity from neighbours?” she asked.“Someone comes to know about our past, and it spreads like fire. People start looking at us with contempt. The environment around us turns hostile. Harassers become active. They follow me on the road, pass lewd comments, and even roam around my house. But we did not break. I did not break. ”Repeated relocation took a toll on the family financially too. “My father once owned three cars and ran them as taxis. Today, he works night shifts driving someone else’s car,” she said. She added: “I’m the only child and I also wanted to support my parents. My education suffered as we had to change places so many times.” Pursuing a law degree, she said she wants to become a judge some day for the cause of rape survivors like her. Her mother, trying to hold back her tears, said, “We were a normal family then... We had never seen a court or spoken to police. But after that day, our lives changed forever.”Recalling that day, her father told TOI how helpless he was. “We were supposed to attend my grandmother’s funeral. It was around 1am when, on the highway, I heard a loud bang. We paused thinking something had hit our vehicle. All of a sudden, 7 to 8 men emerged from the bushes and overpowered us at gunpoint.” He added: “My wife, daughter, brother, his wife and his young son were all there. They dragged my wife and daughter into the bushes. My daughter kept pleading before them. I was right there, but couldn’t save them.”That incident cost them everything, he said. “I had to look for places where nobody knew us. Finding a job became a huge struggle. Today, I barely earn Rs 12,000-15,000 a month by driving someone else’s car.”The gruesome crime happened on July 29, 2016, when the family’s vehicle was intercepted near a village, while they were travelling to Shahjahanpur from Noida.","A day after a court in Bulandshahr convicted five of the men involved in the gang rape, she said it has given them hope.

KOLKATA: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said seeing the Sangh through the lens of BJP would be a ""big mistake"". Bhagwat, who tried to define ""Hindus"" and the ""Indian society"", said the goal of the Sangh is organisation of Hindu society, but it is not aimed at opposing others.Speaking at Kolkata Vyakhyanmala, an interactive session to celebrate the centenary of RSS, Bhagwat said, ""Many have a tendency to understand Sangh through the lens of BJP. That is a big mistake,"" while trying to clearly separate the two.""Swayamsevaks in Sangh work in varied fields. Some are in politics. Some are in the party in office (at the Centre),"" he added, explaining the genesis and growth of the Sangh during his over an hour-long speech.Bhagwat said, ""There are people who spread wrong narratives about the Sangh. Interpretation of the Sangh should be objective and not through secondary sources. The goal of the Sangh is organisation of the entire Hindu society, but it is not aimed at opposing others...If you see that Sangh is anti-Muslim, you can make (that) your opinion. But change your opinion if you don't find that.""Stressing on the need for a political awakening in the state, Bhagwat said Congress was created as a means for political awakening and struggle for Independence.""There was a large-scale political awakening and people fought for this country. We got freedom...But there was another section which stressed on social reforms before Independence. The tradition started with Raja Ram Mohan Roy,"" he said.Bhagwat said: ""We have to organise society and not create any separate organisation within society."" Harping on diversity in ""Hindu society"", Bhagwat said, ""Hindu is not a name but an attribute and denotes a nature. Those who respect their motherland are Hindus. They could have different languages, rituals, attire or eating habits.""The RSS chief added that Muslims should understand that they might be different ""in terms of worship"", but they are part of the unified entity in terms of ""nation, culture and society"". Terming the proposed Babri Masjid a ""political conspiracy"", he said, ""It is neither in favour of Muslims, nor Hindus. It is happening for the votes"".Criticising efforts to construct a temple or mosque from the public exchequer, Bhagwat said the Somnath temple was built with money pooled in from society. ""The govt did not fund that (Somnath temple). Ram Mandir was not built by the govt. The govt should not get into the construction of temples,"" he said.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said seeing the Sangh through the lens of BJP would be a ""big mistake"" He tried to define ""Hindus"" and the ""Indian society"" He said: ""We have to organise society and not create any separate organisation within society""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126109684,imgsize-804455,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

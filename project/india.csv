NEW DELHI: US Supreme Court on Saturday approved the extradition of 2008 Mumbai-attack accused Tahawwur Rana to India.Rana's lawyer had argued that the Supreme Court should block his extradition based on the interpretation of ""offense"" in the US-India extradition treaty .""The (Supreme) Court should grant the writ. On the merits, it should hold that the term ""offence"" in the double jeopardy provision of the United States-India extradition treaty (and many other similar treaties) refers to the conduct underlying the charges in the two countries, rather than the elements of the crimes the respective countries have charged,"" the lawyer had said.US government had supported India's request for his extradition last year asking the Supreme Court to dismiss ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.A Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, Rana, had appealed to the US Supreme Court to block his extradition. On December 16, US Solicitor General Elizabeth B Prelogar filed a response urging the court to reject his petition.Rana had unsuccessfully appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. In August, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the India-US Extradition Treaty allows Rana's extradition.","US Supreme Court approves extradition of 2008 Mumbai-attack accused Tahawwur Rana to India.

“Farming though hard is the foremost craft

Men ply at will but ploughmen lead”

uzhandhum

sambar

chakkara pongal

Ennanga, enna aachu?

chakkara pongal

uzhandhum’

The aroma of Pongal floated through the streets a week ago, but the celebrations were muted in urban areas. Pongal was boiled in pressure cookers, a far cry from the tradition of cooking it in open fires and clay pots. The festival—a thanksgiving to farmers and their noble companions, the bulls—unfolded without the presence of either.Thiruvalluvar, the eternal poet of wisdom, has dedicated an entire chapter to the farmer . The opening couplet is deeply relevant even today:Valluvar considers farmers humanity’s cornerstone. But the use of the word ‘’ (amidst hardships) is intriguing. Perhaps, even in his time, farming was no easy path.Agriculture bears the burden of triple uncertainty. The yield, the price, and the market are all at the mercy of forces beyond the farmer’s control. Across the country, fertile lands are being devoured by real estate projects and farmers have been selling their ancestral lands to settle debts. But if fields continue to shrink and farmers abandon the plough, what will sustain us?My friend Senthil offered a glimpse into this grim reality. A former software professional, he returned to his roots to take up his father’s calling—farming. But the seeds fail to germinate, crops wither under the scorching heat, and unseasonal rains destroy harvests. Even when the skies are kind, labour shortage plagues him.On Pongal evening, the lights went out in our apartment, and I stepped onto my balcony to check. The watchman, a frail chap in his sixties, stood beneath, fumbling with the generator. Finally, he restored power, but his hunched shoulders bore the weight of exhaustion.Moved by his plight, I gathered some rice,, and a small portion of leftoveronto a plastic plate and handed it to him. He ate hungrily, but tears began to stream down his face. Startled, I asked, ““Eatingon Pongal day from a plastic plate feels like a betrayal,” he said, his voice trembling. “We used to cook Pongal in large pots, sharing it with the entire village on banana leaves. But our lands were sold to clear debts after years of failed rains. My wife works as a maid now, and I got this job. I miss the soil beneath my feet.”His eyes glimmered with hope as he made a quiet request: “Ma’am, could you ask the apartment association to let me plant brinjal and tomatoes in the patch of ground here? We should see a good yield.”His words lingered in my mind. Once a farmer, always a farmer. It is not a vocation but a calling from the skies above.Will the association agree? Likely not. People prefer ornamental plants, aesthetic but lifeless, over the earthy beauty of vegetables. The thought brought a bitter smile to my face.Valluvar’s ‘echoed in my heart. As cities grow taller and fields shrink, the farmer’s struggles become invisible, buried beneath concrete and convenience. At least Pongal should be a day to remember the hands that till the soil. They deserve unwavering respect and support for without them, humanity itself would crumble.But all I could say was “I will check with the secretary,” before returning to my apartment.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117525560,imgsize-46364,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/117525560.jpg"
Odisha tops in fiscal health: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-tops-in-fiscal-health-report/articleshow/117538948.cms,"NEW DELHI: Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand and Gujarat have emerged as the top performing states in the fiscal health index, compiled by govt think tank Niti Aayog.Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala and Haryana figure at the bottom of the table. The performance of the states have been put under four categories - achievers, front runners, performers and aspirational. Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand and Gujarat are achievers, with higher capital outlay, effective mobilisation of non-tax revenue, creation of revenue surpluses, low interest payments. States under the aspirational category include Kerala, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab. The states under the aspirational category are struggling to meet the fiscal and revenue deficit targets, have low revenue mobilisation and are faced with growing debt burden, and debt sustainability is a concern.The states' performance varies across the five sub-categories. For instance, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have a good score under quality of expenditure but they rank lower with regard to revenue mobilisation, Karnataka has performed well across most indices but it ranks among the three bottom states in terms of debt sustainability. Odisha and Chhattisgarh have performed well under revenue mobilisation category with their own non-tax revenue growing significantly due to high revenue collection from mining. But on debt sustainability, Chhattisgarh ranks lower compared to other states.The Fiscal Health Index (FHI) is aimed at evolving an understanding of the fiscal health of states in the country. The analysis covers eighteen major states that drive the country's economy in terms of their contribution to GDP, demography, total public expenditure, revenues, and overall fiscal stability.""As states are responsible for approximately two-thirds of public spending and one third of total revenue, their fiscal performance is important for the country's overall economic stability,"" according to the report. It further adds that the objective is to evaluate fiscal health of the states through key fiscal parameters, identify fiscal strengths and weaknesses.","Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand and Gujarat have emerged as the top performing states in the fiscal health index, compiled by govt think tank Niti Aayog.

What is Budget halwa ceremony?

Budget 2025 halwa ceremony : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the customary 'halwa' ceremony on Friday, signalling the commencement of the final phase in preparing the Union Budget 2025-26, scheduled for presentation on February 1 in the Lok Sabha. The ceremony takes place in the North Block basement, where the ministry is situated in the national capital, with the finance minister and senior officials in attendance.FM Sitharaman attended the event, inspected the Budget Press facilities, and conveyed her best wishes to the officials involved in the process.The ceremony was attended by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, along with senior officials including Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth, and other high-ranking members of the ministry.The budget session of parliament will begin on January 31 and end on April 4, with an inter-session break from February 14. President Droupadi Murmu will address the joint sitting of two houses of Parliament on January 31.The halwa ceremony is a customary ritual observed a few days before the budget presentation in the Parliament, involving the preparation and serving of ""halwa"" to officials and staff involved in the budget's preparation.Following the halwa ceremony, officials involved in drafting the Budget enter a 'lock-in' period, remaining confined within the North Block premises, cut off from external communication, and prohibited from using mobile phones to ensure that Budget details are not leaked before the official presentation in Parliament.According to an ET report, Budget documents are sent for printing after receiving approval from the Prime Minister, and the Intelligence Bureau conducts surprise inspections of the printing press in the ministry's basement to safeguard the process further.This upcoming Budget Presentation will be Sitharaman's eighth budget, surpassing the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Like the previous few full Union Budgets, Budget 2025 will also be delivered in paperless form.The Budget comes in the backdrop of weak GDP numbers and weak consumption in the economy. The Indian economy grew by 5.4 per cent in real terms in the July-September quarter of the current financial year 2024-25, lower than RBI's forecast of 7 per cent. The Reserve Bank, in its latest monetary policy, had cut India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.6 per cent from 7.2 per cent.The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament earlier this year ""conservatively"" projected India's real GDP growth at 6.5-7 per cent for 2024-25, acknowledging that market expectations are higher. India's GDP grew by an impressive 8.2 per cent during the financial year 2023-24 and continued to be the fastest-growing major economy, growing by 7.2 per cent in 2022-23 and 8.7 per cent in 2021-22.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the customary 'halwa' ceremony on Friday, signalling the commencement of the final phase in preparing the Union Budget 2025-26.

PUNE: Alerts from three Pune hospitals to local authorities last Monday about a higher-than-usual occurrence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a rare but treatable autoimmune disease, blew up into an unprecedented cluster of 73 cases by Friday - almost trebling in four days from the initial 26 cases that caused alarm. No GBS-induced death has been reported. Although GBS is known to occur in communities, large hospitals typically admit 1-2 cases a month.Fourteen of the patients hospitalised over the past week were on ventilator support as health authorities in Maharashtra started door-to-door surveys, looking for signs of infection and raising awarness about GBS. Officials said municipal and district health workers surveyed about 7,200 homes in two days.Experts said the pathogenic bacteria Campylobacter jejuni was a known trigger for GBS, in which the patient's immune system attacks the nerves. The recent detection of the pathogen in stool samples from multiple hospitals adds to evidence linking this bacteria to the outbreak.Concern about the spread deepened with reports of an infant and a toddler being among new cases. Health experts and doctors suspect the cluster formed on Jan 9, with the first patient to be admitted being an eight-year-old boy.Union health ministry's Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) has taken cognisance of rising GBS cases in Pune and decided to send a team of doctors to assist local authorities. Healthcare facilities, including Sassoon Hospital, are stocking up on injectables and medicines required to combat the outbreak. The hospital is treating 16 GBS patients.Of the 73 GBS patients reported till Friday, 44 are in Pune rural, 11 in Pune Corporation area and 15 in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation belt. The highest number of patients are from Kirkitwadi (14), DSK Vishwa (8), Nanded city (7) and Khadakwasala (6). Three patients are under five, 18 between six and 15, and seven above 60.Dr Babita Kamalapurkar, joint director of epidemiology dept, briefed the CSU about the patient profiles.

NEW DELHI: The simple case of 'burglary gone wrong' at actor Saif Ali Khan 's residence in which he was injured continues to raise questions with the arrest of a Bangladeshi national and medical report from the hospital.The actor, who was discharged three days ago after undergoing surgery at Lilavati Hospital, gave his statement to the police. Meanwhile, opposition leaders in Maharashtra have jumped in, raising questions regarding the attack and the arrest. The father of the accused has also termed it a ""false"" arrest.On Thursday, Bandra police took Saif's statement regarding the violent encounter with an intruder at his 11th-floor residence in Satguru Sharan. The actor said, ""My grip loosened after the stranger stabbed me repeatedly on my back with a knife after I overpowered him.""According to Saif, his household members and staff were terrified when they spotted the armed trespasser. He immediately moved to confront the intruder to safeguard his younger son Jehangir and the staff. In his statement, Saif mentioned that he and Kareena were in their bedroom, and Taimur was in another room with a nurse. Their younger son Jehangir was in a different bedroom with staff nurse Eliyamma Phillip and a domestic helper when Phillip spotted the intruder.A medical report from Lilavati Hospital disclosed details of the injuries Saif sustained during the break-in on January 16. The actor suffered five distinct wounds on his back, wrist, neck, shoulder, and elbow.The report highlighted:The question raised on the day of the attack remains a mystery as different versions come up. Initially, it was reported that there were no drivers available at that hour at Saif's residence and no car was ready. He was taken to the hospital by his younger son Ibrahim in an auto.The auto driver who transported Saif to Lilavati Hospital, approximately 2 km from the actor's residence at Satguru Sharan building in Bandra, mentioned that the actor was with a ""small child"", presumably his seven-year-old son Taimur, along with another individual.The driver, who works night shifts in the Bandra-Khar area, said he spotted one of the actor's domestic help waving at him near Satguru Sharan. ""It was a scene of panic. The actor sat inside, his son in the middle and (Hari) on the side before we left for the hospital,"" he recalled, describing how a blood-soaked Khan struggled to walk. Upon reaching the hospital, the staff immediately attended to him and took him on a stretcher.The neurosurgeon who operated on Saif also said that the actor arrived at the hospital in an auto with his seven-year-old son, Taimur Ali Khan , and a caretaker. ""I was the first one to meet Saif Ali Khan when he came to the hospital. He was drenched in blood, but he walked in like a lion with his small child, Taimur. Saif Ali Khan is a real hero,"" the doctor had said.However, the medical report sent to Bandra Police indicated that Saif was probably taken to the hospital by Afsar Zaidi, his manager and close associate who operates a celebrity management firm.According to the report, Zaidi accompanied Saif to the hospital on January 16 with the admission process completed at 4.11 am.The medical documentation from Lilavati Hospital submitted to the police listed Zaidi's name in the section designated for friends.The medical form has also led to many questioning an alleged 'delay' in Saif reaching the hospital. According to the medical report, the time of the attack was 2.30 am.

INDORE/UJJAIN/MAHESHWAR/KHARGONE: Liquor ban at religious places in Madhya Pradesh has thrown up an interesting question-what of the famed Kal Bhairav Mandir in Ujjain where liquor is the main ""prasad""?In stalls outside the temple, every basket of offerings has a liquor bottle and a coconut. In fact, the state govt runs liquor counters outside the temple to ensure devotees are not swindled.While local officials await instructions from govt, chief minister Mohan Yadav was quite clear in replying to a reporter's query about Kal Bhairav temple.

If we close down the shops, where will one get liquor to drink?"" Liquor shops in Ujjain will close from April 1 after the cabinet decision. But it seems liquor prasad will continue to be served at the temple of Lord Kal Bhairav.Temple priest Om Prakash Chaturvedi told TOI despite previous moves to ban liquor, ""traditions have never been broken at the temple"". ""Even during Simhastha festival in 2016, alcohol was offered to the deity despite a ban. The govt provides a counter through the excise department to ensure that devotees have access to alcohol for the offerings,"" he said.Offering alcohol to the deity is an ancient practice, he said. ""These deities are considered 'Tamasic'. Similarly, Goddess Kalika is also offered alcohol,"" he explained.Assistant commissioner (excise) Rajnarayan Soni said issue of alcohol ""prasad"" at the temple will be decided by govt. ""Currently, there are two (liquor) counters for devotees outside the temple. They are operated under excise department's supervision. There're no licensed shops nearby,"" he said.Hinting at prohibition, Yadav said: ""In the first step to bring about an end to drinking in the state, liquor vends in 19 holy towns will be shut down.

NEW DELHI: Ministry of external affairs on Friday said that India is ""against illegal immigration "", not just in the United States, ""but anywhere in the world"".""We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a press briefing.The spokesperson added, ""For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians. If that happens to be the case we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India.""This comes a day after EAM S Jaishankar said that India has always been open to legitimate return of undocumented Indians to their country. ""As a government, we are obviously very much supportive of legal mobility because we do believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have the maximum opportunity at the global level. At the same time, we are also very firmly opposed to illegal mobility and illegal migration,"" Jaishankar had said.""Because you also know that when something illegal happens, many other illegal activities get joined onto it, which is not desirable. It is certainly not good reputationally. So, with every country, and the US is no exception, we have always maintained that if any of our citizens are there illegally, and if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been open to their legitimate return to India,"" Jaishankar added while responding to a query on news reports that India is working with the Trump administration for the deportation of some 18,000 Indians in the US who are either undocumented, or have overstayed their visas.Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Thursday that US authorities arrested 538 migrants and deported hundreds of ""illegal immigrants"" in a day in a large-scale operation, days after President Donald Trump began his second term.Leavitt said on X, ""The Trump Administration arrested 538 illegal immigrant criminals including a suspected terrorist, four members of the Tren de Aragua gang, and several illegals convicted of sex crimes against minors.""During his campaign, Trump pledged to take tougher measures against illegal immigration.

Will take back illegals only after verifying: India to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-take-back-illegals-only-after-verifying-india-to-us/articleshow/117535937.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid concerns raised by the US over irregular migration, India Friday reiterated it will, like in the past, accept illegal migrants from the US only after verifying their Indian origin and that any talk about number of such undocumented people it’s willing to take back is “premature”.The remarks by the ministry of external affairs came shortly after reports from the US said “hundreds” of illegal immigrants were deported in a military aircraft by American authorities just days into Donald Trump’s presidency. More than 500 migrants were also reported to have been arrested. Indian officials said they had no information about this “largest massive deportation operation”.While US authorities were reported last year to have served final order of removal to close to 18000 people for deportation to India, the Indian government has not backed that number maintaining it is yet to be verified by Indian authorities. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) called India “uncooperative” because of the delay in verifying their citizenship.After his meeting with counterpart Marco Rubio, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had said India follows the same policy - facilitating legitimate return of illegal migrants if their Indian origin is validated - with all countries and the US is no exception.“We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime. For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.“If that happens to be the case we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India. Any discussion about the number of people who would be taken back is premature,” he added.“The Trump Administration arrested 538 illegal immigrant criminals…also deported hundreds of illegal immigrant criminals via military aircraft. The largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway. Promises made. Promises kept,” said Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a post on X. Trump has maintained all along that illegal immigration puts an enormous burden on the US and pledged all lawful action at his disposal to address the “crisis”.Speaking after his meeting with Rubio, Jaishankar had also said that while India is aware of the ongoing debate on the issue and the sensitivities involved, India’s position on illegal migration has been consistent and principled.Responding to a query at a media briefing, Jaiswal also said India looks at illegal migration and trade - another likely contentious matter given Trump’s tariff threats - as separate issues and its approach has always been very constructive.“India-US relationship is very strong, multifaceted and the economic ties are something which is very special...We have established mechanisms between the US and India to discuss any matter or trade matters or matters related to trade,” said the official.“Our approach has always been to address issues in a constructive manner which is in keeping with the interests of both countries...We remain in close communication with the US administration,” he added.","India says it will accept illegal migrants from the US only after verifying their Indian origin. Any talk about number of such undocumented people it’s willing to take back is ‘premature’ US authorities reported last year to have served final order of removal to close to 18,000 people for deportation to India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117535976,imgsize-1655441,width-400,resizemode-4/117535976.jpg"

NEW DELHI: All 10 opposition members attending the JPC meeting on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill - two opposition MPs were absent - were suspended for a day on Friday after they accused panel head Jagdambika Pal of arbitrarily changing meeting dates, and not heeding their plea to have the final sessions on Jan 30-31.The members reiterated their demand that the meet for finalising the bill should be postponed from Jan 27, while Pal called their protests ""dilatory tactics"" to delay submission of the JPC report. He said the meet would go ahead on Jan 27, setting the stage for another row on Monday.The suspended MPs are A Raja and Mohamed Abdullah (DMK), Syed Naseer Hussain, Mohd Jawed and Imran Masood (Congress), Kalyan Banerjee and Nadeem-ul Haque (TMC), Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), Arvind Sawant (Sena UBT) and Mohibullah (SP).Later, in a letter to Speaker Om Birla, the MPs alleged that Pal “spoke on the phone with somebody and suddenly ordered suspension”, and asked the Speaker to ensure fair proceedings. BJP accused opposition of seeking to thwart passage of the bill as part of vote-bank politics.The confrontation overshadowed the significant development of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, head of separatist Hurriyat Conference which does not acknowledge Indian sovereignty over J&K, participating in the deliberations in what also marked his first visit outside J&K since scrapping of the erstwhile state’s special status.A clash was expected after opposition, through Raja, sent a letter Wednesday demanding the meetings of Friday and Saturday be pushed to Jan 30-31, as they got no time to collect evidence for moving amendments. The fireworks started right at the start, with opposition protesting the last-minute change in schedule and agenda, announced close to midnight on Thursday, prompting strong retaliation from BJP members who accused them of disruption. Pal told reporters opposition “broke all boundaries”. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey moved the motion for suspending the opposition contingent.Dubey dismissed the charges as hilarious, pointing out that it was opposition MPs who got the last meeting postponed, resulting in it being rescheduled, adding, “Their allegations are just a smokescreen. The fact is that they don’t want the bill to go through for the fear of annoying vested interests among the minority community who are in illegal possession of real estate worth hundreds of billions.”Opposition will attend the meeting Monday if JPC insists on the announced schedule. Opposition MPs said “a comprehensive study” was required by JPC as the issue pertained to large tracts of waqf land and related complex judicial issues. Some members demanded an SC probe, alleging the chairman was “acting at the behest” of higher-ups.Rebutting opposition’s charges, Pal said he tried to answer members’ queries but was faced with sloganeering and use of abusive and unparliamentary words.","All 10 opposition members attending the JPC meeting on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill were suspended for a day on Friday.

NEW DELHI: A 27-year search for Reji, a murder convict awarded life term, finally led to her arrest last June. But Supreme Court Friday suspended her sentence and agreed to test whether Kerala HC took the correct call in Sept 1996, saying there is evidence to suggest she may have been a minor while committing the crime on Feb 11, 1990. In 1993, a trial court had acquitted Reji of murdering Mariamma (61), her employer, in Alappuzha's Mavelikkara. The case then went to HC.According to prosecution records, Reji was 18 at the time of committing the murder and she allegedly stole a gold chain and earrings from the victim.

However, police drew a blank as she disappeared from her native town immediately after the HC verdict.Police, who only had a 1990 photograph of Reji with them, failed to trace her for 27 years. They said she changed her name, married, had children, and kept shifting her profession and residence to evade arrest - from Kottayam to Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadi to Kothamangalam to Adivad by working as a domestic help and also sales woman in a shop.She was finally arrested on June 25, 2023, at Adivad at Pallarimangalam in Ernakulam's Pothanikkad, where she was living with her family under an assumed name, 'Mini Raju'. Reji movedSC in April last year challenging her conviction, claiming she was a minor at the time of commission of the crime. SC had on Sept 24 last year summoned the trial court records and translated copies of witness depositions. On Friday, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar perused the trial court records.""We are ordering the suspension of her sentence. The trial court would enlarge her on bail pending the adjudication of her appeal after imposing appropriate terms and conditions,"" SC said and posted the matter for final hearing in the third week of Feb.","Reji was convicted of murdering her employer in Alappuzha, Kerala, in 1990.

Last year, Shariful had entered India by crossing Dawki river on the India-Bangladesh border at Meghalaya, paid Rs 10,000 to an agent to have him taken to Assam, and then took a bus to Kolkata, where he stayed for three days before taking a train to Mumbai in May.On Wednesday, police completed the crime scene reconstruction with the recovery of a white plastic bag near Bandra Talao.

He was accused of fraudulently having his wife’s uterus removed, abandoning her and their daughters, and marrying another woman.The case, registered in 2009, led to his conviction, sentencing him to 2.5 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ₹5,000. He served 11 months in custody. In 2024, the Jharkhand High Court reduced his sentence to 1.5 years but increased the fine to ₹1 lakh.The couple married in 2003, but the wife was reportedly tortured and thrown out after just four months due to an unmet dowry demand of ₹50,000. Despite several panchayat meetings, the man refused to reconcile. By June 2009, he allegedly remarried and expelled his wife and daughters from the home.While the high court noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove the removal of the wife's uterus or the remarriage, the Supreme Court insisted the man pay for the upkeep of his wife and daughters, warning that the case would not proceed until he did so.

Bagheera of Kurseong. What a beauty,” Kaswan wrote in a social media post, likening the elusive creature to the iconic character from The Jungle Book.The video, which showcases the majestic animal strolling gracefully through the dense forest, quickly gained traction.The black panther, often described as a shadow in the wild, is not a separate species but a variant of the leopard (Panthera pardus).In a subsequent post, Kaswan elaborated on the science behind their striking appearance. “These animals appear black due to a genetic condition called melanism, which results in excess dark pigmentation. Despite their dark coats, their characteristic leopard rosettes are often visible under certain lighting conditions,” he said.Black panthers are primarily found in the dense, tropical forests of Karnataka’s Kabini region, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, and parts of the Northeast. Their solitary and elusive nature makes sightings an exceptionally rare occurrence, adding to their mystique. North Bengal’s forests, now revealed as a habitat for this elusive predator, have once again highlighted the region’s ecological significance.Beyond their beauty, black panthers play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems as apex predators. However, they face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.","Video shows a rare black panther strolling through the lush greenery of north Bengal.

The "" Delhi Declaration 2025 ,"" adopted during the event, reflects EMBs’ commitment to free, fair, and inclusive elections while fostering innovation and integrity.Kumar criticised the role of social media algorithms, claiming they often amplify one-sided views and promote misinformation. “Big-tech entities should ensure social media algorithms seek to clarify and inform rather than distort and misinform,” he said. He added that relying solely on fact-checkers to combat fake content was insufficient.""Social media algorithms are designed in a way that repeatedly presents content aligned with existing views, reinforcing a perspective without exposing the person to the other side of the argument.

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai police on Friday informed the local court that it is yet to conduct facial recognition analysis of Shareeful Islam Shehzad Mohammad Rohilla Amin Fakir, a Bangladeshi national arrested for allegedly stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan. The facial analysis will be done to ascertain if he was the person seen in the CCTV footage from the actor's building in Bandra.The 30-year-old accused was presented before Magistrate KC Rajput, who extended his police custody until January 29. Fakir was held on January 19 for allegedly breaking into Saif’s apartment with the intent of theft and stabbing the actor multiple times during the incident.Prosecutors KS Patil and Prasad Joshi argued in court that while progress had been made, further investigation was required. Police highlighted key objectives, including:The court was also informed of the recovery of Fakir’s Bangladeshi driving license, which corroborates his origins. Authorities further revealed that Fakir used forged Aadhaar and PAN cards under the alias “Vijay Das” to stay in India.Fakir’s lawyers, Dinesh Prajapati and Sandeep Sherkahne, however, opposed the police's plea, questioning the credibility of the case. They argued that the alleged victim (Khan) had enough time but did not call the police for help.Meanwhile, the accused’s father has contested Fakir’s arrest, claiming that the man seen in the CCTV footage does not match his son. This dispute over identity has deepened the mystery surrounding the case.On January 16, Saif Ali Khan was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder at his 12th-floor apartment in Bandra during the early hours of the morning.

NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference supremo Farooq Abdullah on Thursday joined a group of singers to perform the devotional song, ""Tune Mujhe Bulaya Sherawaliye, Main Aaya Main Aaya Sherawaliye.""The NC leader was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra. He was seen donning a traditional red-coloured scarf associated with the shrine.During the event, Abdullah addressed the contentious issue of the ropeway construction project in Katra, voicing his support for local residents protesting against it. He targeted the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board for proceeding with the project without adequately considering the interests of the community.""Those running the shrine's operations should not take actions that harm the interests of the local people or create problems for them,"" Abdullah said. He praised the residents of Katra for their resilience in opposing the project, saying, ""You showed courage and fought bravely to stop it. They have realised that power lies with the people, not the government.""Former J&K CM also highlighted the power of collective action, pointing out that the people have the ultimate authority to shape or dismantle governments. He mentioned that officials are now consulting the community to determine a more suitable location for the ropeway.He also expressed concern for locals who rely on the shrine for their livelihood. ""The people living in these hills come here to earn their livelihood with the blessings of Mata, but they have been forgotten. Those in power think they are everything, but they are not. When the power of God prevails, all else fades. Just look at what is happening in California,"" he said.Abdullah also mentioned the universality of religious teachings, saying that all faiths share common core values but are often misused by individuals for personal gain.","Farooq Abdullah was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra.

"‘Indigenous’ bullet trains to run on Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow “indigenous trains”, with a maximum design speed of 280 kmph, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two “indigenous” high-speed trains by the end of 2026. These trains will have the Vande Bharat base and will be designed to run on standard gauge tracks.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains , which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even, when our own high-speed trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the indigenous trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, would meet the expectation of passengers.","The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two ‘indigenous’ high-speed trains by the end of 2026.

KOLKATA: Father of Shariful Fakir, the illegal Bangladeshi immigrant arrested by Mumbai police for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan during a burglary attempt at his Bandra home, claimed that police have framed his son. He said Shariful is not the person shown in the video from the initial CCTV footage released the day after the attack.""They have arrested my son as a suspect, but he is not the one whose photograph police had released after the incident. The man in the photograph had long hair that touched his eyes. My son has always had shorter hair raised upwards. They have picked him up as he has some similarities. He is also an easy target as he had entered India illegally,"" Md Rohul Amin, 55, told TOI over a WhatsApp call from Bangladesh.Amin, who is also a village-level Bangladesh Nationalist Party functionary, said he is speaking to senior politicians in his country to raise the ""false arrest"" of his son as a diplomatic issue. Shariful is the second among Rohul's three sons. While his elder son works at a private firm in Dhaka, the younger son is still in school. Shariful dropped out from school after Class 10 and started doing odd jobs after Rohul lost his job at Khulna jute mill.""We may be poor, but we are not criminals. In Bangladesh, he used to ride a bike taxi for a living. But during the era of Awami League, there was a lot of political turmoil in our village and after Sheikh Hasina's govt came back to power early last year. Since my son was an active supporter of Khaleda Zia, he faced immense backlash and so he decided to leave Bangladesh for better earning and living prospects,"" said Rohul.He said Shariful got in touch with an agent who helped him illegally cross the border and enter India in April last year. While Mumbai police said he crossed Dawki river to reach Meghalaya and then reach Bengal via Assam, his father couldn't specify the details. ""He hadn't shared with us about how he had exactly entered India but there are multiple persons like him who leave Bangladesh and head for India illegally for work. Once he reached India, he went to Bengal and worked at a restaurant for a few days, before he went to Mumbai and started working at a bar. He had also met a relative of ours in Bengal but he refused him accommodation,"" said Rohul, who now works as a farmer at Rajabaria village in Jhalokhathi of Bangladesh.Rohul said Friday evening, more than 38 hours since the stabbing incident at Saif's Bandra residence, Shariful called home and told his father that he had transferred 10,000 Bangladeshi taka via a hawala agent leaving only 3,000 taka for himself. ""We know he had done several illegal things, like straying into India and sending money illegally. He may have some politically-motivated cases against him in Bangladesh but one thing I can assure is that my son is not a criminal. He can never loot or attack someone. We demand justice,"" he said, breaking down into tears.",Shariful Fakir's father claims his son was wrongfully arrested for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan.

"CEOs of Maharashtra, Haryana issue fresh letter to Rahul Gandhi, give him 10 days to prove 'voter fraud' claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ceos-of-maharashtra-haryana-issue-fresh-letter-to-rahul-gandhi-give-him-10-days-to-prove-voter-fraud-claims/articleshow/123228040.cms,"NEW DELHI: The chief electoral officers of Maharashtra and Haryana on Sunday sent fresh letters to Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, giving him 10 days to furnish a signed declaration with particulars of electors he alleged were fraudulently added, so that necessary proceedings may be initiated.Karnataka CEO too sent a notice to Rahul on Sunday, citing Mahadevapura voter Shakun Rani’s denial of his claim at a recent press conference that she had voted twice from Mahadevapura AC in 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The Congress leader was requested him to provide the documents based on which he had reached the conclusion, so that a detailed inquiry could be held.“On inquiry, Smt Shakun Rani (the voter in question) had stated that she has voted only once and not twice, as alleged by you. Preliminary inquiry conducted by this office also reveals that the tick-marked document shown by you in the presentation is not a document issued by the polling officer,"" the CEO said in a letter sent to the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha.The Election Commission, in wake of the Karnataka CEO’s latest letter to Rahul, once again asked him to submit a timely response. “He should either file the declaration/oath under Rules 20(3)b of the Registration of Electors Act 1960 or apologise to the nation for making baseless allegation against EC,” said an EC functionary.Sources said if Rahul does not furnish a declaration, his claims cannot be investigated since the law requires evidence by any person (who is not a voter in that particular constituency himself) to be tendered on oath.If Rahul were to furnish an oath and the evidence and it is found to be fabricated or false, Section 227 and 229 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) (giving false evidence) shall kick in; the section provides for jail term up to three years and, if this false evidence is repeated in court, it invites jail up to seven years. Also, making false allegations in connection with preparation, revision or correction of electoral roll or inclusion/exclusion of any entry in electoral roll, is punishable with imprisonment up to one year under Section 31 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950.Meanwhile, EC sources on Sunday told TOI that the alleged polling records shown by Rahul as “EC data” with 'tick marks' against Shakun Rani's name, appear fabricated, as such records form part of Form 17A maintained and retained by the polling officer. Access to Form 17A is limited to authorised EC officials and these are not shared with the political parties. The parties' polling agents do get polling records but in Form 17C, which do not contain the voters' photographs. Form 17A is only produced before the court when sought in any judicial proceeding.Flashing a ""forged document"" at a press conference could spell legal consequences for Rahul as he may face an FIR for violation of Section 337 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, which provides for jail term up to seven years for forging a govt-issued ID like voter identity card or a register maintained by a public servant. Also being in possession of such forged documents is a criminal offence under Section 339 of BNS, also punishable with imprisonment that can extend to seven years.EC sources said the Karnataka CEO is yet to receive any documents cited by Rahul at last week's press conference to allege 'massive voter fraud' in the state's Mahadevapura AC.Rahul Gandhi had, in his presentation at the press conference, displayed Shakun Rani's voter details in the electoral roll ""obtained through RTI from EC ERO login"" and the ""BLA-marked electoral roll"", and claimed in his remarks that the polling officer had ticked against her ID card twice, recording her duplicate votes. Interestingly, the role of a political party's booth level agent (BLA) is limited to activities concerning the electoral roll; it's the polling agents who represent the party and their candidates in the polling station are their polling agents.","Karnataka CEO too sent a notice to Rahul on Sunday, citing Mahadevapura voter Shakun Rani’s denial of his claim at a recent press conference that she had voted twice.

Suspected snag: Air India Thiruvananthapuram-Delhi flight diverts to Chennai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/suspected-snag-air-india-thiruvananthapuram-delhi-flight-diverts-to-chennai/articleshow/123227676.cms,"Representative image (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Air India’s Thiruvananthapuram (TRV)-Delhi flight AI 2455 on Sunday night with several MPs among the passengers safely diverted to Chennai following a suspected snag. On its approach to Chennai, the Airbus A320neo ((VT-TNL) was given a go-around by the air traffic control (ATC) — meaning asked to abort landing and then touch down in second attempt — which the pilots executed safely.However, the announcement of the flight diverting due to a snag, enroute bad weather and then the go-around added to the anxiety of passengers. Congress MP K C Venugopal who represents Alappuzha in Lok Sabha was among the parliamentarians on board. He said on X early Monday morning: “AI 2455 from Trivandrum to Delhi, carrying myself, several MPs, and hundreds of passengers, came frighteningly close to tragedy. What began as a delayed departure turned into a harrowing journey. Shortly after take-off, we were hit by unprecedented turbulence. About an hour later, the captain announced a flight signal fault and diverted to Chennai.”“For nearly two hours, we circled the airport awaiting clearance to land, until a heart-stopping moment during our first attempt — another aircraft was reportedly on the same runway.In that split second, the captain’s quick decision to pull up saved every life on board. The flight landed safely on the second attempt. We were saved by skill and luck. Passenger safety cannot depend on luck. I urge DGCA and aviation ministry to investigate this incident urgently, fix accountability, and ensure such lapses never happen again,” Venugopal added.Aircraft routinely go around for safety reasons due to a number of factors like unstabilised approach or a plane/vehicle being on the runway it is supposed to land on. Air India denied that AI 2455 was asked to go around because there was another aircraft on the runway.An AI spokesperson said: “The flight crew of AI2455 operating from Thiruvananthapuram to Delhi on August 10 made a precautionary diversion to Chennai due to a suspected technical issue and given the weather conditions enroute. The flight landed safely in Chennai, where the aircraft will undergo the necessary checks. We regret the inconvenience caused to affected passengers…. At AI, safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority. ”Congress MP for Virudhunagar Manickam Tagore B who as also on board said on X: “Shocked & shaken. Air India AI 2455 from TRV to Delhi, carrying MPs & hundreds of passengers, narrowly escaped disaster today — turbulence, flight signal fault, and a near runway collision in Chennai…. Passenger safety cannot rely on luck. We demand answers & action now.”Replying to him, AI said: “…diversion to Chennai was precautionary, due to a suspected technical issue and poor weather conditions. A go-around was instructed by Chennai ATC during the first attempted landing, not because of the presence of another aircraft on the runway. Our pilots are well-trained to handle such situations, and in this case, they followed standard procedures throughout the flight…”Air India arranged another Airbus A320neo, VT-TQE, which flew the passengers from Chennai to Delhi as AI 2455. The usual flying time of AI 2455 (TRV-Delhi) is 3.5 hours with a schedule departure time 7.15 pm. According to flight tracking sites, it took off with a slight delay on Sunday at 8 pm & landed in Chennai at 10.39 pm. The alternate aircraft took off from Chennai at 1.40 am & landed in Delhi at about 4 am.Seasoned aviators say while AI 2455 had a routine suspected snag, passenger anxiety levels have expectedly been higher post the deadly June 12 AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad and subsequent incidents.","Congress MP K C Venugopal who represents Alappuzha in Lok Sabha was among the parliamentarians on board.

What is his current location? How is his health? There is no clarity on these matters.”The Shiv Sena leader said attempts by Rajya Sabha members to contact Dhankhar had failed, and rumours were circulating in Delhi that the former vice president had been “confined to his residence” and “reportedly not safe.”He warned that some MPs were considering a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, but he had decided first to approach Shah: “Before knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court I thought it to be prudent to seek this information from you. ”Raut’s intervention follows similar calls from Independent MP Kapil Sibal, who questioned the silence around Dhankhar’s whereabouts. Sibal said he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa [missing] vice president’,” and noted that even Dhankhar’s family and close associates had offered no update. “The home ministry must know where Dhankhar is and must reveal it,” he said, warning that such secrecy “should not happen in a democracy. ”Dhankhar, 74, resigned midterm as vice president, just two years after assuming office in August 2022.

At a press conference, he alleged, “All the Booth Level Officers (BLOs) were filling out ‘fake forms’ in one room.”Singh further stated, “ Rahul Gandhi put forward such facts that no one could deny... The name of one person appeared at multiple locations, including polling booths... Rahul Gandhi’s demand was for electronic data of the voter list, which could be scanned using software to determine how many votes were cast on a single EPIC number...The reason for the SIR happening in Bihar was questioned. It had been thoroughly tested in 2003, which took 2 years in Bihar, but this time they wanted to do it in 1 month. ..”He added, “All the BLOs were filling out fake forms in one room.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram on Sunday lashed out at the Election Commission of India (ECI), asserting that it is “not a court” and must not act like one while dealing with petitions or complaints.In a post on X, Chidambaram wrote, “The ECI is not a court and cannot behave like a court in entertaining petitions or complaints. It is an administrative body tasked with ensuring free and fair elections.”Clarifying the scope of Rule 20(3)(b), he said it applies only when an Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) accepts or rejects a specific claim to be included in the electoral rolls -- not in cases of alleged large-scale manipulation of an entire assembly constituency’s rolls.Citing a newspaper report, he alleged that complaints from Booth Level Agents in Bihar are being ignored. “If true, this refusal to entertain complaints during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) will spell the death of democratic elections,” he warned, adding that the ECI’s duty extends beyond mere procedure to safeguarding the rights of political parties and voters.Meanwhile, the Election Commission has reiterated its stand that Rahul Gandhi must either submit supporting documents for his recent ""vote theft"" allegations or apologise.The reminder follows a notice from the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) and a follow-up from the Haryana CEO.In an August 10 letter, the Karnataka CEO said Rahul Gandhi had, during his August 7 press conference, cited ECI records to allege that a voter named Shakun Rani voted twice, based on data shown by a polling officer.However, the voter has denied the charge, and officials said the tick-marked document displayed by Rahul Gandhi was not issued by the polling officer, raising doubts about its authenticity.The Karnataka CEO has asked Rahul Gandhi to share the original documents forming the basis of his claim so a detailed investigation can be carried out.",Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram on Sunday lashed out at the Election Commission of India.

No need for Supreme Court to comment on abilities of high court judges: CJI BR Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-need-for-supreme-court-to-comment-on-abilities-of-high-court-judges-cji-br-gavai/articleshow/123225356.cms,"SC has no authority to dictate rosters of HCs: Justice Kant



NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, who is next in line to succeed him, have disapproved of the tendency of judges of superior courts to comment on the knowledge and ability of lower court judges, and said the Supreme Court and high courts are only to correct, modify impugned orders/judgments, or set them aside, if they were perverse.""The high courts are not subordinate to the SC as both are constitutional courts. SC can only rectify, modify or set aside the orders/judgments of HCs. The Constitution gives no authority to comment on the ability, capability or knowledge of individual judges of HCs,"" the CJI told TOI.Justice Kant agreed. ""Superior court judges must discharge their role as friend, philosopher and guide for lower court judges. In the three-tiered justice delivery system, persuasion and guidance yields better results than criticism and castigation,"" Justice Kant, who'll take over from Gavai on Nov 24, told TOI.Remarks of the CJI as well as Justice Kant assume significance in the wake of an SC bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan criticising an Allahabad HC judge for passing ""the worst and most erroneous order"" and barring him from hearing criminal cases. The bench Friday expunged its directions for de-rostering the judge while requesting the HC chief justice to look into the matter.Endorsing the vision encapsulated in the saying 'a judge who has not committed a mistake is yet to be born', CJI B R Gavai told TOI that the same principle applies to HC judges, who should refrain from castigating judicial officers on the ground of lack of ability, knowledge or capability while hearing appeals against impugned orders authored by them.""They must administratively convey how to improve and in which area. For that, HC CJs concerned have a significant role to play. The role of superior courts in imparting required training to lower court judges in various aspects of adjudication, acquiring knowledge in myriad fields of law and maintaining proper demeanour and decorum in the courtroom will shape the future of the justice delivery system and reinforce people's faith in judiciary,"" the CJI said.Justice Kant said HC judges and judicial officers come from various social strata and bring with them a wealth of real-life experiences which can be harnessed, modulated and sharpened with legal training to enrich the justice delivery system to meet day-to-day challenges of open court hearing and address grievances of litigants.""On the judicial side, SC has no authority to dictate to HCs which of their judges would hear what types of cases or the manner in which cases are to be decided. It can only lead by example and guide them with its judgments. Allocation of cases to judges and their roster squarely falls in the exclusive domain of the HC CJ concerned,"" Justice Kant said.CJI Gavai said, ""Every constitutional court judge, be it in HCs or in SC, has the constitutional responsibility to do justice in each case, whether criminal or civil or any other field of law. Superior court judges have the onerous duty to maintain civility while passing orders or writing judgments.""","Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant disapprove of the tendency of judges of superior courts to comment on the knowledge and ability of lower court judges.

"“Put yourself in uncomfortable situations,” says Google CEO Sundar Pichai: 8 important career lessons that professionals must learn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/put-yourself-in-uncomfortable-situations-says-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-here-are-important-career-lessons-to-learn/articleshow/123178194.cms,"Be your own toughest critic



Seek out the people who intimidate you



Lean into discomfort



Let passion guide your decisions



Build mission-oriented teams



Trust before you criticise



Let recognition come naturally



Remember that wealth is only part of the story



Corporate boardrooms rarely produce leaders who combine quiet humility with the sharp strategic acumen needed to steer a $2.3 trillion enterprise. Sundar Pichai is one of those rare and remarkable exceptions. His ascent from a product manager’s desk in 2004 to the CEO’s chair at Google is not a story of brash, impulsive manoeuvres, but of measured choices, deliberate growth, and an unyielding focus on people and innovation.At 52, with a personal fortune of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Pichai stands as proof that leadership excellence is not defined by volume or theatrics, but by clarity of vision and consistency of execution. In a candid exchange with Lex Fridman, American Computer Scientist and podcaster, he offered a distilled set of principles, drawn from two decades at the helm of one of the world’s most influential companies, that hold deep relevance for anyone seeking professional and personal advancement.These lessons are not abstract platitudes. They are field-tested convictions forged through moments of uncertainty, challenge, and relentless innovation.For those willing to absorb them, they serve as a blueprint for growing beyond limitations and leading with purpose.Pichai’s most telling insight lies in his belief that the best professionals need no external reprimand to recognise their missteps. “At times, you're working with people who are so committed to achieving, if they've done something wrong, they feel it more than you do,” he remarked. The essence: Hold yourself to a standard higher than any imposed by a manager.Far from shying away from professional discomfort, Pichai considers it an essential growth tool. “At various points in my life, I've worked with people who I felt were better than me,” he admitted. The takeaway? Surround yourself with talent that challenges your competence and compels you to stretch your own abilities.For Pichai, growth rarely blossoms in the safe zone. He urges young professionals to “put yourself in uncomfortable situations” because “often you'll surprise yourself.” That willingness to step into the unfamiliar is what propelled him from a product manager’s desk to the helm of Google in just over a decade.In an age when career decisions are often algorithmically calculated, Pichai champions an instinctive approach. “When you do things, I think it's important to listen to your heart, and see whether you actually enjoy doing it,” he advised. Passion, he argues, is a more reliable long-term compass than expediency.A single leader cannot steer a global enterprise without the right people in place. Pichai’s formula for high performance is simple but uncompromising: “You find mission-oriented people who are in the shared journey, who have this inner drive to excellence, to do the best, and motivate people, and you can achieve a lot that way.”Pichai’s calm management style is grounded in faith in his teams. While he recognises that “occasionally, there are people who you need to clearly let them know, like, ‘That wasn't okay,’” he is quick to add, “I've often found that not to be the case.” His approach reflects a belief that empowered and committed employees self-correct more effectively than those micromanaged.Pichai’s rise to CEO was not the result of orchestrated self-promotion, but the by-product of consistent excellence. His work caught the attention of Larry Page and Sergey Brin precisely because it spoke for itself—a quiet reminder that recognition earned organically is the most enduring.Despite his billionaire status, Pichai’s net worth is modest in comparison to Google’s co-founders, whose fortunes exceed $160 billion each according to US media reports. Yet his focus remains fixed on impact, influence, and innovation, an implicit lesson that personal wealth is only one metric of success.Pichai’s philosophy is deceptively simple yet deeply profound: Growth begins where comfort ends, excellence thrives in self-discipline, and success is amplified by the people you choose to work with. For those willing to follow his lead, the results can be transformative.","Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google, worth an estimated $1.1 billion. He has been at the helm of the company for over a decade. In an interview with Lex Fridman, he offers a distilled set of principles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123178247,imgsize-26928,width-400,resizemode-4/123178247.jpg"

Pakistani cricket player Haider Ali , 24, was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on rape charges . The incident allegedly occurred on July 23, 2025, in Manchester. He was released on bail while investigations continue. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has suspended him and is providing legal support during the UK investigation.Ali's cricket career began promisingly. He made his mark in the 2020 PSL with Peshawar Zalmi, scoring 239 runs with an impressive strike rate over 157. His international debut was memorable, scoring 54 runs off 33 balls in Manchester, helping Pakistan win by five runs.One of his international matches thereon came against India in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia where he scored just 2 runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya . During that match in October 2022, played at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Haider couldn't make a name for himself in arguably the biggest game in the sport as he holed out to Suryakumar Yadav.Despite his explosive batting style, Ali has struggled with consistency in his career. He has played two ODIs and 35 T20Is for Pakistan. The Shaheens tour was seen as a chance for him to return to form and fit into Pakistan's aggressive T20 playing style.Ali was touring with Pakistan's Shaheens squad, their 'A' team, in England when the arrest happened in Beckenham. He played all five games of the tour, including matches before and after the alleged incident. He was set to join the team in Australia for a T20 series but has been replaced by Mohammad Faiq.The police have said: ""After receiving a report on Monday 4 August 2025 of a rape, we have arrested a 24-year-old man. It's alleged that the incident occurred on Wednesday 23 July 2025 at a premises in Manchester. The man has since been bailed pending further enquiries. The victim is being supported by officers.""The PCB stated they ""fully respects the legal procedures and processes of the UK"" while providing Ali with legal support.

Key air and ground strikes against Pakistan

Aerial interception and final missile strike

NEW DELHI: Even as Operation Sindoor continues, the navies of India and Pakistan are set to conduct separate naval drills in the Arabian Sea starting tomorrow, defence sources confirmed on Sunday.According to officials, both navies have issued Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) restricting air traffic in their respective territorial waters for the duration of the exercises.""Indian Navy warships would be carrying out drills in the Arabian Sea on August 11-12. Pakistan Navy has also issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) for carrying out its own naval exercises in its waters,"" defence sources said.A NOTAM is issued to alert pilots and air traffic controllers of airspace restrictions during specific operations, such as military drills.The drills come months after a tense military standoff in May when Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed Operation Sindoor with India’s top commanders.As per media reports, PM Modi reportedly told navy chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi, “Humne aapke mooh se niwala cheen liya, aapko mauka phir milega” -- indicating the Navy’s planned strike on Karachi was called off at the last moment. Despite concerns about possible Pakistani retaliation, Modi gave full operational autonomy to the services.The military leadership displayed varied strengths: Air chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh, known for his daring as a test pilot; Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, a troop-focused leader; and Admiral Tripathi, a strong advocate for naval offensive action. This blend helped execute coordinated strikes while balancing strategic caution.Between May 7 and 10, the Indian Air Force targeted critical Pakistani military assets, destroying fighter aircraft, radar systems, and airborne early warning platforms.The Army’s deployment of advanced artillery and loitering munitions forced Pakistani troops to retreat along the Line of Control.Concurrently, the Navy’s mobilisation pushed Pakistani vessels into shelter at Gwadar port.A significant engagement saw an Indian S-400 missile intercept a Pakistani Saab AEW&C aircraft deep inside Pakistan, severely impacting its surveillance capability.The conflict’s last strike was a BrahMos missile attack on the Bholari airbase on May 10, marking India’s successful mission completion.",Indian Navy warships would be carrying out drills in the Arabian Sea on August 11-12.

NEW DELHI: In a fresh escalation of tensions within the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Lok Sabha MP Kalyan Banerjee described fellow party leader Mahua Moitra as “below standard” and a “wasteful lady,” remarks likely to deepen their ongoing feud.Speaking to reporters, Kalyan said, “Mahua Moitra is not my subject matter that I need to talk about her. I do not want to invest my time, energy and mind on a wasteful lady like her.” He added, “And I have become the villain in people’s eyes for talking about her.”While conceding that he had earlier made “unsavoury comments” about chief minister Mamata Banerjee , saying, “I shouldn’t have done that”, Kalyan stood by his remarks against Moitra.The exchanges come after the two leaders clashed publicly over the South Kolkata Law College rape case. Their rivalry has played out in the media in recent weeks, drawing attention ahead of the West Bengal Vidhan Sabha election scheduled for early 2026.Moitra has not yet publicly responded to the latest comments.","Lok Sabha MP Kalyan Banerjee described fellow party leader Mahua Moitra as “below standard” and a “wasteful lady,” remarks likely to deepen their ongoing feud.

‘Bharat Is Bharat’: Mohan Bhagwat’s Powerful Call To Protect India's Name, Soul, And Identity

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday expressed concerns over the increasing commercialisation of healthcare and education while speaking at an event in Indore. He said that both sectors, once considered acts of service, have now become unaffordable and inaccessible for the common man.“Health and education are extremely important and were earlier considered as ‘seva’ (service), but now both are beyond the reach of common people. Both have been commercialised. They are neither affordable nor accessible,” Bhagwat said at an event in Indore.Citing personal experience, Bhagwat recalled, “when I was a child, I had malaria and missed school for three days. My teacher came home, and brought jungle herbs for my treatment. He was concerned that the student who came to him should stay healthy. Society needs accessible and affordable healthcare.”Referring specifically to cancer care, he said, good cancer care is currently available in only 8-10 Indian cities, and stressed the need for healthcare that does not become a source of anxiety for patients.“We need low-cost, easily accessible medical care. Treatment should not turn into a cause of worry,” he added.Bhagwat also said that Western medical research cannot be uniformly applied across the world due to regional and individual differences.“Someone may benefit from naturopathy, others from homeopathy, no single way can be supreme. Indian medical systems treat based on personal needs,” he noted.On the education front, he pointed out that students still have to travel long distances for quality education, just as patients do for advanced healthcare.","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat expressed concerns over the increasing commercialisation of healthcare and education.

Whose white tiger is it? Turf war over shifting safari in MP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whose-white-tiger-is-it-turf-war-over-shifting-safari-in-mp/articleshow/123225053.cms,"BHOPAL: Claws are out in a grey-area tussle over a white tiger safari in Madhya Pradesh. Who keeps the legacy of Mohan, a big cat captured as a cub in 1951 by then maharaja of Rewa that went on to become the progenitor of nearly all white tigers in captivity in the world? This question has turned a seemingly routine govt redrawing of district maps in MP into a massive turf war.After a letter from Maihar district administration on Aug 7 suggested that Mukundpur - home to the world's only White Tiger Safari - should be moved to neighbouring Rewa, politicians and common people of both districts are at loggerheads. While those in Rewa say it is a ""homecoming"", people in Maihar are up in arms against this move, heating up politics in the Vindhya region.The letter proposes shifting Mukundpur and five neighbouring panchayats - Anandgarh, Amin, Dhobahat, Parsiya and Papra - from Maihar to Rewa district, citing recommendations from the state's Administrative Boundaries Reorganisation Commission. On paper, it's a matter of redrawing maps. On the ground, it's a tug-of-war over history, tourism revenue and political prestige.For Rewa, the safari is more than just an attraction - it's a birthright. Mohan's stuffed remains still guard the Rewa palace museum, his story etched into the region's identity.Bringing the safari into Rewa's official borders, supporters argue, would ""bring Mohan home"".But in Maihar's Amarpatan belt, the move has landed like a hostile takeover.Satna MP Ganesh Singh has called it ""a calculated conspiracy"", while BJP veteran and former minister Ramkhilawan Patel vowed that the villages ""will remain in Maihar"". Congress heavyweight and former Speaker Rajendra Kumar Singh has gone further, accusing deputy CM Rajendra Shukla of engineering the shift to ""grab the White Tiger Safari"" and calling for a Gandhian-style satyagraha, even suggesting ""filling Maihar jail"" in protest.Opponents allege the timing was no accident: the letter was issued a day after the assembly session was abruptly ended, they claim, to prevent debate by the local MLA. Singh has warned villagers to expect ""pressure"" from officials to sign off on the transfer, urging them to resist ""local Mir Jafars and Jaichands"".The stakes are high - not only does the safari draw tourists from across the country, but its brand value is unmatched in Madhya Pradesh's wildlife tourism. For now, the map hasn't changed. But in the Vindhya heartland, the battle over Mukundpur is fast becoming as much about political dominance as it is about a legendary tiger's legacy.","Mukundpur, home to the world's only White Tiger Safari, should be moved to neighbouring Rewa district.

NEW DELHI: Can organs, say a kidney or the liver, retrieved from a deceased donor with a history of diabetes or hypertension be used for transplantation?In a first of its kind factual assessment and report, the Indian Society for Organ Transplantation (ISOT) has said the benefits far outweigh the risks involved and, therefore, such donations should be considered subject to the viability of the organ.According to the ISOT, while Indian data are lacking, international registries report hypertension in 15-20% and diabetes in 2-8% deceased donors. ""Evidence from the US Renal Data System (USRDS) and the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) databases suggests minimally increased risk of primary non-function, acute rejection, or delayed graft function (DGF) and marginally lower graft survival from such donors, particularly in kidney transplantation,"" the ISOT statement published in the Lancet Regional - South-east Asia says. It has been co-authored by doctors from 32 top medical institutions in the country, including AIIMS Delhi, Safdarjung hospital, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital Mumbai, Max Saket and Madras Medical College Chennai among others.Over time, diabetes that isn't well controlled can damage blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure. High blood pressure can cause more kidney damage by raising the pressure in the filtering system of the kidneys, according to the Mayo Clinic.Dr Dinesh Khullar, a leading nephrologist and co-author of the ISOT statement, said they have suggested a screening criterion to decide whether kidneys donated from a diabetic deceased donor can be considered or not. ""Outright rejection is wrong. In my view, doctors should carry out individualised risk assessment of the donor organ and recipient profile to reach a conclusion,"" he said.Dr Shiv Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences said organs from deceased donors with a history of diabetes, hypertension or cancer can be used on a case-to-case basis. ""A liver biopsy should be done to see the extent of fibrosis and fat in liver from a diabetic donor, as one-third may be unfit. Similar caution for hypertensive donors for kidney donation needed. Organ from a donor cured of cancer for over two years, should be acceptable. """,Indian Society for Organ Transplantation says benefits far outweigh risks.

EC sources said ""tick marks"" against Shakun Rani's name on separate lists flagged by Rahul as ""EC data"" appeared fabricated, based on information in Form 17A maintained and retained by the respective polling officers.Access to Form 17A is limited to authorised EC officials and these are not shared with political parties. Polling agents of parties get polling records in Form 17C, which do not contain photographs. Form 17A is only produced if a court seeks it.Maharashtra's chief electoral officer S Chockalingam, who first wrote to Lok Sabha LoP on Aug 7, sent a reminder to submit his ""declaration/oath"" within 10 days so that proceedings could be initiated. In his first letter, the bureaucrat mentioned the dates on which the draft and final rolls had been shared with Congress, also pointing out that the party never filed first appeals with the district magistrates or second appeals with the election office.

""You are kindly requested to sign and return the enclosed Declaration/Oath under rule 20(3) (B) of the Registration of Electoral Rules 1960 with the names of such electors,"" it said.In an identical notice, Haryana CEO A Sreenivas gave Rahul 10 days to submit an affidavit under oath specifying his allegations about vote fraud along with supporting documents.A day after the presser, Sreenivas said his office had shared copies of electoral rolls with representatives of Congress during the meetings ahead of elections.

"After NISAR mission, India to launch 6500-kg US communication sat: Isro chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-nisar-mission-india-to-launch-6500-kg-us-communication-sat-isro-chief/articleshow/123223740.cms,"NEW DELHI: After launching the world's costliest earth observation mission NISAR in collaboration with the US on July 30, India is set to launch a US communication satellite —Block-2 BlueBird — weighing 6,500 kg in a couple of months, Isro chairman V Narayanan disclosed on Sunday.The Block 2 BlueBird satellite features large communication arrays, up to 2,400 sq ft, and has been designed to achieve data transmission speeds of up to 12 Mbps, enabling voice, data and video communication capabilities for end users. The satellite will provide direct-to-smartphone broadband connectivity, eliminating the need for specialised terminals.The next-generation American satellite is expected to reach India in Sept and will be launched aboard LVM-3-M5, Isro's heaviest rocket, from the Sriharikota spaceport. BlueBird satellite uses AST & Science's patented technologies for connecting to cellphones in a space environment for their SpaceMobile constellation.The satellite has a communications array measuring 64.38 sq m to establish direct connectivity with cellphones via 3GPP-standard frequencies, in partnership with leading cellular service providers around the world. After NISAR, the Block-2 BlueBird launch will further boost Indo-US space collaboration.Narayanan, who was presented with an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Maharashtra governor C.P. Radhakrishnan during the convocation ceremony at SRM Institute of Science and Technology at Kattankulathur near Chennai, talked about the rapid strides India’s made in the field of space technology.He said Isro was set up in 1963, with a tiny rocket being donated by the US that year to mark the beginning of the Indian space programme. In 1975, with satellite data given by the US, Isro demonstrated ‘mass communication’ through 2,400 TV sets at 2,400 villages across six Indian states. “From that (humble beginnings), the 30th of July was a historic day for the Indian space programme. We have launched the NISAR satellite, the costliest one ever built in the world. Today, we are working shoulder to shoulder with advanced countries,” Narayanan said.","The Block 2 BlueBird satellite features large communication arrays, up to 2,400 sq ft, and has been designed to achieve data transmission speeds of up to 12 Mbps.

'Torture' of Bengalis set to become Durga Puja theme across Kolkata,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/torture-of-bengalis-set-to-become-durga-puja-theme-across-kolkata/articleshow/123223564.cms,"KOLKATA: ""Atrocities"" against Bengalis in several states is set to be one of the major Durga Puja themes across Kolkata this year. Highlighting how alleged persecution of Bengali-speaking Indians and attempts to brand them ""Bangladeshis"" undermine the community's contributions to Indian society, several puja committees have decided to go big on themes underlining the heritage of Bengal, plight of migrant workers, and cultural and historical contributions of prominent Bengalis.From big players to new entrants, puja committees will focus on the ""harassment"" of migrant workers for speaking Bengali. While Behala's Adarshapally Club has set its theme on the plight of Bengali refugees during Partition, Baguiati Ashwininagar Bandhumahal will trace Bengal's history back to human existence in the delta 42,000 years ago.In its 81st year, Chaltabagan Sarbojonin's theme is 'Ami Banglay Bolchhi (I am speaking in Bangla)'. The pandal, interestingly, stands adjacent to the house of poet, playwright and lyricist Dwijendralal Roy. ""Our pandal will focus on the oppression of Bengalis,"" said organiser Mousam Banerjee.""Our puja theme will focus on how Bengali speakers are being illegally deported to Bangladesh and their basic rights being snatched, judging them on the basis of the language they speak,"" said Sanjay Das, chief organiser of the puja at Dum Dum Road Hanuman Mandir Jayashree Club.Bandhumahal is marking its 45th year with the theme 'Bangla o Bangali. Banglar Itihaas (Bengal and Bengalis. History of Bengal)'. The pandal will have installations of Rabindranath Tagore, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Raja Ram Mohan Roy.""Durga Puja is no longer limited to idol-viewing, offering prayers or grabbing a quick bite. Our festival is now honoured and admired on the world stage. That's why Puja theme ideas today are like complete thesis papers,"" said club secretary Swarup Nag.At Adarshapally, the focus is on filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak's works, particularly his film 'Meghe Dhaka Tara (The Cloud-Capped Star)'. Organisers say the theme draws parallels between the turmoil of Bengal during Ghatak's era and contemporary threats to Bengal's cultural fabric. ""It's about Bengal in peril - then and now,"" said organiser Shankar Ghosh.39 Pally Durgotsav Samiti's puja, primarily being organised by youths struggling with Down syndrome under the supervision of artist Snehasis Das, will focus on the theme of 'language terrorism'. ""In society's eyes, we are either outcasts or objects of pity. We wish to be tempered and hardened by the fiery struggles of life,"" an organiser said.","Several puja committees have decided to go big on themes underlining the heritage of Bengal.

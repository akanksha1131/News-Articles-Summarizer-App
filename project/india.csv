‘Mouths shut when Hindus are killed’: Yogi targets opposition in Assembly

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) national president Asaduddin Owaisi on has criticised the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, during a press conference held in Amravati.He referred to recent reports that claimed people's identities were being determined through mobile phones. Owaisi said that the UP government should be ""congratulated"" for the new ""invention"" to determine whether a person is Bangladeshi by placing a mobile phone on their back.Owaisi sarcastically said that even leading scientists and ISRO would be surprised by this ""technology.""He questioned whether citizenship and identity in India would now be determined by mobile phones. He said that such actions were not only ridiculous but also against both the law and the Constitution.Furthermore, Owaisi claimed that after a mosque, the administration has now taken bulldozer action against madrasas, which are being termed illegal, in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal district. He alleged that the government is acting arbitrarily in the name of bulldozer action and misusing the law.He alleged that the government is targeting a particular community and using the bulldozer as a political weapon.However, the administration says that the action is being taken only against illegal constructions and there is no discrimination against any community.The AIMIM chief alleged that such manoeuvres are creating an atmosphere of fear among the public and arbitrariness in the name of law and order. He demanded that the government adhere to constitutional and legal procedures on serious issues like identity and citizenship.He levelled serious allegations against the Modi government and the ruling parties regarding electoral politics. He stated that first, there was the issue of vote theft, and now candidates are being ""stolen.""He alleged that in many places, candidates are being forced to withdraw their nominations through intimidation, threats, or bribery, which is a very dangerous trend for democracy.Owaisi said that if voters are not provided with a candidate of their choice, the very foundation of democracy will be weakened. He also said that this process directly violates the public's right to vote, reducing elections to a mere formality.On the BMC elections, Owaisi said, ""If elections are being held unopposed anywhere through intimidation, threats, or bribery, then it is a threat to our democracy.""Owaisi appealed to political parties to keep constitutional obligations and social harmony in mind when making statements on issues like elections and population.Owaisi raised several serious questions about the central government's foreign policy and security strategy. He said that after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India took a tough stance and tightened its water-related agreements against Pakistan, but despite this, there was no hesitation in playing against Pakistan in international cricket tournaments.Calling this a ""double standard,"" Owaisi asked why normal relations are being pursued on the playing field while issuing strong statements on terrorism.Speaking on the Bangladesh issue, Owaisi said that a clear and transparent policy should be formulated regarding illegal Bangladeshi nationals living in India. Those living illegally should be deported through legal procedures, but the entire process should be in accordance with the Constitution and human values. He said that political stability in Bangladesh is crucial for the security and development of India, especially the northeastern states.Owaisi also said that increased strategic activities by China near the Bangladesh border and the presence of elements linked to Pakistan's intelligence agency are matters of concern. He stressed that these issues should be viewed not merely from a political perspective but in the broader context of national security.",All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) national president Asaduddin Owaisi on has criticised the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh.

‘Slavery Destroys Heritage’: PM Modi’s Big Message After Unveiling Sacred Buddha Piprahwa Relics

(Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India and is also the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust)

Somnath… hearing this word instils a sense of pride in our hearts and minds. It is the eternal proclamation of India’s soul. This majestic temple is situated on the western coast of India in Gujarat, at a place called Prabhas Patan. The Dwadasha Jyotirling Stotram mentions the 12 Jyotirlings across India.The stotram begins with “Saurashtre Somnatham Ch”, symbolising the civilisational and spiritual importance of Somnath as the first Jyotirling.It is also said: Somalingam Naro Drishtva Sarvapapaih PramuchyateLabhte Phalam Manovaanchitam Mritah Svargam SamaashrayetIt means: Just the sight of Somnath Shivling ensures that a person is freed of sins, achieves their righteous desires and attains heaven after death.Tragically, this very Somnath, which drew the reverence and prayers of millions, was attacked by foreign invaders, whose agenda was demolition, not devotion.The year 2026 is significant for the Somnath Temple . It has been 1,000 years since the first attack on this great shrine. It was in Jan of 1026 that Mahmud of Ghazni attacked this temple, seeking to destroy a great symbol of faith and civilisation, through a violent and barbaric invasion.Yet, one thousand years later, the temple stands as glorious as ever because of numerous efforts to restore Somnath to its grandeur. One such milestone completes 75 years in 2026. It was during a ceremony on May 11th, 1951, in the presence of the then President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad , that the restored temple opened its doors to devotees.The first invasion of Somnath a thousand years ago in 1026, the cruelty that was unleashed upon the people of the town and the devastation that was inflicted upon the shrine have been documented in great detail in various historical accounts.When you read them, the heart trembles. Each line carries the weight of grief, cruelty and a sorrow that refuses to fade with time.Imagine the impact it had on Bharat and the morale of the people. After all, Somnath had great spiritual significance. It was also on the coast, giving strength to a society with great economic prowess, whose sea traders and seafarers carried tales of its grandeur far and wide.Yet, I am proud to state unequivocally that the story of Somnath, a thousand years after the first attack, is not defined by destruction. It is defined by the unbreakable courage of crores of children of Bharat Mata.The medieval barbarism that began a thousand years ago in 1026 went on to ‘inspire’ others to repeatedly attack Somnath. It was the start of an attempt to enslave our people and culture. But, each time the temple was attacked, we also had great men and women who stood up to defend it and even made the ultimate sacrifice. And every single time, generation after generation, the people of our great civilisation picked themselves up, rebuilt and rejuvenated the temple. It is our privilege to have been nurtured by the same soil that has nurtured greats like Ahilyabai Holkar, who made a noble attempt to ensure devotees can pray at Somnath.In the 1890s, Swami Vivekananda visited Somnath and that experience moved him. He expressed his feelings during a lecture in Chennai in 1897 when he said, “Some of these old temples of southern India and those like Somnath of Gujarat will teach you volumes of wisdom, will give you a keener insight into the history of the race than any amount of books. Mark how these temples bear the marks of a hundred attacks and a hundred regenerations, continually destroyed and continually springing up out of the ruins, rejuvenated and strong as ever! That is the nationalmind, that is the national lifecurrent. Follow it and it leads to glory. Give it up and you die; death will be the only result, annihilation, the only effect, the moment you step beyond that life current.”The sacred duty of rebuilding the Somnath Temple after Independence came to the able hands of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. A visit during Diwali time in 1947 moved him so much that he announced that the temple will be rebuilt there. Finally, on May 11th, 1951, a grand temple in Somnath opened its doors to devotees and Dr Rajendra Prasad was present there. The great Sardar Sahib was not alive to see this historic day, but the fulfilment of his dream stood tall before the nation.The then Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, was not too enthused with this development. He did not want the honourable President as well as ministers to associate with this special event. He said that this event created a bad impression of India. But Dr Rajendra Prasad stood firm and the rest is history. No mention of Somnath is complete without recalling the efforts of KM Munshi, who supported Sardar Patel very effectively. His works on Somnath, including the book, ‘Somanatha: The Shrine Eternal’, are extremely informative and educative.Indeed, as the title of Munshi Ji’s book conveys, we are a civilisation that carries a sense of conviction about the eternity of spirit and of ideas. We firmly believe that that which is eternal is indestructible, as outlined in the famous Gita verse “ Nainam Chhindanti Shastraani ...”. There can be no better example of our civilisation’s indomitable spirit than Somnath, which stands gloriously, overcoming odds and struggles.It is this same spirit that is visible in our nation, one of the brightest spots of global growth, having overcome centuries of invasions and colonial loot. It is our value systems and the determination of our people that have made India the centre of global attention today. The world is seeing India with hope and optimism.They want to invest in our innovative youngsters. Ourart, culture, music and several festivals are going global. Yoga and Ayurveda are making a worldwide impact, boosting healthy living. Solutions to some of the most pressing global challenges are coming from India.Since time immemorial, Somnath has brought together people from different walks of life. Centuries ago, Kalikal Sarvagna Hemchandracharya, a respected Jain monk, came to Somnath. It is said that after praying there, he recited a verse, “ Bhavabijaankurjananaaraagaadyaah Kshayamupagataa Yasya” . It means: Salutations to That One in whom the seeds of worldly becoming are destroyed, in whom passion and all afflictions have withered away. Today, Somnath holds the same ability to awaken something profound within the mind and soul.A thousand years after the first attack in 1026, the sea at Somnath still roars with the same intensity as it did back then. The waves that wash the shores of Somnath tell a story. No matter what, just like the waves, it kept rising again and again. The aggressors of the past are now dust in the wind, their names synonymous with destruction. They are footnotes in the annals of history, while Somnath stands bright, radiating far beyond the horizon, reminding us of the eternal spirit that remained undiminished by the attack of 1026. Somnath is a song of hope that tells us that while hate and fanaticism may have the power to destroy for a moment, faith and conviction in the power of goodness have the power to create for eternity.If the Somnath Temple, which was attacked a thousand years ago and faced continuous attacks thereon, could rise again and again, then we can surely restore our great nation to the glory it embodied a thousand years ago before the invasions. With the blessings of Shree Somnath Mahadev, we move forward with a renewed resolve to build a Viksit Bharat, where civilisational wisdom guides us to work for the welfare of the whole world.Jai Somnath!","The year 2026 is significant for the Somnath Temple.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Economically Weaker Sections are entitled to general category posts if they secure the cutoff marks stipulated for general category.The ruling by a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine G Masih was inspired by SC's landmark verdict in the Indra Sawhney case of 1992 which had granted 27% reservation to OBCs in govt jobs. The bench dismissed a petition by Rajasthan HC which, while recruiting candidates for certain posts, had barred reserved category candidates from getting appointed against general category posts despite securing more marks than the cutoff fixed for general category.When an HC division bench ruled in favour of reserved category candidates who wanted to be considered for general category posts, HC moved SC, arguing that considering reserved category candidates for general category posts would amount to their being granted double benefit. Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, ""We hold that the word 'open' connotes nothing but 'open', meaning thereby that vacant posts which are sought to be filled by earmarking it as 'open' do not fall in any category.Upholding the HC division bench's decision, SC said, ""The availability of reservation doesn't operate as a bar for a reserved category candidate from being considered on merit against the unreserved category.""The HC recruitment process was based on a written test followed by an interview. SC said if a reserved category candidate gets more marks more than the cutoff prescribed for general category, they should be considered to be in general category while appearing for interview. If the cumulative marks fall short of the cutoff for general category, they would be considered under the reserved category to which they belonged.",Ruling was inspired by SC's landmark verdict in the Indra Sawhney case of 1992.

Traffic to Sonprayag, P 10

.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to improve connectivity to Kedarnath, reduce travel time by road and enhance pilgrims' safety, the govt has zeroed in on the construction of a 7-km tunnel connecting Chaumasi in Kalimath Valley near Guptkashi to Sonprayag, the starting point of the ropeway project which will take pilgrims to the shrine.The twin tube tunnel will not just be an alternative but also serve as an escape route in case of emergency and bad weather. The govt will also carry out a feasibility study for a walkway and pedestrian tunnel from Chaumasi side for better connectivity to Kedarnath shrine.At present, all vehicles heading to Sonprayag and Gauri Kund take NH-107.As per the plan, the existing one-lane road in Kalimath Valley, which is under the Uttarakhand govt, will be expanded to two lanes to cater to increased traffic once the tunnel becomes operational.TOI has learnt the road transport ministry held a detailed discussion last week with Uttarakhand govt on the proposal. It took note of the increased number of pilgrims and tourists in Kedarnath, which stood at 17.7 lakh last year and is estimated to rise to 25 lakh in 2030 and 40 lakh in 2040.Taking lessons from the Sylkiyara tunnel episode, detailed geological and hydrological investigations will be carried out. The govt has awarded to Adani Enterprises the 12.9-km Sonprayag-Kedarnath ropeway project, which is likely to be operational in 2031-32.It will have the capacity to carry 1,800 pilgrims per hour, and pilgrims will be able to complete a one-way trip in just 40 minutes.",The twin tube tunnel will not just be an alternative but also serve as an escape route in case of emergency and bad weather.

Usually banks are shut only on second and fourth Saturdays of the month according to the RBI calendar.Banks in West Bengal will be closed to mark the birthday of Swami Vivekananda.Banking services will be suspended in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh on account of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.Banks in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain shut in observance of Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be closed for Thiruvalluvar Day, followed by another closure in the state on January 17, 2026, due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic Day.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute disruptions. However, a bank holiday does not mean that no banking activity is available. Even when branches are closed, customers can continue to access online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to the branch, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan such activities ahead of time and rely on digital banking options during bank closures.","Banks in India observe a mix of national and state-specific holidays.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available.

"In a 1st in world, Army set to deploy ramjet-powered shells for 155mm artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-world-army-set-to-deploy-ramjet-powered-shells-for-155mm-artillery-guns/articleshow/126330397.cms,"From Missiles To Torpedoes, DRDO Outlines India’s Big Defence Push For Near-Term Battlefield Edge

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

BENGALURU: Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh Sunday — Jan 4, 2025 — stressed the need for strict adherence to delivery timelines, warning that delays could affect IAF’s operational readiness, even as he congratulated ADA on the completion of 25 years of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas flight.Inaugurating the two-day national seminar “Aeronautics 2047” here, Singh said meeting committed schedules was critical at a time when the operational environment was rapidly evolving and the IAF’s requirements were growing.Aeronautics 2047 will also trace the journey of LCA Tejas from early design sketches to operational squadrons. Designed and developed by ADA, Tejas has completed more than 5,600 successful flight trials.“More than 100 design and development centres, including govt laboratories, academic institutions and industry partners, have contributed to the programme. The effort led to the development of several niche technologies such as carbon composites, lightweight materials, fly-by-wire flight control, digital utility management systems and a glass cockpit, enabling Tejas to emerge as a fourth-generation fighter aircraft,” the ministry of defence (MoD) said.The LCA-Mk1A, an advanced variant of Tejas, is expected to serve as a key platform for meeting the IAF’s operational requirements. The LCA-Mk2 and the naval variant are currently under development. The seminar features a series of technical talks by engineers, test pilots and scientists closely associated with the Tejas programme.According to ADA officials, the LCA programme has helped India build both capability and capacity to design and manufacture fighter aircraft domestically. So far, 38 aircraft, including 32 fighters and six trainers, have been inducted into two IAF squadrons.Secretary, department of defence R&D, and DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat, stressed the importance of developing indigenous, cutting-edge technologies to reduce dependence on imports. This, he said, “was central to achieving the vision of Viksit Bharat @2047”.The seminar brought together experts from industry, academia, government laboratories and the wider aerospace community.Discussions are centred on the future trajectory of Indian aeronautics, with sessions covering next-generation aircraft manufacturing and assembly, digital manufacturing, advanced aerodynamics, propulsion systems, flight testing techniques, digital twin technology, certification challenges, flight control systems and avionics, maintainability of fighter aircraft, artificial intelligence in aircraft design, and precision manufacturing for actuators.As part of the event, public sector undertakings, defence PSUs, private industry and MSMEs are showcasing indigenously designed products and systems for airborne applications.","Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh stressed the need for strict adherence to delivery timelines.

"Confusion, queues, goof-ups mark 2 months of SIR in Bengal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/confusion-queues-goof-ups-mark-2-months-of-sir-in-bengal/articleshow/126339923.cms,"West Bengal SIR Brings Home A Man Presumed Dead For 28 Years In UP’s Muzaffarnagar

KOLKATA: Sunday marked two months of the SIR rollout in Bengal as people struggle to get back something as basic as their voting right amid confusion among officials over which documents are kosher, multiple orders from Election Commission, flip-flops, and innumerable goof-ups.The chaotic drive led CM Mamata Banerjee to write on Saturday to chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar to either ""rectify glitches"" or halt the ""unplanned, arbitrary and ad-hoc"" SIR of electoral rolls.Banerjee asked the CEC why Bengal was being ""singled out"" for ""arbitrary and illegal"" voter deletions. This was her fourth letter to Kumar since SIR began.Jayanti Devi (80) was one face of the confusion. Laden with a bag of medicines and documents, she stood clueless outside an SIR hearing camp at Chetla Boys' High School in Kolkata Sunday. She was asked to come for a second hearing with an old ration card or her parents' documents. ""I cannot hear or see properly. I can hardly walk... I don't have many documents, but I have a voter card. I have always cast my vote. Now they are saying there is a problem,"" she said.Jayanti's son said they had not been told of the EC order that voters aged 85 or more, as well as those who are sick or disabled, will not be called to such hearings.""They (EC officials) did come, but only to inform us about the hearing date. My parents moved to Chetla in 1967. She has been voting here since,"" he said.At Kalighat High School, Sister John Paul of the Missionaries of Charity had to appear for a hearing for putting Sister Nirmala in the column for her ""parent's name"" - the standard practice among all such orders and one acknowledged by EC.A Goan, Sister Paul came to Bengal in 2002 - the reference year for SIR in Bengal. In 2006, she had her voter and Aadhaar cards made and Sister Nirmala, then superior general of missionaries of charity, was named her guardian in the documents. ""I did not have my birth certificate with me. My sister sent it to me. It's absolute chaos,"" the 46-year-old said. Around 10 nuns of the order have received hearing notices.Roma Samanta, a voter in Kolkata's Rashbehari, got a hearing notice as her name was mixed up with a namesake from Kaliaganj in North Dinajpur district, over 400km away. ""We have been living here for 30 years... Our BLO told us to write a letter to the CEO. We have come to submit that,"" Samanta's husband said.In her letter to the CEC, the CM highlighted some of these hassles. ""Family register, extensively accepted as valid proof of identity during the SIR exercise in Bihar, is now reportedly being denied... such selective and unexplained exclusion of a previously accepted document raises serious concerns of discrimination and arbitrariness,"" Banerjee wrote.The CM claimed residence/domicile certificates issued by state authorities were also being rejected. Calling EC insensitive, CM said even the ""elderly, infirm, and seriously ill citizens are not being spared"". ""Many electors are being compelled to travel 20-25km to attend hearings, which have inexplicably been centralised rather than decentralised,"" she wrote.Amid the outcry, the poll panel announced 160 more SIR hearing centres, mostly in north Bengal. The new centres will be set up keeping in mind geographical constraints and distance for voters, EC officials said.","Sunday marked two months of the SIR rollout in Bengal.

Massive Car Explosion Near Delhi’s Red Fort Hours After Faridabad Terror Plot bust, Many Dead

The ‘dual-phone’ playbook

A disturbing trend

How does the government plan to tackle this?

The

white-collar terror module

NEW DELHI: Investigations into the blast near Delhi’s Red Fort on November 10 last year have revealed how a ""white-collar"" terror module relied on a sophisticated network of “ghost” SIM cards and encrypted messaging apps to stay in touch with Pakistani handlers.The accused, many of them highly educated doctors, used illegally obtained or fraudulently issued SIM cards and multiple mobile devices to evade surveillance.The findings of this probe subsequently became the basis for a sweeping directive issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on November 28, mandating that app-based communication services such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal must remain continuously linked to an active physical SIM card installed in the device.A “ghost” SIM card is a mobile connection that is illegally issued or fraudulently activated without being linked to the actual user, security officials said. Such SIMs are typically obtained using forged or misused identity documents, including Aadhaar details of unsuspecting civilians, or through bulk activations that bypass verification norms.Investigators say these numbers allow criminals and terror operatives to communicate and use encrypted messaging applications while remaining largely untraceable, posing a significant challenge to telecom surveillance and law enforcement agencies.Officials said the probe uncovered a tactical ""dual-phone"" protocol followed by the module.Each accused carried two to three mobile phones. One ""clean"" handset, registered in their own name, was used for routine personal and professional communication to avoid suspicion. The second, described as a “terror phone”, was used exclusively for encrypted communication with handlers in Pakistan through WhatsApp and Telegram, officials said.The SIM cards used in these secondary devices were issued in the names of unsuspecting civilians whose Aadhaar details had been misused, the officials told news agency PTI. In a parallel development, Jammu and Kashmir Police also uncovered a separate racket in which SIM cards were issued using fake Aadhaar cards.Among those arrested were Muzammil Ganaie and Adeel Rather, while Dr Umar-un-Nabi, another key accused, was killed while driving an explosives-laden vehicle near the Red Fort, officials said. The Pakistani handlers were identified by the codenames ‘Ukasa’, ‘Faizan’ and ‘Hashmi’.Investigators said security agencies noted a disturbing trend in which these compromised SIMs remained active on messaging platforms even when the devices were being operated from Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK) or Pakistan. By exploiting app features that allow continued access without a physical SIM inside the device, handlers were able to remotely guide the module.Officials said the operatives were directed to learn improvised explosive device (IED) assembly through online videos and plan “hinterland” attacks, even though some of the recruits initially wanted to join conflict zones in Syria or Afghanistan.To plug these vulnerabilities, the Centre invoked the Telecommunications Act, 2023, along with the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, to “safeguard the integrity of the telecom ecosystem”. Under the new framework, all Telecommunication Identifier User Entities (TIUEs) have been given 90 days to ensure their applications function only when an active SIM card is present in the device.The order also directs telecom operators to automatically log users out of platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal if no active SIM is detected. Messaging and social media platforms, including Snapchat, Sharechat and Jiochat, have been asked to submit compliance reports to the DoT.“This feature of using apps without a SIM is posing a challenge to telecom cyber security as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber frauds and terror activities,” the DoT had said while explaining the rationale behind the move.The directive is being fast-tracked in the Jammu and Kashmir telecom circle. While officials acknowledge that deactivating all expired or fraudulent SIMs will take time, the move is being viewed as a significant blow to the digital infrastructure used by terror networks to radicalise and manage “white-collar” operatives.Failure to comply with the new norms will attract stringent action under the Telecom Cyber Security Rules and other applicable laws, officials said.The “white-collar” terror module began to unravel on the intervening night of October 18-19, 2025, when posters of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) appeared on walls outside Srinagar city, warning of attacks on police and security forces in the Valley.Treating the development as a serious threat, Senior Superintendent of Police, Srinagar, GV Sundeep Chakravarthy constituted multiple teams to carry out an in-depth investigation. Based on the statements of the arrested accused, the probe led police to Al Falah University in Haryana’s Faridabad, where two doctors, Ganaie, a resident of Koil in south Kashmir’s Pulwama, and Shaheen Sayeed from Lucknow, were arrested.A large cache of arms and ammunition, including 2,900 kg of ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and sulphur, was seized during the operation, officials said.The car explosion near the Red Fort, which claimed 15 lives, is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).","Officials said the probe uncovered a tactical ""dual-phone"" protocol followed by the module. Each accused carried two to three mobile phones. One ""clean"" handset was used for routine personal and professional communication. The second, described as a “terror phone” was used exclusively for encrypted communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126333293,imgsize-122652,width-400,resizemode-4/red-fort-blast.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday weighed-in on the US strikes on Venezuela, a day before, calling it ""law of the jungle"".The US carried out multiple airstrikes on Venezuela early Saturday, triggering explosions across Caracas and paving the way for the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The dramatic escalation was confirmed hours later by US President Donald Trump. Venezuelan authorities declared a state of emergency as panic swept the capital following the attacks, which left at least 40 people dead.Talking about the situation, the chair of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, replied to a post by Indian author Kapil Komireddi, saying ""International law and the UN Charter have for some years now been honoured in the breach. The Law of the Jungle prevails today. “Might is Right” is the new creed.""Congress general secretary in charge of Communications Jairam Ramesh also gave a statement on behalf of Congress saying, ""The INC expresses very grave concern on US actions relating to Venezuela in the past 24 hours. Settled principles of international law cannot be violated unilaterally.""Meanwhile, Congress leader and Member of Rajya Sabha Abhishek Manu Singhvi called it ""19th-cen imperialism"".""Regime change by cruise missile, democracy delivered by warship, & sovereignty rewritten under self-styled Doctrine? Not leadership, this is 19th-cen imperialism in 21st-cen jargon. If international law matters only to weak, UN should shut shop. world deserves rules, not lunatic rulers,"" he said on X.AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi said that US set an example that India should follow. """"Today we heard that US President Donald Trump's forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and took him from his country to America. If US President Donald Trump can abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from his own country, then you (Prime Minister Modi) can also go to Pakistan and bring back the mastermind of the 26/11 terrorist attacks to India,"" he said.In response to Owaisi, BJP MP Gulam Ali Khatana said, talking to ANI, ""The entire country has praised the Indian armed forces. The way terrorists were eliminated and neutralised under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, only Prime Minister Modi's government could have done this. Were we supposed to bring them here and feed them?""Shiv Sena leader Shaina NC also hit back at the AIMIM leader saying, """"Asaduddin Owaisi, don't you worry. Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India has become the world's fourth-largest economy. We have demonstrated unparalleled strength through Operation Sindoor, we have launched missiles, we have eradicated terrorism from Pakistan... we have even secured the extradition of Tahawwur Rana... Unlike you, we do not engage in appeasement politics. .. You continue with your politics of appeasement, and we will continue doing our work.""Shaina NC also spoke about the escalating situation in Venezuela itself. ""India has always maintained cordial relations with Venezuela, with strong diplomatic engagements over the years. This is a matter of grave concern, as ties with Latin America and South America have been carefully nurtured,"" she said, while talking to PTI.Further referring to the MEA statement on the crisis she added, ""The Ministry of External Affairs has advised that the safety of Indian nationals living there should be prioritised. No country can go around bullying the world; the situation must be viewed holistically. The global community today is worried about such actions, surgical strikes, and, above all, the safety of citizens, which must be seen from a collective global perspective. ”The ministry of external affairs, in its official statement, reiterated India’s support for the safety of people in Venezuela. ""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" it said.""We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability of the region. The Embassy of India in Caracas is in contact with members of the Indian community and will continue to provide all possible assistance,"" it added.","Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday weighed-in on the US strikes on Venezuela, a day before, calling it ""law of the jungle"" Congress leader and Member of Rajya Sabha Abhishek Manu Singhvi called it ""19th-cen imperialism""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126334079,imgsize-539084,width-400,resizemode-4/article.jpg"

Indian Army Raises Bhairav Special Force With Over One Lakh Drone Operatives For Modern Warfare

NASIRABAD: At a time when the Centre is pushing for restructuring the defence forces, the Indian Army has carried out one of the biggest ever transformations to meet modern warfare challenges creating a pool of over one lakh drone operatives across the force.Bhairav, the latest Special Force raised by the Indian Army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare, as all operatives are capable of handling drones and use them in real operations for targeting bases and formations inside enemy territory.Team visited one of the newly raised Bhairav battalions in the desert sector under the Southern Command, where it witnessed the capabilities of the troops who had been selected from Infantry regiments to raise the Special Force and were being given special training as per the requirements of modern warfare.The Bhairav battalions raised by Army Headquarters with lessons from global and own conflicts in mind, have been created to provide a dedicated force for high-speed, offensive operations to carry out the Special Forces tasking at multiple levels as per requirements.The Indian Army has raised around 15 of these battalions already, and they have been assigned to different formations on both borders and have plans to raise around 25 of them in total in the near future.The Bhairav battalions would also bridge the gap between the Para Special Forces and the regular Infantry battalions. The Bhairav would also be tasked to carry out Special Operations at tactical to operational depth.""Modern warfare is changing at a very rapid pace. The conflicts of today are hybrid in nature, and one needs to be fully equipped with modern technology to be able to deal with the Challenges. The Bhairav battalions have also been created as part of the force restructuring, which have been raised in line with the requirements of modern technology, new thought process and as per the new operational requirements,"" Commanding Officer of the 2 Bhairav Battalion told ANI in an exclusive interview.""I am the Commanding officer of the desert Bhairav battalion of the Southern Command of the Indian Army. The desert has its own challenges where special skill sets, endurance and technology are required to be used in the right way. That is why the Bhairav has been raised as a technology-driven system which can operate independently and carry out multi-domain operations in the future,"" he added.Explaining about the formation of the unit, the Commanding officer said, ""The desert Bhairav Battalion has been raised on the concept of 'Sons of the Soil' as the majority of the troops are from Rajasthan who can understand the terrain, language, weather and the area. The battalion has been built upon the legacy of the valour and gallantry of Rajanghan, and that is our biggest strength. We are ready to meet any challenge in the desert sector. ""The Bhairav battalions have trained very hard in the last five months since their raising, using modern technology and carried out successful operational validation during the Exercise Akhand Prahar, where the troops showcased their readiness in the presence of Southern Army Commander Lt Gen Dhiraj Seth.The Commanding Officer said the force was evolving very strongly and emerging as the ""Swift, Capable and Decisive"" force of the Southern Command and the Indian Army. The Bhairav battalions would also be part of the India Army's Army Day Parade at Jaipur to be held on January 15 this year. The 2 Bhairav, also known as the Desert Falcons, would be taking part in the event.The Indian Army has also carried out major force restructuring keeping in mind the operational requirements and created Rudra Brigades, which are all-arms formations that combine infantry, mechanised units, tanks, artillery, special forces, and unmanned aerial systems with dedicated logistics and combat support.The Artillery, Mechanised Infantry and the Armoured Corps are also being equipped with modern warfare equipment like drones and other capabilities to be able to perform tasks more efficiently.","Bhairav, the latest Special Force raised by the Indian Army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare.

"With MGNREGA agitation, Cong eyes long-term drive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-mgnrega-agitation-cong-eyes-long-term-drive/articleshow/126339988.cms,"'MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan': Congress Announces Nationwide Protest Against VB-G RAM G Act

NEW DELHI: As it takes a determined step to agitate for MGNREGA with the successful farm laws stir as motivation, Congress views the agitation as a long-term sensitisation programme than the one which can radically change the status of the scheme disbanded by Modi govt. The reason is that the nature of the stakeholder in the rural job scheme is the poor working class in contrast to the big farmers involved in the campaign against farm laws.As MGNREGA workers are fighting for daily survival, it is conceded they cannot be mobilised for a long struggle over a future concern. This is in stark contrast to farm laws agitation which witnessed farmers from across the north gather for a prolonged dharna, which finally forced Centre to roll back three Acts. The marked difference in social clout of the two groups is what seems to complicate the struggle which otherwise, many feel, was a straight battle.Interestingly, the other agitation, which forced Modi govt to backtrack in its early days in power, was against ""weakening"" of land acquisition law, led by Rahul Gandhi. But that too involved farmers who were concerned about easing of acquisition norms.In contrast, MGNREGA changes may actually put farmers against labourers, and the protest, because of the policy of pausing G RAM G Act for two months during the agricultural season.Thus, it is felt, the agitation for MGNREGA is more a long-term campaign, which would seek to sensitise the poor workers and prepare them for the time when ""they feel the pinch"" of the new G RAM G Act.The difference between past successful agitations and proposed MGNREGA campaign was discussed in Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting last week that considered the issue.Sources said CWC acknowledged the battle will be prolonged, as wage earners cannot be called away from work to join a struggle. Instead, political activists will have to visit work sites and villages to sensitise the groups that, according to Congress, will be hurt by the changes from the job guarantee scheme brought in the new law - like budget, pause during agriculture season, panchayat-level planning. This will also require coordination with voluntary organisations involved in the job guarantee scheme.",Congress views the agitation as a long-term sensitisation programme than the one which can radically change the status of the scheme.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday wrote to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, criticising the ""procedural violations"" and ""administrative lapses"" in the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), which is currently under way in the poll-bound state.Mamata Banerjee called the exercise ""unplanned, arbitrary and adhoc"" and urged the poll body chief to stop the SIR if glitches remain unattainted.""I am once again constrained to write to you in order to place on record my grave concern regarding the serious irregularities, procedural violations, and administrative lapses being witnessed during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in West Bengal,"" she wrote in a letter.She also expressed apprehension about the large-scale disenfranchisement of eligible voters, which she said would be a ""direct assault on the foundational principles of democratic governance"".""I strongly urge you to immediately address and rectify the glitches, address the flaws and make the necessary corrections, failing which this unplanned, arbitrary and adhoc exercise must be halted. If allowed to continúe in its present form, it will result in irreparable damage, large-scale disenfranchisement of eligible voters, and a direct assault on the foundational principles of democratic governance, "" she further wrote.In November last year, describing the ongoing SIR in West Bengal as “unplanned, chaotic, and dangerous,” Mamata Banerjee said that the situation had reached an “alarming stage” following the deaths of multiple booth-level officers (BLOs), including an anganwadi worker in Jalpaiguri.In a letter addressed to Gyanesh Kumar, Banerjee said she had “time and again flagged my serious concerns” but had now been “compelled to write” as the situation had deteriorated sharply.She wrote that the manner in which the EC had pushed the SIR onto officials and residents was “not only unplanned and chaotic, but also dangerous”, alleging the absence of basic preparedness, clear communication, or adequate planning.According to her, the process has been “crippled from day one” by poor training, confusion over mandatory documentation, and the near impossibility of meeting voters during their work hours.She warned that the credibility of the voter roll itself was at risk, saying BLOs were being forced to work “far beyond human limits” while balancing their principal duties as teachers and frontline workers.Banerjee said most BLOs were struggling with online submissions because of server failures and repeated data mismatches, making it “almost certain” that accurate voter data could not be uploaded by the 4 December deadline. She added that many BLOs, under fear of punitive action, were being pushed to submit incorrect entries, “risking disenfranchisement of genuine voters”.","Mamata Banerjee criticises ""procedural violations"" and ""administrative lapses"" in the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in West Bengal.

Rodriguez, 56, is a senior figure in Venezuela’s socialist leadership and a close ally of Maduro. She has previously served as vice president, finance minister and oil minister, and has played a central role in economic decision-making as the country grappled with US sanctions and surging inflation.","The ministry of external affairs on Sunday reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela.

The report flagged systemic lapses in monitoring and testing of drinking water by urban local bodies while putting out the tally of 5.45 lakh diseases in the two cities.The report cautioned that ""the possibility of contaminated water being supplied by the MCs (municipal corporations) during the period could not be ruled out"". Such CAG reports are part of its assessments of the civic bodies' finances.To assess ground realities, CAG's audit conducted joint sampling in Aug-Sept 2018 with officials of Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC). A total of 54 samples were collected from water sources, filter plants, overhead tanks and consumer taps, and independently tested at the State Research Laboratory, Bhopal.In BMC areas, turbidity in some samples exceeded BIS norms, while faecal coliform, which should be 0, was detected in multiple samples. In Indore, faecal coliform counts ranged from 40 to 140, far above permissible limits.The auditor noted that 8.95 lakh residents -- 3.62 lakh in Bhopal and 5.33 lakh in Indore -- were likely to be affected due to the supply of contaminated water containing faecal coliform, pointing to a ""lack of monitoring of filter plants at the operational level as well as at the distribution level"".CAG raised concerns again in the audit report on local bodies for the year ended March 31, 2022, which found that seven of the 14 urban local bodies randomly audited did not have water testing laboratories.CAG observed that tests were not conducted regularly and that civic bodies failed to follow minimum sampling frequencies prescribed in the CPHEEO manual, warning that ""adverse effects on the health of the population due to supply of water without regular testing cannot be ruled out"". CPHEEO is short for Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation, a technical wing of the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.After the recent Indore deaths, NGO Jan Swastha Abhiyan has written to the MP chief secretary and the Union Jal Shakti ministry, citing the repeated audit findings, demanding urgent action and stressing that warnings sounded years ago were never translated into sustained corrective measures.",Official audits had warned for years that contaminated drinking water posed serious public health risks in Madhya Pradesh. 5.45 lakh cases of water-borne diseases were recorded in Bhopal and Indore civic areas between 2013 and 2018.

INDORE: The health administration in Indore on Sunday declared the waterborne disease outbreak in Bhagirathpura locality an epidemic, calling in specialised teams from the Central and state govts to contain the spread and identify the root cause of contamination that has claimed 10 lives so far in the area.Chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Madhav Hasani said, ""An epidemic is defined by reporting more cases of a disease than usual for a specific area. We are now treating the outbreak on that scale. These national teams are analysing our survey data to determine if the contamination originated from a single source or multiple points.""A high-level meeting was chaired by district collector Shivam Verma at the Smart City office on Sunday morning to coordinate with specialists from across India, who include ICMR-NIRBI (Kolkata) scientists Dr Pramit Ghosh and Dr Gautam Chaudhary from the National Institute for Research in Bacterial Infections, Dr Anubhav from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), along with experts in community medicine and epidemiology from the State Surveillance Team (Bhopal).The team from Kolkata collected random water samples using advanced scientific methods to pinpoint the exact bacterial strains involved.Verma said the Narmada water supply in the affected zone remained suspended and would be restored only after the experts certify the pipelines as fully decontaminated.Verma told the experts that, to manage the crisis at a micro-level, the entire Bhagirathpura area was divided into 32 beats.In each beat, dedicated teams worked with residents to ensure mandatory chlorination of all govt and private borewells. ""Residents have been instructed to drain and clean basement storage tanks (hoj), followed by professional chlorination before any reuse,"" he said.Addressing public anxiety regarding secondary health complications, Verma said, ""I want to clarify that no cases of GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) were found in the city,"" dismissing rumours of the neurological disorder being linked to the current outbreak.Verma said the administration continued to supply clean drinking water via tankers, while health workers distributed liquid chlorine drops door-to-door.He said multi-departmental teams conducted house-to-house surveys, with random sampling extended to other areas of the city where complaints were received.""Affected patients are receiving free treatment, including necessary injections and medications, at various hospitals under the supervision of specialists called in from neighbouring districts,"" he said.",Indore declares waterborne disease outbreak in Bhagirathpura locality an epidemic.

NEW DELHI: In a landmark advance for thalassemia care, US FDA has approved Mitapivat, the first oral treatment for anaemia in adults with thalassemia, covering both transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent alpha and beta disease.Clinicians and patient groups in India have welcomed the decision as a potential game changer for a lifelong genetic blood disorder that currently depends largely on repeated blood transfusions and iron chelation. The drug, however, is not yet available in India, as it has not received approval from DCGI.Calling the approval a historic shift, Dr Rahul Bhargava, director and head of hematology and hemato-oncology at Fortis Institute of Blood Disorders, said Mitapivat targets the disease at its cellular core by correcting red-cell metabolism rather than only managing consequences.From a transfusion-medicine perspective, Dr Rishiraj Sinha from AIIMS said adult patients have long borne the clinical and quality-of-life burden of lifelong transfusions and chelation. ""The approval of the first oral therapy for both transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia is a meaningful shift in disease management.

"NHAI flags 424 'telecom black spots', urges TRAI to step in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-flags-424-telecom-black-spots-urges-trai-to-step-in/articleshow/126340003.cms,"Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

NEW DELHI: Lack of mobile network coverage on highway and expressway stretches is not only causing inconvenience to commuters but is also a concern for NHAI as cellular connectivity gaps affect emergency communication to responders - such as ambulance services and patrol vehicles - in case of an incident.Flagging this, NHAI has urged telecom regulator TRAI to direct operators to improve mobile network connectivity on these sections.The authority has identified 424 such ""telecom black spots"" covering around 1,750km and has shared this with TRAI.TOI has learnt that NHAI chairman Satosh Kumar Yadav, in a letter to TRAI chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti, pointed out that no mobile network is adversely impacting highway operations, coordination with field units and enforcement agencies.Officials said missing mobile network is more prevalent on greenfield highways and expressways, and remote sections, including stretches of Delhi-Mumbai and Bengaluru-Chennai expressways. For instance, data shared with TRAI mentions how three stretches of Delhi-Mumbai expressway passing through Ratlam (approx 69km) has no mobile network. Similarly, the entire 51km stretch between Harda and Betul in Madhya Pradesh has no network.The list of missing mobile networks include nearly 15km of Bengaluru-Chennai expressway, 17km of Tambaram-Tindivanam section in TN, 11.8km of Warangal-Khammam section in Andhra, 10.8km of Mumbai-Vadodara expressway in Thane.NHAI has also identified around 1,665 accident-prone locations due to stray cattle movement across NHs and expressways. Officials said it has also taken up this with TRAI and proposed proactive SMS and flash SMS alerts at geo-mapped accident-prone zones, including stretches affected by stray cattle movement and other hazards.""Alerts are intended to reach users approximately 15 minutes in advance as they approach such locations. NHAI has urged TRAI to issue directions to telecom operators to facilitate these alerts free of cost, purely in the interest of road user safety. This will save several lives,"" said an official.","NHAI has urged telecom regulator TRAI to direct operators to improve mobile network connectivity on these sections.

People in the know of the development said an informal group of ministers is holding deliberations on this agenda.They added that the themes have been chosen considering govt targets’ focus to achieve the goal of a developed nation by undertaking major reforms to push growth.Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the government since Aug 15, 2022, when PM Narendra Modi spoke about it from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This was also one of the five pledges (Panch Pran). “When we see even the smallest thing related to colonialism in us or around us, we have to be rid of it... Indians should shed ‘colonialism’ from their minds and habits,” Modi had said.Last week, speaking at the Veer Baal Diwas programme, the PM had said that by 2035, people will ensure that the nation is completely “free from the mentality of slavery”. He has increasingly invoked the theme of colonialism and the need to shed its lingering impact on the national psyche and development.Construction of the new Parliament building, changing the name of Rajpath to Kartavya Path and shifting the seat of power from the South and North Blocks are also being seen as part of this government’s bigger plan to put an end to the colonial past.Similarly, the government has projected that the economic growth and improved ranking in ease of doing business are results of its agenda of reforms.Officials said that while the ministries will share the steps they have taken so far, they will also provide some details of the future steps to improve ease of living and doing business.",Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the government.

Coinciding with the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Monday distributed scholarships worth Rs 25.25 crore to 1,709 meritorious students from economically weaker sections under the Delhi Higher and Technical Education Assistance Scheme.Addressing the scholarship distribution programme at Thyagaraj Stadium, Gupta said providing financial assistance to students was the Delhi government's investment in their future and a step towards strengthening the city's youth.The event was attended by Education Minister Ashish Sood, senior officials of the Education Department, vice chancellors of various universities, educationists and a large number of students, according to a statement.The chief minister said that scholarship amounts for the academic years 2023-24 and 2024-25 had been transferred directly to the bank accounts of eligible students studying in universities across Delhi. She also informed that a pending scholarship amount of Rs 19 crore from the previous government's tenure had been released by the present government, asserting that no funds earmarked for students' education would remain pending in future.Marking National Youth Day, Gupta urged students to draw inspiration from the thoughts and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda and to pursue their goals with dedication and discipline.She said the progress of the nation depended on the advancement of its youth and highlighted the role of young people in achieving the goal of a developed India by 2047.The chief minister also said that national development was not possible through government policies alone and required the collective responsibility and active participation of citizens.Speaking on the occasion, Sood said the government was committed to improving the education sector and ensuring that students from disadvantaged backgrounds received adequate support.He said the government's approach was guided by the principle of Antyodaya, aimed at ensuring that benefits reached those at the lowest rung of society. He said the Narela Education City project, which had remained stalled for several years, was now being implemented.He added that the project's budget had been increased from Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,300 crore and would include shared university campuses, auditoriums, libraries, digital libraries and ICT laboratories spread across 160 acres.The Education Minister said the objective of the government was to address challenges in the education sector through policy measures and effective implementation, adding that education would play a key role in shaping leadership for the future.Meritorious students from economically weaker sections who have passed Class XII from Delhi schools with at least 75 per cent marks and meet the prescribed income criteria are eligible for financial assistance under the Delhi Higher and Technical Education Assistance Scheme, it said.The scholarship amount is transferred directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, it added.","Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta distributed scholarships worth Rs 25.25 crore to 1,709 meritorious students from economically weaker sections.

Ex-Admiral Prakash submits eligibility documents; set to be included in Goa’s final roll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-admiral-prakash-submits-eligibility-documents-set-to-be-included-in-goas-final-roll/articleshow/126497027.cms,".

New Delhi: Former Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retired) on Monday reportedly submitted all the necessary documents linking him to the electoral roll from last special intensive revision (SIR), paving the way for early resolution of the matter relating to the system-driven notice issued to him after all the fields in his enumeration form (EF) pertaining to linkage with the last SIR roll, were left blank.""The documents were collected by the competent field officer on Monday and the matter will be settled, perhaps by Tuesday, making the retired Admiral and his wife eligible for inclusion in the final electoral roll of Cortalim assembly constituency (AC) in Goa,"" an officer aware of the proceedings told TOI on Monday.Similarly, a hearing due on Jan 16 on the notice served to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, an elector in Bolpur AC of West Bengal, after the age of his mother, with whom he was mapped in the EF filled and submitted by his relative, was reportedly found to be less than Sen's, is expected to sort out the anomaly. A hearing will be held at Sen's registered address at Shanti Niketan, and the relative will have the opportunity to correctly map Sen to the SIR from the last roll, said an officer.In a clarification issued in Admiral Prakash's case on Monday, the Cortalim ERO explained that his EF was categorised as “unmapped” after it was observed that the said EF did not contain the mandatory particulars relating to the previous SIR, including the name of the elector, EPIC number, name of the relative, name and number of the AC, part number, and serial number in the electoral roll.""In the absence of these essential identification details, the BLO application was unable to establish an automatic linkage between the submitted EF and the existing electoral roll database,” the ERO said.Underlining that the BLO application is designed to automatically map EFs only when the prescribed identification particulars are duly filled in, the Cortalim ERO said the blank fields in Prakash’s EF triggered the system to categorise his EF as “unmapped"", mandating an auto-generated notice for further verification through a hearing mechanism.""As per the standard, system-driven procedure, a hearing notice was automatically generated and issued to enable verification of the elector's details and ensure due opportunity for confirmation of eligibility,"" shared the ERO.The officer said any elector can notice blank fields in the EF and cross-check with the BLO, before signing the form. Unlike SIR Phase 1, no eligibility documents are to be submitted with EF in Phase 2; however, the fields regarding linkage to last SIR must mandatorily be filled to avoid a notice after the draft roll is published.","Former Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retired) on Monday reportedly submitted all the necessary documents linking him to the electoral roll from last special intensive revision.

Gen-Z protests in 3 Asian nations must be examined: Manish Tewari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gen-z-protests-in-3-asian-nations-must-be-examined-manish-tewari/articleshow/126496536.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manish Tewari said there should be a deep study of the Gen-Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in the last three years to check if they were organic movements arising out of grievances.Tewari said these movements should be examined for the critical difference between autonomous agitations over grievances, and agitations driven by narratives where grievances may have been weaponised. Though he did not point at any country which could have virtually carried out coups in Asia in the name of youth protests, his remark suggested that suspicions could not be simply brushed off. Starting with Sri Lanka, protests brought down elected govts in Nepal and Bangladesh — all in the Indian neighbourhood.The note of caution came as Tewari spoke about the turbulent contemporary world, from Venezuela to Bangladesh to Greenland to Ukrainian invasion, at the launch of his new book “A World Adrift”. The book was released by former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha at IIC, and the gathering included P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Vivek Tankha, Mukul Wasnik, and a host of foreign delegates, among others.As he spoke on raging geopolitical issues, Tewari dismissed the belief that “India has lost Bangladesh” after protests toppled the Sheikh Hasina govt that set in motion developments which have increased the friction between India and Bangladesh.He said India invested blood and treasure in creating Bangladesh under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, and “that reality is not lost on the people of Bangladesh”. He said the present transition govt in Dhaka is belligerent towards India for inexplicable reasons, but there is an “emotive connect” between the neighbours, and Bangladesh will be back in India’s eminent domain in coming time.Interestingly, Tewari sought more focus on India’s policy making with the neighbours. He reprised a question he had asked in Parliament – “India has a neighbourhood-first policy, but do any of the neighbours have India-first policy?”Exuding optimism in the wake of turbulence stoked by US President Donald Trump’s policies ranging from Venezuela to Greenland, and the threat to the world order, Tewari said nobody believed the world could survive the Covid pandemic but it did. “We will survive the coming three years,” he laughed.","Congress MP Manish Tewari said there should be a deep study of the Gen-Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in the last three years.

Retail inflation inches up to 3-month high of 1.3% in December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retail-inflation-inches-up-to-3-month-high-of-1-3-in-december/articleshow/126495039.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Retail inflation inched up to a three-month high in Dec, led by narrowing deflation in some food prices and fading favourable base effect, but remained below the Reserve Bank of India ’s (RBI) tolerance level for the fourth month in a row.Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Monday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 1.3%, higher than the 0.7% in Nov and below the 5.2% in Dec 2024.Food inflation contracted 2.7% in Dec and there is an increase of 120 basis points compared to Nov. Rural inflation was at 0.8% while urban was at 2% during Dec.Core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, soared to a 28-month high of 4.8% during the month, up from 4.4% in Nov, led by a sharp spike in gold and silver prices, which surged 69% and 97% year-onyear, respectively. Excluding these metals, core inflation moderated to 2.3% in Dec.The increase in overall inflation and food inflation during Dec was largely attributed to increase in inflation of personal care and effects, vegetables, meat and fish, egg, spices and pulses and products. Personal care and effects, which includes gold and silver, rose 28.1% in Dec.“Looking ahead, headline inflation is expected to edge higher but remain below the RBI’s 4% target for the rest of FY26.For FY26 and FY27, CPI inflation is projected to average around 2.1% and 4% respectively, based on the current CPI basket. The rollout of the new CPI series with a 2024 base year next month will be an important development to watch,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge.“From a monetary policy standpoint, the recent uptick in inflation is unlikely to trouble the RBI. While inflation projections leave room for a further 25 basis points rate cut, we expect the monetary policy committee (MPC) to pause and conserve policy space, opting to ease only if growth conditions deteriorate,” said Sinha.","Food inflation contracted 2.7% in Dec and there is an increase of 120 basis points compared to Nov.

Putin's Powerful Ally China BACKS Iran As Trump Threatens US Military Action Over Khamenei Crisis

How Will 25% Additional Tariffs Impact India?



In a fresh round of global tariffs, US President Donald Trump has announced that countries doing trade with Iran will attract a 25% tariff from the world’s largest economy. The move is seen as a pressure tactic on Iran over its response to nationwide protests that have reportedly claimed nearly 600 lives.Trump has repeatedly warned that his administration could consider military action if it determines that the Iranian government is using lethal force against demonstrators. Trump described this as a threshold Iran is ‘beginning to cross,’ prompting discussions within his national security team on what he called ‘very strong options’.The tariff decision was announced by Trump in a social media post on Monday, where he said that measures would take effect immediately. Several major economies, including China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and India maintain trade ties with Iran.“Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” Trump posted on Truth Social.India already faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US. While 25% of this figure are ‘reciprocal’ tariffs’, the remaining 25% are a penal duty for India’s crude oil imports from Russia.India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.India’s key exports to Iran span a range of products, including rice (especially basmati), tea, sugar, pharmaceutical goods, man-made staple fibres, electrical equipment, and imitation jewellery. In return, India mainly imports items such as dry fruits, inorganic and organic chemicals, and glassware from Iran.Also read: 'Seize and hold the cities'; 5 takeaways from Reza Pahlavi's declaration amid Iran protests

Iran is a crucial market for Indian basmati rice, typically purchasing more than one million tonnes each year, according to reports. Iran has traditionally been among the biggest overseas markets for Indian basmati rice. Reports suggest that Iran purchases close to 12 lakh tonnes each year, with the trade estimated at around Rs 12,000 crore.However, Iran is not among its top 5 trading partners in terms of both imports and exports. India’s top exporting destinations are currently the United States of America, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, China, United Kingdom - accounting for 41% of India’s exports according to the Ministry of Commerce dashboard.From a trade and strategy perspective, India also has a major stake in Iran’s Chabahar port. Last year, the US extended its sanctions waiver for Iran’s Chabahar port by an additional six months to April this year. The waiver had earlier been withdrawn in September 2025 when the US State Department cancelled the exemption first issued in 2018, which had allowed India to develop the port as a gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia while avoiding routes through Pakistan, as part of efforts to increase pressure on Tehran.If the exemption were to lapse, entities involved in operating the port or engaging in related activities could be exposed to US penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act.Chabahar has gained strategic relevance for India’s outreach to Afghanistan, especially as engagement with the Taliban administration in Kabul has been gradually improving.","India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years.

Accenture techie murdered in Bengaluru: Student plotted killing after she resisted his advances; flat set ablaze to mask crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/neighbour-student-held-for-murder-of-techie-in-bengaluru-flat-torched-to-destroy-evidence/articleshow/126469068.cms,"





BENGALURU: What was first believed to be a tragic death in a house fire has now been uncovered as a brutal murder.A second-year pre-university student has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east Bengaluru earlier this month. Police said the accused allegedly smothered the woman after she resisted his advances and then set fire to her flat in a calculated attempt to erase evidence.The victim, Sharmila Kushalappa, a native of Mangaluru, worked with Accenture and lived alone in a rented flat in Subramanya Layout, Ramamurthynagar. On the night of Jan 3, she was found unconscious inside her locked two-bedroom apartment after a fire broke out. She was later declared dead, with initial suspicion pointing to smoke inhalation — a theory that investigators would soon prove wrong.The accused, Karnal Kurai K, a IInd-year PU student at a private college and from Arasunagar in Virajpet town of Kodagu district, lived with his mother in the same building, next door to Sharmila's flat on the second floor. He has been arrested and remanded to three days of police custody.According to police, the case took a decisive turn after forensic and postmortem findings contradicted the initial assumption that Sharmila had died due to smoke inhalation. Ramamurthynagar police had received a complaint from Sharmila's friend, K Rohit, who suspected foul play after learning of her death.On the night of the incident, at 10.30pm, the building owner alerted the fire department after noticing smoke coming from Sharmila's flat. Fire personnel broke open the locked door and doused the flames. Sharmila was found lying motionless near the kitchen and was rushed to hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.Investigators said injuries on her hands and visible signs of a struggle at the scene raised doubts. During autopsy, doctors found that the injuries were inflicted prior to the fire and were inconsistent with accidental burns. Medical opinion indicated that Sharmila had been smothered just before she lost consciousness.Based on this, police narrowed their probe and detained Karnal for questioning. He reportedly confessed to the crime. A police officer said Karnal entered Sharmila's flat through a sliding window at 9pm. When confronted, he expressed his desire towards her, which she resisted, shouting at him to leave. Enraged by the rejection, he allegedly held her mouth and nose shut, causing her to lose consciousness.Police said bloodstains from her mouth and nose were found on her clothes. To destroy this evidence, the accused allegedly removed the clothes and set them on fire before escaping through the same window. The fire later spread to other parts of the flat.","Karnal Kurai K, a second-year pre-university student has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east Bengaluru.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

SRIHARIKOTA: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday said that the PSLV-C62 mission encountered an anomaly during end of the PS3 stage and a detailed analysis has been initiated.""Today we have attempted the PSLV C62 / EOS - N1 Mission. The PSLV vehicle is a four stage vehicle with two solid stages and two liquid stages,"" Isro chief V. Narayanan said.""The performance of the vehicle close to the end of third stage was as expected. Close to the end of third stage we are seeing more disturbance in the vehicle. Subsequently, there is a deviation in the vehicle observed in the flight path. We are analysing the data and will come shall come back at the earliest,"" he added.Isro launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission, marking the space agency’s first mission of 2026.The flight comes months after a rare setback, when PSLV-C61, launched on May 18, 2025, failed to place the EOS-09 earth observation satellite into orbit due to a third-stage anomaly.The 44.4-metre-tall Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C62) lifted off from the First Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, in a commercial mission for NewSpace India Limited (NSIL).The launch marked the 64th flight of PSLV and the fifth mission of the PSLV-DL variant.The mission carried a diverse suite of technology demonstration satellites from India and overseas, covering applications such as AI processing in orbit, store-and-forward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, and agricultural data collection.The primary payload, EOS-N1 (Anvesha), is a hyperspectral earth observation satellite designed for advanced surveillance and strategic monitoring.Among the notable secondary payloads was AayulSAT, developed by Bengaluru-based startup OrbitAID Aerospace, which serves as India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling demonstrator. The mission aims to test technologies for propellant transfer and satellite servicing in low Earth orbit, a capability seen as critical for extending satellite lifetimes and enabling sustainable space operations.Another key payload, the KID re-entry capsule, a European technology demonstrator developed with a Spanish startup, was expected to be separated from the PSLV’s fourth stage and was designed to splash down in the South Pacific Ocean, validating controlled atmospheric re-entry technologies.The flight also included a mix of CubeSats and small satellites from universities and startups, including missions from Dhruva Space (CGUSAT), and international partners, supporting research and commercial applications in communication, IoT and Earth observation.The 2026 PSLV-C62 mission follows Isro’s detailed review of the PSLV-C61 failure, one of only a handful of setbacks in PSLV’s three-decade operational history. Isro had constituted a failure analysis committee after the May 2025 mission and implemented corrective measures before returning the launcher to flight.","Isro launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission.

Why India need leader Shreyas Iyer for 2027 World Cup | Greenstone Lobo prediction

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul played a pivotal role in India’s tense run chase against New Zealand in the first ODI, but the challenge he faced went beyond the numbers on the scoreboard. Washington Sundar , who was struggling with a back issue picked up during his bowling spell, found himself unable to run effectively when it was his turn to bat. Rahul revealed the difficulty of managing the innings under these circumstances after the match.“I didn’t know Washi couldn’t run,” KL Rahul said after the match.That admission puts India’s chase into perspective. In tight ODI finishes, running between the wickets is often just as crucial as hitting boundaries. With Sundar’s mobility restricted, Rahul had to reassess how the team approached each scoring opportunity, balancing aggression with caution.“He played some excellent shots. We made sure not to let too many dot balls accumulate.”Rahul’s role expanded from just scoring runs to actively managing the tempo. He had to rotate strike, make calculated singles, and prevent the pressure from building — all while maintaining focus on the target.“We were not up against a very tall target; at this level, you’re generally expected to chase down 6 or 6.5 runs per over in 9 out of 10 instances.”Rahul also emphasised the importance of early partnerships and understanding the pitch conditions. “The pitch remained consistent for the full 100 overs; the new ball is the optimal time to bat. The partnerships developed by Rohit, Gill, and Virat found the precise tempo. It tended to become slower as the innings progressed…”Acknowledging New Zealand’s knack for prolonging matches, Rahul remained composed under pressure. “We have faced a multitude of last-over finishes against New Zealand; they are adept at finding ways to claw their way back into the match. I look forward eagerly to the upcoming games.”Through it all, Rahul’s composure and strategic management of the innings underscored his influence — proving that in such high-pressure chases, leadership at the crease can be just as important as the runs scored.","KL Rahul played a pivotal role in India’s tense run chase against New Zealand in the first ODI.

In substance, it revealed how the push for(control) was unsettling the alliance, exposing the deepest fault lines yet in the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) attempt to present a credible, unified challenge to the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) government led by chief minister MK Stalin.At the heart of the tension lies a demand that goes beyond the usual arithmetic of seat-sharing. The BJP reportedly wants a formal power-sharing assurance from the AIADMK, including at least three cabinet berths if an AIADMK-led NDA were to form the next government.For Tamil Nadu’s political culture, shaped by decades of Dravidian assertion and a strong emphasis on regional autonomy, such an explicit pre-election claim has few precedents.The reaction within the AIADMK has been wary, if not outright resistant, as the BJP’s clout in the South remains lean.The pre-poll power-sharing deal, however, is only one strand in a much larger and more byzantine political development. With just months to go before the 2026 polls, Tamil Nadu’s political field is unusually crowded and unsettled.The NDA is trying to stitch together a fragmented anti-DMK vote; the DMK is defending its record amid murmurs of alliance unease with the Congress, while actor-turned-politician Vijay has injected a new variable through his fledgling but closely watched Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK). The result is a state on the cusp of a multi-cornered contest, where perception may matter as much as numbers.For the BJP, Tamil Nadu remains the most challenging large state on the electoral map. Despite steady organisational work over the past decade and a growing vote share, the party has not yet translated presence into power.Its alliance with the AIADMK has therefore always been more than tactical and is seen in Delhi as the primary vehicle for relevance in the southern state. However, the current BJP strategy, curated mainly by Amit Shah, reflects this urgency.BJP has consistently maintained that merely contesting a limited number of seats as a junior partner no longer serves the long-term interests of the party. The proposal that the BJP and its own allies together contest around 56 of the state’s 234 assembly seats is part of this thinking.More striking, however, is the reported insistence on cabinet representation, a move intended to signal to cadres and voters alike that the BJP is not just supporting an AIADMK government but would be a stakeholder in governance.This push has coincided with a renewed effort by Shah and the central leadership to rebuild a broader NDA in the state. Former allies and breakaway factions are being courted again, including leaders who left the alliance last year. The BJP believes that consolidating these forces is essential to prevent vote-splitting that could once again hand the DMK an advantage.Yet, this centralised approach has also revived old anxieties. In Tamil Nadu, where electoral narratives are often framed around resistance to “Delhi control”, any perception that the BJP is dictating terms risks becoming a political liability rather than an asset for the AIADMK.For the AIADMK, the alliance question is as much about survival as it is about strategy. Since the death of J Jayalalithaa, oras she was popularly known, the party has struggled to regain the dominance it once enjoyed.In the 2016 elections, the AIADMK under Jayalalithaa had emerged victorious with 136 seats.The AIADMK-led alliance, in the 2021 state polls, which were fought in the absence of, won 75 seats, of which the AIADMK itself secured 66, while the DMK-led front swept to power with 159 seats. The verdict underlined both the AIADMK’s residual strength and the scale of the challenge ahead.After the 2021 assembly defeat, EPS moved decisively to consolidate control over the AIADMK, marginalising rivals and asserting himself as the party’s sole authority. This process effectively pushed out O Panneerselvam (OPS), once a key face of the party and a former chief minister. The EPS–OPS split was not just a leadership clash but a symptom of the AIADMK’s post-Jayalalithaa identity crisis.Palaniswami argued that a single centre of authority was essential for electoral recovery, while Panneerselvam continued to claim legitimacy through loyalty to Jayalalithaa’s legacy and sympathy among sections of the cadre. EPS emerged stronger within the party, but the split narrowed the AIADMK’s social and political reach at a time when it could least afford division.For the BJP, this internal fracture has been an enduring source of discomfort. The party has viewed Panneerselvam as more approachable and politically expendable, someone who could be accommodated without threatening the alliance’s structure. Palaniswami, by contrast, has been guarded and transactional, keen to keep both the BJP and expelled leaders at arm’s length to protect his authority and the party’s regional identity.This has left the BJP caught between competing compulsions: it cannot ignore EPS without risking the alliance, but it also hesitates to shut the door on OPS, whose limited yet specific influence could matter in a tight contest. The result has been an uneasy balancing act, one that reflects the BJP’s broader struggle to manage Tamil Nadu politics without appearing overbearing.Against this backdrop, Palaniswami’s reluctance to commit publicly to power-sharing with the BJP is rooted in political instinct.The AIADMK is also cautious about re-inducting expelled leaders and rival factions like the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).The AMMK did not win seats but polled enough votes in several regions to dent the AIADMK’s prospects, particularly in the southern and delta districts.This residual vote base, drawn mainly from sections of the Thevar community and AIADMK loyalists disillusioned with the current leadership, makes the AMMK less a kingmaker and more a potential spoiler. For the BJP, bringing Dhinakaran back into the NDA is about preventing further fragmentation of the anti-DMK vote rather than expecting direct seat gains.While the BJP sees figures like O Panneerselvam and TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK as assets who can consolidate specific caste and regional vote banks, Palaniswami views their return as a threat to internal cohesion and his own authority.The re-entry of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) into the NDA has given the alliance a symbolic boost, but not without complications. Anbumani Ramadoss’s decision to align with the AIADMK-BJP front was meant to strengthen the NDA’s presence in northern Tamil Nadu, where the PMK traditionally draws support from the Vanniyar community. Though this adds social breadth to the coalition at a time when consolidation is critical, the PMK is far from united.The sharp and public rift between Anbumani and his father, party founder S Ramadoss, has fractured the cadre and weakened the party’s ability to transfer votes as a bloc. Rival claims over leadership and legitimacy have created confusion at the grassroots, blunting what was once the PMK’s core electoral strength.For the NDA, the PMK’s return improves optics but not certainty. Without internal cohesion, the party risks becoming an unreliable ally rather than a decisive force against the DMK in 2026.For the DMK, the turbulence within the NDA offers both opportunity and warning. The party’s sweeping victory in 2021, when it returned to power after a decade in opposition, was built on a broad coalition that included the Congress and several regional players.Since then, the government has focused on welfare schemes, social justice narratives, Tamil identity and language. However, incumbency carries its own risks. There are murmurs of unease within the DMK-led alliance, particularly the Congress seeking greater seat shares or a more visible role post the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.While these strains are far from a rupture, they are being closely watched by rivals eager to exploit any cracks. The DMK leadership, which is slowly transitioning from MK Stalin to Udhayanidhi Stalin , is also conscious that a fragmented opposition could paradoxically complicate its task.A three- or four-cornered contest may lower the winning threshold in individual constituencies, but it also introduces unpredictability. The party’s messaging has therefore doubled down on stability, contrasting its governance record with what it portrays as an unstable and opportunistic opposition camp.Perhaps the most intriguing element in the current churn is the emergence of Vijay as a political actor. His TVK has yet to contest a major election, but its entry has already altered calculations across the spectrum.Vijay’s appeal cuts across age groups, with particular resonance among younger voters and sections disillusioned with established parties.His carefully calibrated stance, critical of both the BJP and the DMK, positions the TVK as an alternative rather than an adjunct. This has attracted exploratory overtures from leaders sidelined within traditional formations, adding to the sense of flux.At the same time, the TVK’s strengths remain largely potential rather than proven.Organisational depth, booth-level machinery, and the ability to translate popular enthusiasm into votes are tests that only an election can provide. For now, Vijay’s presence serves as a wildcard, expectedly capable of influencing outcomes even if it falls short of forming a government.Tamil Nadu’s recent electoral history offers important context. In 2016, the AIADMK won 136 seats with around 41 per cent of the vote, while the DMK secured 98 seats with just under 40 per cent. The narrow margin reflected how small shifts in alliances and turnout can have outsized effects.Five years later, in 2021, the pendulum swung decisively. The DMK-led alliance polled close to 46 per cent and won 159 seats, while the AIADMK alliance’s vote share dipped to around 39 per cent, translating into 75 seats. The BJP, contesting as an ally, won four seats and improved its vote share, but remained dependent on the larger Dravidian partner.These figures highlight two enduring truths. First, alliances matter enormously in Tamil Nadu’s first-past-the-post system. Second, no single party, outside of peak DMK or AIADMK waves, can easily dominate without a broad coalition.As the state heads towards the 2026 elections, the political picture remains fluid. The BJP is betting that a reconstituted NDA, bolstered by returning allies and clearer power-sharing signals, can present itself as a viable alternative.The AIADMK is trying to balance that partnership with its need to project independence and reassure its core electorate. The DMK is defending its turf while watching for signs of opposition consolidation. And Vijay’s TVK is carving out space in a crowded field, its final impact yet to be measured.What is clear is that Tamil Nadu’s politics is entering a phase where old certainties no longer apply automatically. The familiar binary of DMK versus AIADMK is giving way to a more layered contest, shaped by national ambitions, regional identities, and the aspirations of a new generation of voters.Whether the NDA’s current troubles are a prelude to a stronger, more coherent front, or a symptom of deeper contradictions, will become evident only as alliances crystallise and campaigns take shape. For now, the state watches as negotiations continue behind closed doors, aware that in Tamil Nadu, the path to power is rarely straightforward and often decided as much by perception as by pact.","AIADMK and BJP announced alliance for Tamil Nadu's 2026 polls. This is the first time since 1987 that an incumbent government has been re-elected in Tamil Nadu after the enormous success of AIADMK founder, MG Ramachandran. At the heart of the tension lies a demand that goes beyond the usual arithmetic of seat-sharing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126485567,imgsize-110350,width-400,resizemode-4/tamil-nadu.jpg"
PMO likely to move to Sewa Teerth complex in next one week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pmo-likely-to-move-to-sewa-teerth-complex-in-next-one-week/articleshow/126491874.cms,".

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to move to his new office at the newly built Sewa Teerth complex near Vayu Bhawan in the next one week. This will be the first time since independence when the PMO moves out of the seat of power at South Block built by British architect Herbert Baker.Officials said the office housing the PMO is fully ready. They added that the new PMO will be operational any time between Jan 14 (Makar Sankranti) and Jan 23 (Subhas Chandra Bose Jayanti). “Kharmas, considered inauspicious in Vedic astrology to avoid new ventures, is ending with Makar Sankranti on Wednesday. So, the shifting of PMO to the new building can happen anytime from Wednesday onwards. All preparations have been completed in the past two weeks,” said an official.South Block and North Block situated in the Raisina Hills were built in 1931. The history of PMO traces from a small PM’s Secretariat (PMS) in 1947 to provide basic administrative help to the PM. The first major structural change happened in 1964 after Lal Bahadur Shastri became PM when PMS got statutory status via Allocation of Business Rules. The authority of the office increased significantly during Indira Gandhi’s tenure and in 1977 this was officially renamed the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) during the Morarji Desai administration.The Cabinet Secretariat has shifted from Rashtrapati Bhawan to ‘Seva Teerth-2’ in September and ‘Seva Teerth-3’ is designated for the National Security Adviser’s (NSA) office. The NSA is likely to shift to the new complex in the next one week as well.The PMO and subsequently defence ministry moving out of South Block in the next few weeks will mean the country's power centre completely shifting out of Raisina Hills, which officials said is another example of govt’s thrust on getting rid of the colonial past and “mentality of slavery”. The North Block has been vacated completely with ministries moving out of the iconic building to new Bhawans that have come up along Kartavya Path.",PM Narendra Modi is likely to move to his new office at the newly built Sewa Teerth complex near Vayu Bhawan.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

MUMBAI: In a setback to the Mahayuti government, which was planning to transfer a double instalment of Rs 3,000 under its Ladki Bahin scheme to underprivileged women by Jan 14 - shortly before the Jan 15 elections to 29 municipal corporations, including BMC - state election commissioner Dinesh Waghmare has barred the advance payment for the month of Jan while allowing the pending payment for Dec 2025.Hence, the state will only be allowed to dispense the sum of Rs 1,500 for Dec to around 2.5 crore eligible women in the state by Jan 14.""The regular benefits of the scheme can be given while the model code of conduct is in force. But benefits cannot be given in advance. And new beneficiaries are also not allowed to be selected,"" Waghmare said in his order.In doing so, Waghmare went beyond the report of state chief secretary Rajesh Aggarwal which had only said that ""development work and schemes that were actually started before the announcement of the elections are allowed to continue during the code of conduct period.""In a post on X on Jan 7, rural development minister Girish Mahajan of BJP said that eligible beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme will receive a combined transfer of Rs 3,000 for Dec and Jan in their bank accounts before Makar Sankranti, which falls on Jan 14, terming it a ""special gift"" from chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The flagship scheme of govt was credited with powering a landslide victory for the Mahayuti in the assembly polls last year.Congress filed a complaint to SEC and questioned the timing of the announcement, alleging it was a violation of the model code of conduct and aimed at influencing voters ahead of the corporation elections. SEC in turn had asked the chief secretary to send a report on the issue. Waghmare's order came after the report was sent.Meanwhile, on the issue of around 70 of 2,869 posts in the state's municipal corporations set for unopposed elections in favour of Mahayuti candidates, Waghmaresaid that the count was just 2.4% of the total seats.""This cannot be considered a threat to democracy. In fact, in the Lok Sabha elections last year, around 50 MPs were elected unopposed,"" said a senior official.Asked if Fadnavis' statement that Mumbai would have a Marathi and Hindu mayor was a violation of the model code of conduct, Waghmare said, ""If someone sends a complaint to SEC, we will issue notice on the statement.""","Mahayuti government was planning to transfer a double instalment of Rs 3,000 under its Ladki Bahin scheme to underprivileged women by Jan 14.

DHAKA: Renowned Hindu musician and senior Awami League functionary Proloy Chaki has died in police custody in Bangladesh, with his family members accusing the prison administration of denying necessary medical care to the 60-year-old and rubbishing police's claim that it was a ""natural death"", reports Ahsan Tasnim.Proloy - held in a blast case linked to the 2024 anti-discrimination student movement that grew into the 'July Uprising' and led to Sheikh Hasina's ouster as PM - died on Sunday night. The cultural affairs secretary of the party's Pabna unit, Proloy was picked up by police from his house in Pabna's Dilalpur on Dec 16 and later shown as arrested.Proloy Chaki’s death comes at a time when Bangladesh is in the grip of relentless violence against minorities, particularly Hindus, and groups, parties and institutions aligned with Awami League. Seven Hindus have died and properties of minorities targeted by arsonists since the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh on Dec 18. Pabna jail superintendent Md Omar Faruk said Proloy had been suffering from multiple health complications, including diabetes and heart disease.“He suffered a cardiac arrest and was first taken to Pabna General Hospital on Friday. Later, as his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, where he died around 9 pm on Sunday,” Omar said, adding that “it is a natural death”.Proloy’s son Sony Chaki said, “My father was arrested despite not being named in any case at the time.

PSLV fails for 2nd time in 9 months; 3rd-stage glitch costs 16 satellites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pslv-fails-for-2nd-time-in-9-months-3rd-stage-glitch-costs-16-satellites/articleshow/126492197.cms,".

Things started going wrong 8 min after launch, says Isro chairman

SRIHARIKOTA/BENGALURU: India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage (PS3), costing 16 satellites and an ambitious project of strategic, diplomatic and commercial importance.The PSLV-C62 failure comes nine months after a glitch in the same third stage of PSLV-C61 prevented EOS-09, another strategic satellite, from reaching orbit on May 18, 2025. This is also the first time PSLV has failed consecutively. The main satellite was EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a DRDO satellite designed to give India's military sharper eyes in space through a hyperspectral imaging payload.Towards the end of the third stage we saw a little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said. Isro is yet to make public the failure analysis report of the PSLV-C61 mission. All appeared good on Monday when the 44.4-m PSLV, flying its fifth mission in dual strapon configuration, lifted off from SDSC’s first launch pad at 10.18 am, about 1.30 minutes after the scheduled time.About 8 minutes and 40 seconds later, between the thirdstage shut-off and fourthstage (PS4) ignition, something went wrong.Soon, Narayanan announced the mission had failed. It also carried a satellite (Munal) for Nepal and a technology demonstrator (AyulSat) from start-up OrbitAID aimed at cracking on-orbit refuelling, along with 13 other payloads.AyulSAT, which was to demonstrate fuel transfer internally and later act as a target satellite for OrbitAID’s chaser satellite planned about six months later, would have put India a step closer to testing on-orbit refuelling. China is the only country which now has on-orbit refuelling technology. OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI on Monday: “We are now forced to launch both the target and chaser satellites together. We hope to do that later this year.”The rocket also carried satellites from the UK, Brazil, Thailand and Spain, apart from payloads developed by Indian startups demonstrating several technologies, including AI processing in orbit, store-andforward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, agricultural data collection, and a re-entry capsule to be deployed after re-start and deorbit of the PS4 stage. This failure is the third launch setback for Isro since Jan 2025 — GSLV-F15, which carried the NVS-02 navigation satellite, failed to place the satellite in geostationary orbit due to a propulsion system malfunction.","India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage.

Hinduism vs Hindutva: TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s 'Love Jihad' Remark Ignites Fierce Political Debate

RAIPUR: The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal after a Class 4 English exam paper listed 'Ram' as a possible answer to a multiple-choice question about the name of a protagonist's dog, reports Partha Behera. The paper-setter said the error occurred as a result of inadvertently dropping the last letter of 'Ramu'.The school education department announced the decision on Saturday, four days after the question paper sparked protests across state by VHP, Bajrang Dal and other organisations. Shikha Soni, headmistress of a govt primary school in Nakti village of Tilda block, had set the paper for half-yearly examinations across govt schools in Raipur division. Namrata Verma, an assistant teacher on contract, moderated it.To the question 'What is the name of Mona's dog?', students had four options to choose from: 'Bala', 'Sheru', 'Ram' and 'No one'. Soni said the 'typo' went unnoticed while Verma said she failed to spot the incorrect option.Both maintained they had no intention of hurting religious sentiments or any community.","The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal.

Long-term impact on India’s naval posture



NEW DELHI: More than five decades after Indian naval strikes crippled Karachi during the 1971 war, undersea power is once again at the heart of New Delhi’s strategic thinking. As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his visit to India on Monday amid a more volatile regional and global security environment, discussions around Project-75I have acquired fresh urgency.The Indian Navy’s plan to induct six next-generation conventional submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion reflects a convergence of hard lessons from history, renewed friction with Pakistan following recent crises, and China’s expanding undersea presence in the Indian Ocean. Together, these factors are pushing India towards one of its most consequential naval procurement decisions in years, one that blends deterrence, indigenisation and long-term strategic signalling.Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems. The Ministry of Defence issued the Request for Proposal for the project in July 2021 under the Strategic Partnership Model, describing it as a key pillar of the government’s Make in India push, according to a PIB statement.The project envisages indigenous construction, long-term technology transfer and the creation of a domestic submarine-building ecosystem. The estimated cost was over Rs 40,000 crore at the RFP stage, with current assessments placing the final contract value closer to $8 billion, or about Rs 72,000 crore, based on configuration and lifecycle support.For the Indian Navy, the programme addresses a critical gap. Its conventional submarine fleet is ageing even as undersea activity by China and Pakistan increases in the Indian Ocean and along India’s maritime approaches.The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine, edging out Spain’s S-80 Plus offered by Navantia, defence sources said. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system, acoustic stealth and lower lifecycle risk.AIP allows submarines to remain submerged for weeks without surfacing or snorkeling, reducing detection risk. In contested waters, endurance and silence are decisive. The Type-214’s AIP technology is widely regarded as operationally proven, while competing systems are still undergoing validation.In undersea warfare, reliability and survivability often outweigh novelty. That calculus appears to have guided the Navy’s choice.Under the proposed framework, all six submarines will be built in India at MDL, with TKMS providing design authority, engineering expertise and technical consultancy. Indigenous content is expected to start at around 45 percent and rise to nearly 60 percent by the final boat, aligning with Atmanirbhar Bharat goals.TKMS and MDL signed a memorandum of understanding in June last year to jointly pursue the project, laying the groundwork for the partnership. MDL’s prior experience building Scorpène-class submarines under the earlier Project-75 strengthened its case as the Indian strategic partner.The ministry of defence has repeatedly stressed that Project-75I is not only about acquiring platforms but about absorbing complex submarine design and construction technologies, as outlined in the 2021 PIB release.India’s emphasis on undersea capability is rooted in history. During the 1971 war, the Indian Navy’s attacks on Karachi port crippled Pakistan’s maritime logistics and fuel supply, accelerating Islamabad’s defeat. That episode stressed how control of the seas can shape outcomes on land.The relevance of that lesson resurfaced during Operation Sindoor in May 2025, when tensions with Pakistan escalated following a major terror provocation. Between May 8 and May 11, India placed its naval forces on heightened readiness, with Karachi again emerging as Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability.Karachi handles the bulk of Pakistan’s maritime trade and energy imports. India’s ability to credibly threaten that hub, even without firing a shot, highlighted the deterrent value of naval and undersea power. New submarines with extended underwater endurance would sharpen that leverage.Beyond Pakistan, China looms large in India’s maritime threat assessment. The People’s Liberation Army Navy operates a rapidly expanding submarine fleet, including nuclear-powered platforms that have increasingly deployed into the Indian Ocean.Chinese submarines have docked at regional ports and conducted patrols close to Indian waters, while Pakistan, with Chinese assistance, is also upgrading its submarine arm. For Indian planners, this twin challenge has made restoring conventional submarine strength an urgent priority.Project-75I is designed to plug that gap by giving India a survivable, persistent undersea capability suited to monitoring choke points, tracking adversary submarines and conducting sea-denial operations.Chancellor Merz’s visit from January 12–13 comes amid a broader effort by Germany to expand its strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific. Berlin and New Delhi are also working toward an EU-India free trade agreement, as noted by AFP.For India, the potential submarine deal fits into a wider diversification of defence partnerships beyond legacy suppliers such as Russia. For Germany, it represents an opportunity to anchor a long-term industrial and security relationship with the world’s largest democracy.According to informed defence sources cited by idrw.org, the final contract is not expected to be signed during Merz’s visit but could be concluded within the next three months, with the high-level engagement expected to provide political momentum.In October 2025, India put on hold plans to build three additional French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, even as it moved decisively to push ahead with Project-75I, which envisages the construction of six new-generation German-origin diesel-electric submarines at the same shipyard, The Times of India reported.Top government sources told TOI that the proposal for the three additional Scorpenes, estimated to cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “was not being pursued” at the time, although a formal decision to scrap it had not been recorded. While cost negotiations for the Scorpene follow-on order had concluded in the previous fiscal, final clearance from the Prime Minister-led Cabinet Committee on Security remained on hold.Officials told TOI that the German submarines under Project-75I were considered “a generation ahead” in terms of technology and capability. Concerns also existed about MDL’s ability to simultaneously execute two complex submarine construction programmes. The six original Kalvari-class submarines had already been built at MDL under the earlier Project-75 contract signed in October 2005, with the first boat INS Kalvari commissioned in December 2017 and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, inducted in January 2025.All six Kalvari-class submarines were slated to be retrofitted with the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion system to improve underwater endurance. AIP allows a diesel-electric submarine to remain submerged for nearly two weeks, compared to boats without the system that must surface or snorkel every few days to recharge batteries.In contrast, the submarines planned under Project-75I, to be built in partnership with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, were designed to incorporate AIP from the outset, along with land-attack cruise missiles and other next-generation technologies, TOI reported.Sources told TOI that the decision to proceed with final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines, with an option for three more at a later stage, followed extensive deliberations involving the defence ministry, the Navy and the National Security Council Secretariat. Formal contract negotiations began in September 2025.“These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” a source told TOI.Despite the pause on the Scorpene extension, officials indicated that France’s broader strategic partnership with India remained strong. Negotiations progressed on additional Rafale fighters for the Indian Air Force’s proposed 114 multi-role fighter aircraft programme, as well as a collaboration to co-develop a powerful jet engine with French major Safran for India’s fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft was nearly finalised.At the time, the Navy’s conventional submarine strength stood at six Scorpenes, six ageing Russian Kilo-class boats and four German HDW submarines, alongside two nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. China, by comparison, operated more than 50 diesel-electric and around 10 nuclear submarines and was in the process of supplying eight Yuan-class AIP-equipped submarines to Pakistan, a development seen as a major capability boost for Islamabad, TOI reported.Once inducted, the six Type-214NG submarines will significantly enhance the Indian Navy’s capacity for covert surveillance, sea denial and precision strike missions. Their sensors, weapons and endurance will form a key layer of India’s maritime deterrence architecture.Equally important is the industrial legacy. By absorbing advanced submarine technologies, India positions itself for future indigenous designs and follow-on projects. MDL’s role would be strengthened, and a specialised domestic supply chain would be deepened.Project-75I marks one of the most consequential naval procurement decisions India has taken in years. It addresses hard lessons from 1971, recent operational realities with Pakistan, and the growing challenge posed by China’s undersea expansion.As Germany’s chancellor arrives in India, the submarine negotiations underscore how defence industrial cooperation has become central to New Delhi’s foreign policy. From Karachi’s burning docks in 1971 to the silent depths of the Indian Ocean today, India’s maritime strategy is being reshaped through capability, indigenisation and strategic foresight.",Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel- electric submarines. The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system.

NEW DELHI: Lauding India's Gen Z, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said it is full of creativity as he emphasised that his govt's reforms have opened countless opportunities for them in contrast with the stifling rules of the previous UPA govt that caught them in a web of compliances and curbed their entrepreneur spirit.Speaking at Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue to commemorate Swami Vivekananda 's birth anniversary, he said no country can develop without self-confidence and told the largely young audience that it is their responsibility to end the ""slave mindset"" that afflicted a generation of Indians due to the education policy of Thomas Macaulay.His laudatory words for Gen Z, which has ruled global headlines for a while largely due to a string of anti-govt protests it has spearheaded in different countries, including in neighbouring Bangladesh, have come against the backdrop of a few opposition leaders referring to their agitations outside and seeking to coopt them in their agitation against the PM Modi govt. The Rahul Gandhi-led Congress campaign against alleged ""vote chori"" reached out to the young generation in its bid to ""save"" democracy.PM Modi said that India's youth with its innovative ideas, energy and purpose is at the forefront of nation-building.

""Our Hanuman ji can dominate gaming in the world,"" he said, adding that it will export Indian culture in a modern way.He contrasted the opening of a string of sectors ranging from space to nuclear power and defence and easing of regulations and taxes ushered by his govt with the UPA era, which, he said, was accused of policy paralysis and its inability to implement things on ground.So many rules and restrictions existed at the time that youth had few choices, and even applying for a job or a loan from banks demanded a web of compliances, he added.He said, ""As a CM and now as PM, I have put a lot of trust in the young generation, your capability and talent."" Sectors restricted to the govt have been opened to private players, PM Modi added.He praised their presentation on different themes and said, ""It shows the mood of Gen Z in India. India's Gen Z is full of creativity.""Noting the participation of a huge number of youngsters in the dialogue, he said the popular term of ""think tank"" can't capture their immense size and deep research.","PM Narendra Modi said that India's youth with its innovative ideas, energy and purpose is at the forefront of nation-building.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday, the mission's success will bring India a step closer to becoming the second country in the world to demonstrate on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China, reports Chethan Kumar.Last year, China carried out a similar demonstration, but details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. However, US firm Astroscale is developing a refuelling technology but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won't demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid's first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions. OrbitAid founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI the first refuelling is expected to take place within four hours of launch.",OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday.

Nabin ascension is seen as a move towards overhaul of BJP

NEW DELHI: BJP working president Nitin Nabin is set to take over as full-fledged national president of the party on Jan 20, in the presence of PM Modi and other senior leaders, including chief ministers, national office-bearers, state party presidents and national executive council members, reports Akhilesh Singh. He will replace JP Nadda , one of the longest-serving party presidents.Since his appointment as working president, Nabin has enjoyed the support of the party brass. His ascension, following elections on Jan 20, therefore, is being seen as a formality.With full-throttle endorsement from the saffron fountainhead, RSS, Nitin Nabin (46) will be the youngest party president, and his ascension is seen as a move towards a complete overhaul of the party, with a possible mix of youth and experience. Party sources have indicated that nominations for the president’s election will take place on Jan 19, followed by election the next day.Party sources said that after completing the nomination process, Nabin will be elected national president the next day. He had been appointed BJP working president on Dec 15, but his formal takeover was on hold due to “kharmas”, an inauspicious phase when Hindus avoid taking up new work or marking a beginning.Since his appointment, Nabin has been meeting party workers at the BJP headquarters.Widely regarded as an organisational chief, Nabin currently represents Bankipur assembly constituency in Patna district. Nabin is the son of the late BJP politician and former BJP MLA Nabin Kishore Prasad Sinha. With nearly two decades of organisational experience, Nabin has held several key roles within the party, including as Bihar president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and BJP’s election in-charge for Chhattisgarh.","Nitin Nabin set to take over as full-fledged national president of the party on Jan 20.

People say they were not ‘witnesses’, cops say probe will reveal all

BHOPAL: From late-night raids to routine seizures spread across villages miles apart, they were present everywhere - many a time simultaneously at different locations. Allegations of 'omnipresent' police witnesses in Madhya Pradesh's Mauganj district have snowballed into a major controversy after scrutiny of digital crime tracking records confirmed that the same six individuals were repeatedly cited as govt witnesses in hundreds of cases registered at Laur and Naigadhi police stations in the district.The pattern of a few selected names recurring case after case emerged from FIRs accessed through Crime & Criminal Tracking Network & Systems, a home ministry project.At the centre of the allegations is Jagdish Singh Thakur, former in-charge of Naigadhi and Laur police stations, against whom complaints were lodged by an RTI activist, accusing him of misusing his position to register over 150 questionable FIRs. The complaint alleged that under his charge at the two police stations, the same favoured individuals were repeatedly cited witnesses to facilitate routine police action, justify the cases on paper and enable corruption.One of the six individuals, Amit Kushwaha, who was cited as a witness in hundreds of cases, allegedly moved with Thakur during his transfers. The activist, Kunj Bihari Tiwari, first lodged a police complaint in 2022. He filed another detailed complaint in Dec 2025, sharing 'proof'.Acting on the complaint, Mauganj SP Dilip Soni removed Thakur as Naigadhi police station incharge Sunday. “We are getting the complaint probed in detail.The complainant shared details regarding 145 FIRs with common witnesses,” Soni told TOI. He however, added that “this was not the only reason, but one of the reasons for which the action was taken”. Some of the ‘witnesses’ have now distanced themselves from the police’s move.Dinesh Kushwaha, a vegetable vendor, told TOI: “I signed as a witness in only one or two cases where I was present. I wasn’t a witness in so many other cases. Police wrote my name as a witness without my knowledge.” Another witness, Rahul Vishwakarma, said: “I was not present during the action. Iused to sign after the accused were arrested and brought to the police station. But I did not sign as a witness in so many cases. I am a driver. ” Tiwari claimed the rot runs much deeper.“I examined FIRs of more than a year and found around 200 cases with common names. When I scanned the records from the year 2000, I found similar names in about 1,000 FIRs. I am also a victim, as I was framed in a case by the same police officer,” the complainant alleged. TOIaccessed and examined copies of over 40 such FIRs and found the same names repeatedly listed as witnesses across unrelated cases. Police officers said the probe will determine whether legal procedures and norms were violated and whether disciplinary or criminal action was required.",Allegations of 'omnipresent' police witnesses in Madhya Pradesh's Mauganj district have snowballed into a major controversy. scrutiny of digital crime tracking records confirmed that the same six individuals were repeatedly cited as govt witnesses in hundreds of cases registered at Laur and Naigadhi police stations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126492210,imgsize-571525,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-20.jpg"
Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, sources told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant’s biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades.When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Sources said Cognizant’s EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. “CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability.These deals now typically span seven to ten years and combine transformation, run, cloud, data and AI under a single commercial construct, making the headline value appear larger even though annual spend is often comparable to legacy budgets,” he said. Fersht added that AI-led modernisation has become non-deferrable, as enterprises cannot pause core system renewal, cloud migration, cybersecurity or data platform investments, pushing deal sizes higher as “change plus continuity” are brought together.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of US-based Everest Group, said Cognizant has been the most aggressive among Indian-based providers in combining a strong vision for AI transformation with very competitive pricing. “This has positioned them to take share in a hyper-competitive market. The vendor consolidation trend, of which the Novartis transaction is a leading example, is ripe for this approach. We are aware of other large transactions where Cognizant is in the lead,” he said.Healthcare contributes around 30% to Cognizant’s revenue. Early in its growth journey, the company rapidly expanded its healthcare footprint, counting nine of the top 10 payers—including United, Anthem, Cigna and Aetna—as customers, along with nearly 30 major pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly.Novartis operates three state-of-the-art centres in India across two cities—Hyderabad, where it has facilities at the Novartis Corporate Center (NOCC) and Genome Valley, and Mumbai. The company employs around 8,500 people in the country.India serves as a key hub in Novartis’s global operations, supporting the development of breakthrough medicines across therapy areas including cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology and global health. The India centres support a wide range of global functions such as global clinical operations, technical R&D, patient safety and pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs and advanced quantitative sciences, among others.","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis.

, NGO tells SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has agreed to test the constitutional validity of a law giving lifelong immunity to the Chief Election Commissioner and election commissioners from civil and criminal prosecution after a PIL alleged it would make the Election Commission a law unto itself, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.After hearing arguments from S N Shukla for NGO 'Lok Prahari', a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi issued notices to the Union govt and EC, and sought their responses. ""We will examine whether it is constitutionally permissible to give CEC and ECs (election commissioners) such immunity from prosecution,"" the bench said Monday.NGO ‘Lok Prahari’ challenged Section 16 of CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023, which provided that “...no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceedings against any person who is or was a chief election commissioner or an election commissioner for any act, thing or word, committed, done or spoken by him when, or in the course of acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty or function”.The NGO’s S N Shukla said Supreme Court in the M S Gill case, while giving Election Commission independence and autonomy to conduct elections, had ruled that it should not make EC a law unto itself.The present provision would enable the CEC and election commissioners to act in an unaccountable manner and could jeopardise free and fair elections, which is the basic requirement of a democracy. The NGO alleged that Section 16 was not part of the original bill tabled in Parliament in Aug, 2023 and was surreptitiously introduced “as an afterthought in the last-minute amendment to the bill at the time of debate on the bill in Dec, 2023 without giving any valid reason and adequate justification in support of it”.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, had recently targeted the CEC and election commissioners by saying if Congress and its allies came to office at Centre, it would disband this immunity and change the law retrospectively to hold them accountable for any past wrongdoings in the conduct of elections.The NGO said Section 16 is against the settled law that no one is above the law, and pointed out govt gave no reason for hurried inclusion of immunity clause for CEC and election commissioners. The petitioner claimed that such immunity is not available to the President, governors or judges. The NGO alleged the offending clause was not discussed during the debate on the bill and that “the amendment was put to vote in a rushed hush hush manner”. The petitioner said, “Evidently, the approval of the House on the said amendment was obtained and given without application of mind.” It said, “The blanket permanent immunity from all civil or criminal proceedings against any present or former CEC or election commissioners is not only against the constitutional scheme and the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”","NGO 'Lok Prahari' challenged Section 16 of CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP )leader K Annamalai on Monday launched a broadside against Raj Thackeray and dared the MNS chief to stop him from entering Mumbai.The reaction came a day after Thackeray mockingly referred to the BJP leader as “rasmalai” and questioned his standing to speak on issues related to Mumbai.At a press conference in Chennai, the BJP leader alleged that he has received multiple threats, with some people even threatening to cut off his legs.“Who are Aaditya Thackeray and Raj Thackeray to threaten me? I am proud to be a farmer’s son. They have organised meetings just to abuse me. I don’t know whether I have become that important,” Annamalai said.“Some have written that they will cut my legs if I come to Mumbai. I will come to Mumbai—try cutting my legs. If I were afraid of such threats, I would have stayed in my village. If I say Kamaraj is one of India’s greatest leaders, does it mean he is no longer a Tamil? If I say Mumbai is a world-class city, does it mean Maharashtrians didn’t build it? These people are just ignorant,” former Tamil Nadu BJP chief added.Earlier on Sunday, Thackeray attacked Annamalai for suggesting that Mumbai is an “international city”.Thackeray also referred to his uncle Bal Thackeray's slogan from the 1960s and 1970s — “Hatao lungi, bajao pungi.”“One rasmalai came from Tamil Nadu… what is your connection to here? Hatao lungi, bajao pungi,” Thackeray said at a joint UBT–MNS rally in Mumbai.Additionally, Thackeray also said that he would “kick” people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they “try to impose Hindi”.“People from UP and Bihar should understand that Hindi is not your language. I don’t hate the language… but if you try to impose it, I’ll kick you. They’re coming from all sides to Maharashtra and snatching away your share. If land and language are gone, you will be finished,” Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj Thackeray also mounted a joint attack on the rival BJP over what they described as “fake Hindutva”, saying their political reunion was prompted by an imminent “danger” to Mumbai.Uddhav said he and Raj Thackeray had set aside their differences in the interest of the Marathi manoos, Hindus, and Maharashtra. Appealing to the core Marathi vote bank, Raj said the two leaders had come together as Mumbai was facing danger.Calling the BMC polls the “last election for the Marathi man”, Thackeray said: “If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra.”The State Election Commission in Maharashtra has announced elections to 29 municipal corporations across the state, including the Pune Municipal Corporation, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Polling will be held on January 15, with counting scheduled for January 16.","K Annamalai says he has received multiple threats, with some people even threatening to cut off his legs.

CHENNAI: A war of words broke out between former chief of BJP's Tamil Nadu unit K Annamalai and functionaries of Sena UBT and MNS over his remarks that Mumbai is an international city and does not belong to Maharashtra alone. Annamalai made the comment while campaigning for BMC polls in Mumbai last week.At a joint rally of Sena UBT and MNS in Mumbai on Monday, MNS chief Raj Thackeray mocked Annamalai, calling him ""rasmalai"" and invoked the slogan ""hatao lungi, bajao pungi"", a phrase derogatorily used to target south Indians in Mumbai.Annamalai hit back: ""Some wrote that they would cut my legs if I visit Mumbai. I will come. Try cutting my legs."" He added his remarks were misrepresented. ""If I say Kamaraj is one of India's greatest politicians, does that mean he is no longer Tamil? If I say Mumbai is a world-class city, does that mean Maharashtrians didn't build it,"" he asked.","K Annamalai says Mumbai is an international city and does not belong to Maharashtra alone.

Vaping case: Birla hints at action if charge established,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaping-case-birla-hints-at-action-if-charge-established/articleshow/126494641.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Action is mandated if an MP violates Parliament's dignity, Speaker Om Birla asserted on Monday, hinting at proceedings against a Trinamool member accused of vaping inside Lok Sabha, in case the charge is established.Birla recalled that parliamentarians have been even stripped of their membership for misconduct, though insisting that it is for LS, and not him, to make the decision after a parliamentary committee recommends action. The probe into BJP MP Anurag Thakur's complaint against the opposition MP, who was not named, for e-smoking during proceedings in the last session is nearing completion, he added.Birla confirmed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her ninth Budget on Feb 1. Though govt had indicated that it will stick to the convention of presenting the Budget on Feb 1, Birla's is the first official voice to declare the same. Parliamentarians are meant to work all the time and should not be seen as employees, the Speaker added.On Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth (CSPOC), which India will host after 16 years, he said Pakistan will not be a part of it, nor will Bangladesh, as the latter has had no Speaker since dissolution of its parliament by the interim govt, which has announced a fresh election.India will be hosting the biggest edition of CSPOC, with 42 of 56 member nations, including UK, Australia and Canada, having confirmed their participation.Asked if Lok Sabha has followed the rules in constituting an inquiry committee to probe the charge of corruption against Justice Yashwant Varma, Birla said it has put forth its views in Supreme Court, which has reserved its decision on the Allahabad HC judge's legal challenge.Varma has argued that since a notice for his removal was submitted in RS on the same day as in LS, both Houses should have been part of the consultation process and the speaker should not have announced the committee unilaterally. RS has told SC that it had never admitted the opposition-sponsored notice as it was ""defective"" on many counts.","Birla confirms finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her ninth Budget on Feb 1.

Visa-free transit announced for Indians travelling to and from UK via Germany,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/visa-free-transit-announced-for-indians-travelling-to-and-from-uk-via-germany/articleshow/126494637.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indians will soon be able to travel to & from the UK via Germany, in a significant development for Lufthansa, Air India and desi globetrotters. Germany has announced visa-free transit for Indians during Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s official visit to India. Travel agents and airlines are now awaiting the date from this will be implemented.Once effective, desi travellers will be able to travel between India and the UK via Germany on Lufthansa. Also, Air India will be able to code share with Lufthansa to & from the UK and increase passenger numbers on its German flights.“ Announcement of visa free transit for Indian passport holders for transiting through Germany,” govt said in a statement on the 27 outcomes of the Chancellor’s India visit. Once implemented, this move will partially undo the impact on Indian (and many other foreign) travellers caused by Brexit six years ago.At the time of Brexit to “hurt” each others’ airlines, the UK and EU mandated a transit visa will be required for travelling to one via the other. Which means, an Indian going from Delhi to London via Frankfurt will require a transit Schengen visa to get on the connecting flight. Similarly, an Indian travelling from Mumbai to Munich via London will require a transit UK visa to take the connecting flight.The UK is a huge market for Lufthansa and Air India. Once implemented, this development will again enable Lufthansa to fly travellers (both flying it and code share ones on Air India) from India via its hubs in Germany to the UK. There are also some other visa-free destinations also which Indians can now travel to & from by transiting from Germany, like those in the Caribbean.Transit visa requirements must be kept in mind while booking tickets. There have been numerous cases when people booked via some unscrupulous agents or online travel agencies (OTAs) by just seeing the lowest price. For instance, travelling from India to Canada on an American carrier (for just transiting via the US) means the passengers must have a US visa.Similarly, going from India to the US via Canada means a transit visa for the latter is required. Ditto for those travelling from India to the UK via Schengen states and the Schengen States via the UK. Soon Germany will be an exception for the UK.","Germany has announced visa-free transit for Indians during Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s official visit to India.

Gen Z protests in 3 South Asian nations must be studied: Tewari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gen-z-protests-in-3-south-asian-nations-must-be-studied-tewari/articleshow/126494593.cms,",

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manish Tewari said that there should be a deep study of Gen Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in last three years to check if they were organic movements arising out of grievances.Tewari said these movements should be examined for critical difference between autonomous agitations over grievances, and agitations driven by narratives where grievances may have been weaponised. Though he did not point at any country which could have virtually carried out coups in Asia in the name of youth protests, his remark suggested that suspicions could not be simply brushed off. Starting with Sri Lanka, protests brought down elected govts in Nepal and Bangladesh - all in the Indian neighbourhood.The note of caution came as Tewari spoke about the turbulent contemporary world, from Venezuela to Bangladesh to Greenland to Ukrainian invasion, at the launch of his new book, 'A World Adrift'. The book was released by former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha at IIC, and the gathering included P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Vivek Tankha, Mukul Wasnik, and a host of foreign delegates, among others.Tewari dismissed the belief that ""India has lost Bangladesh"" after protests toppled the Sheikh Hasina govt that set in motion developments which have increased the friction between India and Bangladesh. He said India invested blood and treasure in creating Bangladesh under Indira Gandhi, and ""that reality is not lost on people of Bangladesh"". He said the present transition govt in Dhaka is belligerent towards India for inexplicable reasons, but there is an ""emotive connect"" between the neighbours, and Bangladesh will be back in India's eminent domain in coming time.","Congress MP Manish Tewari said there should be a deep study of Gen Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in last three years.

DRDO flight-tests man-portable anti-tank guided missile against a moving target,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drdo-flight-tests-man-portable-anti-tank-guided-missile-against-a-moving-target/articleshow/126494583.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ’s Defence Research & Development Laboratory has successfully conducted a flight-test of the third-generation fire-and-forget man-portable anti-tank guided missile (MPATGM) with top attack capability against a moving target in the KK Ranges of Ahilya Nagar in Maharashtra. The test was conducted on Sunday.The anti-tank guided missile can be launched from a tripod or military vehicle launcher and its warhead is capable of defeating modern main battle tanks.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has lauded DRDO , development-cum-production partners (DcPP) and the industry for the successful test and called it an important step towards ‘ Aatmanirbhar Bharat ’.DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said the trial target was successfully conducted, thereby leading the weapon system for induction into the Indian Army .The indigenously-developed MPATGM consists of state-of-the-art indigenous technologies like imaging infrared (IIR) homing seeker, all electric control actuation system, fire control system, tandem warhead, propulsion system and high-performance sighting system, which have been developed by DRDO's sister laboratories — Research Centre Imarat, Hyderabad, Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, Chandigarh, High Energy Materials Research Laboratory, Pune and Instruments Research & Development Establishment, Dehradun.The thermal target system was developed by the defence laboratory, Jodhpur, to simulate the target tank. The IIR seeker is well accomplished with day and night combat operation capability. Bharat Dynamics Ltd and Bharat Electronics Ltd are the DcPP for the weapon system.","The anti-tank guided missile can be launched from a tripod or military vehicle launcher.

"PSLV-C62 rocket fails to reach orbit, loses DRDO’s ‘super-eye’, 15 sats with disruptive technologies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pslv-c62-rocket-fails-to-reach-orbit-loses-drdos-super-eye-15-sats-with-disruptive-technologies/articleshow/126494578.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Isro 's PSLV-C62 rocket’s “deviating from its planned flight path” during the launch on Monday is a big setback for not only security agencies that lost crucial defence satellite EOS-N1 (Anvesha) but also several Indian and foreign institutions, startups and companies that lost 15 satellites possessing disruptive technologies that would have brought revolutionary changes in the space sector if they had reached their sun-synchronous orbit home at an altitude of 512 km.“We attempted the PSLV-C62 EOS-N1 mission. The PSLV is a four-stage vehicle - the first stage is a solid motor with two strap-ons, the second stage is liquid, the third stage is solid, and the fourth stage is liquid. The performance of the vehicle close to the third stage was as expected and as predicted,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said after the botched launch at the Sriharikota spaceport.“However, near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected. We are now analysing the data from all ground stations, and once the analysis is complete, we will come back to you,” he said.DRDO's EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a strategic super-eye, was a hyperspectral imaging satellite capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance.Had it been placed in orbit, it would have helped India secure its borders through its advanced remote sensing capabilities and would have also seen civilian application in areas such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Last year too, India lost a crucial defence satellite, EOS-09, in space when the PSLV-C61 mission failed on May 18, 2025, due to an anomaly in the third stage, like this time. EOS-09 was an advanced Indian radar imaging satellite designed for all-weather, day-and-night surveillance, crucial for border monitoring, disaster response and resource management.The PSLV-C62 mission was also carrying KID or Kestrel Initial Technology Demonstrator from a Spanish startup. It was a small-scale prototype of a re-entry vehicle developed by the startup. KID was scheduled to be the last co-passenger to be injected, after which it was slated to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere towards splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace was poised to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT was aimed at extending satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.Hyderabad startups TakeMe2Space and Eon Space Labs were launching India's first orbital AI lab. It featured the MIRA telescope and a disruptive model to slash space data costs. Satellite MOI-1 would have taken photos from an altitude of 500 km and also processed them there itself.Other secondary payloads were cubesats developed by students of several universities and Indian startups, including CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1. All satellites are now lost in space.","Isro's PSLV-C62 rocket’s “deviating from its planned flight path” during the launch on Monday is a big setback for security agencies.

Wife’s qualification no ground to deny maintenance: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wifes-qualification-no-ground-to-deny-maintenance-hc/articleshow/126494553.cms,".

PRAYAGRAJ: A wife cannot be denied maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC merely because she is highly qualified or possesses vocational skills, Allahabad HC has ruled, setting aside a Bulandshahr family court’s order. In its Jan 8 order, a bench of Justice Garima Prashad said it was misplaced for a husband to rely solely on his wife’s qualifications to evade his legal obligation to maintain her.The bench observed that a wife’s statutory right to maintenance cannot be infringed by claiming she has the capacity to earn, noting that mere potential to earn is distinct from actual gainful employment. The court said it is difficult for a woman to rejoin the workforce after years of domestic and childcare duties. The hard reality is that women are expected to fulfill these obligations, often at the cost of their education or career. But when marital discord arises, the very “sacrifice” is often portrayed as a ploy to extract money from the husband, HC said.“Such sweeping assumptions are not only unfair, but deeply insensitive to the social and emotional realities that women face,” HC added. The high court remanded the matter to the family court, directing it to determine maintenance for the petitioner wife and son on the basis of the husband’s gross income and the principles of social justice embedded in Section 125 CrPC, within a month.The additional principal judge of Bulandshahr court had rejected the wife’s application on the grounds that she concealed her professional education, was living separately without sufficient cause, and refused to return to her matrimonial home despite proceedings under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act.","Allahabad HC sets aside a Bulandshahr family court’s order.

SC blocks reinstatement of 'peeing' judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-blocks-reinstatement-of-peeing-judge/articleshow/126494541.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Terming the actions of a Madhya Pradesh judicial officer who created a ruckus inside a train and allegedly urinated on the seat of a female co-passenger as disgusting and grossest misconduct, Supreme Court on Monday blocked the way for his reinstatement in the service. It stayed a MP HC order which had set aside his termination and directed his reinduction.Interestingly, it is MP HC administration which has approached SC challenging the order passed by its judicial side. Acting on the recommendation of the administrative committee and its full court reference, HC administration had terminated his job but he challenged it on the judicial side and a division bench set aside the termination order.""This is a shocking case. You urinated in the compartment. There was a lady... It is disgusting,"" a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said. It expressed surprise on how can HC pass the order in favour of a judicial officer after his disgusting behaviour in public.HC, in his petition filed by advocate Divyakant Lahoti, said that the judicial officer ""indulged in an extremely indecent conduct by urinating on the seat of a female co-passenger, exposing his private parts which is unbecoming of a judge"".It said that HC erred in reinstating him on the basis that he was acquitted in a criminal case lodged against him after the incident.""The reasoning adopted by HC, if allowed to stand, sets a damaging precedent whereby judicial officers proven guilty of misconduct in duly conducted departmental inquires may evade accountability by relying on technical criminal acquittals. Such an approach erodes the autonomy of disciplinary mechanisms, weakens institutional discipline, and risks undermining the very confidence that the public reposes in the judiciary. The preservation of judicial integrity demands that departmental findings, reached through a fair process and on the standard of preponderance of probabilities, be accorded their due weight, or the credibility of the institution itself would be in great peril,"" the petition said.The incident happened when the judge was travelling in an overnight express in June 2018 & was allegedly drunk. He had misbehaved and harassed co-passengers & indulged in obscene actions. He was arrested and was immediately released on bail. He was also acquitted in criminal case lodged against him after witnesses including TTE & victim passengers turned hostile.tnn",Madhya Pradesh judicial officer created a ruckus inside a train and allegedly urinated on the seat of a female co-passenger.

NEW DELHI: While sympathising with a young man from UP who will lose his govt job because of its adverse order over his not declaring a pending criminal case against him at the time of recruitment, Supreme Court on Monday emphasised that sympathy cannot supplant the law as such disclosure is not a simple procedural formality but a basic requirement for public service.""There is a maxim in law to the effect that ' dura lex, sed lex', which means the law may be harsh, but the law is law,"" a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said while quashing the order of Allahabad HC which had held that the non-disclosure was of ""trivial nature"" and his appointment could not be set aside on that ground.""It is also a settled position in law that sympathy cannot supplant law. As such, while we acknowledge that loss of a govt job is not an easy loss to come to terms with, at the same time awareness of consequences is a necessary component of actions,"" the bench said.""Proper and complete disclosure in applications for govt employment is not a simple procedural formality, but a basic requirement rooted in fairness, integrity and public trust. Govt posts attract hundreds, and often thousands, of applicants for a single vacancy, each competing under the same stated conditions; scrupulous vetting of every candidate becomes imperative and essential to ensure a level playing field and to protect the credibility of the selection process.When an applicant withholds information about criminal antecedents, it undermines this process by depriving the appointing authority of the opportunity to make a fully informed assessment of suitability,"" the bench said.While the law recognises that non-disclosure, depending on the nature of the offence and accompanying circumstances, may not invariably be fatal to a candidature, it nevertheless remains a serious lapse. ""The gravity is significantly compounded when the non-disclosure is repeated, as it ceases to be accidental or inadvertent and instead reflects deliberate concealment. Such strikes at the core of trust reposed in candidates for public service, where honesty and transparency are indispensable attributes, and justify a far stricter view by the authorities,"" it said.In the case before it, the person was appointed as Sahayak Samiksha Adhikari, but his services were terminated after it was found there were two pending criminal cases against him, which were not disclosed by him in the form. He approached Allahabad HC, whose single as well as division bench quashed his termination, following which state govt moved SC.",A young man from UP will lose his govt job because of its adverse order over his not declaring a pending criminal case against him at the time of recruitment.

Isro sees warning in two consecutive PSLV failures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-sees-warning-in-two-consecutive-pslv-failures/articleshow/126494434.cms,".

BENGALURU: Any space agency will tell you that every rocket launch comes with anxious moments, no matter what the record is. Yet, India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) failing twice in consecutive attempts won't be easy for Isro to digest given its workhorse's record.PSLV has had 64 missions, of which four, including Monday's PSLV-C62, failed to put the spacecraft in orbit, and one in 1997 placed the payload on a lower orbit than the intended one. When a launcher is seen as proven, scrutiny can soften. But back-to-back failures need to be treated as a structural warning - not bad luck - as they suggest deeper issues, whether with quality control, supply chains, testing protocols, or configuration management.When PSLV-C61 failed last year, it brought down the rocket's success rate from 95.2% to 93.7%. Now, it has slipped further. Isro told TOI on Monday that the failures have affected the collective morale of the team. ""It would have been different if any other launcher failed, but a PSLV failure worries us,"" said a scientist.An analysis of setbacks shows that PSLV-C62's failure could have been caused by unresolved issues from the failed PSLV-C61 on May 18, 2025.In both cases, PS3, or the third stage - a solid motor that provides a high-energy boost after the second stage burnout - suffered a glitch.While Isro has not made the previous failure analysis committee (FAC) report public, TOI has learnt there was a fall in chamber pressure of the motor case. The PSLV-C62 will now be analysed by another FAC. Isro said there was disturbance in the ""roll rate"" during the final stages of PS3 burning on Monday, and that caused a deviation.Failures before 2025 all point to different glitches. The first setback was on Sept 20, 1993 when PSLV-D1, the rocket's first mission, failed due to a guidance system error during the separation of PS2 (a liquid stage).Isro launched again on Oct 15, 1994, and thereon PSLV showed no glitch until Sept 29, 1997, when PSLV-C1 mission became a ""partial success"". Here, the pressure regulator on PS4 (which uses twin liquid engines) failed, resulting in the satellite being placed in a lower-than-intended orbit.The 1997 glitch has not repeated. The next failure came 20 years later, in Aug 2017, when the PSLV-C39 mission failed. In this case, the problem was with the heat shield, which has since been rectified. After the PSLV-C39 mission, the launch vehicle had 21 successful flights before the failure last year, followed by Monday's.","PSLV has had 64 missions, of which four failed to put the spacecraft in orbit.

NEW DELHI: Reminiscing 'Sholay' in times of conflict, the Consulate General of Iran in Mumbai Tuesday took to X (formerly Twitter) to post about an Iranian newspaper's coverage on the iconic Bollywood film awaiting its 50th anniversary.The Iranian embassy joined in, posting ""Sholay turns 50 and Iran still remembers."" While this nostalgic tribute highlighted the film's timeless appeal and cross-cultural resonance transcending borders, the gesture was also pleasantly surprising at a time when the country is recovering from a war.'Sholay' was released on Aug 15, 1975, when India was under the Emergency.The Consulate General's post recalled how an Iranian newspaper dedicated a full-page tribute to 'Sholay', noting that the film's unforgettable story of friendship has become a cornerstone of cinematic memory in Iran. Interestingly, the iconic villain Gabbar Singh is known as Jabbar Singh in Iran. The post also mentioned Iranian actor Navid Mamza, who drew inspiration from Gabbar Singh's looks and menacing mannerisms.This gesture is significant given the historical and cultural ties between India and Iran. The two countries enjoyed a long-standing relationship rooted in their shared border until India's partition in 1947.Indian cinema has been a common thread between the two nations, with films like 'Shree 420' and 'Sangam' gaining immense popularity in Iran.

I can’t accept payment by UPI anymore,” Shankar, a shopkeeper in Horamavu told ET.According to vendors, lawyers and accountants, thousands of unregistered small businesses, including street food stalls, push carts and corner shops, have received GST notices. Some face demands running into lakhs of rupees.Advocate Vinay K Sreenivasa, joint secretary of the Federation of Bengaluru Street Vendors Associations, said many vendors fear harassment by GST officers and possible eviction by civic authorities, prompting them to switch to cash.Under the current GST framework, businesses supplying goods must register and pay GST if their annual turnover exceeds Rs 40 lakh. For service providers, the threshold is Rs 20 lakh.The commercial taxes department stated that notices were issued only in cases where UPI transaction data since 2021-22 indicated turnover levels that require GST registration. It said such businesses must register, disclose their taxable turnover, and pay the applicable tax.However, HD Arun Kumar, former additional commissioner of commercial taxes in Karnataka, said GST authorities cannot simply quote random figures as turnover. “Under the GST laws, the burden of proof is on officers. They must establish it before arriving at a tax demand, unlike in money laundering cases,” he said.Opposition BJP MLA S Suresh Kumar said he plans to write to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking his intervention.A former GST field official pointed out that not all UPI credits reflect business income. “Some of it would be informal loans or transfers from family and friends,” he said.“Bengaluru may emerge as a test case. If the GST authorities can net a good chunk of revenue by tapping unregistered vendors, other states too will take the cue as every state is desperate for funds,” said chartered accountant Sreenivasan Ramakrishnan of Sreeni & Associates.“Officials have zeroed in on chat vendors with high business in Mumbai. It's only a matter of time considering the huge potential tax base,” he told ET.Karnataka’s tax officials are under pressure to meet a collection target of Rs 1.20 lakh crore for 2025-26. CM Siddaramaiah is grappling with the twin demands of funding Rs 52,000 crore worth of welfare guarantees and responding to pressure from Congress MLAs seeking funds for infrastructure.","Bengaluru, once hailed as a tech capital, is replacing QR code with physical currency.

I don’t know who Bikkalu Shiva is, where the property is, or any other details. But without reason, my name was included in the FIR, and I got to know about it through the media. I am deeply pained by the development. I will fight against it legally, and I will be contacting the home minister to explain to him that I don’t have any role. ""As mentioned in the media, the deceased filed a complaint with the police many days ago. Why did no one inform me about it or try to get my clarification? I am not sure if it is a political conspiracy or another reason,"" Basavaraj said. ""I will appear before the police if they summon me for questioning about the case,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has busted an ISI-China-Canada linked international drug cartel and arrested a notorious Indo-Canadian gangster, Opinder Singh Sian aka Thanos, running a global fentanyl and methamphetamine trafficking ring from British Columbia.According to court documents reviewed by TOI, Sian was arrested in Arizona on June 27 after his role in smuggling methamphetamine to Australia and chemicals for fentanyl into the US via Canada was established.The investigation, which kicked off in 2022, and a recently unsealed affidavit in a US court, has revealed that Sian, had operational ties with chemical suppliers linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) besides the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico.The DEA had mounted an undercover operation to trap Sian after his dubious ties came to fore in 2021-2022 in the aftermath of a preliminary inquiry conducted regarding a tip from a Turkish intelligence agency.Singh was at the time a known senior member of the notorious ISI-backed 'Brothers Keepers' gang which mostly has foot soldiers from Punjab in India, many of whom are Canadian citizens.The gang, which has lent its support to the cause of so-called Khalistan on many occasions, was also seen active in commemorations rallies in support of Air India bombing mastermind Talwinder Singh Parmar and others, sources said.According to Canadian police, the group deals in bulk trafficking of cocaine, MDMA, heroin, fentanyl and methamphetamine besides arms trafficking, murder, extortion and armed robbery.In his early days, Sian was wounded in a shooting in Aug 2008 that left his friend Gurpreet Sidhu dead and survived another bid on his life in May 2011, marking his rapid rise in Canada's underworld. The now-released court documents state that Sian had arranged for a meeting between a confidential US undercover source, known as ""Queen"", and a Chinese cartel man named Peter Peng Zhou in Vancouver in 2023. Zhou, ran a trucking company with an Indo-Canadian associate, revealed that he could ""receive fentanyl precursor chemicals from China into Vancouver and ""send 100 kilos of chemicals per month to Los Angeles"" using his trucking company.Sian and Queen, the DEA said, held multiple meetings and were in contact through chat application Threema to coordinate multiple deliveries. Specifically, Sian made four drops of methamphetamine (over 500 pounds) in southern California before the DEA moved for his arrest.The DEA agents were subsequently able to identify multiple characters involved in the network, which ranged from Turkey to Dubai. Sian, the DEA submitted, was also found linked to the notorious Kinahan crime family which is linked to Hezbollah",Opinder Singh Sian aka Thanos was arrested in Arizona on June 27.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday turned the tables on a married woman, who sought cancellation of anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping her on promise of marriage, by warning her she might be liable for prosecution for having a physical relationship with a man other than her husband during subsistence of her marriage.When the woman's counsel argued that the man had continued to engage in a sexual relationship with his client on the false promise of marriage, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""You are a married woman with two children. You are a mature person, and you understand the relationship you were getting into outside the marriage.""When the advocate said that she was called many times to hotels and rest houses by the man for sex on the pretext of marriage, the bench asked, ""Why did you go to the hotels repeatedly at his beckoning? You very well understand that you also have committed an offence by having a sexual relationship outside the marriage.""The bench said Patna high court was right in granting anticipatory bail to Ankit Barnwal and dismissed the plea of the woman. The trial court had refused anticipatory bail to Barnwal, who had sought relief after the woman registered a rape complaint against him.The married woman and Barnwal had been in a relationship after knowing each other through social media in 2016. The woman had alleged that at the behest and pressure of Barnwal, she had sought divorce from her husband, which was granted by a family court on March 6.Within a fortnight of getting the divorce she allegedly asked Barnwal to marry her but he refused. She then lodged a complaint with Bihar police accusing him of sexually exploiting her in the false promise of marriage.The HC had granted anticipatory bail to Barnwal on finding from record that he had not indulged in any sexual activity with her after her divorce from her husband.","A married woman sought cancellation of anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping her on promise of marriage.

BJD activists clash with police over Balasore incident

BHUBANESWAR/BALASORE: Minutes before a 20-year-old college student set herself ablaze on July 12, she was allegedly coerced by her college principal to withdraw a sexual harassment complaint against a senior faculty member and apologise to the accused, according to a police complaint filed by her family.FIR says the student was summoned to the principal’s office between 12 and 12.30 pm. She left the room and by 12.40 pm had doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. Her cousin, who filed the complaint, alleged that the principal warned her, “You won’t be able to show your face to anyone. You’ll be forced to end your life if you don’t withdraw the complaint.”Both the accused teacher and the principal were suspended and arrested. The crime branch has taken over the probe amid growing questions about how the student procured petrol within 10 minutes of leaving the principal’s office.Both the accused teacher and the principal were suspended and arrested.

'Committed To Peace': Pak Calls for Dialogue With India at SCO After Pahalgam Attack, Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Stressing on acquiring the most advanced but indigenous defence technologies to have an upper hand over adversaries, chief of defence staff general Anil Chauhan said that “in today’s warfare, you cannot win with yesterday’s weapon systems”. “Today's warfare has to be fought with tomorrow’s technology,” he said.The CDS advocated for accelerated development of homegrown drone technology and counter-UAS grids, cautioning that outdated technology cannot be relied upon in modern battlefields.In his address at an event held at the Manekshaw Centre in Delhi, CDS Chauhan also pointed out that during Operation Sindoor, Pakistan had used unarmed drones and loiter munitions on May 10 but “none of them could actually inflict any damage to Indian military or civilian infrastructure, and most of them were neutralised through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means”.Laying stress on self-reliance in drone and UAV technology, he said, “Our 'Operation Sindoor' has shown us why we must not depend on imported drone or counter-drone technology. Indigenous systems are critical. Foreign systems come with limitations — their specifications are widely known, allowing adversaries to anticipate tactics.”Gen Chauhan said recent conflicts globally have demonstrated how drones can “shift tactical balance disproportionately”.Asserting that self-reliance in UAVs and Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) is a “strategic imperative” for India, he said Operation Sindoor has shown why indigenously developed Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and C-UAS “built for our terrain and our needs are crucial”. “Asymmetric drone warfare is making large platforms vulnerable and driving militaries to rethink the conceptual aspects of air doctrines, development of C-UAS and adaptive moves of engagement,” he said.“In the history of warfare, we have witnessed revolutionary changes — from heavy rifles to lighter, more sophisticated long-range weapons. But the biggest shift is the emergence of drones and unarmed aerial systems. Their utility has grown multifold — from basic surveillance tools to becoming effective force multipliers on the battlefield,” Gen Chauhan said.He explained that drones, despite being smaller and less aerodynamic, are reshaping conventional warfare. “They are cheaper, harder to detect and yet sophisticated. This defies traditional military thinking,” he said. Operation Sindoor, he said, clearly demonstrated the need to secure lower airspace and develop integrated counter-UAV systems.His statement comes amid a global shift towards drone-dominated conflicts, like in the case of the Israel-Iran conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war, where hundreds of drones are being used for bombing strategic targets, individuals and even key installations.","Chief of defence staff general Anil Chauhan said that “in today’s warfare, you cannot win with yesterday's weapon systems” He advocated for accelerated development of homegrown drone technology and counter-UAS grids, cautioning that outdated technology cannot be relied upon in modern battlefields.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122592319,imgsize-1335439,width-400,resizemode-4/122592319.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Congress is likely to settle for a lower share of seats in Bihar than it contested in 2020, with sources saying that negotiations are on with a constituency-wise analysis among partners, including RJD and Left parties.According to a Congress manager, the party is likely to get a tally between 50 and 60 seats to contest, which would be below the 70 seats it contested in the last election to the 243-member assembly. But Congress, sources said, is focusing more on the ""winnability"" factor than numbers, and is keen to ensure that the alliance does not face dissonance which a race among allies for a greater share creates.While talks are ongoing, Congress's willingness to settle for a lower tally appears to be a bitter lesson learnt from the humbling experience of 2020. Congress had secured a high tally of 70 seats after intense bargaining, but could win only 19, and ended up taking the blame for the RJD-led alliance falling just short of the magic number against the JDU-BJP combination, which scraped home.Other parties in the alliance were CPM, CPI, CPI (ML), which had performed much better than Congress, compounding the criticism directed at the grand old party. The Patna failure seriously curbed Congress's bargaining power in the elections that followed in Tamil Nadu and other states where the party was a junior member of the alliance.While the better-than-expected results in the 2024 parliamentary polls raised Congress stock, the Haryana and Maharashtra debacles have marked a setback to the party in the eyes of its allies. At the same time, sources said Congress too is aware of the need for unity among partners and does not want to come across as putting itself above the alliance's interests.In Bihar, according to Congress members, the party is working to ensure coherence in the alliance and seeking to add value to the grand anti-NDA combine by amplifying Rahul Gandhi's messaging among backward classes. The attempt to secure seats for the JMM in Bihar is also seen as a step in that direction.","Congress likely to settle for a lower share of seats in Bihar than it contested in 2020.

NEW DELHI: Those with pending toll dues for use of National Highways (NHs) will soon not be able to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer and issuance of fitness certificate. The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification to introduce this change in Motor Vehicle Rules, to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one gets a free ride on tolled highways.The move gains further importance in light of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) going for multi lane free flow (MLFF) on NH stretches for tolling purposes, with there being no physical barrier to stop vehicles for collection of user fee.The draft notification proposes that the registration authorities “shall not grant request” for depositing motor vehicle tax or recording transfer of ownership in certificate of registration if “unpaid user fee” is reflected against the vehicle in question. The proposed change in rules also says that in case a vehicle crosses a tolling point after being electronically recorded but the toll charge is not paid, either because of the vehicle not having an affixed valid FASTag or on account of a pending challan, it will be reflected as unpaid user fee in the system.Officials said that vehicle owners would be allowed to avail the vehicle- and transport-related services only after they clear the toll dues.Earlier, NHAI had urged the road transport ministry to make changes in the Vahan system, which is the repository for all registered vehicles, to recover unpaid toll from vehicles with no FASTag or faulty/blacklisted tags.",The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification to introduce this change in Motor Vehicle Rules.

NEW DELHI: In the politically significant AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam case, Delhi HC on Wednesday rejected a plea from fugitive Shravan Gupta, promoter of Emaar-MGF who fled to London in 2019, seeking further adjournment of his case relating to non-bailable warrant against him and that he be allowed to appear before ED through video conferencing in view of his inability to return to India.Pulling up his counsel for misleading the court repeatedly, the court refused to grant any further adjournment while reserving its order on the plea of quashing the non-bailable warrant.ED argued before Justice Neena Bansal that Gupta had failed to appear for questioning despite nine summonses issued to him since 2019. Two days after he wrote to ED (on Nov 24, 2019) seeking ""some time to join the investigation"" on grounds of ill health, with a doctor's prescription advising six days rest to him, Gupta had fled to London and not returned since then, sources said.Rejecting Gupta's adjournment request, Justice Bansal said the matter had already been argued by both sides on two previous occasions, and on each date after the arguments, senior counsel (for Gupta) Vikas Pahwa had sought time to get instructions from his client regarding his return to India to join the investigation. Such conduct is ""unbecoming of a senior advocate"", the judge said while pointing out that the counsel had been seeking repeated adjournments.Gupta is accused of receiving kickbacks from AgustaWestland intermediaries for influencing the VVIP chopper deal worth Rs 3,600 crore, sealed during the UPA regime. ""Shravan Gupta received proceeds of crime in Natille Overseas Inc, Switzerland; Timekeeper Ltd, British Virgin Islands; Hall Park Holdings Ltd, UK, etc which are beneficially owned by him,"" the ED had said earlier, and has filed 12 chargesheets in the case, including against Gupta in 2022.Probe found that a Mauritius-based shell firm received bribes in the deal signed with Agusta SPA, Italy. Bribes were laundered to India allegedly through Gupta's shell entities and shared with IAF officials, bureaucrats and politically exposed persons through a complex web of transactions.","Gupta is accused of receiving kickbacks from AgustaWestland intermediaries for influencing the VVIP chopper deal worth Rs 3,600 crore, sealed during the UPA regime.

Telangana: Kids as young as 2 addicted to spiked toddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telangana-kids-as-young-as-2-addicted-to-spiked-toddy/articleshow/122606617.cms,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: The latest instance of toddy adulteration in Telangana, which has left seven people dead and dozens in hospital, has exposed another dark and sinister side of the business driving the sale of this alcoholic beverage that is otherwise considered less potent.Doctors report that an increasing number of children are getting addicted to toddy that has been spiked with sedatives like alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Some of these children are as young as two years old and have barely learnt to stand on their feet. They are brought to doctors with withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, fever and sleeplessness.Psychiatrists TOI spoke to said it is common practice in parts of rural Telangana for parents and grandparents to give their children toddy to calm them and put them to sleep. What the elders don't realise is that much of the toddy sold now is often laced with sedatives. Doctors say they are seeing a substantial increase in such cases since pandemic, with four to five cases being reported every month.""In rural Telangana, it's very common for the whole family, including children, to consume toddy as it is considered a traditional drink. In poor families, children are made to consume it so that they sleep when both parents are out working. So, by the time a child is seven or eight, he or she is addicted to adulterated toddy, causing irreparable damage to their young bodies,"" said Dr Srinivas SRRY, head of the psychiatry department and nodal officer, addiction treatment facility, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Warangal. He has treated several children under 10 with withdrawal symptoms.","Doctors report that an increasing number of children are getting addicted to toddy that has been spiked with sedatives.

KANPUR: In a remarkable scientific breakthrough that may rewrite regional history, a team from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has discovered signs of ancient Buddhist stupas and structural remains buried beneath the soil in Yamuna Nagar district of Haryana.Using advanced Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology, researchers detected circular structures, old walls, and chamber-like rooms at a depth of around 6 to 7 feet, pointing to the possibility of a 2,000-year-old Buddhist site.The survey, commissioned by the Haryana State Department of Archaeology, was part of a broader investigation to locate potential historical structures across several sites, including Topra Kalan and other villages known for scattered old bricks on the surface.The IIT Kanpur team's work offers compelling evidence of buried heritage that may date back to the Buddhist period or even to the Mahabharata era, according to local tradition.Professor Javed Malik of IIT Kanpur's Civil Engineering Department said, ""When we surveyed the mound's exterior, we picked up strong geo-radar reflections indicating a semi-circular structure beneath.

NEW DELHI: It is a classic case of how courts should not decide the custody battle of a child between estranged parents, by only hearing arguments of the warring couple's lawyers in the courtroom without interacting with the minor to know about the child's liking and comfort level with parents.Ten months after it directed a woman to hand over custody of a 12-year-old boy to her divorced husband, the Supreme Court has recalled its order as it resulted in mental and emotional breakdown of the minor who did not want to get separated from his mother and is now undergoing psychiatric treatment at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Admitting the error by the apex court as well as Kerala high court in granting custody to the father who visited and met the child only a few times in 12 years, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna B Varale said that the judicial order had a ""calamitous effect"" on the child's health and reversed its order by granting custody to the mother.In this case, the couple got divorced within two years of marriage in 2011 and the child had been living with the mother since then. She remarried four years after divorce. The father in 2022 approached a family court for custody of the child on the ground that the woman was shifting to Malaysia along with her second husband. The family court rejected the plea but Kerala HC and SC in Aug last year allowed his plea.The court's order led to deterioration of the child's mental health and the clinical psychologist's report said the minor was suffering anxiety and fear, with a high risk of separation anxiety disorder.The mother thereafter filed a review petition for recall of the order and placed medical reports before the court.Allowing her plea, the court said, ""It would be extremely harsh and insensitive for courts of law to expect the child to accept and flourish in an alien household where his own biological father is akin to a stranger to him. We cannot turn a blind eye to the trauma that is being inflicted on the child in consequence of the orders of courts of law handing custody to the father, who is alleged to exhibit apathy towards the tender emotional state of the minor. ""It admitted that the child's deteriorating mental health was ""as a consequence of judicial order changing custody"" and relied upon the medical report to reverse its order.","The Supreme Court has recalled its order as it resulted in mental and emotional breakdown of the minor.

NEW DELHI: Eleven years after he was arrested for allegedly killing his six family members, including three children, for which he was awarded death sentence by trial court and Punjab and Haryana high court, Supreme Court has acquitted the person saying that there was no credible evidence to prove his guilt and he was being sent to gallows because of court's enthusiasm to deliver justice.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said the trial court and the HC erred in convicting the person on the basis of statements of alleged eyewitnesses which was full of contradiction and their being present at the site of crime was also doubtful. The court said that the case is a reflection of breakdown of legal system where a person is not only punished but sent to gallows despite no credible evidence.""The breakdown of the legal system becomes apparent when such haste to lay a finger of blame on somebody leads to a shoddy investigation and a poorly conducted trial. The result is a loosely tied prosecution case with glaring loopholes all across and yet the courts' enthusiasm to deliver justice in such a heinous crime ensures that the accused person ends up on the death row, albeit without sufficient evidence. This is precisely the misery which the instant case entails,"" the bench said.The incident occurred in Phagwara in 2014 and it was alleged that the murder was done out of family dispute. Examining threadbare the statement of witnesses, the apex court said they did not inspire confidence and were not reliable.""The internal inconsistencies and lack of corroboration cast serious doubts and snatch away the degree of accuracy that is to be attained while determining the culpability of an accused in cases of murder. W e cannot turn a blind eye to the obvious inconsistencies in the depositions of its main witnesses which indicate deliberate embellishment and coaching, rendering these testimonies unreliable. Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that no credence can be lent to the testimonies of PW1 and PW2 and their account of being ""eyewitness"" to the incident or having seen the accused has to be discarded,"" the bench said.The trial court has held that dacoity or commission of offence by a stranger party has to be ruled out due to the gruesome nature of the crime but the bench said ""merely lack of an alternative plausible explanation to the incident cannot serve as enough evidence in itself to send a man to the gallows, whose guilt otherwise remains unestablished"".""At the cost of repetition, we must state that the standard of proof is an absolutely strict one and cannot be faltered with. When at stake are human lives and the cost is blood, the matter needs to be dealt with utmost sincerity. Therefore, given the facts and circumstances of the case and in light of the above discussion, we cannot bring ourselves to hold the accused-appellant guilty of the charged offence as his guilt has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the court said, acquitting the accused who had been in jail for the last 11 years.","A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said the trial court and the HC erred in convicting the person on the basis of statements of alleged eyewitnesses.

'Realised what I had done when I found TV channels reporting Fauja Singh's death'

JALANDHAR: The driver who fatally struck iconic marathoner Fauja Singh on Jalandhar-Pathankot national highway on Monday turned out to be a Canada-returned man who sped away after leaving the 114-year-old to die, Punjab police said on Wednesday.The suspect, Amritpal Singh Dhillon (26), was arrested from his home in Dasupur village, 20km from Jalandhar, on Tuesday. The vehicle, a borrowed white Fortuner bearing a Punjab registration number, was seized. According to Jalandhar Rural SSP H S Virk, Dhillon said he did not know it was Singh he had struck, and that he had fled the scene because he was scared.Police have charged him with culpable homicide and rash driving. The police FIR says the vehicle was speeding, and that Singh's life could have been saved had the driver taken him to the hospital rather than fleeing.Singh's son, Harbinder, said the driver should have stopped to help his injured father. ""We would not have pursued a complaint against him had my father survived. But he should have stopped,"" he said. Dhillon told police that Singh was crossing the highway and he could not stop in time as the vehicle was going fast, said Virk. tnnDhillon was returning home from Bhogpur, a 16km drive that passed via Beas Pind village.As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the marathoner was walking towards his family dhaba across the road when he was struck.During questioning, Dhillon revealed that it was only at night, when TV channels started reporting Fauja Singh's death, that he realised who he had hit and run, said the SSP.According to police officers, Dhillon claimed he felt very guilty after that. However, he did not come forward to take responsibility for the death that was mourned by the world.It took meticulous detective work to track down the vehicle and the driver.At a press conference on Wednesday, SSP Virk said an eyewitness told police that the vehicle that hit Fauja Singh could have been an Innova or a Fortuner. ""We recovered a damaged part of a headlight and when we checked with Toyota agencies, we were told that it could be an old Fortuner from the 2009, 2010, or 2011 models. Then, from CCTV footage, we zeroed in on a Fortuner and also found a damaged headlight from one particular CCTV. We found the registration number from CCTV footage. Investigations revealed that the vehicle had been sold a couple of times,"" he said.By Tuesday, police felt sure they had the right suspect. And the same night a police team arrived at Dhillon's doorstep.The SSP said Dhillon had gone to Canada on a tourist visa eight years ago and stayed back on getting a work permit. His sisters live there, too. He was in the construction business and has a work visa until 2027. He had come to India on June 23 on an emergency certificate as he had lost his passport. Three weeks into his homecoming, he is now behind bars, accused of killing a legend who seemed to outpace time.

New IT bill removes redundant provisions

NEW DELHI: There should be a time-bound resolution of litigations, a parliamentary panel that examined the Income Tax Bill, 2025, has suggested, as it made 285 recommendations on the draft legislation aimed at simplifying and modernising tax laws.The select committee of Lok Sabha headed by BJP's Baijayant Panda examined the IT Bill and adopted the report on the draft legislation, which is expected to be presented in the House on Monday (July 21) - the first day of Parliament's monsoon session. ""We have made 285 recommendations. The government has already accepted 250. We have said tax litigations should not linger on and there should be time-bound resolution, although huge improvements have happened as can be seen in the case of refunds,"" a panel member said.The recommendations of the parliamentary panel that examined the Income Tax Bill, 2025, were largely ""corrective"" in nature, a panel member told TOI. The simplification efforts have led to the reduction of the size of the document to 600 pages from the earlier 850. The IT Bill, 2025, was tabled in Parliament on February 13 and was aimed at simplifying the language and structure of the IT Act 1961.It was sent to the select committee for examination.The simplification exercise was guided by three core principles, which included textual and structural simplification for improved clarity and coherence, no major tax policy changes to ensure continuity and certainty, and no modification of tax rates, which is aimed at preserving predictability for taxpayers, an official statement had said.The new IT Bill also aims at eliminating redundant and repetitive provisions for better navigation, reorganising sections logically to facilitate case of reference. It has opted for simplified language to make the law more accessible and has removed obsolete and redundant provisions for greater clarity.Existing taxation principles have been preserved to ensure continuity while enhancing usability, the statement had said. ""The Income-Tax Bill, 2025, reflects the govt's commitment to enhancing ease of doing business by providing a tax framework that is simplified and clear,"" it had said.In an interview to TOI a day after presenting her 8th consecutive Budget in February this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the new IT bill was aimed at making it relevant for the 21st century.CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal had said there has been simplification in terms of the language and presentation and it brings more clarity to the system which is expected to reduce litigation.","The select committee of Lok Sabha examined the IT Bill and adopted the report on the draft legislation.

It shared that the enumeration forms of Bihar's 88.7 per cent electorate have been received and 82 per cent uploaded on ECINet. Accounting for the 4.5 per cent electors not found at their address, of which 1.6 per cent are probably deceased, 2.2 per cent probably permanently shifted and 0.7 per cent identified as enrolled as multiple places, around 93.2 per cent of Bihar's 7.9 crore electors have already been covered under SIR.Welcoming the people's response to the SIR exercise, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said: ""I thank all eligible electors of Bihar for actively participating in the much-needed cleaning of electoral rolls"".The last date for electors to submit their filled-out enumeration forms is July 25. All electors who turn in their forms, with or without complete documentation, will be included in the Bihar draft electoral roll to be published on Aug 1, 2025.The documents can be added during the claims and objection period.Sharing exact progress of SIR so far, EC Wednesday said around 7 crore electors have submitted their enumeration forms, with 6.5 crore forms uploaded on ECINet app/portal.

NEW DELHI: Observing that compelling dead marriage to continue only creates more mental agony, Supreme Court has said that courts should grant divorce in such cases when a couple cannot live under one roof.Bringing to an end the matrimonial dispute which has been going on for the last 16 years, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta allowed the plea of the husband for divorce despite the wife opposing it.

The court invoked its special power under Article 142 to do complete justice.""It has been consistently held by this court that the institution of marriage is rooted in dignity, mutual respect and shared companionship, and when these foundational aspects are irreparably lost, forcing a couple to remain legally bound serves no beneficial purpose,"" the court said.Supreme Court said, “It has been emphasised by this court in Amutha v Subramaniam that the welfare and dignity of both the spouses must be prioritised, and that compelling a dead marriage to continue only perpetuates mental agony and societal burden.”In this case, the couple got married in 2008 according to the Hindu rites and ceremonies but the difference cropped up between them. They started living separately from Oct 2009 onwards and the husband filed divorce petition before a family court a year after. The family court turned down his plea in 2017 and the Delhi high court also refused to grant divorce in 2019 on the ground of cruelty as alleged by him. In the meanwhile, the wife also filed a harassment case against in-laws for it was also rejected.Noting that the parties have been living separately for more than 16 years and there has been a complete cessation of cohabitation and consortium, rendering the marriage defunct for all practical and legal purposes, the apex court allowed the divorce plea of husband.“In the present case, it is apparent that due to complete detachment and the prolonged estrangement, there has been an irretrievable breakdown of the marital bond, which cannot be mended by any means. Moreover, both the parties have spent the prime years of their youth entangled in this marital discord, which has persisted for more than the last 15 years,” it said.“It is as clear as a day in the case at hand, the continuance of marriage shall only fuel animosity and litigation between the parties, which runs contrary to the ethos of matrimonial harmony envisioned by the law. This would ring true even more in the light of appellant’s (husband) and his family members’ acquittal in the cruelty case preferred by the respondent. It cannot be expected by the appellant to now continue in a marital bond with the respondent, a partner who had filed and fought a false case against her husband and in-laws,” it said.",Supreme Court says courts should grant divorce in such cases when a couple cannot live under one roof. Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta allowed the plea of the husband for divorce. The court noted that the couple has been living separately just a year after marriage.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122594600,imgsize-1124918,width-400,resizemode-4/122594600.jpg"
Take call by Monday on screening of Udaipur Files: Supreme Court to I&B ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/take-call-by-monday-on-screening-of-udaipur-files-supreme-court-to-ib-ministry/articleshow/122593536.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the special committee constituted by the ministry of information and broadcasting to decide by Monday pleas opposing screening of censor board-cleared 'Udaipur Files: Kanhaiya Lal Tailor Murder' on the ground that the movie, based on the beheading of the Udaipur tailor for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad, marked shocking and vicious vilification of Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Maulana Arshad Madani, and senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, who appeared for prime accused in Kanhaiya Lal's beheading case Mohammad Javed, argued against release of the film alleging that it vilified a particular community, would prejudice the trial in the murder case, put the accused's life in danger and also derogated the judiciary.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also asked the police to ensure protection of the producer of the film and his son who have received death threats.For the film producer, senior advocate Gaurav Bhatia told the bench that the film was cleared by Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) after incorporation of 55 cuts. He said the petitioners moved Delhi HC at the eleventh hour to stall release of the film, adding that the producer was suffering huge losses apart from stifling of his free speech.Terming the case a contest between right to free speech and right to life, the Justice Kant-led bench asked the committee constituted by the I&B ministry to decide Madani's representation against the release of the film by Monday, the next date of hearing.It also allowed counsel for the main accused in the beheading case to participate in the proceedings before the committee.The bench those who apprehend the trial getting prejudiced had a right to be heard.It also considered the threats allegedly received by the producer and his son warning them against releasing the film. The SC asked the police to evaluate the threat perception and take appropriate steps to protect them.Sibal said he, as counsel for Madani, had watched the film during an HC-ordered special screening. ""Once I saw the movie, I was shaken in every sense. It is a complete thematic dissertation of hate.""The bench pointed to Sibal's advocacy of free speech and recalled telling the senior advocate that he would one day be arguing against free speech. This is one such occasion, Justice Kant said.Sibal said, ""See the movie. It is something that generates violence... seeds violence. It is complete vilification of one community and not one positive aspect of the community is projected in the movie - violence, homosexuality, denigration of women. It is unthinkable that a democratic nation would allow screening of such a film.""Bhatia said, ""Beheading of the tailor and posting of its video on social media had more than one crore views. Videos were released prior to the beheading and after accomplishment of the sinister and gruesome act. None of the petitioners protested such a posting of video on social media. The film gives a message of communal harmony and is an appeal against violence.""Kanhaiya Lal had apologised for forwarding the post that the killers dubbed as sacrilegious.Guruswamy said the accused Javed would be completely prejudiced during the trial if the film was released. ""Free speech cannot be allowed to vitiate fair trial,"" she said, adding that certain remarks in the film by touching upon two sub-judice cases - the tailor beheading and Gyanvapi - also brought the judiciary into disrepute.Justice Kant said the SC was not bothered about derogatory remarks against the judiciary, as it was used to daily bashing by so-called intellectuals. ""We are used to this kind of bashing every day. Our judicial officers are not school-going children or adolescents to get affected by a movie or get swayed by a few dialogues in a film to decide a case. We are confident about their ability, competence, objectivity and the sense of detachment they carry,"" he said.",'Udaipur Files: Kanhaiya Lal Tailor Murder' is based on the beheading of a tailor for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad.

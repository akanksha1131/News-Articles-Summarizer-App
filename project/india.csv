Why this cohort is growing

Unfair advantages

Back to build

In the Indian startup ecosystem, one constantly hears about how IITs and BITS produce some incredible founders. But there is a large cohort of founders that doesn’t get as much airtime despite quietly outperforming any single IIT when it comes to unicorn creation. Meet the BARBIE founders — those who did their Bachelors Abroad and Returned to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. The term, coined by Sajith Pai, a Partner at Blume Ventures, has gained traction as a shorthand for this distinct founder archetype.From Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal to Zepto’s Aadit Palicha, these founders have moved back to India to build audacious, ambitious and enduring businesses in the country. The numbers speak for themselves — of the roughly 300 BARBIE founders we identified, 3.7% have gone on to build unicorns, a rate higher than IIT Delhi (2.7%) and IIT Bombay (2%). BARBIE founders have started 11.5% of all active unicorns in the country.In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK according to Open Doors and HESA, compared to 20,000 students a decade ago.While this is a tiny minority of the overall Indian undergrad population of 33m students, this number has been growing fast due to rising income levels in India and a myriad of problems with the Indian college experience. Importantly, many of these students are now returning to build in India. Though there is no reliable data on this reverse brain drain, anecdotal evidence suggests that return rates among Indian undergrads are on par with, or slightly higher than, earlier cohorts, likely influenced by recent geopolitical concerns.BARBIEs overwhelmingly build companies targeted at consumers rather than enterprises. Consumer brands account for 37% of all BARBIE-founded companies, followed by marketplaces, fintech, gaming, and other consumer internet businesses.There are two key reasons for this. First is taste and global exposure. These founders usually go to colleges in the US (78%) and UK (16%) that happen to be a melting pot of cultures. New consumer trends naturally emerge from these cultural hotspots and founders are then able to bring this novel flavour of products with a local twist back to India.The typical BARBIE founder spends three to four years doing an undergrad degree, followed by a couple of years working in tech, consulting, or banking before eventually moving back to India. A lot of these founders start up soon after moving back, but a fair number also spend some time working in the ecosystem or their family businesses before venturing out on their own.We tracked the undergraduate alma maters of BARBIE founders. Penn ranks first, followed by Stanford, Michigan, and USC. Penn’s lead is unsurprising given Wharton’s presence and its role as an early cradle of US D2C. In India, the Penn diaspora has gone on to build brands such as Knya, Taali Foods, and The Pant Project.Knya founder Abhijeet Kaji says, “What my time at Penn and Stanford really changed was my relationship with time and ambition. I saw founders and operators who were not in a hurry to 'win' a year, but very intentional about building something that would matter in ten or twenty years. That long-term orientation changes the kinds of decisions you make…and how much you are willing to invest before the outcomes are visible. ”There is also a greater focus and appreciation on design language in many of these brands. Founders often come from fashion, design, or creative backgrounds — enabling them to build brands that feel globally fluent but are distinctively India-first.Second is leverage. Many founders come from families that run businesses in the same or adjacent sectors. Trying to build a new consumer brand is hard in India because of low entry barriers and intense competition. These founders have an unfair advantage as they can leverage their family businesses on either the supply (e.g. a textile manufacturing family business enabling a D2C brand) or demand side (e.g. a family-owned retail chain or distributor becoming the first large buyer).Let’s also address the elephant in the room — privilege. An undergrad degree in the US or UK can cost up to Rs 2.5 crore for a four-year programme, so it is only affluent families who can afford to send their children abroad. That affluence (and the safety net of family businesses in many cases) often influences their decision to come back and take the risk of entrepreneurship. They’re also bolder in challenging the status quo and often end up creating new markets.Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra showed consumers that you can build an ecommerce marketplace from scratch and deliver products to millions of customers within 10 minutes. Anjali Sardana of Pronto is transforming home services by organising a fragmented workforce with professional standards. Pratham Mittal, founder of Masters’ Union and Tetr, is building a completely new kind of educational institution, focused on learning by doing instead of just sitting in classrooms.BARBIE founders also tend to excel at fundraising. As colleges abroad encourage a healthy dose of interdisciplinary liberal arts classes with all the critical reading and writing training that goes with it, they are able to articulate their startup vision with clarity. In the early days of a startup, when you have nothing but a story, the most creative storytellers are the ones that succeed.However, it isn’t all rosy. They have no access to the IIT / BITS networks that are omnipresent in the Indian startup ecosystem. And coming from predominantly English-speaking privileged backgrounds sometimes works against them as they might have real blind spots about how the long tail of India lives and consumes. This is why you might not see a Kuku FM or Meesho being founded by a BARBIE founder. Finally, some investors are biased against this cohort, viewing them as less hungry because they come from privilege — which can be a fair critique in some cases.While global immigration is facing significant headwinds, Indian students still aspire to study abroad. However, the political environment in these countries discourages them from staying on after they graduate. This dynamic suggests that the number and significance of BARBIE founders will only increase significantly in the coming years.","In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK. Many of these students are now returning to build in India. The typical BARBIE founder spends three to four years doing an undergrad degree, followed by a couple of years working in tech, consulting, or banking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127442186,imgsize-838605,width-400,resizemode-4/127442186.jpg"
Too young for a memoir? Not anymore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/too-young-for-a-memoir-not-anymore/articleshow/127443397.cms,".

Writing from middle, not end



Moments over milestones



Power of the ordinary



Once the preserve of people who had lived long, complicated lives — ageing film stars, war survivors, Nobel laureates — memoirs now follow a different timetable. From bookstore front tables to literary fest panels across India, writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like, and who gets to tell it.These are not tales of epic achievement or reflections after retirement, but lives still in motion with millennials and GenZs sharing their tales of growing up queer or disabled, surviving political violence, navigating family expectations, illness, ambition, and the ordinary challenges of becoming an adult, somewhere mid-journey.One such writer is K Vaishali, who was just 24 when she first thought of writing her life story. Growing up as a lesbian and dyslexic person in India, her life had been a tug of war between secrets and confessions — at home and on university campus — navigating double marginalisation. Even as the urge to pen her story grew, so did the hesitation.“I thought hiding under the garb of fiction would be easier. It was my editor who pushed me to make it a memoir,” says the author, now 33. While working on the book, Vaishali discovered queer memoirs by Western writers but struggled to find Indian reference points.“I wanted young people to know there is hope. I didn’t have that growing up,” she says.While many writers wrestle with questions about the relevance of their life story, Sanjana Ramachandran never did. Growing up in a Tamil Brahmin family, she was just 17 when she knew her “filmy” life had to be written about. Ramachandran never climbed Everest or entered the Limca Book of Records, but did something many women of her generation would recognise: appeared for competitive exams, pursued engineering followed by an MBA, clashed with a strict father, and explored her politics and sexuality. Titled ‘Famous Last Questions’, the memoir came out last year. She was 31.“There was no way to not write it,” she says. While working on the book, Ramachandran realised how closely her experiences mirrored those of other ’90s kids in India who lived double lives at home and struggled to be themselves. “I knew it would be helpful to me and to some others, no matter how small or large the number.”A similar zeal defined Tarini Mohan’s ‘Lifequake’, which traces how the young development professional’s life was turned upside down after an accident that led to a traumatic brain injury at 23. A decade later she began writing the book, eager to capture the details in case they became blurry later. “I didn't want it to be inspiring or a success story about ‘overcoming’ limitations, just a normal girl’s journey,” she says. “I hate that word. You don’t overcome disability. You live with it.” In the book, Mohan is vulnerable as she talks about not just slipping in and out of coma, but everyday things she took for granted. “Like going out dancing.”While personal stories are the staple of memoirs, some writers are also trying to find a balance between the political and the personal. Zara Chowdhary’s ‘The Lucky Ones’ recounts her 16-yearold self navigating the Gujarat riots of 2002 with family, and how that violence changed their lives.“I was always keenly aware of the lapses and voids. Memory, whether my own or that of survivors within my household or the larger community, is pliant. The gaps often tell a more profound story. Different versions only reveal how all nonfiction is also ultimately fiction,” she says.In the memoir, which was recently awarded the Shakti Bhatt Prize, the writer not only documents her family’s story but also braids it together with other witness accounts, and how the aftermath of the violence was navigated over generations. “It’s about keeping one’s conscience at the centre of one’s writing,” she adds, “and asking what is still urgent or relevant.”Tara Khandelwal, editor and founder of storytelling agency Bound, says such examples show that the definition of ‘memoir’ is finally changing in India. “There’s a growing awareness that a memoir doesn’t have to be the chronological story of your life from point A to Z. It can be about a year or a particular episode in one’s life,” says Khandelwal.To tap into this curiosity, Bound recently launched a new imprint, ‘Moments’. The submissions so far range from grandchildren writing about grandparents to a young cybercrime specialist documenting their cases. “Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction,” Khandelwal says. “That’s what makes it tick.”Another is “personal branding” in an age of algorithm-driven social media platforms, points out Karthika V K, publisher at Westland Books. “There’s a change in the way that personal experience rubs up against public expression. It’s no longer only the very senior or obviously successful person whose lives are worth sharing,” she says.This, of course, means that there are shallow narratives and vanity projects alongside many more courageous and inspiring attempts to articulate lived experience of conflict, growth, achievement and failure. From startup CEOs and social media influencers to therapists and young parents.“Selective or partial memoirs are now far more popular than the conventional autobiography,” she says. “And where readers are interested, publishers will follow.”","From bookstore front tables to literary fest panels across India, writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like, and who gets to tell it. These are not tales of epic achievement or reflections after retirement, but lives still in motion with millennials and GenZs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127443426,imgsize-986965,width-400,resizemode-4/127443426.jpg"
Toothpick! Twiggy! Why does thin-shaming get a free pass?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toothpick-twiggy-why-does-thin-shaming-get-a-free-pass/articleshow/127442841.cms,".

“How are you a Bengali girl if you don’t have a round chubby face?”

“Careful on the terrace or the wind may blow you off…”

“Do you need a belt, or will a rubber band do?” “Sure it’s not anorexia?”

Over the years, I’ve heard them all. Sometimes, all in the same afternoon. Usually delivered with a laugh. Always a laugh. Which seems to make it acceptable.Being thin comes with a peculiar licence for casual body policing. Despite a culture that idolises skinny bodies plastered across popular media, thinness turns out to be desirable in theory and rather suspect up close. We celebrate it on runways and screens, then mock it in real life.Let me clarify. I never quite fitted the Bengali stereotype of women with soft, rounded curves or the cherished idea of looking visibly ‘well-fed’ on ‘maach bhaat’. I was born thin, stayed thin, and now in my forties, still thin. Not because I’m trying to “maintain” myself, as many assume but because my metabolism has perhaps always done its own thing.Contrary to popular belief, I eat. Well. Often. With enthusiasm. I’ve never dieted, chased size-zero, or feared carbs. I binge on cheese and fries when the mood strikes and accept second helpings of samosa-jalebi from well-meaning friends determined to “fatten me up”.I am also routinely informed that lean women are objects of envy. So far, so good.Except that this is where the compliments end and the comments begin.It started before I was old enough to register it. Standing out in a family of rounded figures, relatives wondered aloud if something in my genes had gone astray. In my teenage years, someone called me a “toothpick”. It took me twenty years to realise this had a name: thin shaming. At the time, it was just one of many things said casually, jokingly, even affectionately. “Bag of bones”, “matchsticks”, “twiggy”, “walking X-ray”.Even after ‘skinny shaming’ entered public vocabulary, the repertoire merely evolved. “Are you ill or something?” “How long will you diet?” And occasionally, for variety, “Trying to become a model?” said aloud at family gatherings, classrooms and later, offices.Because here’s the thing. You wouldn’t call someone fat to their face anymore. We’ve been trained out of that, at least socially. But calling someone “too thin” is still fair game.I’d usually let these jokes land. But once, a distant relative surveyed me at a family dinner and announced, with the solemn air of a doctor, that I resembled a skeleton, apparently concerned that I wasn’t eating enough. I smiled sweetly and suggested she looked rather like a baby elephant. She was offended. I was lectured on sensitivity.What surprised me though was when she apologised later. It had finally occurred to her how casually offensive her own remark had been.Pray, why are there bodies you protect, and bodies you’re allowed to comment on freely?And sometimes, it doesn’t stop at words. A woman at a party I was acquainted with conducted a quick inspection of my midriff, tugging at the band of my dress to check if I was wearing a body shaper. When her investigation yielded nothing, she laughed and asked if I even had a stomach.Another time, a consulate official insisted on carrying my plate at a reception. I mistook it for old-school courtesy until he winked at how “tiny” I was. I stood there plate-less, weighing whether to thank him, laugh along, or recoil.Complete strangers — at a train station, during a spa therapy, in a theatre loo — have offered meal plans I never asked for. People also feel entitled to audit what you eat, when you eat, and how much makes it from plate to mouth. If you’re having a salad, there must be an eating disorder. If you skip dessert, someone will insist you fear calories. If you go for it, it’s followed by a triumphant, “Good, you need it.”Strangely, after all that caring, thin is automatically deemed fit. And fine. Lucky, even. Any health complaint is dismissed as exaggeration or attention-seeking. “Just eat more,” they say, because any anomaly is self-inflicted or worse, imaginary.Once, an undiagnosed allergy spiralled because my symptoms were dismissed as a side effect of being skinny and “not eating enough”. I was handed a food chart. The allergy worsened. What makes this harder is that it’s rarely acknowledged as harmful.Popular culture hasn’t helped either. I have a yawning dislike for that cheerful body-positive Meghan Trainor song that announces it’s “all about that bass” while swatting skinny women as fake, silicone stick figures no man should possibly want.Which brings me to the deeply irritating ideal that ‘real women have curves’. I’ve always found this baffling. Since when did fat percentage become a qualification for womanhood?By now, I’ve also learnt that no one steps in when thin-shaming happens openly right in the middle of a dinner table or a group chat. Not because people are brutal but because they don’t think it’s unkind. Skinny shaming survives because it doesn’t sound like an insult. It sounds like banter, teasing or a backhanded compliment from someone “only joking” or “just worried about you.”The irony is relentless. This is what pop culture has long sold as “the goal”. The XS silhouette is what runways are built for and AI churns out by the million, and now the Ozempics and Mounjaros promise. And yet, I’ve spent a lifetime feeling awkward inside a body everyone assumes I must love. I do — quite unapologetically — even as I’m habitually guilt-tripped for it.A new AIIMS -ICMR study has finally put numbers to what many like me have lived. Conducted among 1,071 young adults aged 18-30 attending AIIMS outpatient clinics, it found that 47% of underweight participants reported moderate to severe body image distress, almost as high as the 49% reported by those with obesity.I’m outside that age bracket now and don’t get angry anymore. Mostly, I get tired. Tired of explaining my metabolism, justifying my appetite, reassuring people that my blood reports are excellent, of hearing “I wish I had your problem” from people who don’t see it as a problem at all.I’ve even curated a bagful of skinny jokes over the years and now ask folks to get more creative when they reach for the hackneyed gags about being blown away by a chance breeze. Somewhere along the way, I reclaimed my right to decide what my body is and is not.But not everyone can. And that’s the part we don’t talk about.","Being thin comes with a peculiar licence for casual body policing.

Cannot dismiss blood pressure as a lifestyle disease and deny disability pension to military officer: High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-dismiss-blood-pressure-as-a-lifestyle-disease-and-deny-disability-pension-to-military-officer-high-court/articleshow/127428957.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: Disability pension to a military officer suffering from blood pressure issues cannot be denied merely by terming primary hypertension a lifestyle disorder, Delhi high court has observed, rejecting the Union govt's challenge to an Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) order that upheld a retired IAF officer's entitlement.""It must be noted that lifestyle varies from individual to individual. Hence, a mere statement that the disease is a lifestyle disorder cannot be a sufficient reason to deny the grant of disability pension unless the medical board has duly examined and recorded the particulars relevant to the individual concerned,"" Justices V Kameswar Rao and Manmeet P S Arora observed.The officer joined IAF in Oct 1981 and was discharged from service in March 2019. His claim for disability pension was opposed by the Centre, which argued that the officer developed the disability in a peace area and that it was neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service. The court observed that the board failed to explain why hypertension was categorised as a lifestyle disorder. ""The medical board must record its reasons and findings while discharging the onus placed upon it,"" the court said.","The officer joined IAF in Oct 1981 and was discharged from service in March 2019.

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

NEW DELHI: Fresh controversy has surfaced around the cancellation of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding with singer-composer Palaash Muchhal, following serious allegations made by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane. Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial misconduct, claiming he was cheated of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project. A formal complaint has been filed in Sangli, Maharashtra.Smriti and Muchhal were initially scheduled to tie the knot on November 23, 2025. The wedding was first postponed citing health emergencies in both families before being officially called off in December 2025.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old alleged that the relationship between Mandhana and Muchhal broke down after a shocking incident during wedding festivities in November 2025.“I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers. The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.”Mane further claimed he is a childhood friend of Smriti Mandhana and was introduced to Muchhal through her family.Mane also levelled allegations of financial coercion against the Muchhal family, stating that he was pressured to invest additional money into a stalled film project.“When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to Rs 1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, communication with the family stopped entirely after the wedding was cancelled.“After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also asserted that he has evidence to back his claims. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal later issued a response through an Instagram story, firmly denying all accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,” Muchhal wrote.Amid widespread speculation over the reasons behind the split, both parties later issued separate statements confirming the cancellation. Smriti stated that she needed to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal said, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”",Smriti Mandhana and Palaash Muchhal's wedding has been called off.

NEW DELHI: Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital, but air quality remained in the “poor” category, with the AQI recorded at 297 at 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Light rain also lashed Ghaziabad and Noida.This marked a marginal improvement from Thursday morning, when the AQI had been in the “very poor” category at 312.Several parts of the national capital continued to register poor air quality, with Anand Vihar at 317, Ashok Vihar 335, Wazirpur 351, Punjabi Bagh 326, RK Puram 315, Bawana 342, ITO 266, Chandni Chowk 326, and Dwarka Sector 8 316, the CPCB reported.Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi was around 16.4°C at 7 am, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Under the AQI classification, readings are categorised as follows: 0–50 ‘Good’, 51–100 ‘Satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘Moderate’, 201–300 ‘Poor’, 301–400 ‘Very Poor’, and 401–500 ‘Severe’.Thursday had been unusually warm, with the mercury soaring to 27.1°C, about seven degrees above normal, marking the warmest January day in seven years.The high temperature was attributed to persistent warm easterly winds and clear skies, which increased sunshine hours.“Westerly winds are cold, while easterly winds are warm during this time of the year,” a weather official explained.With multiple spells of rain expected on Friday, the temperature is likely to drop. Officials said the maximum temperature is forecast to fall to 18-20°C on Friday and further to 16-18°C on Saturday.The rainy spells, accompanied by cloud cover, are also expected to bring down Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) to the poor category on Friday and to moderate by Saturday, if the predictions hold true.The IMD has issued a yellow alert for rain across the city. “Another round of very light to light rain is likely towards the afternoon or evening on Friday,” officials added, advising residents to remain cautious of strong winds and localized thunderstorms.A day earlier, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked all Stage III measures across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect on January 22, following improvements in air quality and favorable forecast trends.A statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said: “The Sub-Committee had invoked Stage III of GRAP on January 16, 2026, after a deterioration in Delhi’s average AQI.” Since then, air quality has shown a downward trend. According to the daily AQI Bulletin from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average AQI improved from 378 on January 20 to 330 on January 21 and 322 on January 22.Considering this improving trend, and based on air quality and meteorological forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the CAQM Sub-Committee convened today to review the situation.","Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital.

VIJAYAWADA: A woman allegedly murdered her husband with the help of her boyfriend after lacing biryani with sleeping pills, police said.The incident occurred at Chiluvur village in Duggirala mandal. The victim, Lokam Shivanagaraju, an onion trader, had been married to Lakshmi Madhuri since 2007.The couple had two sons. Madhuri, employed at a cinema ticket counter in Vijayawada, had reportedly developed a relationship with Gopi, a native of Sattenapalli.According to the police, Madhuri viewed her husband as an obstacle to her relationship. On the night of Jan 18, she allegedly mixed around 20 sleeping tablets into the biryani prepared for Shivanagaraju.After he became unconscious, her boyfriend Gopi reportedly came to the house around 11.30 pm.

'Rahul Gandhi stands exposed':

BJP

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister Shakeel Ahmad, who resigned from the Congress in November 2025, on Saturday launched a scathing attack on senior party leader Rahul Gandhi , calling him “darpok” (coward) and “insecure.”Ahmad also described Gandhi, a former Congress president and the current leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, as “dictatorial” and “non-democratic.”""Rahul Gandhi is a coward and an insecure person. He does not get that 'boss feeling' before anyone who is senior to him or has a big public support. He is uncomfortable with any such person and is thus dictatorial and not democratic,"" Ahmad told PTI.The ex-Congress general secretary further highlighted how the Raebareli MP, who was party chief during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, even lost from his own Amethi constituency, a traditional Gandhi family bastion, and attributed the defeat to Gandhi's “attitude.”Ahmad, a three-time MLA and two-time MP from Bihar, also claimed that he did not come across anyone alleging that their names were removed from the voter list during the Special Intensive Revision exercise in the state last year.The veteran politician resigned from the grand old party just days before the results of the Bihar assembly election, in which it won only six of the 61 seats it contested as part of the RJD-led opposition alliance.The ruling NDA swept the state.Seizing on Ahmad's remarks, the BJP said they have ""exposed"" Gandhi.""Shakeel Ahmad has exposed Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi keeps showing that he is the most tolerant and democratic person, but the reality is something else. He is the most dictatorial person and has the same Emergency-mindset that Indira Gandhi had,"" BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla posted on X.Responding to Ahmad's claim that he did not find any voter alleging their name was removed from the electoral rolls during the SIR in Bihar, Poonawalla slammed Gandhi, saying the Congress leader made ""baseless"" allegations of 'vote chori' to shift the blame for his party's defeat onto ""others.""","Former Union minister Shakeel Ahmad calls Rahul Gandhi a 'coward' and 'insecure' Gandhi is the current leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha.

US ‘Under Siege’: Emergency In DC, NYC, 14 Other States; Monster Storm Threatens 230 Mn Americans

Air India on Saturday announced the cancellation of all its flights to and from New York and Newark on January 25 and 26, citing forecasts of a severe winter storm with heavy snowfall.In a travel advisory, the airline said a major winter storm is expected to affect New York, New Jersey and adjoining areas along the US East Coast from early Sunday through Monday, significantly impacting flight operations.“Considering the safety of our passengers and crew, all Air India flights to and from New York and Newark have been cancelled on January 25 and 26,” the airline said.Air India added that its teams would provide full assistance to passengers booked to travel on these dates.The airline also shared helpline numbers for further information, asking passengers to contact its 24×7 call centre at +91 11 6932 9333 and +91 11 6932 9999.Meanwhile, harsh winter conditions across the United States have taken a toll on nearly half the population, as a days-long storm system brings snow, sleet, ice, bitter cold and widespread power outages.Forecasters warned that the damage, particularly in areas coated in ice-could be catastrophic and rival the impact of a hurricane.After sweeping through the South, the storm is expected to move into the Northeast, dumping up to a foot (30 cm) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston, according to the National Weather Service.Boston has declared a cold emergency through the weekend, while Connecticut is coordinating with neighbouring New York and Massachusetts in case travel restrictions are required on major highways.","Air India on Saturday announced the cancellation of all its flights to and from New York and Newark on January 25 and 26.

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026.

Raising children in a changed world

For many who grew up in India’s urban and metropolitan households, there was a time when forgetting to remind your father about bringing a chart paper or a political map of India meant a sleepless night of fear. The realisation would strike around 11 pm — too late, of course — followed by the certainty of what the morning would bring: anger, scolding, and a silent walk to school. You would run for your life if your mother caught you hiding test papers, instantly transform into an Oscar-worthy performer furiously finishing notebooks the moment you heard your father’s scooty pull in, or feel a familiar knot in your stomach before a parent-teacher meeting — one where the dreaded remark would glare back across the table:A casual greeting from a classmate in the market could be just as unsettling, inviting raised eyebrows and quiet questions later at home. For those disallowed from using mobile phones before their Class 12 boards, messages were typed secretly on keypad phones, the beep muffled so it wouldn’t be heard — sending elephant jokes or whispered secrets to friends like a thief.These memories are largely rooted in urban, middle-class childhoods — shaped by nuclear families, school-centric lives, and early exposure to rules, routines, and discipline within the home.Parenting experiences across India are far from uniform, but it is within these urban belts that the shift from authority to dialogue is most visible today.Today, phones are so firmly glued to hands that parents often become background noise, their presence acknowledged only when they call you for dinner or scold you for missing chores — an ironic reversal from the days when children moved quietly to avoid detection. And there were always two food choices on the dinner table: one, eat the green vegetables mom cooked; or two, don’t.Today, the same situations play out very differently. A child might suggest a 10-minute delivery app, and parents might laugh instead of scold. Friends are no longer viewed with suspicion but accepted as a natural part of growing up. From parents as unquestioned authority figures — stern, guarded, and rule-bound — to parents who attempt to balance discipline with dialogue, the parent–child dynamic has evolved significantly.Where once there was unspoken hesitation between parent and child, certain music, movies, or topics were strictly off the table. Today, children often assure their parents that such things are “not a big deal,” reflecting a more open, negotiable space where dialogue has replaced silent compliance.There exists one generation that largely obeyed and followed the route map carefully curated by their parents. Another listens, responds, and sometimes rebels — demanding to be understood, not merely permitted. Tech-savvy and exposed to the world far earlier than children once were, today’s young people often see beyond their years, assert their individual needs, and understand their own boundaries with remarkable clarity. It is within this generational shift that parenting styles diverge and relationships are reshaped.To be a parent, after all, is not a task for the faint-hearted.It involves raising, teaching, understanding, and eventually befriending a human being — one who can at times be stubborn, questioning, and who ultimately grows into a person of their own temperament.Parenting is a test most are never fully prepared for, a daily examination governed by an unending list of don’ts and dilemmas. This evolution is not a judgment on any generation of parents; most only want the best for their children, often even what they themselves could not achieve — not to burden them, but to build them for the world.Parenting, in essence, can be seen as a negotiation of fear, affection, aspiration, and trust. It is about guiding a human through the unknown while learning to let go, adapting as the child grows, and discovering that the rules of yesterday may no longer apply to the realities of today. The arc from strict discipline to dialogue, from unquestioned authority to mutual respect, reflects not just a change in homes, but a transformation in the very way we imagine childhood, the transition into adulthood, and the delicate dance in between.Parenting today has evolved significantly from the rigid, authority-driven approach of the past. Parents we spoke to shared nuanced views on balancing discipline, guidance, and modern realities, emphasizing the importance of empathy, communication, and trust.One mother explained how she navigates the realities of technology with her 15-year-old daughter: “While I remind her to study, I cannot ignore that phones have become a part of life. I try to balance this by not only allowing social media but also being tagged in reels my children share. What could be a distraction becomes a way to connect with them.”Another parent highlighted the risks of overly strict discipline: “If we are too firm, our children might trust outsiders before coming to us. We ought to be the first ones they share with.” Similarly, patience and empathy were emphasized by another parent: “We try to handle differences calmly. Anger often makes children fear rather than respect, but bad behaviour still needs to be called out.”Parents today increasingly favour guidance and understanding over rigid enforcement. One parent reflected on how the approach to parenting has shifted over generations:“Earlier, parents were strict, and children dealt with that strictness. Today, children prefer supportive guidance and warm communication. They enjoy interactive learning through activities. Children catch on quickly and need parental involvement. I focus on love, care, empathy, and independence when needed, balancing affection with healthy development.”Another parent raising three children, including a Class 10 student, shared how she balances guidance and independence:“We consciously try not to be as authoritative and strict as our parents were. Instead, we try to give our child a safe and comfortable space. Earlier, parenting focused on strictness and outcomes, while emotional support was often ignored. Today, communication matters more.”She added that while friendship in parenting is desirable, balance remains crucial:“Friendship is important, but it must be balanced with firmness. We listen and allow our children to share freely, but rules are also made clear. Boundaries help children feel supported while learning responsibility.”Reflecting on his own upbringing, one parent noted that fear-based discipline often leads to secrecy rather than responsibility. “My reaction to my son’s mistakes has always been a hug, followed by a calm discussion. If children see their parents as a safe space, they are more willing to confide.”Hari Shankar Soni, a media educator and father of two daughters, emphasized how parenting must adapt to modern realities: “I had my share of strict discipline from my father once. But, I have never raised hand on my children; I cannot imagine doing that with my kids. I don’t believe punishment works for this generation. I want to be a friend, not an authority they fear.”To understand parenting from the children’s point of view, we spoke to students across age groups. Their voices reveal how guidance, boundaries, and emotional support play out daily.Rubal, a Class 10 student in Delhi, shared: “My parents usually listen to my opinions, even if they don’t fully agree. They support me when I make mistakes. I wish they trusted me more on issues like career and mobile use, and understood that mistakes are part of growing up.”A Class 11 student echoed similar feelings: “My parents are supportive and provide solutions, but we differ on issues like marriage. They value security, while I think differently. I wish they understood my personality better.”A Class 6 student said: “My opinions are considered, and my parents explain things calmly. But sometimes I feel distant when they are strict about friends or social media.”A Class 9 student added: “I enjoy fun banter with my parents, but comparisons with others sometimes bother me. I try to voice it out.”Together, these voices suggest that children today seek understanding without absence, freedom without neglect, and boundaries without fear.Seema Kundra, a teacher with over 25 years of experience, says classrooms today reflect changing parenting styles, especially after Covid. “Many parents speak to teachers without filters, believing their authority is absolute. This attitude shows in children, who are far more casual with teachers.”She added that excessive screen time has widened the gap. “Parents sometimes criticise teachers in front of children, which undermines authority. Compared to five years ago, parental involvement has reduced.”Palak Sharma, a young educator, said the contrast is “worlds apart.” “Parents are present, but often transient due to work. Discipline and emotional support are pushed onto teachers.”While supporting gentle parenting, she cautioned against misinterpretation. “Gentle parenting has become an excuse to avoid discipline. Children need freedom, but also guidance and boundaries.”Whereas, Gauri Chandna Budhiraja, as a teacher noted that while parents are more engaged, “this sometimes crosses into over-protection and pressure.” Feedback that was once accepted, she said, is now often negotiated.Dr. Rajiv Mehta, Vice-Chairperson (Psychiatry) at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, stressed that the emotional climate at home plays a critical role.“Over-interference, hostility, and constant criticism create a damaging cycle. Parents pass anxiety to children, who then struggle emotionally.”He added: “Today’s helicopter parenting limits children’s independence. Earlier generations allowed more freedom to explore.”Psychologists commonly classify parenting into four styles, first outlined by Diana Baumrind and later expanded by Eleanor Maccoby and John Martin:• Authoritarian: High control, low warmth• Permissive: High warmth, low structure• Authoritative: Balanced boundaries and emotional support• Neglectful: Low responsiveness and guidanceWhat emerges today is a shift away from rigid authoritarianism. Most families attempt authoritative parenting, though many struggle to find balance amid technology, time scarcity, and rising anxiety.Parenting is never one-size-fits-all. Styles evolve with social realities, work pressures, culture, and mental health. Authority has softened into dialogue, fear into negotiation, and silence into openness. Yet closeness without boundaries can be as unsettling as discipline without empathy.Children today are more aware and expressive, but also face heightened emotional pressures. Parents, meanwhile, are caught between doing better than the generation before them — and fearing they may be doing too much, or too little.","Parenting is a test most are never fully prepared for, a daily examination governed by an unending list of don’ts and dilemmas.

NEW DELHI/ SRINAGAR: A Delhi court granted Saturday interim bail to J&K independent MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid aka Engineer Rashid, allowing him to attend Parliament’s budget session from Jan 28 under armed escort.Held in Tihar jail since 2019, the 58-year-old MP faces charges under UAPA in a 2017 terrorist-funding case probed by NIA.

Custody parole allows a prisoner to travel under police escort to a specific destination.Court had earlier granted similar permissions. Rashid attended the winter session last Nov under guard. He was also allowed custody parole between July 24 and Aug 4, 2025, for monsoon session sittings, and interim bail in 2024 to campaign in J&K assembly elections.Awami Itihaad Party, founded by Rashid in 2013 and listed by Election Commission as registered but unrecognised, welcomed the court order.Spokesperson Inam Un Nabi called it vital to ensure people of north Kashmir are not denied representation in Parliament.Nabi said travel expenses would depend on outcome of an appeal pending before high court. The party also renewed demand for Rashid’s release. Nabi said there was no justification to keep a two-time legislator and an elected MP behind bars, alleging victimisation for political beliefs. He cited former CJI DY Chandrachud’s recent remarks that even a few years of detention violate personal liberty.","Held in Tihar jail since 2019, the 58-year-old MP faces charges under UAPA in a 2017 terrorist-funding case probed by NIA.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former journalist Rajeev Shukla on Saturday recalled interviewing Narendra Modi during the prime minister’s days in the BJP organisation, noting that even then, he had brought a computer with him.Shukla said he first met Modi, who was then the BJP's general secretary, at the residence of the late party leader Arun Jaitley and had interviewed the future Gujarat chief minister for the ""Rubru"" programme.""The programme was quite popular and Modi ji had come for it. It was possibly his first TV exposure.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

‘Govt-dictated transfer shows erosion of judiciary’s autonomy’

NEW DELHI: Stressing that the biggest threat to the independence of the judiciary ""is from within"", Supreme Court judge Ujjal Bhuyan expressed on Saturday his dissent and disappointment with the collegium's decision to transfer Justice Atul Sreedharan from MP high court to Allahabad HC on the Centre's suggestion, and said it ""reveals a striking intrusion of executive influence"" in collegium system, which is ""unfortunate"".Without naming Justice Sreedharan, Justice Bhuyan asked why should a judge be transferred from one high court to another merely because he had passed some ""inconvenient order"" against the govt.SC collegium had in Aug recommended Justice Sreedharan's transfer from MP to Chhattisgarh HC but the collegium changed its decision on Centre's request and shifted him to Allahabad HC in Oct. Many law experts termed it a punitive measure against him for passing orders inconvenient to the govt. It was a bench headed by him that had in May taken suo motu cognisance against BJP minister Vijay Shah for using 'scurrilous language' against Col Sofiya Qureshi.""Then again when it is noted in collegium resolution itself that a particular HC judge who was to be transferred to another HC was subsequently transferred to different HC by modifying earlier recommendation on reconsideration sought by central govt. Does it not compromise the integrity of the collegium system,"" he said.Justice Bhuyan was delivering the Principal G V Pandit Memorial Lecture on ""Constitutional Morality and Democratic Governance"" at ILS Law College in Pune.The collegium resolution which was uploaded on the SC website stirred a storm as it revealed officially for the first time that the govt interferes in appointment of judges. But that was soon withdrawn and it was replaced with a new release after omitting that part.Justice Bhuyan said that the govt has no role or say in the transfer of judges which comes within the exclusive domain of the judiciary and that a transfer done at the instance of the govt reveals that the independence of the judiciary has been compromised.""When collegium itself records that the transfer was done at the request of the central govt, it reveals a striking intrusion of executive influence to what is constitutionally supposed to be an independent process created to make such immune to executive and political influence… It reflects clear admission of political executive influencing collegium decision... It's unfortunate,"" Justice Bhuyan said.He said the govt cannot say that such and such judge be transferred to such and such HC or not to be transferred there. ""It has become more important for the judiciary, particularly members of collegium, to continue to function independently and the integrity of the collegium system must be maintained at all costs. As judges we have taken an oath of the Constitution to perform our duty without fear or favour. We must remain true to our oath. If we lose our credibility then nothing will remain of the judiciary. Judges will be there, court will be there, matter will also be adjudicated but heart and soul will evaporate,"" he said.He said that constitutional morality, which means that the country is governed by rule of law and not by rule of people, is the soul of democratic governance and it ensures that democratic institutions function keeping in mind the overarching principles of liberty, exercising restraint and adhering to constitutional values and not bulldozing through on the strength of numbers, authority and power.""Judiciary has neither the purse nor the sword. All that it has is the faith reposed in it by the people and if that faith is breached then nothing will be left of the judiciary,"" he said while holding the collegium is not the best available system for appointment of judges but there is a scope of reform.""Sociology says that a man is a political animal and a judge is also a human being. It is, therefore, natural for a judge to have political and ideological leaning and there is nothing wrong in it. But that should not cloud the decision-making process of a judge who is not supposed to follow political ideology but constitutional principle in judicial proceedings. It would be a sad day for judiciary and by extension for our democracy if the decision in a case becomes a foregone conclusion the moment a case is listed before a particular judge or bench,"" he said.","Supreme Court judge Ujjal Bhuyan expressed his dissent and disappointment with the collegium's decision to transfer Justice Atul Sreedharan from MP high court to Allahabad HC.

Indian seafarers are most abandoned in the world again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-seafarers-are-most-abandoned-in-the-world-again/articleshow/127319128.cms,"Representative image: ANI

LONDON: Indian seafarers are the most abandoned in the world for the third year running.A total of 1,125 Indian seafarers were abandoned on ships in 2025 out of a total of 6,223 seafarers abandoned across 410 ships worldwide, making 2025 the worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.The number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned. In 2023, it was 401. After Indians, the next highest cohort to be abandoned in 2025 were Filipinos (539).India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the Philippines and China.Worldwide the total number of seafarers abandoned has increased by 32% and ship abandonments are up 31% compared to 2024, according to the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), headquartered in London.ITF data shows that seafarers were owed a total of $25.8 million in 2025 as a consequence of abandonment. From this, the ITF has recovered and returned $16.5 million to seafarers.The two countries where most ship abandonments took place were Türkiye and the UAE.Seafarer abandonment is defined as failing to cover the cost of a seafarer’s repatriation; leaving a seafarer without maintenance; or severing ties with a seafarer, including failing to pay wages for at least two months.“It’s nothing short of a disgrace that, yet again, we are seeing record numbers of seafarers abandoned by unscrupulous ship owners,” said David Heindel, chair of the ITF seafarers’ section.An Indian seafarer abandoned with three Indian crew on the “Eleen Armonia”, off the coast of Nigeria, since June, without pay, said: “I can’t sleep from stress, and if this continues I don’t know how it will affect my health. I joined this vessel quickly because the assignment meant I could spend Christmas and New Year with my new daughter and family. I have now missed these and an important family event. As seafarers, it feels really shameful that we’re treated this way. ”Last Sept India’s Directorate General of Shipping blacklisted 86 vessels linked to recurrent Indian seafarer abuse.Three hundred and thirty-seven ship abandonments in 2025 were on vessels sailing under flags of convenience — flags of a country other than the country of ownership. These flags are commonly used by shadow fleets (carrying sanctioned goods) to hide the identity of the real ship owner and are associated with poor safety standards and working conditions.","Number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned.

NEW DELHI: To honour junior commissioned officers (JCOs) with a record of long and distinguished military service, the Central govt has approved ahead of Republic Day the conferment of honorary commissioned ranks on 2,241 JCOs of the Indian Army.At least 437 JCOs have been elevated to the rank of honorary captain, while 1,804 JCOs have been conferred the rank of honorary lieutenant, recognising their decades of selfless military service, according to an official notification.Among those elevated to the rank of honorary captain is Subedar Major and honorary Lieutenant Sanjay Kumar, a Param Vir Chakra recipient, whose name resonates far beyond military circles. Kumar is a legendary Army officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India’s highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil War. On July 4, 1999, he single-handedly captured Flat Top, Point 4875, by neutralising enemy machine-gun posts despite severe injuries.Honorary ranks in the Indian Army are conferred on JCOs with impeccable service records who have displayed professional excellence and sterling leadership qualities at unit level.While these ranks — honorary lieutenant and honorary captain— do not alter command structures, they carry deep symbolic value within the armed forces. The number of those conferred the honour this year highlights the oft-neglected contributions of Subedars and Subedar Majors, who form the bedrock of the Army’s functioning. They train young soldiers, preserve regimental traditions, enforce discipline and provide continuity in some of the most challenging operational environments in the world.In addition to the honour and protocol status, these ranks can result in a modest enhancement in pensionary benefits, depending on the applicable rules, an aspect that assumes importance for personnel retiring earlier than most govt employees. The honorary ranks are a formal acknowledgement by the nation that exceptional service rendered within a shorter career deserves to be recognised and respected.","The Central govt has approved ahead of Republic Day the conferment of honorary commissioned ranks on 2,241 JCOs of the Indian Army.

If you want life, take risks, says recipient



.

NEW DELHI: Preeti Unhale, 51, completed 25 years with a donor heart on Jan 23, 2026, becoming India's longest-living heart transplant survivor - a landmark considering that heart transplants were rare, donor awareness was limited and long-term survival remained uncertain when she underwent the procedure.Originally from MP, Unhale came to AIIMS in 2000 after exhausting treatment options at home and in Mumbai. She was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy - a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weak and enlarged, reducing its ability to pump blood effectively and leading to heart failure. She was told a heart transplant was her only chance. At AIIMS, she met cardiothoracic surgeon Dr P Venugopal and cardiologist Dr K K Talwar. ""For the first time, I heard the words, 'You will be fine',"" she recalled. She stayed in Delhi for treatment - and has since lived here.Dr Talwar told TOI that Unhale had arrived in an extremely critical condition. ""She had married barely two and a half years earlier and came to us with hope after being refused everywhere else,"" he said. With little clinical guidance available at the time, doctors evaluated her extensively before a donor heart became available.""For end-stage heart failure, transplantation is the definitive answer. Survival is around 85% at five years. She has completed 25,"" he said. The transplant, performed in Jan 2001 by using the heart of a brain-dead teenage donor, happened at a time when outcomes were uncertain.""There was no guidance then. Success rates were low, and there were hardly any survivors to talk to. People discouraged us, saying transplants don't last long. But there was no other option,"" Unhale said.""If you want life - and a good quality of life - you take that risk."" Her husband, an Indian Forest Service officer, sought a transfer to Delhi so that the family could stay close to AIIMS. ""Family support was critical,"" she said.Life after transplant meant lifelong discipline. Unhale takes daily immunosuppressants and has faced multiple rejection episodes, including a major one in 2006-07 when she had to be rushed to AIIMS late at night.Over the years, she developed kidney problems, steroid-related bone damage, vascular necrosis and facial paralysis - each managed with sustained medical care. ""This survival isn't mine alone,"" she said. ""It belongs to doctors, nurses, technicians and even sanitation staff. It takes a system to save one life,"" she said. Preeti Unhale has counselled heart transplant patients across India, helping bridge the information gap she once faced. Her message is unequivocal: ""If doctors advise a transplant, there is no other option. Donors are rare - if you get one, say yes immediately. Live fully, but with discipline. We have been given a second chance.""","Preeti Unhale, 51, completed 25 years with a donor heart on Jan 23, 2026.

With the objective of economically empowering women and creating livelihood opportunities, Assam Chief Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday launched the distribution of cheques worth Rs. 10,000 each to 30,806 women under the Mukhya Mantri Mahila Udyamita Abhiyan (MMUA) in the Borkhetri Assembly Constituency of Nalbari district.With this, the scheme has so far benefited 22,28,228 women across 91 Assembly Constituencies in Assam. A total amount of Rs 30,80,60,000 was distributed to beneficiaries in Borkhetri today.Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Sarma urged women from Self-Help Groups selected under the scheme to strive to become a 'Lakhpati Baideu'.He said, ""Although the first instalment of Rs. 10,000 has been provided today, this marks only the beginning of their journey towards becoming financially prosperous. With sustained effort and hard work, they can achieve their goals within the next one or two years.""Highlighting success stories from the constituency, the Chief Minister cited Bijumoni Devi, a member of the Samannay Self-Help Group under Barbhag Development Block, who has become self-reliant through her pickle-making enterprise and now earns around Rs 15,000 per month, amounting to an annual income of Rs 1.80 lakh.Similarly, Anita Thakuriya, a member of the Jeevanjyoti Self-Help Group of Norowagaon, has achieved an annual income of Rs 2.23 lakh through animal husbandry and fish farming.Dr. Sarma added, ""Out of 40 lakh women associated with Self-Help Groups in Assam, more than eight lakh have already become Lakhpati Baideu. Previously, many were unable to pursue business ventures due to financial constraints, and to address this, the government launched the Mahila Udyamita Abhiyan.""He informed that the government will spend Rs. 3,200 crore to provide Rs. 10,000 each to 32 lakh women.

In an acute stroke, nearly 1.9 billion brain cells are lost every minute if treatment is delayed, making access within the golden hour critical. However, reaching a stroke-ready hospital remains a challenge in rural and difficult terrains.Handing over the units, Rajiv Bahl, Secretary, Department of Health Research and Director General, ICMR, said Mobile Stroke Units—first developed in Germany—have now been successfully evaluated in rural and remote parts of Northeast India. “India is the second country globally to report successful integration of an MSU with emergency medical services for treating acute ischemic stroke patients in rural settings,” he said.The initiative, developed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and guided by Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, aims to ensure advanced healthcare reaches the poorest and most marginalised populations, even in the most challenging geographies.Sharing the state’s experience, P Ashok Babu, Secretary and Commissioner, Health and Family Welfare, Government of Assam, said the handover strengthens the state’s emergency response system and ensures continuity of the life-saving service under state ownership.The MSU functions as a hospital on wheels, equipped with a CT scanner, teleconsultation with specialists, point-of-care diagnostics and clot-busting drugs, enabling diagnosis and treatment at or near the patient’s home.The impact has already been evident. During the pilot and evaluation phase, the model reduced treatment time from nearly 24 hours to about two hours, cut stroke-related deaths by one-third, and reduced long-term disability by eight times. Between 2021 and August 2024, the MSUs handled over 2,300 emergency calls, with 90% of patients treated directly from their homes after integration with the 108 ambulance service.","Stroke is among the leading causes of death and long-term disability in India.

""The entrustment of the chairship of International IDEA to India is a matter of immense pride for us all,"" he said while drawing attention to the India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) successfully held here from Jan 21 to 23, with the participation of representatives of election management bodies (EMBs) and ambassadors from over 70 countries.","Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar on Saturday exhorted the young electors to not only vote without fail, but to also lead the fight against misinformation, disinformation, and false narratives.

NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has expressed concern over Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal, saying the exercise is ""being done in a hurry,"" further warning that it is ""unjust to voters"" and could jeopardise democratic participation with the state assembly elections just months away.Speaking to PTI from Boston on Saturday, the renowned economist said that while electoral roll revisions can strengthen democracy if done carefully, the current process in Bengal lacks adequate time and fairness.""A thorough review of electoral rolls done carefully with adequate time can be a good democratic procedure, but this is not what is happening in West Bengal at this time,"" Sen said.""The SIR is being done in a hurry, with inadequate time for people with voting rights to have sufficient opportunity to submit documents to vindicate their entitlement to vote in the coming assembly elections. This is both unjust to the electorate and unfair to Indian democracy,"" he added.Recalling his own experience during the revision process, Sen said the time pressure was evident even among Election Commission officials. ""Sometimes, the officials of the Election Commission themselves seem to lack enough time,"" he said.Sen said he was questioned about his right to vote from Santiniketan—his home constituency, despite having voted there earlier and having his details already recorded.""When they questioned my right to vote from my home constituency in Santiniketan - from where I have voted earlier, and where my name, address and other details are registered in official records - they questioned me about my deceased mother's age at my date of birth, even though, as a voter herself, my mother's details, like mine, were stored also in their own official records,"" he added.The economist also highlighted documentation challenges faced by many Indians, particularly those born in rural areas. ""Like many Indian citizens born in rural India (I was born in the then village of Santiniketan), I do not have a birth certificate, and my eligibility to vote required further paperwork to be presented on my behalf,"" Sen said.Although his case was eventually resolved, Sen expressed concern for others who may not have the same support.""Even though I could happily say (like the Beatles) — ‘Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends’ — I worried about others who do not have so many loyal friends. My friends helped me to get through the rigid gates of the formidable EC,"" he said.Sen was summoned for a hearing after a ""logical discrepancy"" was flagged regarding the age difference between him and his mother.Asked whether the SIR could benefit any political party, Sen said he could not make a definitive assessment.""I am not an election expert, so I cannot answer the question with certainty. I have been told by those who seem to know more, that the BJP will benefit from the under-accounting,"" he said, adding, ""I don’t know whether that is true, but the real point is that the EC should not insist on a faulty arrangement and force our proud democracy to commit an unnecessary error, no matter who benefits.""Sen warned that the poor and underprivileged are most at risk of exclusion.""An obvious answer must be the underprivileged and the poor. The documents needed for being allowed into the new electoral roll are often difficult to obtain for the underdogs of society,"" he said.""The class bias that may show up in the necessary requirement of getting and showing particular documents in order to qualify to enter the new voters' list will tend to work against the indigent,"" he added.He also flagged concerns about minority communities, saying, ""Indian Muslims are sometimes relegated to disadvantaged positions through the activism of the recently bolstered Hindutva extremists. Some categories of Hindus also may face discrimination and targeting.""Sen stressed that institutions must act to protect voting rights. ""The EC and the Supreme Court must make sure that no adult Indian citizen has difficulty to qualify for voting,"" he said.Expressing his desire to vote in the upcoming elections, Sen said it would depend on logistics.""I would very much like to do that.

Referring to repeated confrontations, he added, “governors in the past were not like R N Ravi and I am constrained to criticise him.”Rejecting allegations surrounding patriotism and protocol, the chief minister said, “We are not inferior to anyone in patriotism, and no one needs to teach us,” stressing that respect for the national anthem was deeply ingrained in the State’s political culture.In his address, Stalin said the Governor’s conduct caused him distress, “However, the Governor is acting against the government. He repeatedly cites the same reason and walks out of the Assembly. I am someone who has deep respect for the nation and the national anthem,” he said.He also pointed out that assembly tradition in Tamil Nadu involved singing the Tamil Thai Vazhthu at the beginning of proceedings and the national anthem at the end.Highlighting his government’s record, Stalin said, “Because of the achievements of the Dravidian model government, Tamil Nadu has held its head high. Tamil Nadu has developed more than other states. The reason for this is our schemes.”He added, “As far as this government is concerned, once an achievement is made, an even greater one follows. Creating achievement upon achievement is the hallmark of the Dravidian model government.”The chief minister also dismissed opposition claims on law and order. “Incidents of crime are less in state during DMK regime when compared to AIADMK rule,” he said, adding, “Facing crises is not new to me and I have overcome many challenges.”Taking jibe at opposition Stalin said, “I was worried when DMK formed government because previous AIADMK government had left the state in bad shape and union govt is not in good terms with us, but now I am happy seeing state's growth,""The remarks come days after governor Ravi walked out of the assembly before delivering his inaugural address, alleging disrespect to the National Anthem and claiming his microphone was switched off. Speaker M Appavu had urged the governor to adhere to established legislative conventions.Raj Bhavan later defended the walkout, stating that the government-approved speech omitted references to issues such as atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women. Opposition AIADMK legislators also staged a walkout, citing concerns over law and order.Following which, Stalin said the DMK would consult like-minded opposition parties to pursue a constitutional amendment to abolish the practice of the Governor’s address at the start of the first Assembly session.

'Republic Day 2026 Flypast Will Be IAF's Tribute To Operation Sindoor': Says Wing Commander Deshwal

New Delhi: From Bactrian camels to Zanskar ponies, a rare contingent of “animal soldiers” will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute Republic Day parade on Monday.They will be under the command of Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of a retired IAF officer, and from the first batch of Indian Army’s Remount & Veterinary Corps.Speaking to TOI, she said, “This contingent is very uniquely curated. There are two Bactrian camels from Ladakh, four Zanskar ponies, four raptors (specially-trained birds of prey), 10 military dogs, mostly indigenously-bred. They are all Army soldiers and have different operational roles.”Perfectly adapted to extreme cold, thin air and altitudes above 15,000 feet, the Bactrian camels, which are recently inducted in Army operations, can carry a load of up to 250 kg and traverse long distances in the cold deserts.She said the Indian Army has been using indigenously-bred dogs for quite some time and they are trained basically for two purposes — detection (explosives, mine detection, tracking, search and avalanche rescue) and protection (assault on enemies).“Training of birds like kites or any animal involves neuroscience. Once you understand the science behind these animals and the training part, then these are highly trainable,” Captain Harshita said.IAF Air Commodore Manish Sabharwal, during a Republic Day press preview on Friday, said the S-400 air defence system, which shot down multiple Pakistan aircraft and also a spy plane from a distance of over 300 km deep inside Pakistan, which is a “documented kill”, will also be showcased at the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) tableau during the parade for the first time.The tableau will showcase India's victory in Operation Sindoor last year and the jointness of the three services displayed during the decisive action. One side will feature lethal military weapons that proved crucial during the operation. The other side will depict the destruction of the infrastructure on the side of Pakistan.Major General Navraj Dhillon, Chief of Staff, Delhi Area, said Lt Gen Bhavnish Kumar, GOC, Delhi Area, will head the parade for the fourth time.Battalion, Shaktibaan regiment, drone shakti and robotic mules to take part in the parade for the first time, along with Ladakh Scouts,” he said. He said the Army will feature the debut of a Battle Array Formation showcasing synchronised manoeuvres alongside tanks, missile systems, drones and armoured platforms. The defence assets that will be showcased during the parade will include BrahMos, Akash missile system, Medium Range Surface-To-Air Missile (MRSAM) system, Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), Dhanush artillery gun, Shaktiban and a static display of some drones.The parade will also see the debut of the Shaktiban Regiment, which has been set up in the artillery. The newly-raised regiment will be equipped with a drone, counter-drone and loiter munition. Eighteen marching contingents and 13 bands will take part in the parade.Akash weapon system and MRSAM system are being fielded in this year's parade. Universal Rocket Launcher System URLS 'Suryastra', which can carry out surface-to-surface strikes up to 300 km, is being showcased for the first time in the parade, Maj Gen Dhillon said.As European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be the chief guests, a small EU contingent, comprising an officer of the colonel rank, will lead the delegation. Following him in their contingent will be four flag-bearers.A senior military official said women’s participation is also in big numbers. CRPF’s Assistant Commandant Simran Bala will be the first woman officer to lead an all-male contingent at the parade.Captain Samira, a fourth-generation army officer, is the commander of an Army tableau depicting the success of Op Sindoor. She told TOI the tableau will display the indigenously developed military assets and weapon systems used during the Pakistan conflict and will also highlight Atmanirbhar Bharat.DRDO will showcase some of its path-breaking innovations for national security during the parade. Apart from displaying long-range anti-ship hypersonic missile (LR-AShM), DRDO will have a tableau 'naval technologies for combat submarines'.A formation flying named “Operation Sindoor” comprising Rafale, Su-30, Jaguar and MiG-29 combat jets will feature in the IAF's R-Day flypast that will serve as a powerful symbol of the dominance it established during the four-day hostilities with Pakistan last May. A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighters, nine helicopters and four transport planes, will be part of the flypast.A total of 30 tableaux to roll down Kartavya Path and 150 years of Vande Mataram will be the theme of the parade.","A rare contingent of “animal soldiers’ will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path.

The art of listening in a noisy world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-listening-in-a-noisy-world/articleshow/127273399.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I was at the wedding ceremony of a relative. One of those rare weddings with an early morning muhurtham , where brunch is still an hour away. Relatives who otherwise communicate only through forwarded messages on WhatsApp, slowly formed a circle. There was genuine warmth, laughter and enquiries . Then a teenager murmured an alert, almost like a warning: “Manju aunty.” Half the teenagers vanished with remarkable coordination. Manju aunty is, by all accounts, a loving and well-meaning person. The problem is volume—of words. Excessive talking would be an understatement. It is as though God, while assembling her, forgot to install a filter between thought and speech. She joined the circle, entirely unmindful of the sudden stillness. Her eyes landed on a teenage girl who had not escaped in time. Turning to the girl’s mother, she asked loudly, “Did you forget to feed her? Why is she so thin? Does she think this is some fashion?” Without waiting for an answer, she launched into how well she had fed her own daughter—and how that, naturally, led to a smooth ‘ normal delivery’ . The women who had undergone caesarean sections shifted uncomfortably, eyes lowered, dignity bruised in silence . Her gaze then fell on a Class IV boy and asked his rank in class. When the boy replied there was no ranking system anymore, she smiled indulgently and explained how her son always stood first though, thanks to her strict control. As her words poured out, relentless as autumn leaves falling from a tree, the gathering began to dissolve. Someone urgently needed the restroom. Someone else had to check on their child. A phone rang. Soon, only Manju aunty remained, speaking uninterrupted, and an elderly grandmother who could not hear a word anyway. We have all met Manju aunties in our lives. People who love to talk. When they call you, you immediately panic. If you pick up, your next 20 minutes is gone. If you don’t, you will have to hear about the habit of not answering calls the next time you meet. One thing often common among such persistent speakers is judgement. An unspoken “I know better” . What they lose—without realising it—is the chance to learn. Listening is not merely waiting for one’s turn to speak; it is an act of humility. Wisdom often arrives softly. It does not shout to be heard. Silence, contrary to popular belief, is not emptiness. It is strategy. The silent observer learns far more about the one who speaks without pause than the speaker ever learns about the listener. That is why Plato observed, “Wise men speak when they have something to say; fools speak because they have to say something.” The world today celebrates constant expression—opinions aired instantly; reactions broadcast without reflection. Yet the power lies not in saying everything, but in knowing what deserves to be said. Thiruvalluvar captured this with disarming simplicity: “Solluga sollir payanuḍaiya; Sollarka Sollil payanillach chol.” If speak you will, speak words that are fruitful; If speak you will, speak never fruitless words. The Kural does not glorify silence blindly. It demands responsibility from speech. Words must justify themselves. If they wound, belittle, inflate ego, or merely fill space, silence would have served better.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the bench, said that the Bombay high court erred in quashing its decision of declaring the account ""fraud.""Goyal was arrested by ED in Sept 2023 on charges of laundering money and siphoning off loans worth Rs 538.6 crore extended to Jet Airways.Goyal's counsel submitted that the HC order was on the basis of concession given by the bank and it couldn't be challenged by it in SC. The lawyer was referring to para 10 of the HC judgment that said, ""At this stage stage, Dr Chandrachud has stated on instructions that the Respondent No 1 - Bank - shall not act in furtherance of the earlier classification of the petitioner's account as ""fraud"" and / or the impugned show cause notice dated 1st July, 2025. The statement is accepted.""But the bench said that allegation was very serious and it would ""like to monitor the proceedings"" to find out where the ""money had been parked"". The court, after a brief hearing, deferred the proceedings on request of the solicitor general. The HC had quashed the show cause notice issued by the bank to Goyal on July 1, 2025 but granted the bank liberty to issue a fresh show cause notice.","The court should not be lenient towards them, observed a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi.

SC sends notice on non-recruitment of ‘Rajasthani’ teachers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-sends-notice-on-non-recruitment-of-rajasthani-teachers/articleshow/117136519.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Constitution, Right to Education Act and National Education Policy , mandates imparting primary education to linguistic minorities in their mother tongues, but the governments recruit teachers only in 22 scheduled languages thus depriving instruction in mother tongues to crores of students who speak over 100 languages, which have written heritage.This issue was raised by a scholar in “Rajasthani’ language, which is spoken by more than four crore people, before the Supreme Court on Friday. Appearing for Padam Mehta, senior advocate Manish Singhvi told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta that the mandate of the Constitution and other statutes are being violated as no person proficient in ‘Rajasthani’ is recruited to teach primary or elementary school students.Not questioning inclusion of other languages as part of the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET), Singhvi said ‘Rajasthani’, spoken by over four crore people, has been excluded from REET but languages like Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi and Urdu, which are spoken by a very small population in the state, have been included in REET. The bench entertained the petition and sought response from the state govt.The petitioner said, “If teachers speaking ‘Rajasthani’ are not recruited imparting of education in ‘Mother Tongue’ loses significance” and expressed concern that non-recruitment of teachers in “Rajasthani’ language would violate an important right of the elementary and primary school children to be taught in their mother tongue.Apart from the 22 scheduled languages, there are 23 other languages with millions of speakers including Awadhi, Bagri, Bhili, Bhojpuri, Chhattisgarhi, Deccani, Kangri, Garhwali, Haryanvi, Ho, Kanauji, Khandeshi, Kumaoni, Kurux, Lamani, Magahi, Malvi, Marwari, Meitei, Mundari, Nimadi, Sadari and Tulu, according to Union ministry of educationAs per the ministry, the concept of ‘mother tongue’ is defined by the Census as the language spoken in childhood by the person's mother to the person. If the mother died in infancy, the language mainly spoken in the person’s home in childhood will be the mother tongue.The petitioner said section-29(2) (f) of RTE Act categorically states that while preparation of curriculum and evaluation procedure for elementary education, the medium of instructions as far as practical should be in the child's mother tongue.The National Education Policy also states that the medium of instructions for the children at least till Grade-V or preferably till Grade-VIII will be the mother tongue/local language wherever possible, he said, adding the Rajasthan Assembly more than two decades ago had passed a resolution for inclusion of ‘Rajasthani’ in Eighth Schedule.","The Constitution, Right to Education Act and National Education Policy mandates imparting primary education to linguistic minorities in their mother tongues. But the governments recruit teachers only in 22 scheduled languages.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“The enterprise, not backed by ethical means, will fall

Though many may stand to uphold it”

As I stood before a sea of ambitious faces at the Young Entrepreneur School (YES) conclave, I witnessed the burning flame of aspiration in their eyes. Each participant carried dreams of building the next Amazon, Google, Meta or Apple – giants that began as mere saplings, nourished by nothing but their founders' unwavering vision.These dreamers embodied three distinct phases of the entrepreneurial odyssey.The first wave consisted of those grappling with the age-old dilemma: to jump or not. Their entrepreneurial spirit yearned to break free but family and friends often played devil's advocate.The second group had already taken the plunge, securing partners and promoters but found themselves navigating treacherous waters. Some quietly cast wistful glances at their ‘settled’ peers, drawing bittersweet comparisons.The third category had ventured too deep to turn back, like ancient armies burning bridges behind them to eliminate retreat as an option. Their journey was testament to entrepreneurship 's essence of risk-taking, creativity and opportunity-seeking in uncharted territories.I shared two inspiring tales that capture the essence of entrepreneurial resilience. The first was of a humble dhoti seller who began by carrying his wares on his head. Each day, he faced brutal rejection from the first shop in the bazaar, yet he persisted. When questioned, he revealed that though he was dismissed each day, seeing the owner’s face before he started his venture turned out to be his good luck charm! This simple but intelligent stance transformed his tormentor into an ally, laying the foundation for what would become an apparel empire.The second story featured a sweet shop owner who faced an annual exodus of master chefs during Diwali season. Rather than following the conventional path of higher pay or competitive poaching, he standardised his processes to such perfection that anyone could replicate his sweets' excellence, while keeping the ingredients secret. This innovative solution eliminated his dependency on expensive expertise.These modern tales of enterprise echo the ancient wisdom of Thiruvalluvar, who dedicated an entire chapter to entrepreneurial guidance - Therindhu Vinayaadal (Look before you leap) – which offers timeless principles, from understanding profit mechanisms to choosing knowledgeable partners.His principles, though centuries old, resonate deeply with modern business wisdom.Thiruvalluvar's wisdom extends beyond mere profit-making. He warns against rushing into ventures without proper feasibility studies and advocates for careful planning before challenging competitors. Perhaps most remarkably, he stresses the importance of authentic employee recognition, cautioning against hollow praise and undeserved bonuses – a principle that modern management studies are fully embracing only now.From Enron to Satyam, each fallen giant serves as a testament to Thiruvalluvar's ancient warning about the perils of unethical business practices.The entrepreneurial journey remains one of life's most challenging battlegrounds. True victory, however, lies in choosing the path of ethics, even when it means taking the longer, harder road. For it is in this choice that entrepreneurs transform from mere businesspeople into true leaders who leave lasting legacies of positive change.The young entrepreneurs before me represented not just India's economic future, but its moral compass in commerce. As they embark on their respective journeys, their commitment to ethical business practices will be their guiding star through the storms of entrepreneurship.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117122666,imgsize-40842,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/117122666.jpg"
SC stays GST action against e-gaming companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-gst-action-against-e-gaming-companies/articleshow/117134558.cms,"GST

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday stayed Goods and Services Tax (GST) proceedings against 49 online gaming companies over retrospective demand notices issued to them, a decision that pushed up the share price of some of the listed entities.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan passed the interim order, while posting the matter for further hearing to March 18.Market players saw the SC stay as a relief for online gaming companies, which had received show-cause notices alleging GST evasion of Rs 1.1 lakh crore. As the GST Act allows government to impose a penalty of up to 100 per cent of the tax demand, the total liability could potentially be Rs 2.3 lakh crore.In October 2023, the GST Council had imposed a 28% tax on the face value of online gaming bets, which authorities interpreted as a clarification and raised tax demand for the period preceding the decision. Various online gaming companies have challenged the 'retrospective' GST notices.The gaming industry has been advocating for the tax to be calculated on gross gaming revenue (GGR) rather than the face value of bets. Before the decision, the companies were levying 18% tax on the platform fees or GGR.""While the GST resolution may take time, we remain optimistic that a fair resolution will not only provide the much-needed clarity but also accelerate innovation, job creation, and investor confidence. This clarity is crucial for many companies preparing to go public, positioning the Indian gaming ecosystem for global leadership that India deserves. With the right policies in place, India is poised to seize this once-in-a-millennium opportunity to lead the global consumer tech landscape,"" said Saumya Rathore, co-founder of Winzo, one of the petitioners along with entities, such as Gameskraft, Games24x7. Several petitions pending in High Courts have also transferred to the apex court.In Sept 2023, SC stayed a Karnataka High Court judgment, quashing a GST notice against Gameskraft for alleged evasion of Rs 21,000 crore. The powerful gaming lobby has been seeking a reversal of the GST Council decision , arguing that it will hurt the industry. In Oct 2023, some states had sought a review after six months, but the GST Council had not discussed the matter, amid numbers showing that the bleak picture painted by the gaming companies was not true.On a day when sensex fell 0.3% or 231 points, casino operator Delta Corp gained 4.9% to close at Rs 118.9. Similarly, OnMobile stocks closed 0.6% stronger, while Nazara Tech, whose shares gained 8.5% after the SC stay, closed 3.3% lower.","Market players saw the SC stay as a relief for online gaming companies, which had received show-cause notices alleging GST evasion of Rs 1.1 lakh crore.

(File photo)

NEW DELHI: Two major national political parties have continued occupying govt bungalows in Lutyens’ Delhi for their party offices, even years after building their own headquarters or getting land for the purpose, flouting norms.Though the policy specifies that three years after getting land for office or completing construction, political parties must vacate bungalows, BJP and Congress occupy two bungalows each.Sources said it was in 2018 when the directorate of estates under the housing and urban affairs ministry had sent notices to Congress to vacate four govt accommodations it had occupied. The party has so far vacated two such accommodations.“The rule applies to all political parties. Now, BJP occupies two govt bungalows on Ashoka Road and Pandit Pant Marg, and Congress has two bungalows under its occupation on Akbar Road and Raisina Road. There is no indication of when these parties will vacate the bungalows. At present, around half a dozen bungalows are occupied by political parties,” a source said.As per the policy for allotment of land to national political parties of 2012, parties that occupy bungalow(s) or suite(s) in the Vithalbhai Patel House for their office, should vacate them immediately on the construction of office building on the plot allotted to them or within three years from taking possession of the vacant plot.The land and development office (L&DO), under the housing ministry, had allotted BJP two plots on the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and the party inaugurated its office in Feb 2018. Nearly five years after that, BJP continues occupying bungalows at 11, Ashoka Road and 14, Pandit Pant Marg.In the case of Congress, though the govt had allotted it land on Kotla Road, adjacent to the DDU Marg in 2010, it recently completed the construction of its office after getting several extensions. The new party headquarters will be inaugurated on Jan 15. Sources said Congress is unlikely to vacate the two bungalows, which house its national and youth wing offices, considering that BJP has also not done so.In June 2022, in response to questions on enforcing parties to vacate bungalows, then housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri had told reporters, “It (evictions of political parties) is in process. It will involve all political parties. It’s in the pipeline.”Officials said sending any fresh notice to political parties to vacate bungalows even after building a new office is a “sensitive” issue.","BJP occupies two govt bungalows on Ashoka Road and Pandit Pant Marg.

May make mistakes, but won’t do so with bad intentions: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Modi said the decision of US authorities to cancel his visa was taken on the basis of ""falsehoods"" peddled by some people and it rankled with him because it was an insult to a democratically elected govt and the country as a whole.""Visiting the US as a private citizen was not material to me. But I was the chief minister, heading a democratically elected govt and this was an insult to a democratically elected govt and the country. It troubled me. Some people peddled falsehoods..."" Modi said during a conversation with Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of online trading platform Zerodha, in a podcast.""But when I addressed a press conference...I said I can visualise a day when people will be queuing up for Indian visas. I said that in 2005... I can clearly see that India's time has come,"" he said in his debut on a podcast, a medium politicians across the world are banking on to get their message across.The US cancelled the visa of Modi on the basis of allegations about his complicity in the communal riots that erupted after 59 kar sevaks on Sabarmati Express were burnt to death in Godhra. An SC-monitored probe cleared Modi of the charge.Modi touched upon the Godhra arson attack, saying he was deeply anguished by the ghastly sight but was obligated to rise above his emotions. “It was a painful sight. There were dead bodies everywhere, but I knew I am in a post where I have to rise above my emotions. I tried to keep myself together,” he said.He acknowledged that while humans could make mistakes, they should not act with harmful intentions. “When I became CM, in one of my speeches, I had said that I will leave no stone unturned in my efforts. Second, I will not do anything for myself. Third, I am a human, I may make mistakes, but I will not make mistakes with bad intentions. I made them my life’s mantras. It is natural to make mistakes, after all I am a human, I am not God, but will not do wrong intentionally,” he said.The free-wheeling conversation covered Modi’s personality as well as important episodes through his career, with Kamath prodding the PM on whether he was a risk-taker, and on parallels, if any, between politics and entrepreneurship, and high entry barrier facing those wishing to join politics.Modi described himself as a risk-taker, emphasising that he could afford to take more risks because he “does not have anything personal at stake”. “My risk-taking ability is several times more and I have not exhausted my risk-taking capacity yet,” he said. At another point, Modi said while he was not immune to anxieties, he could handle them better. “Definitely, such situations arise... but everyone has a different style and capacity to face such situations,” he said.Asked if he factored in worst-case scenarios while taking important calls, Modi said, “I have never thought about life or death, those who lead calculated lives may feel so. When I became CM, I was surprised how I ended up there because that was not the trajectory I had chosen.” He recalled his desire to become a sanyasi and a monk with Ramakrishna Mission as well as his wanderings in the Himalayas and in the salt deserts of Kutch. “My background is such that my mother would have distributed sweets in the entire locality if I had become a teacher,” he said.","PM Narendra Modi made his debut on a podcast, a medium politicians across the world are banking on to get their message across.

Delhi elections: Why Arvind Kejriwal should be wary of Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-why-arvind-kejriwal-should-be-wary-of-congress/articleshow/117123921.cms,"Poll Do You Believe the Upcoming Elections Will Witness a Shift in Political Power? No Yes

NEW DELHI: Can Arvind Kejriwal sweep Delhi elections once again to score a hat-trick of victories or will a determined BJP succeed in stopping the AAP juggernaut this time around with the Congress playing a ""spoiler"" for the ruling party?The AAP and the Congress had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi together but have since then gone their separate ways making the February 5 assembly elections a three-way contest. The friends-turned-rivals have openly engaged in ugly spats, much to the delight of the BJP. While the Delhi Congress leaders have unleashed all-out attack against Kejriwal, the AAP chief has accused the grand-old-party of ""secret coordination"" with the BJP.Kejriwal has asserted that Delhi assembly elections is a contest between the BJP and AAP, playing down any possible challenge from the Congress. His assessment may not be completely off the mark, given the performance of Congress in the last two assembly elections where it failed to even open its account and saw its vote share dip to under 5%.But the Congress, which is still smarting under the shock defeats it suffered in Haryana and Maharashtra last year, is going all out to make its presence felt in the Delhi elections. The party has already announced names of 50 candidates and has fielded Sandeep Dikshit, son of three time chief minister Sheila Dikshit, against Arvind Kejriwal. Reacting to Congress's candidates list, AAP claimed ""it looks as if it was finalised at the BJP office."" The Delhi Congress leaders have stepped up their attacks on AAP government and Kejriwal targeting it over issues of corruption and governance. The grand-old-party has promised welfare schemes - Pyari Didi Yojna and Jeevan Raksha Yojna - in line with the recent trends to woo people of Delhi. Congress national leadership, which was missing from action till now, is also planning to take the plunge. Reports say Rahul Gandhi will hold his first rally in Delhi next week.So, should Kejriwal completely dismiss the Congress challenge?Well, a look at the data of the last three elections shows that the rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. The AAP emerged on Delhi's political scene in 2013 winning 28 seats with a vote share of 29.49%. The Congress tally in 2013 came down to 8 seats from 43 that it won in 2008. It's vote share also dipped from 40.31% in 2008 to 24.55% in 2013. The BJP on the other hand saw a marginal dip in vote share of around 3% but gained 8 seats taking its tally from 23 to 31 seats in 2013.In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%. The BJP vote share did not change much registering a decline of just 1%. Clearly, this was an indication of Congress supporters moving towards AAP in a big way.In 2020, the Congress vote share declined further by almost half to 4.26%. However, this time around AAP's support base remained almost the same but the BJP's vote share increased by over 6%. This signalled the strengthening of the BJP at the expense of the Congress.In terms of seats won also, AAP was way ahead of both the BJP and the Congress winning 67 and 62 seats out of 70 in the last two elections. This huge gap perhaps explains AAP's confidence going into the February 5 electoral battle.But Kejriwal's party, which faces the prospect of anti-incumbency after being in power for 10 years, should be wary of an improved Congress performance in the elections. If the Congress manages to better its vote share it could end up cutting into the AAP’s vote-bank which includes slum dwellers, Purvanchalis, Muslims and also residents of unauthorised colonies. Any increase in Congress's vote share may not translate into dramatic increase in party's seat share in the assembly, but would definitely make the contest in some seats difficult for the other two main contenders. Since AAP has 62 seats in the assembly, it could end up suffering more than the BJP has only 8 members at present. The saffron party could gain from the three-way division of votes.The BJP, after the 2024 Lok Sabha setback, has made an impressive electoral comeback - creating history in both Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is leading the BJP campaign, has already held two rallies unleashing a vicious attack on the AAP government. The saffron camp is confident of continuing with its winning spree.Kejriwal, who has campaigned with great success in the last two assembly elections, has also gone all out trying to woo all sections in Delhi in his bid to score a hat-trick in Delhi. He would hope that the Congress continues to remain on the fringes as in the last two elections and not end up playing a spoiler for the AAP.","The AAP and the Congress had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi together but have since gone their separate ways.

Addressing a question on social media’s impact on politics and the advice he would offer aspiring politicians, PM Modi reflected on his journey and shared a joke.Kamath asked Modi about the shift from pre-social media politics to the present, where digital platforms dominate political narratives. Modi responded with a mix of humour and wisdom, recounting a story from Ahmedabad to illustrate his approach to handling criticism. ""Some children ask me, ‘How do you feel when you are abused so much?’ I tell them a joke about an Ahemdabadi who remained calm even when verbally attacked.""Once, an Ahemdabadi was riding on his scooter and almost collided with someone from behind. The other person got angry, and they started arguing. The other person started abusing me. Ahemdabadi remained standing with his scooter. The other person kept on abusing me.

The Ahemdabadi said, ""He is just giving, but he is not taking anything, right?,"" PM Modi said.On facing abuses in the political arena, he said that he is ""okay if they are verbally abusing me"". However, he added that the foundation of the abuse must be truth and there should be no ""evil in heart"".Modi said that there is a need for sensitivity in public life, stating, ""In every aspect of life, friction exists. However, in politics, you must approach challenges with a sense of service. Without sensitivity, one cannot help people effectively.""PM Modi has been at the receiving end of constant barbs from the opposition parties, throughout various state elections as well as Lok Sabha polls.The consistent criticism mainly comes from the Congress party, which has often accused Modi of undermining democratic values and the Constitution and has referred to the PM as ""non-biological"".During the podcast PM Modi also shared his vision for a ""Viksit Bharat"" (Developed India) by 2047, where basic needs like toilets, water, and electricity are available to all, and government schemes are delivered without hindrance. Modi highlighted that AI (Aspirational India) would be the driving force behind this vision.

Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said that now his party and other MVA constituents wanted to fight the upcoming municipal and zilla parishad polls independently. Congress MLA Vijay Wadettiwar echoed the sentiment.NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar expressed displeasure over the failure of the MVA leadership to convene a meeting of constituent parties after the assembly results were declared and MVA suffered a crushing defeat. While Raut, whose party chief Uddhav Thackeray leads MVA, went so far as to say there was a question mark over the relevance of the alliance, Wadettiwar alleged a ""big conspiracy"" against his party.Wadettiwar said the ""unnecessary"" MVA delay in finalising seats cost the Congress time to campaign. ""Meetings were scheduled for 11am, but some leaders would turn up at 2pm. Discussions would drag on endlessly. And this triggers an obvious question whether these delays were part of a conspiracy, a bigger plan,"" Wadettiwar said.Raut hit back: ""Who came late for the meeting is known to Wadettiwar. And maybe, if Congress had let go of some seats in Vidarbha then these discussions would not have dragged on endlessly. Congress's central leadership did not act in time.""Even NCP (SP) MP Amol Kolhe at an internal party meeting in Mumbai is said to have targeted both Congress and Sena (UBT). ""Kolhe mentioned that Congress's broken back has not yet straightened while Sena (UBT) is yet to get up from its slumber.

As with the INDIA bloc, the relevance of which Abdullah and others like RJD politician Tejashwi Yadav questioned in light of coordination issues and the tussle between constituents AAP and Congress in the Delhi assembly election, the MVA also seems to be disintegrating with hardly any meetings happening among its members.

Do watch"".In the podcast, Kamath expressed his nervousness in Hindi, saying, ""I am sitting here in front of you and talking, I feel nervous. It's a tough conversation for me."" The Prime Minister acknowledged with a smile, responding, ""This is my first podcast, I don't know how it'll go with your audience.""Discussing his early life, the Prime Minister revealed, ""I used to wash the clothes of all my family members. Because of that, I was allowed to go to the pond.."" He also recounted inviting his friends and teachers to the chief minister's residence.""When I became the chief minister, I wanted to invite my old friends to the CM house. I invited all of them, but I didn’t enjoy it because I was trying to find my friends in them, while they were seeing me as the CM,"" the Prime Minister said.PM Modi acknowledged that whilst humans can make mistakes, they should not act with harmful intentions.""When I became the CM, in one of me speeches, I had said that I will leave no stone unturned in my efforts. Secondly, I will not do anything for myself. Third, I am a human, I may make mistakes, but I will not make mistakes with bad intentions. I made them my life's mantras. It is natural to make mistakes, after all I am a human, I am not God, but will not do wrong intentionally,"" he said.The Prime Minister recounted the February 24, 2002 Godhra incident, narrating the ordeal as a newly-elected MLA.""I became MLA for first time on 24 February, 2002. Just 3 days and a train was burnt in Godhra. I decided to hit ground zero. Officers denied citing unavailability of the helicopter. They arranged one but said that they it wasn't for VIPs. I said, I'm not a VIP, I'm a common man,"" he said.""I took a single-engine chopper of ONGC despite the risk and reached Godhra. I saw those painful scenes, I controlled my emotions as I was the CM,"" he added.He also shared an interesting exchange with Chinese President Xi Jinping from 2014.""When I became the PM in 2014, leaders from across the world make courtesy calls... Chinese President Xi also made a courtesy call in which he said that he wants to come to India. I said 'you are welcome, you must visit. He said I want to visit Gujarat, your village Vadnagar... He said 'you know why? Me and you share a special bond'... He said Chinese philosopher Hiuen Tsang resided the longest in your village and when he returned to China, he resided in my village,"" he said.During the conversation, the Prime Minister emphasised the importance of public service-oriented individuals joining politics, stating they should be driven by mission rather than personal ambition.He further emphasised that one should enter politics not out of personal ambition but with a mission.""Good people should come into politics. They should come with mission not with ambition. Mission should be above ambition,"" PM Modi said.Discussing the difference between entrepreneurship and politics, he explained that entrepreneurs focus on personal and business growth, while politicians must prioritise societal welfare through self-sacrifice.""Entrepreneur's training is to how to grow, in politics it should be how to sacrifice. There (in entrepreneurship) it is how to make your company number one. In politics it should be nation first. This is the difference,"" he said.He emphasised that political involvement extends beyond electoral participation, noting that society embraces politicians who demonstrate a genuine commitment to national interests.""Society accept nation first people. Life in politics is not easy. We have a worker called Ashok Bhatt. He lived in a small house all his life. He has been a minister. But He did not own a car. To enter politics is not necessary about contest election. The work is about winning the minds of people. To do that one has to live among them. Such people are still there in politics,"" he said.PM Modi clarified the interpretation of ""minimum government, maximum governance"". He explained that the concept focuses on enhancing governmental departmental efficiency, which led to the establishment of separate ministries for skills, cooperatives, and fisheries.The administration eliminated 40,000 compliances to streamline operations across various departments.""We often misunderstand the concept of minimum government, maximum governance. Some believe that minimum government means fewer ministers and fewer employees. However, this is not my understanding. I made different ministries for skill, cooperatives, and fisheries. When I say minimum government...my point is that we took away 40,000 compliances to increase the speed of work. Otherwise, the different departments will demand the same things. If one department has it, use it for all,"" PM Modi said during a podcast conversation with social media influencer Nikhil Kamath.""I have abolished 1,500 old laws. I have changed laws that criminalised certain things. This is my vision of minimum government and maximum governance. I am witnessing it all happen,"" he further said.Although the Prime Minister regularly hosts 'Mann Ki Baat' and appears in television interviews, this marks his initial venture into podcasting.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on the ""People by WTF"" channel.

PUNE: A 25-year-old BPO worker, Shubhada Kodare, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office, while two dozen people remained mute spectators.Shubhada was attacked by 27-year-old Krishna Satyanarayan Kanojia on Tuesday, allegedly because she refused to return money borrowed from him on false pretext. She succumbed to injuries late Tuesday at a private hospital.

About a year ago, Shubhada, of Karad in Satara, told Kanojia that she needed money to support treatment of her father. He lent her money several times adding up to Rs 4 lakh.A few months ago, she informed Kanojia that her father would be operated upon. After a few days, Kanojia, as a good gesture, visited her father.

He kept pursuing her to get his money back, but she avoided him and did not answer his calls.""Enraged, Kanojia came prepared and attacked her,"" he said.","Shubhada Kodare, 25, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office.

Students must not suffer for board’s flip-flops: SC

NEW DELHI: In a relief to a batch of students who dropped one year of study in engineering colleges to take IIT-Advanced exam after maximum attempts were increased to three, Supreme Court on Friday directed they be allowed to appear in the entrance exam which is their third attempt despite the joint admission board withdrawing its decision and restoring maximum attempts to two. JAB, through IIT-Kanpur, released the 'Eligibility Criteria' for candidates appearing for JEE-Advanced 2025 on November 5.As per the criteria, a candidate can attempt JEE (Advanced) maximum three times in three consecutive years. But only 13 days later, the decision was recalled, reviving earlier criteria of maximum two attempts.Observing that the students should not suffer because of flip flops by the board, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih said those who dropped out from their courses between Nov 5 and Nov 18, 2024, be allowed to make third attempt to get into IITs by taking JEE-Advanced.“If the students, acting on the said representation (of Nov 5), have dropped from their course with an understanding that they would be entitled to appear for the JEE exam, withdrawal of the promise on Nov 18, 2024 cannot be permitted to act to their detriment,” the SC bench observed.The court, however, made it clear that the benefit of its order would be confined to only those who dropped out of college between Nov 5 and Nov 18, 2024. SC was hearing two petitions, including one filed by 22 aspirants, challenging the reduction in number of attempts available to aspirants for JEE-Advanced from three to two.One of the petitioner students told the apex court that he dropped the first year of his BTech course at NIT Silchar after the number of attempts was increased but was left in the lurch after the decision was withdrawn, which was done in an arbitrary manner.","JAB, through IIT-Kanpur, released the 'Eligibility Criteria' for candidates appearing for JEE-Advanced 2025 on November 5.

NEW DELHI: Giving women significant autonomy to choose whether to return to their estranged husbands, Supreme Court Friday ruled that a wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband even if she refuses to comply with a court decree in favour of the man for restitution of conjugal rights .A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""Preponderance of judicial thought weighs in favour of upholding the wife's right to maintenance under Section 125 CrPC, and the mere passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights at the husband's behest and non-compliance therewith by the wife would not, by itself, be sufficient to attract the disqualification under Section 125.""Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar said whether the wife had legitimate reasons for not complying with the decree of restitution of conjugal rights would depend on the facts of each case and there could not be an omnibus ruling that refusal to go back to the matrimonial home would disentitle the woman wife of her right to maintenance.""It would depend on the facts of the individual case, and it would have to be decided, on the strength of the material and evidence available, whether the wife still had valid and sufficient reason to refuse to live with her husband, despite such a decree,"" the bench said.""In any event, a decree for restitution of conjugal rights secured by a husband coupled with non-compliance therewith by the wife would not be determinative straightaway either of her right to maintenance or the applicability of the disqualification under Section 125(4) CrPC,"" it added.Setting aside a Jharkhand high court order that had denied maintenance to a woman for refusing to join the matrimonial home despite the husband getting a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, the Supreme Court said that the facts stated by the woman in refusing to go back to her husband - his that he refusal refused to bear her her treatment expenses after abortion,, and not being allowed to use the toilet at the matrimonial home - were facts about her ill-treatment and formed cogent grounds for her reluctance to go back to him.Finding that the woman was fully dependent on her brother for survival, the SC ordered the husband to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000 to her and pay arrears of maintenance from Aug 2019 in three instalments by Dec 2025.","Supreme Court rules that a wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband even if she refuses to comply with a court decree.

The authors of the study conducted an impact evaluation of the NFSA on child stunting , nutrition and dietary diversity .The analysis done by Aditya Shrinivas, an economist with IIM Bangalore, along with two professors of geography and economics from the universities of California and Calgary, also showed that food transfer through the PDS increased daily wages and total wage income, improving the welfare of poor households, who are typically net labour suppliers. Additionally, it helped the poorest weather local climate shocks such as poor rainfall or drought.The NFSA standardised entitlement quantities and prices, mandating the provision of 5kg of staple grain per person per month at 3 per kg for rice and 2 per kg for wheat. Earlier, states had discretion over prices and quantities offered to PDS beneficiaries. The paper provides evidence on how food transfers alone can reduce child stunting in developing countries.The study selected households randomly from 30 villages across eight states which account for about 41% of India's population - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha. Households with ration cards were the focus of the study and non-eligible households, which did not get them, served as an internal control group. The shift from per-household to per-individual entitlements benefitted larger families and states with less generous entitlements had to expand the food transfer after NFSA. The authors used these variations in entitlements to measure the value of PDS transfer before and after the NFSA.While PDS only subsidises staple grains, the authors found that an increase in PDS transfers improves dietary diversity and improves the consumption of nutrient-dense foods. ""We find that PDS transfers increase the share of the food budget spent on animal proteins while decreasing the share spent on grains. The magnitude of increase in nutrient intake is large enough to explain our core finding of a reduction in stunting,"" stated the paper. The authors suggest that this could be because the decrease in out-of-pocket expenditure on staple foods frees up household food budgets for a shift of expenditure to more nutrient-dense foods.""The magnitude of this effect was largest for infants 0 to 2 years, consistent with the critical window of the first 1,000 days of life during which a child's development is highly sensitive to nutritional intake,"" stated the paper. Extensive research has shown that extreme weather events such as droughts substantially increase child stunting, particularly for agricultural households who rely on rain-fed agriculture as their source of income. ""In years with a negative rainfall shock, PDS transfers reduce stunting by 7% points, as compared to 3.2% points during a positive rainfall shock year. These results suggest that a nutrition-sensitive safety net like the PDS supports food security, making child nutrition outcomes less sensitive to local climate shocks,"" observed the authors.Moreover, food transfers can provide insurance against the rise in local food prices in response to agricultural production shocks, they added. PDS has often been criticised for not reaching the intended beneficiaries and for supplying only cereals that provide ""empty calories"". However, the study found that the expansion of PDS following the implementation of NFSA did reach the intended beneficiaries, helped improve nutrition of the poorest households and brought down child stunting.","National Food Security Act of 2013 led to reduction in child stunting in India. Food transfer through the PDS increased daily wages and total wage income, improving welfare of poor households. PDS has often been criticised for not reaching the intended beneficiaries and supplying only cereals that provide ""empty calories""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117131626,imgsize-1165426,width-400,resizemode-4/117131626.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday asked UP government not to allow a fresh flashpoint over a well adjacent to Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna & Justice Sanjay Kumar, which had earlier asked the mosque management committee to move Allahabad HC against a district court-ordered survey of the mosque, said, ""It is a public well. What is the harm if people from all faiths use its water?""However, the committee through senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi said Sambhal municipality, even after the SC-ordered status quo relating to all temple-mosque disputes and ban on surveys of mosques, had issued an advertisement terming the well 'Rishikesh well' and inviting people to take bath in its water.Appearing for UP govt, additional solicitor general K M Natraj said the situation was peaceful but the committee was attempting to vitiate the atmosphere by raising such an issue. ""The well is a public well on govt land,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday expressed reluctance to entertain a petition by Mathura's Shahi Idgah mosque management committee challenging an Allahabad High Court order for clubbing together all 15 Hindu-side suits seeking right to worship on the disputed site claiming it to be Lord Krishna's birthplace.""Why should we interfere with the order for consolidation of all suits?"" asked a bench comprising CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar even before the committee's counsel Tasneem Ahmadi could give reasons for moving Supreme Court against the August 1, 2024, order of a single judge bench of the HC.Ahmadi said the suits were dissimilar and raised myriad issues & should not have been clubbed together. ""We (SC) are examining other issues (implementation of Places of Worship Act, 1991). But consolidation is immaterial for those purposes,"" court said.""Do not try to complicate the already complicated issue. Every issue is not to be agitated, and every order is not to be challenged before SC. It is for the benefit of all that the suits are consolidated and tried together,"" the CJI-led bench said.Advocate for the Hindu side, Vishnu Shankar Jain, told the court that all the petitions have raised similar issues, at the core of which is return of the land over which a mosque was constructed by demolishing a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, symbolising his birthplace.Ahmadi contested the claim and said each suit needed to be weighed with historical events which corroborated existence of the mosque for 400 years. CJI said, ""Consolidation makes no difference. I don't understand why this is raised.""However, the bench agreed to give another chance to the committee to think about the desirability of moving SC against the single judge's order clubbing the suits. It posted further hearings in the first week of April.Justice Mayank Kumar Jain of the HC had ordered on Aug 1, ""On reading of the plaint as a whole and in a meaningful manner, perusal of the material on records, consideration of the arguments advanced by the rival parties, and settled legal propositions, I conclude that the plaints in all the suits of the plaintiffs disclose a cause of action and they do not appear to be barred by any of the provisions of the Wakf Act, Places of Worship Act, the Specific Relief Act and the Limitation Act and Civil Procedure Code.""",Supreme Court expresses reluctance to entertain a petition by Mathura's Shahi Idgah mosque management committee.

Poll What’s More Crucial for Protecting Individuals in Live-In Setups? Public Awareness and Education Legal Framework Strengthening

Accused returned every 15 days to check on decomposing body

INDORE: For over six months, a murdered woman's body lay rotting in a refrigerator in a rented room in MP's Dewas while another family lived next door, unaware of the horror just a few feet away.The grisly secret was uncovered on Friday and police arrested a suspect, Sanjay Patidar, within hours. The victim was identified as his live-in partner, Pinky alias Pratibha Prajapati.The two-storey house in Vrindavan Dham is owned by businessman Dhirendra Shrivastava, who has been in Dubai for the past six months. The ground floor has a room, kitchen and toilet to the right and two bedrooms and a hall on the left, both sides separated by a staircase leading to the upper floor that is retained by Shrivastava.In July 2024, Balveer Rajput, a resident of Ingoria in Ujjain, took the ground floor on rent, ASP Jaiveer Bhadoria said. He, however, could not use two of the rooms that were locked up by the previous tenant, Patidar.""Patidar vacated in June 2024 but left behind some belongings, including the refrigerator, in two rooms. He kept assuring the landlord that he was going to return or take away his belongings but kept delaying it,"" SP Puneet Gehlot told TOI.Balveer requested the landlord to be allowed to use the other rooms for his family, which includes his wife and two children, aged 10 and 11. Shrivastava agreed.On Thursday, Balveer broke the lock and found the refrigerator running. Irritated by the previous tenant's ""carelessness"" and believing that he had finally found the reason for his inordinately high electricity bills, he switched it off and thought he would clear out the rest of the stuff in the morning.By Friday morning, an unbearable stench filled the locality. Neighbours complained. Some called the police.The cops opened the refrigerator and a decomposed body fell out. It was wrapped in a bedsheet. Police began questioning neighbours, leading to identification of their prime suspect, Sanjay Patidar.Neighbours confirmed that a woman lived with him but had not been seen since March 2024. Patidar had told them that she had gone to her parental home.Police went looking for Patidar and arrested him. During interrogation, he identified the victim as Pratibha, his live-in partner for five years, three of which were in Ujjain.Patidar has told police that he is married and has two children but Pratibha had been pressuring him for marriage, which left him angry and frustrated. The day he killed her, he first sat her down and tried to break up with her, but she was adamant on marriage, say police.He then strangled her with the help of his friend, Vinod Dave, stuffed her body into the fridge, cranked it up to the coldest setting, locked the room and fled, say police.Police have learnt that Vinod is imprisoned in Rajasthan's Tonk district for a separate crime. They are coordinating with Rajasthan police to question him.Forensic experts have collected evidence from the crime scene, and a panel of doctors conducted the post-mortem examination.Patidar said he used to return to the house every 15 days to check the decomposing body, say police. He had paid two months' rent and told the landlord that Pratibha's father had suffered a heart attack and they would again move into the house once she returned. Locals have told police that Pratibha was very social and ran a bangles business from the house.","The grisly secret was uncovered on Friday and police arrested a suspect, Sanjay Patidar, within hours.

MEERUT: A family of five - a man who worked as a mason, his wife and three daughters aged 8, 4 and 1 - were wiped out in a chilling mass murder at a rented house in a congested neighbourhood in UP's Meerut.Police said Moin, 40, was found dead tied to a cot and the bodies of his wife Asma, 36, and daughters Afsa, Aziza and Adiba were stuffed in a bed box in a locked house at Sohail Garden in Lisadi Gate on Thursday. All five were attacked with heavy objects, police added. The woman's brother said there could be ""property dispute and involvement of stepbrothers"".What has surprised police the most is the site of the murders - one of Meerut's most crowded areas, with houses built closely together. Neighbours reportedly did not sense anything unusual, hear any commotion or screams for help.SSP (Meerut) Vipin Tada said, ""It is possible the bodies were packed with clothes and sacks with an intention to transport them to some other area to be dumped. Otherwise, there is no reason why a killer would take the pain of wrapping or concealing the bodies. Even the electricity in the house was disconnected. The victims were seen alive on Wednesday morning.""The killings came to light on Thursday evening after relatives were unable to contact them, forcing the neighbours to break into the ransacked house. A murder case has been registered against three persons. Police said they have detained two, while one is absconding. The postmortem report is also awaited.","Family of five - a man who worked as a mason, his wife and three daughters aged 8, 4 and 1 - were wiped out in a chilling mass murder.

Dhruv copters to stay grounded till Gujarat crash cause identified,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhruv-copters-to-stay-grounded-till-gujarat-crash-cause-identified/articleshow/117131136.cms,"Photo/ANI

NEW DELHI:All operators of the `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) have been told by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) that the flying of the indigenous twin-engine choppers should remain suspended till the “root cause” that led to the Jan 5 crash at Porbandar is established.The preliminary analysis of the data retrieved from the FDR (flight data recorder) and CVR (cockpit voice recorder) of the ill-fated Coast Guard chopper has shown that the pilots “lost control three to four seconds” before the crash, an official told TOI.The ALH Mark-III , inducted from the HAL in June 2021, had completed a 90-minute training sortie, with the crew undertaking “running change” for the next sortie. The 5.5-tonne chopper was hovering at 200-feet when it “failed to respond to the pilots’ control inputs” and then nose-dived into the ground and burst into flames.The two pilots, Commandant Saurabh and deputy commandant S K Yadav, and air crew diver Manoj Pradhan Navik, were killed in the crash. The Coast Guard had lost another two pilots and an aircrew diver when their ALH had also crashed into the Arabian Sea during a medical evacuation operation from Porbandar in Sept last year.The armed forces have temporarily grounded all their 330 ALHs for safety checks after Sunday’s crash, as was first reported by TOI. The entire ALH fleet had also been grounded two-three times for systematic technical checks in 2023 after four major crashes. “There have also been some cases of power loss and failure of gear boxes reported in the ALHs in recent months,” another officer said.This troubling safety record has led to calls for a comprehensive investigation, with independent experts in the committee, into the several issues plaguing the helicopters. “These groundings of ALHs, which are the workhorses of the armed forces, are happening far too often. It adversely impacts day-to-day operations,” an experienced helicopter pilot said.“Nothing should be brushed under the carpet now. HAL should resolve all problems,” he added. HAL, in turn, said it “remains committed to the fast-track determination of the root cause of the latest crash and ensuring an early resumption of safe flying operations”.“An expert HAL team is at Porbandar examining all the evidence, while a Coast Guard board of inquiry is also underway. The way forward will be decided soon,” an official said.After the crashes in 2023, the HAL had undertaken safety technical upgrades after cases of design and metallurgical flaws, including “failure of the collective”, which controls the power to the rotors and back, were reported in the multi-mission choppers, as reported by TOI earlier.",All operators of the `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) have been told by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) that the flying of the indigenous twin-engine choppers should remain suspended.

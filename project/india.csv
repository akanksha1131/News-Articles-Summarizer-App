We will commemorate the one year of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir, and the foundation stone will be laid in Berhampur.""Earlier, TMC MLA Humayun Kabir had made comments regarding the Babri Masjid, calling it a deeply emotional issue for Muslims.""The Babri Masjid was a sentimental issue for Muslims. It was built by Babur, and we all know that in 1992, the Babri Masjid was demolished. It's been 30 years, and the Babri Masjid hasn't been rebuilt yet.

Written to Inter-Parliamentary Union against this continued gender harassment & intimidation yet again,"" she posted on X.The incident happened between them during a debate on 75 years of the Indian Constitution, where Moitra's comments regarding judge B H Loya's death sparked controversy in the Lok Sabha.“Honourable Defence Minister in a speech this ,morning mentioned the courage of the late justice HR Khanna to dissent in 1976. May I remind everyone, Justice HR Khanna lived for 32 years after 1976 under a largely Congress regime. Long enough to write his autobiography which the minister quoted from. Unlike poor Justice Loya, who is resting in peace long before his time,” Moitra said.Rijiju responded by stating she had raised a matter already settled by the Supreme Court and indicated about potential parliamentary consequences.""We will take appropriate parliamentary action. You cannot escape. You are setting a very wrong precedent,"" said Rijuju.The session was then adjourned briefly for two times, resuming only after Speaker Om Birla requested Moitra to verify her statements.

Rijiju called Moitra's comments as concerning, warning that such behaviour could set an unwanted precedent.Following the adjournments, TMC's Saugata Roy and Congress's K C Venugopal objected to Rijiju's language, highlighting that the Speaker holds authority in the Lok Sabha. They suggested proper parliamentary procedures should have been followed if there were concerns about Moitra's speech.Venugopal addressed Birla and said that while the minister should maintain order, he instead intimidated a female member. He requested either an apology or removal of Rijiju's remarks.","Mahua Moitra accuses Parliamentary Affairs minister Kiren Rijijuju of threatening her in the Lok Sabha.

NHAI to roll out route patrolling vehicles for quicker aid & maintenance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-to-roll-out-route-patrolling-vehicles-for-quicker-aid-maintenance/articleshow/116304712.cms,"NHAI

NEW DELHI: In its bid to improve highway patrol, NHAI on Friday issued a fresh guideline for Route Patrolling Vehicles (RPVs) branded as “Rajmarg Saathi”, which will be equipped with advanced tools to reduce traffic disruption and better maintenance. These vehicles will be deployed on every 50 km section for dealing with emergency incidents and for quick maintenance.An NHAI spokesperson said that in the existing RPVs, the rear space is open for keeping instruments and equipment to support in case of emergency situations. “However, due to open space, the operators were not able to keep these equipment in a well organised manner, which at times lead to delay in taking prompt action. In order to overcome such a situation, the rear or trunk of RPV has now been replaced by a closed cabinet with dedicated space for different equipment and inventory. The shelves have been created to provide quick and easy access to different equipment during the emergency situations and is a significant upgrade from the earlier RPVs,” he added.These vehicles will also have an advanced feature of dashboard cameras equipped with ‘ AI video analytics ’ to capture and identify cracks and potholes. These will also capture details such as vehicles, pedestrians, road signs, and other infrastructure assets. “The data and video footage including road distresses shall be collected on a weekly basis by NHAI and this road distresses data shall be integrated with NHAI One application for more efficient maintenance of roads,” the official added.Officials said the manpower deployed in these vehicles will be properly trained to use the tolls. To ensure service fitness of the vehicle, the RPV will be replaced with a new RPV, once it exceeds a run of 3,00,000 km or has been in operation for three years.“Since our RPVs are always on the routes (in every 8 hours shift) they can be the first ones to reach any spot or find deficiencies for quick action. The new guidelines help better maintenance of highway stretches and minimise disruption,” said an NHAI official.", Route Patrolling Vehicles (RPVs) branded as ‘Rajmarg Saathi’ will be equipped with advanced tools to reduce traffic disruption and better maintenance.

The fame paradox,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-fame-paradox/articleshow/116287259.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Thondrir pugazhodu thondruga; agdillaar





Thondralin thondramai nandru.

If you walk the stage, appear adorned with glory’s grace;





If not, it is better not to appear before the audience.

Poet Kaviyarasu Kannadasan once attended a cultural function at a college. The students presented their poems before him, after which Kannadasan took the stage and recited his own, which were met with thunderous applause. When the clamour subsided, Kannadasan revealed a secret. Before the event, he had swapped his poem with a student’s. What the audience wildly appreciated as his creation was, in fact, the work of an unassuming student. He left them with a profound question:A similar incident unfolded a few years ago at the New York subway. A violinist played for 45 minutes, earning just $30 from passersby. He was Joshua Bell, one of the world’s most celebrated musicians, performing with a 3.5-million-dollar violin. Days earlier, he had performed to a packed Boston theatre, with tickets sold at a premium. The Washington Post orchestrated this experiment to demonstrate how extraordinary talent often goes unrecognised in mundane settings.In our lives, too, artists are often dismissed or disrespected. Consider theplayers at weddings, tirelessly serenading the crowd. They arrive at the wedding halls at the wee hours and play through the ceremony, as guests rush for food. Recently, at one such gathering, a singer with a mellifluous voice sang some of Ilaiyaraaja’s timeless classics —and. After each song, he glanced at the audience, searching for applause but his soulful music dissolved among the chatter of guests eager for. I walked up to him and praised his talent. He did not utter a single word but nodded his head. Did I see a tear quickly wiped by a wink, as he moved to the next song?As elusive as it is, fame may also be a path paved with struggles for some, thrust upon some without merit, and withheld from countless talented souls. I was curious about what Valluvar had said about being famous. One of the couplets under the chapter titled ‘Fame’ intrigued me:At first glance, this couplet seems harsh. Does Valluvar decree that one must already possess fame before facing an audience? How does one attain glory without first enduring the toil of obscurity? History brims with examples of artists who never lived to see their genius celebrated — Van Gogh, who never sold a painting in his lifetime, and Emily Dickinson, whose poetry lay unpublished when she was alive.Some scholars interpret the couplet as a call to be born with fame or not at all. But this misreads Valluvar, who championed equality at birth. Upon deeper reflection, I realised Valluvar wasn’t speaking about artists yearning for recognition, but those in positions of power — politicians and people in high positions — who appear before the public. The common man looks up to them. Valluvar, through this couplet, warns such people: ‘When you are appearing before the people, you better stand tall with deeds of kindness and acts demonstrating ethics.’This understanding is liberating. For the artist, the pursuit of fame need not overshadow the sanctity of their craft. The journey of creation, with its struggles and triumphs, is itself a testament to the indomitable human spirit. Even if fame remains elusive, the artist’s path leaves an indelible mark.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116287226,imgsize-72358,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/116287226.jpg"
Telangana's Congress govt indulging in publicity stunt to deflect blame for stampede: Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telanganas-congress-govt-indulging-in-publicity-stunt-to-deflect-blame-for-stampede-centre/articleshow/116301642.cms,"(File photo)

HYDERABAD: The Centre slammed Allu Arjun's arrest on Friday saying the Congress govt in Telangana was ""indulging in publicity stunts "" by arresting the national award-winning actor to deflect the blame for the stampede outside Sandhya Theatre on Dec 4 which claimed the life of a woman. However, CM A Revanth Reddy justified the action saying there are no separate laws for film stars and politicians.Backing the actor, Union I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the stampede was a clear case of poor arrangements by the state and local administration. ""Congress has no respect for the creative industry and the arrest of Allu Arjun proves it yet again,"" he said on X, adding that Telangana govt should assist those affected by the stampede and punish those making the arrangements on Dec 4 ""instead of continuously attacking film personalities"".Talking to media, the CM stressed that the law was equal for all, recalling that even Bollywood stars like Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan were arrested in various cases. ""Who is responsible for the death of the woman in the stampede? The film was made with huge investment by the producers to make money and not for any social cause,"" Revanth said.Admitting that his govt had given permission for the show on Dec 4, the CM said: ""Had the film hero come in a car and watched the movie silently, there would have been no issue. But he came out of his car and waved to the crowds. Police and security could not control the crowds, which led to the unfortunate incident . That's why the film hero was booked."" The CM said police followed the due procedure in booking and arresting Allu Arjun, going to his house nine days after the stampede.Revanth said he was monitoring the developments after the stampede. ""If the film hero was not booked, people would be asking govt why there is special treatment for Allu Arjun,"" he said, adding that he knew the actor very well and his father-in-law Chandrasekhar Reddy is a Congress neta who is also his relative. Allu Arjun's uncle, mega star Chiranjeevi, is also a Congress leader, the CM added.","Congress govt in Telangana was ""indulging in publicity stunts "" by arresting Allu Arjun to deflect the blame for the stampede outside Sandhya Theatre on Dec 4.

win?

Indian chess prodigy D Gukesh, 18, secured the World Chess Championship title on Thursday when he beat reigning champion Ding Liren in Singapore. He achieved this victory by clinching the last and final classical game.Announcing the development, the International Chess Federation (FIDE) announced on X that Gukesh had become ""the YOUNGEST WORLD CHAMPION in history"". This followed Ding's resignation in a gripping endgame that many anticipated would conclude in a draw.Overcome with emotion, Gukesh burst into tears , burying his face in his hands upon realising his new title.Liren, 32, slumped over the table after noticing a critical endgame blunder. This mistake provided Gukesh with the winning opportunity.The viewing rooms near the playing arena erupted in cheers. Jubilant fans, comprising many Indians who had travelled to witness the match and local Singaporeans of Indian descent, celebrated Gukesh's victory.Gukesh's win surpasses the previous record held by Russia's Garry Kasparov, who claimed the title at 22. Gukesh has achieved this feat at the age of 18.He has become the second Indian to hold the World Chess Championship title, following in the footsteps of five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand Gukesh's victory in game 14 resulted in a final score of 7.5 against Ding's 6.5. This cemented his exceptional rise to chess stardom. He had already become the youngest-ever challenger for the world championship.Each classical game victory in the $2.5 million World Chess Championship 2024 was worth $200,000 (approximately Rs 1.69 crore). By winning three games, Gukesh pocketed $600,000 (approx Rs 5.07 crore) outrightly. Liren, by winning two games, won $400,000 (approx Rs 3.38 crore).The remaining $1.5 million in prize money will be split equally between the two opponents.That would take Gukesh's prize money to $1.35 million (approx Rs 11.45 crore) and $1.15 million (approx Rs 9.75 crore) for Liren.","Gukesh's win surpasses the previous record held by Russia's Garry Kasparov, who claimed the title at 22.

"Atul Subhash Suicide Case: 'Left Jaunpur house on motorbike': Unable to find Bengaluru techie's in-laws, cops paste notice at their house",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/left-jaunpur-house-on-motorbike-unable-to-find-bengaluru-techies-in-laws-cops-paste-notice-at-their-house/articleshow/116270833.cms,"VARANASI/BENGALURU: A Bengaluru police team reached UP's Jaunpur Thursday looking for the Singhania family accused of abetting the suicide of Atul Subhash, a senior AI executive at a leading automobile firm. But police met with little success as their houses were locked and phones switched off.Jaunpur Kotwali inspector Mithilesh Kumar Mishra said Atul's mother-in-law Nisha and her son Anurag had left their house on a motorbike Wednesday night. When some reporters camping there asked where they were going, Anurag replied his mother was unwell.SEE ALSO: Bengaluru techie suicide: Judge 'asked' for Rs 5 lakh to 'settle the case', says father According to neighbours, the Singhania family had moved in two months ago. Police have launched a manhunt and pasted a notice on the entrance of the house, asking the residents to appear before the investigation officer.""We are in constant touch with local police, and they are working with us to trace the suspects,"" DCP Shivakumar Gunare of Bengaluru police said. Atul, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday amid a prolonged legal battle involving divorce, child custody, and a Rs 3.3 crore demand from his estranged wife Nikita Singhania. According to the FIR filed by Atul's brother Bikas, his estranged wife and her family allegedly demanded Rs 3 crore to drop police cases against him and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to see his four-year-old son. Bengaluru police registered a case against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.His lawyer Dinesh Mishra said Thursday he was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000 and the family court in Jaunpur had ordered him in July to pay Rs 40,000 a month as maintenance for his son, which he might have found burdensome.Read more: Atul was ordered to pay nearly half his salary as maintenance for his son, says lawyer Atul left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video detailing alleged harassment by Nikita and his in-laws, and accused the family court judge of bias. However, his lawyer Mishra said the orders passed by the court were in accordance with the law.""The court did not mandate any compensation for his wife, as she was earning a sufficient income in Delhi. Atul might have found the Rs 40,000 payment steep. Nevertheless, he had the option to challenge the order by appealing to higher courts, including the high court,"" Mishra said.According to the lawyer, Atul never demonstrated violent behaviour or mood swings while appearing before the family court. ""I suspect that his wife and others might have demanded more money from him, forcing him to think that they were blackmailing or extorting him. This very thought could have driven him to take the extreme step."" Atul and Nikita met through a matrimonial site and got married on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi. In his suicide note, Atul wrote that she lived with her in-laws in Bihar's Samastipur for only two days before moving to Bengaluru.","Atul Subhash, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday.

Indian students in Canada in panic after Ottawa seeks documents afresh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-students-in-canada-in-panic-after-ottawa-seeks-docus-afresh/articleshow/116300386.cms,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab. Some were even asked to visit IRCC offices in person to verify their credentials. ""Many students are confused and worried,"" said Avinash Dasari, a student from Hyderabad studying in Ontario.Also read: Canada stops SDS, fast-track popular student permit scheme for international students In recent years, Canada has experienced a significant surge in international student enrolment, with Indian students making up a substantial part of this group. According to the ministry of external affairs, Canada hosts the largest number of Indian students, with 4.2 lakh enrolled, followed by the US with 3.3 lakh Indian students.The sudden cascade of emails left students feeling uncertain about their future. ""We chose Canada for its welcoming environment, but this feels unfair,"" said Manisha Patel, a business management student from Adilabad now in British Columbia.Also read: Why Canada suspended its popular student visa programme and its effects on Indian applicants Many students are urging IRCC to provide clearer communication and address their concerns.

""Caps and financial requirements being introduced are a clear signal. This move could also be to filter out genuine students as many change their designated learning institution and shift to one where there is no restriction on attendance so they can work in Canada,"" he added.""If students don't comply with these requests on time, it could lead to visa cancellations or future complications.

Rahul Gandhi Targets Govt & PM Modi In First Speech As Leader Of Parliament I N18V | CNBC TV18

The Nehru-Gandhi legacy and the Emergency



NEW DELHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday took the centre stage in Lok Sabha with her maiden speech in Parliament. Participating in the two-day Constitution debate, Priyanka led the Congress charge against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused the NDA government of making every effort to dismiss the Constitution in the last 10 years.In her 32-minute speech, Priyanka Gandhi was combative yet restrained, never raising her voice, as she raised the opposition's key issues including BJP's alleged attempts to change the Constitution, ""growing monopoly"" of the Adani Group, atrocities on women, incidents of violence in Sambhal and Manipur and the demand for a nationwide caste census.Priyanka's mild but effective style once again brought to fore the similarities that she share with her grandmother Indira Gandhi. When asked about her speech, Congress leader and brother Rahul Gandhi said, ""Wonderful speech ... Better than my maiden speech, let us put it like that.""Dressed in a dark blue saree, Priyanka stood up in the House after union minister Rajnath Singh and spoke with ease and clarity, just like her grandmother, drawing from her personal meetings with victims of the Unnao rape case and the Sambhal violence.The Congress leader spoke in Hindi and raised the issue of recent violence in Sambhal and Manipur, Lok Sabha results and the Constitution to corner the BJP government. Unlike brother Rahul, who is often seen speaking in an extempore manner and using theatrical tactics like using placards, images, and a Constitution copy to get attention, Priyanka stood straight in the fourth row with glasses on and spoke only from the written material.She diverted only once, to call out a member as she spoke about the alleged custodial death of Arun Valmiki in Agra in October. ""Aap hass rahe hai, lekin yeh gambhir baat hai (You are laughing but this is a serious matter),"" she said before continuing her speech.Priyanka's maiden speech was also a continuation of Rahul Gandhi's earlier speeches as the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha. Like her brother, she invoked religions -- Hinduism, Islam, Buddism, Sikhism -- to point out that conversation and debates have been part of our culture for thousands of years.Like Rahul Gandhi, she also accused the BJP of creating ""atmosphere of fear"". ""BJP cannot maintain unity, we saw it in Sambhal and Manipur. They have created an atmosphere of fear,"" Priyanka said.Earlier in his first speech as leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul had also invoked the image of Lord Shiva with the snake around his neck and accused BJP and creating an ""atmosphere of fear and violence inside the Chakravyuh"" to entrap common people re-iterated ‘Daro Mat, Darao Mat’ (Don't fear, don't create fear).Extending the same sentiment, Priyanka said, ""Today people are intimidated from speaking the truth. Be it a journalist or an opposition leader or a university professor everyone's mouth is shut. Opposition leaders are investigated by ED, CBI, IT and are sent to jail by making false allegation.""""This government has spared no one. Their media machine spreads lies and makes accusations,"" she said.Priyanka Gandhi also pointedly questioned BJP's accountability, particularly their habit of attributing issues to Jawaharlal Nehru, while delivering a sharp critique of its frequent criticism of India's first prime minister.""Our Constitution laid the foundation of economic justice, distributing land to farmers, the poor and the needy.... Whose name is often used by them (BJP) to save themselves, he (Jawaharlal Nehru) created many PSUs and institutions such as HAL, BHEL, SAIL, GAIL, ONGC, NTPC, Railways, IIT, IIM,"" she said.She emphasised that while her great-grandfather's name could be removed from textbooks, his contributions to India's independence and development remain indelible.Regarding the Emergency, she suggested the BJP should acknowledge and express regret for their missteps.""My colleague in the ruling party recounted the past, this happened, that happened... what happened in 1975. You also learn from it, you also apologise for your mistakes,"" she said.Priyanka Gandhi also issued a challenge to the BJP to conduct elections using ballot papers, suggesting this would reveal the true situation.The Congress leader criticised the prime minister's approach, stating, ""There used to be a story that the king used to go among the people in disguise to listen to criticism. Today's king is also very fond of changing his disguise... But he neither has the courage to go among the public nor to listen to criticism.""""The 'suraksha kavach' of unity is being broken. The prime minister touches his forehead to the Constitution but when there are cries for justice from Sambhal, Hathras and Manipur, there is not a wrinkle on his forehead,"" the Wayanad MP said.""It seems Prime Minister Modi hasn't understood that 'Bharat ka Samvidhan' is not 'Sangh ka Vidhan',"" Priyanka Gandhi said.",Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took the centre stage in Lok Sabha with her maiden speech in Parliament.

The incident happened during a chaotic situation as crowds gathered to see the actor at the film's premiere.The city police filed charges at Chikkadpally police station against Allu Arjun, his security personnel, and theatre management under various sections of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), following a complaint from the deceased woman's relatives.On December 11, Allu Arjun petitioned the Telangana High Court to dismiss the FIR registered against him.After the local court ordered his judicial custody on Friday, the high court granted him four weeks of interim bail and scheduled the next hearing for January 21, 2025.","Allu Arun was lodged in Manjeera block as Special Class status given by the Nampally court that remanded him earlier.

Actor's arrest unwarranted, says family who filed plaint

HYDERABAD: Actor Allu Arjun was arrested Friday from his home in Hyderabad's Jubilee Hills and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder for the death of a 39-year-old mother of two in the Dec 4 stampede at a city theatre hosting the premiere of his new film, Pushpa 2: The Rule , a blockbuster.Telangana high court granted Arjun interim bail till Jan 21 on a bond of Rs 50,000 after a local court remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days. Justice J Sridevi said it was ""unfair"" to hold the actor to account for the stampede when the film's distributors had intimated cops about his presence at the premiere.However, Chanchalguda jail authorities told TOI that the actor would not be released in the night. Amid protests by fans outside, a jail official said Arjun would be released Saturday morning as the bail order had arrived late.The family of Revathi, who died in the stampede, said Arjun was not to blame and they were ready to withdraw the complaint that led police to register a criminal case.Allu Arjun couldn't be legally held responsible for the December 4 stampede at Sandhya Theatre, in which a woman was killed, as police had been duly informed about his presence at the premiere and should have taken adequate precaution, the actor's counsels argued in a packed courtroom in Nampally on Friday.DCP (central zone) Akshansh Yadav had denied on the morning after the stampede that they received an intimation from the theatre on Dec 2. On Dec 8, ACP (Chikadpally division) L Ramesh Kumar iterated that there was ""no prior information "" about Allu Arjun being invited to the theatre.The public prosecutor sought Allu Arjun's judicial remand on the ground that despite police turning down Sandhya Theatre's request, the actor and his entourage turned up, leading to what he said was ""an uncontrollable situation"". Police also accused Allu Arjun of arriving at the theatre in a cavalcade for which there was no prior permission. ""Waving to the people from the open-top car got the crowd excited, with more people joining in and rushing into the theatre,"" the prosecutor said.The prosecution took a similar line during arguments at HC hearing of Allu Arjun's interim bail plea. Prosecutor Palle Nageswara Rao argued against any relief to the actor and requested that he be asked to file for regular bail on Dec 16.Justice J Sridevi ruled that none of the charges - negligent act leading to death and prior knowledge about the likelihood of such a death, among others - was applicable in this case as police could not present proof of having rejected the theatre's bandobast request.Allu Arjun's counsel Niranjan Reddy cited a Gujarat HC order granting ""instant relief"" to Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan when he was charged with causing a person's death in a stampede during a publicity event for his 2017 film Raees.Justice Sridevi also granted interim bail to the four co-owners of Sandhya Theatre. She asked police to continue their investigation and directed the actor to cooperate with them.The criminal case was filed against the actor, his security team and the management of Sandhya Theatre on the basis of a complaint filed by the family of the victim, Revathi. But the family said the actor's arrest was unwarranted. ""My son wanted to watch 'Pushpa 2', so I took them to the theatre. Allu Arjun was not at fault. I came to know about his arrest from a news portal,"" Revathi's husband Mogadampalli Bhaskar said. Revathi was with her nine-year-old son Sritej when police tried to disperse the swelling premiere-evening crowd jostling for a glimpse of the actor. The boy, a fan of Arjun, was seriously injured in the resultant stampede.The day of drama began around 11.30am when police arrested Allu Arjun from his Jubilee Hills residence. He was taken to Chikadpally police station, by which time hundreds of fans had assembled there. The actor's father, Allu Arvind, a film producer, and other family members trailed the police convoy.The actor waved to his fans and smiled while being taken to Gandhi Hospital later for a medical examination. At 3.30pm, Allu Arjun was produced before the ninth additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Nampally criminal court.The HC relief came moments after Allu Arjun entered Chanchalguda Central Jail, clad in a white hoodie with the film's dialogue, ""flower nahi, fire hei mein"", emblazoned on it. Late Friday, city police said, ""It is beyond our resources to provide bandobast for every event.

BHOPAL: Suicides by a businessman and his wife - Manoj and Neha Parmar - on Friday in Ashta town of MP and a six-page typed purported suicide note recovered from their home, alleging harassment and physical torture by ED officials during a search at his premises on December 5, have taken a political turn.Congress alleged Parmar was harassed as his kids supported Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra by organising a 'Gullak' (piggy bank) team.ED sources termed the deaths ""unfortunate"" and denied the charge, emphasising that the search was conducted in the presence of two independent officers (one male and the other female) of SBI. A dossier prepared by ED on Parmar termed him a ""habitual offender"" who was sentenced to seven years in jail for loan fraud in another case investigated by Astha police. Parmar was arrested and was on bail in a rape case in which the trial is underway, and faced offences of creating public nuisance, threatening public servants and damaging public property.In his suicide note - marked to PM, CJI, CM, Governor, DGP and AICC and MPCC - the Manoj alleged that his entire family was being victimised because of his association with Congress. The note ends with a prayer to Rahul Gandhi to take care of his three children.Denying the allegations, agency sources said that Parmar had personally called ED office at 12 noon on Dec 12, confirming that he would appear for recording his statement at 3.30pm. However, he didn't turn up.ED had searched four of Parmar's properties in Indore and Sehore as part of a probe into alleged money laundering linked to a 2017 FIR by CBI.Sources stressed that MP high court had in 2022 rejected Parmar's plea for quashing the CBI FIR. The HC had noted that while CBI registered a single FIR for the 18 transactions, each was considered a distinct offence, and the agency was instructed to proceed with the case.","Congress alleged Parmar was harassed as his kids supported Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra by organising a 'Gullak' (piggy bank) team.

'Allu Arjun not to blame', says husband of stampede victim



NEW DELHI: Telugu actor Allu Arjun was arrested on Friday, in connection with a stampede that occurred during the premiere of his film Pushpa 2: The Rule at Sandhya Theatre, Hyderabad. The December 4 incident led to the death of Revathi, a 39-year-old woman, and injuries to her son. Allegations of poor crowd management and negligence have since surfaced, with the actor and others facing legal action.Allu Arjun filed a petition in the Telangana high court to quash the FIR and sought a stay on all legal proceedings.Authorities criticised the theatre management for failing to make additional provisions for crowd control. “The theatre management did not make any additional provisions regarding security...though the theatre management had information about their arrival,” the police stated.The police have registered a case under sections 105 (Culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 118(1) (Voluntarily causing hurt) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) at the Chikkadpally police station based on the complaint lodged by the deceased woman's family.Besides Allu Arjun, his security team and the management of the theatre are also named. The case was registered at Chikkadpally Police Station on December 5 on a complaint by the woman's husband.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Zone) Akshansh Yadav provided a detailed account of the tragic events at the premiere of Pushpa 2: The Rule on December 13, 2024. The show was scheduled at Sandhya 70mm Theatre in Chikkadpally RTC X Road at 9:40 PM.A massive crowd had gathered to watch the movie and catch a glimpse of actor Allu Arjun, who was anticipated to visit. The theatre management, despite being aware of the actor's arrival, failed to notify the authorities or make necessary security arrangements, including a separate entry or exit for the actor and his team. Around 9:30 PM, Allu Arjun arrived at the venue with his personal security team. The crowd surged towards him, trying to enter the theatre. According to the DCP: ""His personal security team started pushing the public which further aggravated the situation as there was already a huge gathering at the theatre.""The commotion led to overcrowding in the lower balcony area. Among the victims was 35-year-old Revathi and her 13-year-old son Sri Tej, who were suffocated due to the influx of people. Police personnel on duty rescued them and performed CPR on the boy.They were immediately rushed to Durgabai Deshmukh Hospital, where doctors pronounced Revathi dead. Her son was transferred to another hospital for advanced treatment.Telangana high court granted 4 weeks interim bail to actor Allu Arjun after he was sent to 14-day judicial custody by a local court in connection with a stampede incident on Friday. The matter will come up for hearing again on January 21, 2025. The HC said that ""right to life and liberty can't be taken away just because he is an actor"", adding that it is ""apparent that there is no malafide action associated to the petitioner"".The husband of the woman who was killed in a stampede on Friday said he does not hold actor Allu Arjun responsible for the incident and is prepared to withdraw his complaint.Bhaskar clarified his stance in a statement, expressing that he does not hold Allu Arjun responsible for the tragic event. ""We only visited Sandhya Theatre because my son was eager to watch the movie. Allu Arjun is not to blame for being at the theatre that day. I am ready to withdraw my complaint. I wasn’t even informed about his arrest; I learned about it from the news while at the hospital. He has no connection to the stampede,"" Bhaskar said.","Telugu actor Allu Arjun was arrested on Friday, in connection with a stampede that occurred during the premiere of his film Pushpa 2: The Rule at Sandhya Theatre, Hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Telangana Police on Friday explicitly blamed actor Allu Arjun 's ""gesture"" for the crowd getting out of control and leading to a stampede in Hyderabad's Sandhya Theatre during the premiere of Pushpa 2 that resulted in the death of a woman and serious injuries to her son.The stampede, which occurred on December 4, claimed the life of Revathi and critically injured her 13-year-old son, Shreethej, after a massive crowd gathered at Sandhya Theatre in Hyderabad.Facing backlash for the actor's arrest, who was granted interim bail by the Telangana high court, the state police issued a release in which it dismissed allegations there weren't sufficient arrangements in place to manage the large crowd that had gathered.The Telangana police said that organisers, unlike what usually happens before any mega event, ""did not meet any officer and simply submitted the letter in the inward section"".The administration said when a heavy crowd is expected the organisers ""personally visit the police station/ ACP/ DCP office"" to seek the proper arrangement, which was not the case with Allu Arjun's event.""We receive a lot of requests for(arrangement) citing visits by some political personalities, film celebrities , religious programs etc., However, it is beyond our resources to providefor every event.

At the same time his private security started pushing people to make way for his vehicle.

According to more than a dozen informed sources who spoke to Reuters, he deliberately misled or withheld information from his aides, officials and family members.On Saturday, at a defence ministry gathering of approximately 30 army and security leaders, Assad gave false assurances about incoming Russian military support and urged the ground forces to maintain their positions, according to an anonymous commander who attended the briefing.The civilian personnel remained unaware of the situation. Assad deceived his presidential office manager by saying he was heading home after work on Saturday, when he actually proceeded to the airport, according to an insider aide.He also requested his media adviser, Buthaina Shaaban, to visit his residence to compose a speech, but upon her arrival, she found the premises empty. ""Assad didn't even make a last stand. He didn't even rally his own troops,"" said Nadim Houri, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative regional think-tank. ""He let his supporters face their own fate.""Discussions with 14 individuals familiar with his final period in power reveal a leader seeking external assistance to maintain his 24-year rule before orchestrating a covert departure from Syria early Sunday.The sources, including former presidential inner circle members, regional diplomats, security officials and senior Iranian representatives, requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information freely.Assad excluded even his younger brother, Maher, the Army's 4th armoured division commander, from his escape plans. According to three aides, Maher subsequently travelled to Russia via Iraq by helicopter.His maternal cousins, Ehab and Eyad Makhlouf, were left behind as Damascus fell. According to a Syrian aide and Lebanese security official, they attempted to escape to Lebanon by car but encountered rebels. Ehab was killed and Eyad wounded in the ambush. The incident lacks official confirmation.On December 8, Assad departed Damascus by aircraft, flying with the transponder disabled, according to two regional diplomats. His departure concluded his 24-year leadership, his family's 50-year rule, and effectively ended the 13-year civil war. He travelled to Russia's Hmeimim airbase in Latakia, then proceeded to Moscow.His immediate family - wife Asma and their three children - were already in Moscow, according to three former close aides and a senior regional official.Social media footage of Assad's residence, captured by rebels and citizens who entered the presidential complex after his departure, suggests a rushed exit, showing unfinished meals on the stove and abandoned personal items, including family photographs.Russia's military assistance would not be forthcoming, despite their crucial 2015 intervention that had previously supported Assad's position in the civil war. Similarly, Iran, another steadfast supporter, would not provide military aid.Assad received this news during his attempts to secure support from various sources whilst trying to maintain his grip on power and ensure his safety, according to individuals who spoke with Reuters.On November 28, Assad travelled to Moscow, following Syrian rebel attacks in Aleppo province and their swift advance across the nation. Three regional diplomats reported that his requests for military support were rejected by the Kremlin.According to Hadi al-Bahra, who leads Syria's main opposition abroad, Assad misrepresented the Moscow meeting's outcome to his staff, based on information from an insider within Assad's circle and a regional official.""He told his commanders and associates after his Moscow trip that military support was coming,"" Bahra added. ""He was lying to them. The message he received from Moscow was negative.""On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov informed reporters that whilst Russia had previously invested significant effort in stabilising Syria, its current focus was the Ukraine conflict.On December 2, four days after the Moscow visit, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi met Assad in Damascus. By then, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist rebels had captured Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, and were advancing southward as government forces weakened.A senior Iranian diplomat told Reuters that Assad appeared distressed during the meeting and acknowledged his army's inability to mount effective resistance.Two senior Iranian officials said that Assad never requested Iranian troops in Syria, recognising that Israel might use such deployment to justify attacks on Iranian forces in Syria or Iran itself.The Kremlin and Russian foreign ministry declined to comment on this matter, whilst the Iranian foreign ministry was not immediately available for response.","Bashar al-Assad deliberately misled or withheld information from his aides, officials and family members.

Individual skills, attitudes and efforts matter,"" Nageswaran said, while warning that enforcing equality through regulation hurts small businesses as had been seen earlier.He said that a part of Piketty's calculations was based on wealth created in stock markets, but recent evidence suggested that investments in shares had now extended extensively to smaller towns and cities. He also said that there was evidence to suggest that the gap between the top 20 companies and the others was coming down.As Piketty pressed for levy on super-rich across the world and using taxes across countries to fight climate change, Nageswaran countered by saying there was no guarantee wealthy nations would part with the funds.Shamika Ravi, member of the economic advisory council to PM, said that lower taxes had improved compliance, as was evident from the tax department statistics, and suggested that during the decades of high taxes in India there may have been greater evasion. She cited numbers to argue that extreme poverty was coming down and the latest statistics suggested that even the poorest households were consuming more milk, eggs and fruits and also owning vehicles. ""Inequality of consumption is reducing,"" she added.","V Anantha Nageswaran: Taxing capital less may not make them invest, but taxing capital more will drive away capital.

NEW DELHI: The husband of the woman who was killed in a stampede in Hyderabad's Sandhya Theatre during the premiere of Pushpa 2, on Friday said he does not hold actor Allu Arjun responsible for the incident and is prepared to withdraw his complaintBhaskar clarified his stance in a statement, expressing that he does not hold Allu Arjun responsible for the tragic event. ""We only visited Sandhya Theatre because my son was eager to watch the movie. Allu Arjun is not to blame for being at the theatre that day. I am ready to withdraw my complaint. I wasn’t even informed about his arrest; I learned about it from the news while at the hospital. He has no connection to the stampede,"" Bhaskar said.The statement came moments after Allu Arjun was arrested in connection with the case.While a local court remanded Arjun to 14-day judicial custody, the Telangana high court gave relief to the actor by granting him 4-week interim bail.The stampede, which occurred on December 4, claimed the life of Revathi and critically injured her 13-year-old son, Shreethej, after a massive crowd gathered at Sandhya Theatre in Hyderabad.The incident had sparked widespread criticism of the theatre's crowd management, leading to the arrest of three individuals, including the theatre owner and staff members, for their alleged negligence in handling the event.Allu Arjun expressed his deep sorrow, describing the stampede as a ""heartbreaking"" event that overshadowed the success of his film. The actor has since pledged Rs 25 lakh in financial support to Revathi’s family and committed to covering the medical expenses for Shreethej.The stampede at the Pushpa 2 premiere was caused by an overwhelming crowd eager to see the actor, with the situation escalating further due to a lack of proper security arrangements.","Revathi Bhaskar's husband says he does not hold actor Allu Arjun responsible for the incident.

SC grants prospective bail to ex-WB minister Partha in teachers' jobs 'scam',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-grants-prospective-bail-to-ex-wb-minister-partha-in-teachers-jobs-scam/articleshow/116301624.cms,"SC order points to prospective bail as a new concept

NEW DELHI: Seeking to balance the rights of an accused with the gravity of offence he has been charged with, Supreme Court on Friday granted prospective bail to former Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee from Feb 1 in a money laundering case related to the teachers recruitment 'scam' and directed the trial court to decide on framing of charges and record statements of vulnerable witnesses by then.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan struck an innovative balance to tackle the classical dilemma in administration of justice - while the accused can't be kept in custody indefinitely as that would amount to punitive detention, scales of justice cannot be balanced if affluent and influential accused obstruct probe or tamper with evidence.As part of the reconciliation of the two imperatives, the Supreme Court bench said Partha Chatterjee could continue as an MLA but would not be appointed to any public office during pendency of the trial.The restraint on holding public office is significant as it marks the crystallisation of the judicial reasoning first witnessed in SC's dismay over re-appointment of Senthil Balaji as minister in Tamil Nadu soon after apex court released him on bail in a money laundering case.The order also pointed to the emergence of prospective bail as a new concept as it was only on Thursday that a different bench, while upholding the bail plea of an accused in a money laundering case, ruled that he would not come out for another two months.Chatterjee's right as an accused and his bail plea must be juxtaposed with broader societal harm caused by his alleged action of taking bribe to recruit undeserving candidates as teachers while depriving thousands of deserving candidates their future, the bench said. While passing the prospective bail order, the bench also cited the statement of Arpita Mukherjee, a co-accused in the case, fearing threat to her life from Chatterjee.Prior to release of Chatterjee on bail, the bench said the trial court must decide on framing of charges before Dec 31 and ""fix a date within the second and third week of Jan for recording statements of such prosecution witnesses who are most material or vulnerable. All such witnesses, especially those who have expressed apprehension of danger to their lives, will be examined on these dates"".Asking Chatterjee and his counsel to cooperate with the trial court in recording witness statements, the bench said if the trial court framed charges against him, he would have the right to appeal against it. However, it restrained the appellate court from staying the trial during pendency of the appeal against framing of charges.Fixing an outer limit of Jan 31 for completion of recording of statements of vulnerable and important witnesses, the bench said while Chatterjee would be released on bail on Feb 1, his bail would be cancelled if he was found to have influenced or threatened witnesses directly or indirectly. SC asked him to appear without fail before the trial court on every hearing, and attempts to delay or stall the trial would entail cancellation of bail.Between the cases involving Balaji and Chatterjee, SC may have restored the convention followed until recently when politicians, even powerful ones, resigned as soon as they were chargesheeted. This was followed across the spectrum - those who quit include BJP stalwart L K Advani and RJD boss Lalu Prasad - until others like Manish Sisodia, Anil Deshmukh, Satyendar Jain, Arvind Kejriwal, among others, held on to their respective offices. The repercussions of the court drawing the line afresh may have implications for many who are in office while on bail as well as those who are fancying a return.",Partha Chatterjee could continue as an MLA but would not be appointed to any public office during pendency of the trial.

IndiGo owes us an apology & compensation: Stranded flyers

Nearly 400 passengers who were supposed to travel from Istanbul to Delhi and Mumbai on IndiGo flights have been stranded at the Turkiye airport for almost two days now.Passengers have now taken to social media to recount their experience. While they were supposed to travel to Delhi (6E12) and Mumbai (6E18) on Wednesday night, queries sent to IndiGo on when the passengers would be flown to India remained unanswered till Friday night.Shubham Bansal wrote on LinkedIn: ""I am one of the 400 passengers stranded in Istanbul.

NEW DELHI: A delegation of opposition Rajya Sabha MPs on Friday submitted a notice to the Upper House's secretary general, seeking the removal of Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav for his alleged controversial remarks against Uniform Civil Code and Muslims at a recent Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) event.The notice for removing Yadav was signed by 55 opposition MPs , including Kapil Sibal , Vivek Tankha, Digvijaya Singh, P Wilson, John Brittas, Manoj Kumar Jha, Saket Gokhale, Raghav Chadha and Fauzia Khan. They submitted the notice under Judges' (Inquiry) Act, 1968, and Article 218 of the Constitution, seeking initiation of proceedings for Yadav's removal.The notice mentioned that Yadav's speech or lecture, during the event organised by VHP, prima facie showed that he ""engaged in hate speech and incitement to communal disharmony in violation of the Constitution"". It also said the judge's speech prima facie showed that he targeted minorities and displayed bias and prejudice against them.As per the notice, Yadav entered into public debate or expressed his views in public on political matters relating to UCC, in violation of Restatement of Values of Judicial Life, 1997. The MPs have submitted a video clip of his speech.Mentioning that the three pillars of democracy don't collide with each other and there is no grounds for sitting judges of high courts to ""affiliate with extremist group or parties"", the notice said, ""No litigant can hope for justice in a court in which a member holds such a biased, prejudiced, publicly expressed opinion against the minority community and in favour of a majoritarian approach.""The notice also said Yadav's actions ""contravene the directive principles enshrined under Article 51A(e) of the Constitution, which mandates promoting harmony and renouncing practices derogatory to the dignity of individuals"".""We request the chairman (of RS) to admit this motion and forward it to the President in accordance with Judges' (Inquiry) Act, 1968, and constitute an inquiry committee to investigate the charges of hate speech, communal disharmony, and violations of judicial ethics ,"" the notice said.

Judging a woman's virtue based on her attire impermissible: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judging-a-womans-virtue-based-on-her-attire-impermissible-hc/articleshow/116301147.cms,"Representative image

KOCHI: Judging a woman or making conclusions about her virtue or modesty based on her dress is unpardonable and impermissible in any civilised society, as such judgments stem from rigid patriarchal notions, Kerala high court has held.A bench of justices Devan Ramachandran and M B Snehalatha made this observation while setting aside a family court verdict that granted custody of two children to their father and ruled that the mother was unworthy of their care. The family court concluded that she was of loose morals, as alleged by her husband - on the grounds that she wore ""revealing dresses"", posted pictures on dating apps, spent time with male friends, used abusive language towards her husband and hired a 'hacker' to access her husband's computer.Regretting that such observations were made on the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution, the division bench granted the custody of the two children to their mother. The bench acknowledged how deeply rigid gender roles and patriarchy have permeated society, and emphasised that ""unwritten dress codes"" have a lasting impact on women's lives with the sexualisation and policing of women's clothing starting as early as school. No one has the right to judge a woman based on her attire or her choices in life. Clothing is a form of self-expression and part of an individual's identity or aesthetic expression, it added.HC also noted that the mother celebrated her divorce with a close group of friends, and termed it unfortunate that the ex-husband submitted photographs of her celebrating as part of evidence, and the family court even took that into consideration. The notion that a woman should be sad about a divorce and only happy in marriage is so deeply ingrained that it requires no further explanation, the bench observed, stating that personal opinions must not influence judgments.","Kerala high court sets aside a family court verdict that granted custody of two children to their father and ruled that the mother was unworthy of their care.

NEW DELHI: Ending a 20-year-ego battle between a judicial officer and an IPS officer, Supreme Court Friday quashed summons and bailable warrants issued by a trial judge to then Kurukshetra SP Bharti Arora to show cause why 'her role in letting off an accused in a narcotic drug case be not investigated'.A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Prashant Mishra and K V Viswanathan said the judicial officer issued 7 summonses to her, who was probing the Samjhauta train bomb blast at that time, in a span of 10 days acting in a 'predetermined manner' and forgetting that ""no one would be condemned without being heard"".Justice Gavai said the trial judge ignored Arora's plea that after coordinating the investigations in the train blast case, she was tasked to maintain law and order at a place where the situation had deteriorated due to an agitation.When repeated summonses were being issued to Arora in 2008, who took voluntary retirement in 2021 as IGP, the judicial officer was transferred out on May 26, 2008 and directed to relinquish charge immediately, the judge kept the matter for hearing on May 27, 28, 29 and 30 and on the last day proceeded to type the order but kept in sealed cover to be pronounced by the successor judge.The bench termed this a grave error. ""It is a well-settled principle of law that justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done,"" the bench said, while expressing surprise at HC's decision to uphold the May 30, 2008, order. SC stayed HC order on Oct 26, 2010.SC opened the sealed cover order of 2008 on Oct 24 and said after perusing the same ""it became clear to us that the special judge had acted in a predetermined manner"" against the then SP.The controversy started with the arrest of a person in 2005 for possessing a huge quantity of narcotic drugs. But as he claimed innocence before then SP Arora, she ordered an inquiry, and it was found that three persons had planted the drugs on the person arrested. She released the arrested person and ordered proceedings against the three.When a closure report for the case was sent, the special judge rejected it and ordered fresh inquiry, which too returned the same finding as that of the SP. Apparently enraged, the judge rejected that closure report, acquitted the three and convicted the person earlier arrested. Additionally, she initiated proceedings against the SP under NDPS Act for ""interfering with the investigations into the case and summoned her to appear before the trial court.","Supreme Court quashes summons and bailable warrants issued by a trial judge to then Kurukshetra SP Bharti Arora.

Neuro-robot offers help in epilepsy treatment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neuro-robot-offers-help-in-epilepsy-treatment/articleshow/116300990.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Around 15 million people in India suffer from epilepsy - a common brain disorder that causes seizures - and about 20%-30% among them are drug resistant. The Neuroscience Centre at AIIMS, Delhi, has devised a unique treatment method using an advanced neuro-robot that can 'pop' the brain and provide succour to millions who don't respond to epilepsy drugs and aren't fit for surgery.The neuro-robot implants multiple electrodes into a patient's brain in a bloodless procedure to identify the area from where the seizures get triggered. Then, the seizures are reproduced again by stimulating the electrodes to reconfirm the point of focus. Finally, the faulty part is burnt or ablated, causing a popping sensation in the brain, thus, stopping the seizures or reducing them.""We have used this technique in over 60 patients suffering from uncontrolled epilepsy,"" professor of neurosurgery at AIIMS, Delhi, Dr P Sarat Chandra, said. Recently, Chandra and his team performed the procedure on a 23-year-old woman, who had been suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy . Tanushree (name changed), who works with an MNC, had visited several doctors and undergone as many as 14 MRIs over nine years, but no abnormality could be detected even as the frequency of her seizures kept increasing.""Through pre-operative investigations including video EEG, MRI, SPECT and PET scans, and magnetoencephalography, we identified the areas of suspicious neural activity in the brain. This data was fed into the neuro-robot, which directed its robotic arm to the right area to place thin electrodes,"" Chandra said.The patient was moved to ICU and monitored for next few days. On day five, she developed five to six seizure episodes, which the implanted electrodes demonstrated were arising from a specific portion of the brain and spreading to the left temporal lobe. This is called periventricular heterotopia (PVH) - small 'lesions' in the brain found next to the ventricle (cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavities in the brain), where the wiring between the neurons had gone 'haywire', constantly short-circuiting & generating abnormal amounts of electricity that spreads to the rest of the brain, leading to epilepsy. In Tanushree's case, PVH was very small, and hence, missed by previous MRIs.To reconfirm, doctors passed a very low-intensity current - similar to what normally passes through neurons - through electrodes to stimulate the PVH.When the electrode in the PVH was stimulated at 10 milliamperes, the patient developed the typical 'staring episode' she used to have during seizures, said professor of neurology at AIIMS, Dr Manjari Tripathi. ""Reproducing seizures with stimulation is a moment of jubilation for us as we now know exactly where the abnormal networks are located within the brain,"" she said.The final part involved burning the PVH around the electrodes using a bipolar current. The patient is conscious and gets a 'popping' sensation as the brain substance around electrodes heats up and coagulates,"" Chandra said. Every electrode costs Rs 1.5 lakh. At AIIMS, they are being done at a fraction of cost with the same technology, and are often permanent cures for epilepsy, Chandra said.","Around 15 million people in India suffer from epilepsy - a common brain disorder that causes seizures.

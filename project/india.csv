Nations that ‘failed demonstrably’

Trump’s warning to China





Taliban’s role in Afghanistan drug trade





US President Donald Trump has identified China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and 19 other nations as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries, warning that their activities threaten the safety of the United States.In asubmitted to Congress on Monday, Trump listed these countries as sources or routes for illicit drugs entering the United States.According to the White House, Trump delivered the “Major’s List” to Congress, designating these countries as responsible for sourcing and transporting illicit drugs into the US, reported PTI.The state department clarified that inclusion on the list does not necessarily reflect a government’s cooperation or counternarcotics work. It said the designation is based on “the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs or precursor chemicals to be transited or produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control and law enforcement measures. ”According to the White House, these countries are either sources of illicit drug production or serve as major transit points for trafficking into the US.The state department said five countries – Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela – have “failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts” to meet international counternarcotics obligations.It also clarified that inclusion on the list “does not necessarily reflect a government’s counterdrug efforts or level of cooperation with the United States,” but is based on geographic and economic factors that enable drug flows.Trump singled out China as the “world's largest source” of precursor chemicals used in illicit fentanyl production. He said China is also a major supplier of synthetic narcotics including nitazenes and methamphetamine.“The Chinese leadership can and must take stronger and sustained action to cut down these chemical flows and prosecute the drug criminals facilitating them,” Trump said.On Afghanistan, Trump said the Taliban’s announced ban on drugs has not stopped ongoing production and stockpiles of narcotics.“Revenue from this drug trade funds transnational criminal groups and supports international terrorists. Some members of the Taliban continue to profit from this trade, and I am once again designating Afghanistan as having failed demonstrably to uphold its drug control obligations,” he said.Trump added that trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly illicit drugs has created a national emergency. “Transnational organised crime's trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly illicit drugs into the US has created a national emergency, including a public health crisis that remains the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 44,” he said, as quoted by PTI.","US President Donald Trump has identified China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and 19 other nations as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries.

Prospects of Leh talks' resumption brighten,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prospects-of-leh-talks-resumption-brighten/articleshow/123960928.cms,"NEW DELHI: The prospects of early resumption of talks between the Centre and the Apex Body, Leh (ABL) on the latter's demand for safeguards for Ladakh, have brightened with ABL agreeing to drop political parties' representatives from its negotiating team and veteran leader Thupstan Chhewang consenting to lead the dialogue once again.Chhewang and Congress leader Nawang Rigzin Jora had resigned from key positions in ABL ahead of a crucial meeting with the home ministry in July this year. This was after the home ministry, following a round of talks with Ladakh representatives in May 2025, introduced a new reservation and domicile policy for the Union Territory, guaranteeing 85% quota to local domiciles in jobs and reserving one-third seats for women in Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC).Jora withdrew from the apex body soon after, affirming the Congress' commitment to securing statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, ostensibly with an eye on upcoming LAHDC elections. Chhewang, on the other hand, objected to ""partisan agendas"" of some ABL constituents and insisted on the talks remaining ""non-political"". These developments had put the talks in a limbo.With the ABL now agreeing to exclude political parties from its delegation negotiating Ladakh's safeguards, in a move to depoliticise the process, Chhewang has finally agreed to return to lead the talks.The decision follows a resolution by the Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA), urging separation of politics from ABL and persuasion of Chhewang to head the delegation.ABL has now requested the Centre to resume dialogue, amid concerns that political influence and upcoming LAHDC Leh polls had hindered negotiations. Meanwhile, Sonam Wangchuk's hunger strike over demands for statehood and Sixth Schedule status has evoked mixed response, with many netas favouring talks. ""Given the changed circumstances, the home ministry is inclined to call the APL to the negotiating table soon,"" a central govt officer told TOI.","Talks between the Centre and the Apex Body, Leh (ABL) on the latter's demand for safeguards for Ladakh have brightened.

As the news spread, workers of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena UBT rushed to the spot and cleaned the premises. The police were subsequently informed, an officer said.Eight teams were formed to identify the perpetrators, the police officer said, adding that police scanned footage from CCTV cameras installed in the Shivaji Park area.An FIR was registered against unidentified persons under Section 298 of BNS.

Sanitation worker dies in bid to save 1 from manhole,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanitation-worker-dies-in-bid-to-save-1-from-manhole/articleshow/123960509.cms,"'No mask, oxygen or even cloth given to cover face'

NEW DELHI: A labourer, 40, died and two of his colleagues are critical after being sent into a manhole to repair and clean it in northwest Delhi's Ashok Vihar Phase-II late on Tuesday night. None of them had any safety equipment.When the first worker collapsed after inhaling poisonous fumes, another went in to save him and died. The third, who tried to rescue the two, lost consciousness.Police called the manager of a company, which engaged the three on contractual basis, for questioning. They registered a case under several sections, including one banning manual scavenging.According to police, information about the people falling inside a sewer near Harihar apartments was received via a PCR call at Ashok Vihar police station at 11.30pm.""Arvind, along with three others, Sonu and Narayan, also from Kasganj, and Naresh from Bihar, entered a sewer as part of ongoing cleaning work when they fell unconscious, allegedly due to toxic gases,"" a senior police officer said.Arvind was rushed to DDU Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The other two, Sonu(45) and Naresh (30) remain in critical condition in the ICU.At Deep Chand Babu Hospital's ICU ward, Narayan (32), one of the workers, told TOI, ""I was the one who opened the lid of the sewer that day,"" he said.""After that, Sonu was told to go inside. We had tied a rope around his waist, but no safety equipment was provided to him. He wasn't given any mask, no oxygen, not even a cloth to cover his face. He was just asked to go down and cut a pipe that was inside the sewer for some repair and cleaning work.""The moment Sonu cut the pipe, we saw him collapse. He just fell unconscious inside. To save him, Arvind immediately tied himself with the same rope and went in. But as soon as he reached down, he too fell unconscious. After that, Naresh tried to go in and bring them out, but the same thing happened to him. One after another, all three of them collapsed inside that sewer,"" Narayan said. ""I raised an alarm and shouted for help. Some locals gathered and together we somehow managed to pull them out with the rope. But by then all three were completely unconscious. They went in only to save each other. That's how we lost him.""Arvind was the sole breadwinner of his family, which includes his wife and two young sons aged 12 and 7. His daily earnings ranged between Rs 500 and Rs 800 and the family depended entirely on that income. For the past 15 years, he had been doing contractual work, often travelling to Delhi and taking up odd jobs. Sonu, too, is the only earning member in his family and supports his two sons, aged one-and-a-half and five.At the spot, the manhole on the busy residential stretch lay open the next day, access to it blocked only by a police barricade. Scattered around were the belongings of the workers, slippers, broken bluetooth headsets and a lone slipper floating inside the manhole's dirty sewer water. ""Preliminary inquiries revealed that the sewer cleaning work was underway for several days, carried out under the supervision of a construction company,"" police officer added.","A labourer, 40, died and two of his colleagues are critical after being sent into a manhole to repair and clean it in northwest Delhi's Ashok Vihar Phase-II late on Tuesday night.

CBSE issues notice on minimum requirements to appear in board examinations: Check details here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/cbse-issues-notice-on-minimum-requirements-to-appear-in-board-examinations-check-details-here/articleshow/123900628.cms,"Two-year structure is now binding

Mandatory attendance

Attendance will be closely tracked, and schools are required to maintain daily registers.

Condonation of up to 25% is allowed only under extreme circumstances, such as medical emergencies, bereavements, or national-level participation in sports and cultural events — and only if backed by valid documentation.

Students with poor attendance and no valid justification will be treated as ineligible, regardless of whether they are enrolled as regular candidates.

Internal assessment cannot be skipped

Internal assessment is conducted over two years and covers periodic tests, projects, and classroom participation.

Students who do not attend school regularly will automatically miss these assessments.

Without internal assessment records, CBSE will not declare results, and such students will be placed in the “Essential Repeat” category even if they appeared for theory exams.

Restrictions on additional subjects

Class X students can opt for two additional subjects beyond the compulsory five.

Class XII students can take one additional subject only.

These subjects, too, must be studied for the entire two-year programme.

Private candidates and repeaters

Students who previously opted for additional subjects but were placed in Compartment or Essential Repeat categories can reappear as private candidates.

However, students who have not followed the prescribed two-year study and attendance requirements are not eligible to offer additional subjects as private candidates.

Why this notice is significant

“Dummy candidates” who enroll without attending regular classes,

Schools that offer unapproved subjects without adequate facilities, and

Students who attempt to bypass the internal assessment framework.

The bigger picture

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a sweeping directive tightening the eligibility norms for students appearing in the Class 10 and 12 board examinations. The new notice makes it explicitly clear that no student will be allowed to write the exams without fulfilling strict academic performance and minimum attendance requirements, marking one of the board’s most stringent and far-reaching measures in recent years.The CBSE, under the Ministry of Education, emphasized that while the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) functions under the open and distance learning model, CBSE operates strictly through the face-to-face schooling framework. The latest guidelines are designed to ensure accountability, discipline, and proper implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.CBSE has formally declared that Class X and Class XII will be treated as two-year programmes. This means Class IX and Class X together constitute a complete course for the Class 10 exam, while Class XI and XII together form the foundation for the Class 12 exam.Any subject taken in board classes must have been studied for two consecutive years.Students attempting to take shortcuts, such as enrolling late or skipping foundation classes, will be disqualified.The board has made it explicit that students must have at least 75% attendance to be eligible for board exams.As per NEP-2020, internal assessments are no longer an optional add-on but a core, continuous evaluation mechanism.CBSE has also outlined strict rules for additional subjects:Further, the board has warned affiliated schools against offering subjects without approval. If a school lacks qualified teachers, laboratories, or CBSE’s formal permission, students will not be permitted to register for such subjects as main or additional papers.The notice clarifies the rules for repeat candidates:This announcement marks a decisive shift towards discipline and accountability within CBSE schools. It directly targets:By linking exam eligibility with two-year classroom learning, compulsory attendance, and continuous internal assessment, CBSE is enforcing a 360-degree compliance regime.The reforms are in line with NEP-2020, which stresses holistic, year-round evaluation over rote, exam-centric learning. For students, this means that showing up in school and participating in classroom learning is as important as performing in final board exams.For schools, it signals zero tolerance against unauthorized subject offerings and poor record-keeping. The board has warned that violations may invite disciplinary action, including disaffiliation.",The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a sweeping directive tightening the eligibility norms for students appearing in the Class 10 and 12 board examinations.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet confirmed the status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that reflects the UAE’s values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways. This year’s celebrations are also expected to set new records in tourism and retail spending, reflecting the growing impact of National Day on the UAE’s economy.","The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan set up another politically charged clash with arch-rivals India after securing a 41-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Wednesday. The result confirmed both teams’ progression from Group A into the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup.With the win, Pakistan finished the group stage with 4 points from 3 games, slotting in alongside India, who top the standings with 4 points from 2 games and are yet to play Oman on Friday.

Kash Patel to be fired for Charlie Kirk probe blunders?

FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel. ""Any suggestion that I was brought in to replace anyone in leadership at the FBI or spin my appointment into a sign of division, is simply false - I am honored to serve the FBI and Department of Justice as we work together to keep our nation safe,"" he said.Meanwhile in a separate but related development Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with.”","Andrew Bailey will be sworn in as co-deputy director of the FBI today.

'I Didn't Do It': Pilot's Last Words Before Air India Crash| Probe Report| Tech Failure or Sabotage?

Poll Do you think the media has played a fair role in reporting on the crash? Yes, they have been unbiased. No, they have sensationalized the story.

NEW DELHI: The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' by the central government while criticising the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation"".In the Ahmedabad plane crash, which was one of the worst aircraft accidents in India, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed. Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after take off from Ahmedabad on June 12.In a letter to the civil aviation secretary and AAIB Director General, 91-year-old Pushkaraj Sabharwal said that selective leaks about the accident had led to speculation that Sumeet (56) was under tremendous psychological pressure and contemplating suicide, PTI reported.""These innuendos have very adversely affected my health and mental setup and the reputation of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal. They tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the letter, dated August 29, said.Pushkaraj has demanded that the central government order a formal enquiry into the accident under Rule 12 of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, which empowers the Centre to institute a formal investigation into the circumstances of any accident of an Indian-registered aircraft if it appears expedient to hold such a probe.There were no immediate comments from the civil aviation ministry or the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on the letter.Amid speculation about the cause of the fatal crash following the release of its preliminary probe report on July 12, the AAIB had asserted it was too early to draw any “definite conclusions” as the investigation was still on and that the final report would identify root causes. The agency also urged everyone to refrain from spreading premature narratives.""The preliminary report on the contrary does not allude to the 'what' happened or the bare facts of the crash, instead resorting to insinuations on the one hand and offering copious clean chits to the manufacturer/s on the other. The report in its present form is deficient, diversionary & discrepant,"" the letter said.It further alleged that selective information from the preliminary investigation — including contents of the cockpit voice recorder — had been put into the public domain.Pushkaraj also refuted speculation about his son’s mental health. Citing reports, he said it was suggested Sumeet was divorced and that caused him anxiety and depression.""It even ignores the fact that Captain Sabharwal was divorced about 15 years ago. The other speculation relating to the cause for Captain Sabharwal being desirous of committing suicide has been his mother's death. His mother died more than three years ago. After that, Captain Sabharwal had operated more than 100 flights without any incident or accident.""It is most pertinent to note that in over 25 years of flying, Captain Sabharwal had not had a single incident or accident-causing fatalities or otherwise,"" the letter said.He had almost 15,638.22 hours of flying experience, of which 8,596 hours were on the 787-8. He was also designated as a Pilot Trainer — a Line Training Captain — and held the DGCA licence for that purpose.Pushkaraj added that the absence of a formal enquiry under Rule 12, coupled with selective information being provided to the media, was very disturbing and detrimental to him and affected his fundamental rights, including the right to the reputation of his deceased son.In the preliminary report, AAIB had said the fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after takeoff. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,"" it had said.","The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' He criticises the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish his reputation"" 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123945567,imgsize-165992,width-400,resizemode-4/ahmedabad-plane-crash.jpg"
Tejashwi Yadav's Bihar Adhikar Yatra: Consolidating Rahul Gandhi's gains or establishing pre-eminence in alliance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tejashwi-yadavs-bihar-adhikar-yatra-consolidating-rahul-gandhis-gains-or-establishing-pre-eminence-in-alliance/articleshow/123951337.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' to challenge Nitish Kumar's government on unemployment and crime, following the 'Voter Adhikaar Yatra' led by Rahul Gandhi. This solo move, amidst CM face debates and seat-sharing talks, aims to assert RJD's dominance in the Mahagathbandhan.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

NEW DELHI: RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' from Jehanabad to raise pitch against Nitish Kumar-led NDA government over issues of unemployment and increasing crime incidents among others ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.Interestingly, Tejashwi's solo yatra comes close on the heels of the much-hyped ""Voter Adhikaar Yatra"" which included all Mahagathbandhan leaders and was led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi . Tejashwi was part of the Voter Adhikaar Yatra, but the limelight was hogged by Rahul - who has been leading a campaign against alleged vote theft across the country accusing the Election Commission of helping the BJP.The RJD, which is going all out to dethrone Nitish Kumar led NDA government in the state, asserted that Tejasjwi's yatra will cover districts which were left out in the 'Voter Adhikaar Yatra'.""After the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', some districts were left out. All our workers and leaders from these districts demanded that these areas should be covered, so Tejashwi ji took the decision to take out this yatra respecting their feelings,"" RJD MP Sanjay Yadav said yesterday when asked about the launch of the yatra.Also read: 'Hydrogen bomb' incoming? Rahul Gandhi to hold special presser on Sept 18; 'vote chori' row set to intensify However, the fact that this new yatra comes amid an ongoing debate over Mahagathbandhan's CM face and also inconclusive seat-sharing talks makes one wonder if the RJD leader has other objectives in mind also.Recently, the RJD leader had surprised all when during a rally in Muzaffarpur he pronounced: “And this time, Tejashwi will contest all 243 seats, whether it is Muzaffarpur, Kanti or Bochahan.”Tejashwi's remarks, more than anything, was perhaps an attempt to stamp his pre-eminence as the leader of the opposition alliance across the state.However, Tejashwi later explained that there is ""no confusion"" regarding the chief ministerial face in the opposition bloc and the name will be announced at the ""right time.""So, the question is why was such an assertion needed in the first place? After all, RJD is the largest party in the alliance and in the last elections had won 75 seats, which was the highest as it was one more than BJP's tally.However, as the opposition alliance gears up for the assembly elections, the Congress has refused to openly endorse Tejashwi as Mahagathbandhan's CM face. During the ""Voter Adhikaar Yatra"", when Rahul Gandhi was pointedly asked why Congress was not endorsing Tejashwi as the CM face, he evaded a direct reply and instead spoke of a good understanding between the partners. This, despite the fact, that Tejashwi had earlier openly announced that Rahul would become the Prime Minister once the opposition won the next Lok Sabha elections.When asked why the Congress was not backing Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial face in Bihar, Rahul Gandhi said: ""A very strong partnership had been forged. All the parties (in the bloc) are working in sync. There's no tension, and there's mutual respect to help each other as we are ideologically and politically aligned. The result will be good. But the vote theft needs to be stopped.""Rahul's reply was clearly a calculated and clever deflection of announcing party's stand on the leadership issue in Bihar. The Congress leader, riding high on his successful ""vote chori"" campaign, was perhaps not willing to lose the bargaining chip so easily.Also read: Bigger, in colour: EC's new norms for EVM ballot papers; first roll-out in Bihar polls

The seat-sharing talks are underway and all parties are posturing for a higher share. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested 144 seats and won 75. The Congress had the worst strike rate as it contested 70 seats but won only 19. In fact, the Left parties had performed very well with the CPI-ML winning 12 out of 19, CPM 2 out of 4 and CPI 2 out of 6.This time around more parties have joined the opposition alliance and hence seat-sharing will not be an easy exercise. Already there are reports of pressure on both the RJD and the Congress to reduce their share so that other parties can be accommodated.While the Congress in Bihar is in no position to question his leadership within the alliance, they can pile pressure on the RJD during seat sharing talks. This, perhaps, explains why RJD and its leader Tejashwi have embarked on a campaign to ensure their pre-eminence in the alliance is not questioned.","Tejashwi Yadav launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' to challenge Nitish Kumar's government on unemployment and crime.

US' Ex-NSA John Bolton: ‘Trump Should Call Modi, Fix Relations, And Visit India For QUAD Summit'

Former US national security advisor John Bolton said that the punitive tariffs imposed by the US on India under President Donald Trump have complicated negotiations. He described the US tariff policy on India as a mistake and said the priority should be reaching a deal that lowers tariffs while keeping negotiations open.""I think the whole tariff policy is a mistake. I think we ought to go back to the way we were before, but leaving that aside, in the time of Trump, in the White House. To get a deal that reduces the tariffs and leaves the way open for further negotiations is the best thing to do,"" Bolton said in an interview with TOI.He added that the focus should be on finding common ground on economic tariffs and then building from there.Bolton criticized the 25 percent US tariffs on India as collateral damage from broader Western sanctions on Russia, which were imposed over Russian oil and gas imports. He called the move “incoherent”, noting that Russia faced no direct tariffs and China, which imports more oil and gas than India, was left unpenalized.He also noted that India’s historical ties with Russia present challenges but argued for a gradual transition toward cooperation with like-minded partners.“I think we need to reduce purchases of Russia and oil and gas, and there are ways to do this to help transition India away from that in a way that's economically sound,” he said.He suggested that both sides should resume talks to reduce tariffs and rebuild trust, emphasizing the importance of personal rapport between leaders in fostering cooperation.“If the two leaders are now closer to being able to talk about it again that I think is a good sign I hope indicates progress,” he said, adding that a conversation between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to happen.On broader geopolitical concerns, Bolton highlighted the significance of closer collaboration between India, the US, Japan, and Australia through the Quad, particularly in countering China-Russia strategic alignment.He also said that he doesn’t think that Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.Bolton said Pakistan’s recent statement that Trump had no role in de-escalating tensions after the Kashmir attack highlights that the resolution was handled solely by India and Pakistan.""I think it's pretty remarkable that they would say that, and certainly, those who know a little bit about India know that from the similar agreements on forward, that's been the position that issues between Pakistan and India will be settled by the two of them. It's an example of how little Trump knows about,"" Bolton added.Bolton observed that Trump often seeks credit for international developments, citing the Nobel Peace Prize as a possible motivation.","Former US national security advisor John Bolton said that the punitive tariffs imposed by the US on India have complicated negotiations.

MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

On Wednesday, grief turned into fury in the assembly, where opposition accused LDF government of presiding over a health system in free fall.Congress-led UDF moved an adjournment motion, saying 19 people had died this year from the rare infection, including Lathakumari of Thiruvananthapuram last week. The notice charged the government with ignoring awareness campaigns at local level, where those exposed to stagnant water are most at risk. It also flagged rising cases of jaundice, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid and diarrhoeal diseases - calling the situation a ""collapse of public health management"".Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is rare. Globally, fewer than 500 cases have ever been reported. Yet Kerala has seen over 120 so far, including 68 this year. Infection occurs when contaminated freshwater enters the nose, letting the amoeba reach the brain through the sinus and destroy tissue.On Sept 1, an infant and a woman died while under treatment at Kozhikode Govt Medical College Hospital.

Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'

A group of 56 Indian travellers was subjected to “most inhuman behaviour” by Georgian authorities while trying to enter the country from Armenia, a woman alleged in a viral social media post Tuesday.In a post on Instagram, user Dhruvee Patel said the group, despite holding valid e-visas and documents, faced humiliation and prolonged detention at the Sadakhlo border, the primary land crossing between Armenia and Georgia.She claimed they were “made to wait 5+ hrs in the freezing cold – no food, no toilet.” Patel further alleged that officials “confiscated passports for 2+ hrs with no communication” and forced the travellers to sit on the footpath “like cattle.”She said the authorities even recorded videos of them “like criminals” but stopped them from filming the incident. Their documents, she added, were not even checked, with officials simply declaring the visas “wrong.”Calling the treatment “shameful & unacceptable,” Patel tagged PM Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar in her post, writing, “India must take a strong stand.” She ended her post with a sharp rebuke: “This is how Georgia treats Indians. Shameful & unacceptable!”The post received mixed reactions online, with many Indians sharing similar ordeals.One user commented, “I’ve actually had so many civilised friends visit Georgia and had the same treatment… Trust me, it has nothing to do with civic sense or anything cause these girls were dressed very smartly, spoke softly and were extremely polite. The officials are just rude.”While one user remarked, “Depends. Were they squatting and eating Khakra at the airport while dancing to garba? Coz I have seen it!” another questioned, “When this behaviour has been consistent from Georgia then why do Indians keep going there.”A traveller who visited Georgia in 2019 shared a more mixed perspective. They recalled hearing similar stories before their trip but said they were eventually granted entry and went on to enjoy a “dream visit.” Still, they added, “from the last many years they are creating problems for Indians, that's a sad story.”","A group of 56 Indian travellers was subjected to “most inhuman behaviour” by Georgian authorities.

PATNA: The court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Darbhanga, Junaid Alam has rejected the regular bail plea of the man who is currently under judicial custody on the charges of using abusive language against the PM Narendra Modi and his mother on August 27 from a platform erected by the local Congress leaders to welcome party leader Rahul Gandhi during his ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Darbhanga to Muzaffarpur in Bihar.“The court of the CJM rejected the regular bail plea of accused Mohammad Rizvi alias Raja (20) on Tuesday. The bail petition was rejected mainly on the ground that the accused Rizvi has confessed his involvement in the crime during his statement before the investigating officer,” advocate Md Murshid Ansari, who moved the bail petition, told TOI over phone from Darbhanga on Wednesday.The accused Mohammad Rizvi alias Raja (20) is lodged in the Darbhanga district jail since August 29. He was sent to jail hours after his arrest on the same day.Mohammad Rizvi came into the spotlight on Aug 28 after a video in which he allegedly used abusive language against the PM and his mother went viral on social media. This prompted BJP’s Darbhanga district president Aditya Narain Choudhary to lodge an FIR with Simri police station against certain persons.During investigation, Simri police identified the man in the viral video as Rizvi of Bhapoora village. According to police, he had used abusive language against the PM and his mother on Aug 27 from a platform erected by local Congress leaders to welcome party leader Rahul Gandhi during his ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Darbhanga to Muzaffarpur.Police, in its investigation report, said Rizvi allegedly mounted the dais and used abusive language after Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders had already left for Muzaffarpur.","Mohammad Rizvi came into the spotlight on Aug 28 after a video in which he allegedly used abusive language against the PM and his mother went viral on social media.

The meeting focused on reviewing records of the last intensive revision, the current status of the voter list, and gathering suggestions on state/UT-specific documents that may be accepted to establish eligibility for inclusion in the rolls.The EC is expected to announce a nationwide SIR soon, possibly later this month or early next month. This exercise will replace the annual Special Summary Revision (SSR), with January 1, 2026 as the reference date, as earlier reported by TOI.The Bihar SIR, announced in June, faced sharp criticism from opposition parties, which alleged that crores of eligible citizens risked losing their voting rights due to lack of proper documents. Following this, the Supreme Court directed the EC to ensure that no eligible voter is excluded from the rolls.According to the poll panel, the primary aim of the SIR is to identify and remove “foreign illegal migrants” by verifying place-of-birth details of applicants and existing voters.","After Bihar, stage is set for a special intensive revision of electoral rolls in Delhi.

Anxiety & Anger

KULLU/DEHRADUN: This monsoon, from Kullu to Kalimpong, Kishtwar to Karnaprayag, landslides, flash floods and ground subsidence sharpened the focus on how India's expanding network of highways, tunnels, ropeways and hydropower dams is affecting the fragile Himalayan terrain. While officials insist these were natural calamities, a growing number of residents, scientists and campaigners point to unscientific construction as a key driver.In many towns and villages in India's hills, protests have intensified over cracked homes, vanished springs and roads that collapsed as quickly as they were built.Earlier this week, Supreme Court said the entire Himalayan range was facing an ecological crisis. And that conditions were ""very violent"" this year. Talking about its suo motu examination of environmental issues facing not just Himachal but also Uttarakhand and other states, the top court wondered if there was a link between the spate of rain-related events and the fast-paced construction of roads, hydro schemes, buildings and other big infrastructure projects currently on.Visible scars appeared recently on the 197km Chandigarh-Manali highway, where large sections slumped after cutting by National Highways Authority of India left near-vertical slopes of sand and gravel vulnerable to heavy rain.Carriageways were buried, tunnels flooded, and the Beas was choked with debris.""There used to be hardly any landslides,"" said Kullu environmentalist Guman Singh. ""Then came NHAI with its vertical cuts and created a mess of a road."" Former Geological Survey of India director Om Narain Bhargava called the technique ""a horrible mistake"". Villagers demanded relocation and compensation after their homes developed cracks.Activist Madan Sharma called it ""the most dangerous road ever built,"" while state rural development minister Anirudh Singh launched a 'Justice for Himachal' campaign, saying the highway had created ""more problems than it solved."" A state climate report had already warned that such cutting would ""exacerbate land instability.""Sharp disagreements over the cause of recent calamities have surfaced in Uttarakhand next door. Chief secretary Anand Bardhan told TOI there was ""no technical or scientific study"" linking large infrastructure to natural disasters, citing the flash flood in Dharali, which killed several, as an example of a disaster in a zone without major projects. He added that ropeways to Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib had not yet begun and cautioned against speculation.Campaigners, however, said the impacts were widespread. ""All ecological and local factors have been sidelined,"" said Brijesh Sati of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat. ""It would not be wrong to say these disasters are man-made. We are not against development, but it must respect ecology."" He said 50,000 pilgrims completed the Char Dham yatra in 1905 without roads and that even in 2000, road broadening was done without felling trees.Expert opinion from the Supreme Court's high-powered committee on the Char Dham project underscored the risks. Environmentalist Ravi Chopra, who chaired the committee, explained that Uttarakhand's Himalayan ranges emerged from three major faults. ""Even though the rock may be strong, the slopes are weak. During field visits we saw them weakened further by deforestation and unscientific road-cutting - slopes of 60 degrees were carved where even 30 degrees is unsafe. "" He added that climate change had increased the frequency of disasters.Evidence of man-made pressures came from across the scientific community. S K Bartarya, former senior hydrogeologist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, said both human activity and climate change were to blame. ""Drying of water bodies are surfacing across the Himalayas. To understand the impact of projects we need cause-factor analysis to separate man-made pressures from climatic ones.""Lived memory offers its own testimony. Uttarkashi-based campaigner Suresh Bhai said, ""Floods from Kedarnath in 2013 to Joshimath in 2023 show the health of the Himalayas is being spoiled. Development at the cost of ecology requires reassessment.""IPCC author Anjal Prakash called big projects in the mountains ""disaster multipliers"" that destabilise slopes. Shruti Narayan of C40 said infrastructure in fragile zones must be based on scientific evidence ""or risk becoming victims of the very calamities they claim to overcome.""Anxiety has become part of daily life in Sikkim, where a glacial lake outburst flood in Oct 2023 destroyed the Rs 1,200 crore Teesta III dam within minutes, swept away more than a dozen bridges on NH-10, and killed over 90 people. A July 2025 report said many families now kept their bags packed at night, unsure of early warning systems. The Sevoke-Rangpo railway tunnel continued beneath slopes some locals said were still settling. In Pakyong and Namchi, natural springs used for drinking and irrigation had begun drying. A travel magazine recorded complaints that newly widened roads lacked drainage. ""We are not engineers,"" a villager said, ""but we live here. We know when the mountain is being hurt.""In Himachal's Lahaul & Spiti, hundreds marched in May against the proposed Seli and Miyar schemes, alleging that avalanche risks had been ignored and impact assessments withheld.With landslides increasing, extreme rain events rising and traditional water sources vanishing, the future of infrastructure in the Himalayas now hinges on whether engineers and planners can align ambition with the limits of the land.","India's expanding network of highways, tunnels, ropeways and hydropower dams is affecting the fragile Himalayan terrain.

It has said that any ""unauthorised subcontracting and subcontracting beyond permissible limits will be classified as 'undesirable practice', thereby attracting penalties on par with fraudulent practices"".The changes in the bid document have been made months after the issue of subcontracting at multiple levels was raised at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi. TOI on June 9 had reported about the PM's direction to the road transport and highways ministry to formulate ""clear norms and standards"" for subcontractors.NHAI said instances had been observed where concessionaires or selected bidders had engaged contractors without the required prior approval of the authority or exceeded the permissible subcontracting limits. It added that such practices not only violated contractual norms but also posed risks to quality assurance, project timelines and regulatory oversight.The parliamentary PAC in its recent report had raised concerns over the practice of subcontracting in highway projects while flagging that ""unchecked layering"" of contractors and subcontractors had led to diffusion of accountability.NHAI said the provision of ""similar work"" criteria in bid qualification had been clarified considering how it had been often misrepresented by contractors seeking to become eligible for large-scale projects despite having experience only in minor or peripheral works.","National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has tightened norms to check ""unathorised"" subcontracting of works by main highway builders.

The responses are to be filed in four weeks.The petitioner said forests of MP and Maharashtra constitute the heartland of the tiger's habitat and highlighted what the SIT report revealed: ""Tigers are increasingly being killed outside the boundaries of protected areas, in territorial forest divisions and corridors which lack effective surveillance and protection. These areas, identified as vital dispersal habitats by the Wildlife Institute of India, have become the prime targets of organised gangs of poachers.

"Trade, security dominate EU’s India agenda; Modi says ready for next level in ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-sets-strategic-agenda-to-boost-india-relations/articleshow/123960134.cms,"'Will open a new chapter in ties'

NEW DELHI: Under pressure from the US to impose tariffs on India for its oil purchase from Russia, the EU Wednesday rolled out a new strategic agenda for boosting bilateral cooperation with India, including through the creation of an EU-India Security and Defence Partnership that would also facilitate defence industrial collaboration, along with technology, maritime security and counterterrorism cooperation.Following the launch of EU’s proposals for a comprehensive strategic agenda that will be adopted at the next India-EU summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke to PM Narendra Modi to brief him about EU’s vision for ties with India, while also wishing him on his birthday.“Delighted to know about the 'New Strategic EU-India Agenda' adopted today. India is ready to take the India-EU relationship to the next level. It is our shared commitment, shared goal, and shared responsibility. We remain committed to an early and peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict,” said Modi in a post on X, appreciating the agenda.The president said India and the EU will open a new chapter in ties and that she discussed progress in trade talks and how they can work together to effectively support Ukraine’s ""fight for freedom"".Both the EU and India want to upgrade their 2004 strategic partnership with a new comprehensive agenda, as they look for ways to offset likely damages from President Donald Trump’s tariff policy.While the leaders reiterated their commitment to have the free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of this year, there’s still a lot of ground to be covered in the trade negotiations and differences over Russia continue to act as an impediment in ties.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stressed at the launch that India’s oil procurement from Russia remained an issue, saying that “ultimately, our partnership is not only about trade, but also about defending the rules-based international order. On the trade deal, Kallas warned that nothing is agreed till everything is agreed. EU officials, however, have ruled out tariffs or sanctions against India for its crude purchase from Russia.India and the EU held the 13th round of FTA negotiations here last week and another round is expected early next month in Brussels. However, EU’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who visited India last week, said he had expected more progress in the last round of talks.As India encourages the EU to double down on defence and security cooperation and raise its profile in the Indo-Pacific, the EU also announced that the 2 sides are launching negotiations on a Security of Information Agreement that will facilitate the exchange of classified information and stronger cooperation in areas related to security and defence.“This could also pave the way for India’s participation in EU security and defence initiatives in line with EU Treaty-based frameworks,” said the EU in its joint communication on the agenda.There was also a mention of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in the agenda with the EU calling it a tragic reminder of terrorism’s human cost and committing to further strengthening counterterrorism cooperation to assess global threats, counter extremism and terrorism financing.According to the EU, its increasing strategic engagement in the Indo-Pacific – especially its support for regional partners in comprehensive security areas – aligns closely with India’s role as a key pillar of regional stability and its deepening cooperation with partners including the US, Japan, Australia, and ASEAN member states. “The two sides should improve coordination and exchange views on the links between the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, particularly the connection between the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean as key interfaces between the two,” it proposed.Apart from defence and security, the EU proposed 4 other pillars for expanding cooperation: prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, connectivity and global issues and enablers across pillars.According to Indian authorities, the agenda recognizes India’s rising global profile, economic might, important security role, technological prowess, demographic dividend and its growing influence in world affairs. “It identifies India as a natural strategic partner, focusing on converging interests, complementary strengths and shared political will,” said an official. In their conversation on Wednesday, both leaders welcomed efforts towards further strengthening the India-EU Strategic Partnership for mutual prosperity, as well as for jointly addressing global issues, fostering stability, and promoting a rules-based order.","EU and India want to upgrade their 2004 strategic partnership with a new comprehensive agenda.

By making Europe the first testing ground, India is underlining its strategic intent - tying its innovation ambitions to a continent looking to diversify away from global supply chain tensions.Under the aegis of the ministry of education and guided by the principal scientific adviser, with IIT-Bombay as nodal institution, the ventures will span critical domains such as biotechnology, Industry 4.0, smart cities and mobility, AI and quantum computing, space and defence, semiconductors, agri-food technologies, medtech, sustainable energy, advanced materials and rare-earth minerals.The scale and timing of the initiative reflect a broader geopolitical recalibration.

After a specific promise and a clear SC order, the state is now going back on its undertaking to notify the pristine forest as a sanctuary on the specious ground of demarcating boundary.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""It appears that the Jharkhand govt is indulging not only in dilly dallying but playing tricks with the court.

This has been attained five years ahead of the target set under the country’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – climate action commitment – to the Paris Agreement.As of June 30, India’s installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources stood at242.8 GW – with the total installed capacity at484.8 GW. The CREA’s report noted that the country is expected to add another 16–17 GW of solar and wind capacity in the second half of 2025.Referring to the slowdown in India’s CO2 emission growth since 2024, the report said the largest contributor to the phenomenon was the power sector, which was responsible for 60% of the drop in emissions growth rates, when the first half of 2025 is compared to the years 2021-23.“Oil demand growth slowed sharply as well, contributing 20% of the slowdown. The only sectors to keep growing their emissions in the first half of 2025 were steel and cement production,” said the report. It attributed the CO2 emissions growth from steel and cement production, by 7% and 10%, respectively, to the government’s infrastructure spending.The report noted that the reduction in coal use, on the other hand, comes after more than a decade of break-neck growth, starting in the early 2010s and only interrupted by Covid in 2020. “While coal-power generation is expected to flatline, large amounts of new coal-power capacity is still being planned, because of the expected growth in peak electricity demand,” it said.",India's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its power sector fell by 1% year-on- year in the first half of 2025.

Can life sentences be turned into fixed terms? SC to decide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-life-sentences-be-turned-into-fixed-terms-sc-to-decide/articleshow/123959326.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to examine whether a constitutional court can award a sentence of specific number of years to a convict in a heinous crime in substitution of life sentence imposed by a trial court, and said it was prima facie of the view that fixed term sentences could be handed down in lieu of death penalty.""Can a constitutional court convert a life sentence into a fixed term incarceration,"" asked a bench of CJI BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran while dealing with an appeal filed by a former Roman Catholic church vicar who was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for sexually assaulting a minor girl but the Kerala HC modified it to 20 years in jail without remission.The bench said it was primarily of the opinion that a fixed term sentence without remission could be awarded only in cases where a constitutional court maintains a person's conviction for a heinous offence but feels that the award of capital punishment was excessive as the case did not fall in the ""rarest of rare"" category.The bench said it will examine this question while dealing with the quantum of punishment to be awarded to former vicar Edwin Pigarez. In March last year, the HC had sentenced him to undergo incarceration of 20 years without remission. A fixed term sentence of 20 or 30 years or till the end of natural life of a convict in lieu of death sentence is awarded by constitutional courts as they are increasingly becoming averse to capital punishment, and at the same time, realise that imposition of life sentence would entitle a convict to seek remission of sentence after being lodged in jail for 14 years.Accepting senior advocate R Basant's plea for bail during pendency of his appeal, the CJI-led bench said the relief is being given as Pigarez has already undergone almost 10 years of imprisonment, which is half of the sentence imposed by the HC.Pigarez was convicted for sexually assaulting the class VIII girl several times between 2014 and 2015 at the presbytery. The girl was a parishioner at the church of which Pigarez was vicar then.The girl's mother had lodged a complaint with police on Apr 1, 2015. The trial court had convicted him under the IPC and several provisions of POCSO Act and sentenced him to life imprisonment.",Supreme Court agrees to examine whether a constitutional court can award a sentence of specific number of years to a convict in a heinous crime.

State treasury not important than health: PM

On Sept 17, his 75th birthday, PM Narendra Modi launched India's largest-ever health outreach programme for women and children, called the Swastha Nari Sashakt Parivar health initiative, and exhorted women to actively participate in the initiative.Under the initiative, the govt is going to organise more than 10 lakh health camps between Sept 17 and Oct 2 across all its health facilities, from Ayushman Arogya Mandirs to tertiary hospitals, to screen women for common health issues like anaemia, hypertension, diabetes and cancer. Some private hospitals have also volunteered to conduct camps to screen women for common health problems.""Today, I have come here to demand something from my mothers and sisters. All I ask is that you should attend these camps without any hesitation,"" the PM said. tnnTests and medicines are free. State treasury is not more important than your health,"" the PM said while speaking at the launch event in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh.Prime Minister Modi said women are the main foundation for national development. ""If a mother is healthy, the whole family stays healthy. A mother's health impacts the whole family. Therefore, this campaign is dedicated to mothers and sisters and for their healthy future,"" he added.Noting that sickle cell anaemia is a pertinent issue in the tribal regions of the country, the PM particularly appealed to tribal women to take advantage of the benefits available during the campaign period.He also stated that all tests and medicines in the health centres will be free of cost. ""Our resolve is that no mother or daughter should be left behind. Those who require further treatment can avail themselves of the protective cover (suraksha kavach) provided by the Ayushman cards,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also launched the Adi Karmyogi Abhiyan on the occasion. The Adi Karmyogi Abhiyan initiative will include a series of service-oriented activities in tribal regions focusing on health, education, nutrition and skill development.The government runs multiple programmes targeted towards improving women's health. However, multiple studies suggest poorer health indices among them as compared to men, especially in rural areas.The Union govt's latest initiative, jointly led by the health ministry and the ministry of women and child development, aims to provide women-centric preventive, promotive, and curative health services at the community level. ""The initiative will strengthen screening, early detection, and treatment linkages for non-communicable diseases, anaemia, tuberculosis, and sickle cell disease, while also promoting maternal, child, and adolescent health through antenatal care, immunisation, nutrition, menstrual hygiene, lifestyle and mental health awareness activities,"" a senior health ministry official said.","PM Narendra Modi launched India's largest-ever health outreach programme for women and children.

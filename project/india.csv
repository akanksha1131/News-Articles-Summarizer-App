"Red alert in North India: Dense fog in UP, Punjab and Haryana; Delhi AQI on brink of severe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-alert-in-north-india-dense-fog-in-up-punjab-and-haryana-delhi-aqi-on-brink-of-severe/articleshow/126069590.cms,"NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for the next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India, even as air quality in the national capital and surrounding regions remained in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category on Friday.According to the IMD, very dense fog is likely to prevail over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with Uttar Pradesh also expected to witness a very cold day. Dense to extremely dense fog has been forecast across Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar on December 19 and 20, and over Uttar Pradesh and Haryana during the early morning hours. The weather agency said fog conditions are likely to persist for the next two to three days, raising concerns over reduced visibility, travel delays and road safety.In Delhi, hazardous air conditions continued, with thick smog blanketing several areas, including Anand Vihar. The Commission for Air Quality Management activated all measures under GRAP Stage IV across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed the Air Quality Index at 442 in Ghazipur, 409 in ITO and 447 in Palam, placing these areas in the ‘severe’ category.The city’s overall AQI stood at 330 at 7.47 am, while earlier readings showed levels as high as 358 during the morning hours. At around 8 am, Delhi’s overall AQI was recorded at 387, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category.Authorities advised residents, particularly children, the elderly and people with respiratory ailments, to limit outdoor exposure as pollution continued to pose serious health risks.Dense fog also disrupted aviation operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, with flights being operated under CAT III conditions, leading to multiple delays. Delhi International Airport said low visibility was affecting flight schedules.“Dense fog is impacting flight schedules, and operations are currently under CAT III conditions. Our on-ground teams are working in close coordination with all stakeholders to assist passengers and provide necessary support across all terminals. For real-time flight updates, please reach out to your respective airlines. We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding,” the airport said in a statement.CAT III is a category of the Instrument Landing System that allows aircraft to land in extremely low visibility conditions and requires advanced equipment and specialised pilot training.IndiGo also issued a travel advisory, saying early-morning fog in Delhi and across parts of northern India was disrupting flight operations. “Early-morning fog in Delhi and across parts of northern India is reducing visibility and disrupting flight operations. We seek your understanding, as this is a seasonal occurrence, and flight movements are being managed accordingly to ensure safe and orderly operations. Customers travelling in the early hours may experience delays or revised timings. We recommend checking the latest flight status prior to leaving for the airport, goindigo.in/flight-status,” the airline said in a post on X.“Our teams are actively monitoring weather conditions and coordinating with air traffic authorities. Wherever possible, we are making operational adjustments to minimise inconvenience and ensure customer support remains available across all key touchpoints. We will keep you informed and get you on your way as soon as conditions permit,” the post added.On Thursday, 15 out of 40 air quality monitoring stations in Delhi recorded ‘severe’ pollution levels. Anand Vihar reported the highest AQI at 441, falling under the ‘severe-plus’ category, while 24 stations logged ‘very poor’ air quality, according to CPCB’s SAMEER app.As per official classification, AQI levels between 401 and 500 are considered ‘severe’, while readings above 300 indicate ‘very poor’ air quality.Data from the Decision Support System for Air Quality Management showed transport as the largest contributor to Delhi’s pollution at 18.3 per cent, followed by industries at 9.2 per cent. Residential sources contributed 4.5 per cent, construction activities 2.5 per cent, waste burning 1.6 per cent, road dust 1.3 per cent, other sectors 1.2 per cent and power generation around 1.2 per cent.Pollution from neighbouring NCR districts also added to Delhi’s air quality woes, with Jhajjar contributing 12.3 per cent, Sonipat 8.8 per cent, Rohtak 4.8 per cent, Jind 3.1 per cent, Bhiwani 1.4 per cent and Gurugram 1.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the IMD urged people to exercise caution, avoid unnecessary travel during foggy conditions and stay updated with local advisories over the next few days.","IMD issues red alert for next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India.

Supreme Court will talk to patient’s parents before deciding on passive euthanasia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-will-talk-to-patients-parents-before-deciding-on-passive-euthanasia/articleshow/126068799.cms,"Court asks two lawyers to meet & interact with Harish’s parents, siblings



NEW DELHI: Saying that time has come for it to decide on the passive euthanasia plea regarding 31-year-old Harish Rana, who has been in a vegetative state for the last 13 years, Supreme Court on Thursday decided to talk to his parents before it moves further in the matter.Significantly, the secondary report filed by AIIMS medical board, as was directed by SC, is similar to the primary medical board’s report, which had said that there is negligible chance of the man’s recovery.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan called AIIMS Delhi’s secondary medical report a “sad” one and said it wanted to talk to the parents in person before moving ahead.It requested them to come to court on Jan 13 when it would interact with them in the chamber. The court also directed its registry to furnish the AIIMS medical report to additional SG Aishwarya Bhati.The Supreme Court also directed its registry to furnish the AIIMS medical report additional SG and advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, who is appearing for Harish's father. “We have reached a stage wherein we will have to take a final call. So, your thorough assistance will be required. We will ask the registry to provide you with one copy of the report.Study the report. You will have to assist us. It's a very sad report, and it will be a big challenge for us also, but we can't keep the boy like this for all time to come,” it told both the lawyers.The bench also asked the two lawyers to meet and interact with Harish’s parents and his siblings to discuss the issue before the next date of hearing.“In pursuance of our last order dated Dec 11, a secondary medical board was constituted by AIIMS, New Delhi. The team of doctors medically examined the patient, and a report has been forwarded. The report consists of the medical history, general examination, neurological examination and other observations made and diagnostic criteria. We direct the registry to provide each copy to Ms Rashmi and Ms Aishwarya Bhati, learned ASG. We request them to look into the report and study the same and assist us in the report. We request them to jointly speak to the parents and other family members of Harish Rana and give us a report in that regard,” the bench said.As per the procedure framed by SC on passive euthanasia, a decision to withdraw artificial life support is to be made after the primary and secondary medical boards concur. In case of contradictory reports from the two, the matter is to be decided by court, which may constitute an independent committee to depute three doctors from the fields of general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry or oncology, with experience in critical care and with overall standing in the medical profession of at least 20 years.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor on Aug 20, 2013. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.Last week, the court went through the report of the primary medical board set up by Noida District Hospital and said, “The bare reading of the letter would indicate Harish is in a pathetic condition.”","Court asks two lawyers to meet & interact with Harish’s parents, siblings.

VB - G RAM G row: Opposition sleeps outside Parliament in protest - watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vb-g-ram-g-bill-opposition-stages-overnight-protest-in-parliament-over-mgnrega-replacement-video/articleshow/126067758.cms,"Lok Sabha Passes Viksit Bharat G Ram G Bill Amid Protests, Opposition Tears Copies Over Gandhi Name

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, or VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaces the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.The protest came hours after Parliament cleared the Bill amid noisy scenes and walkouts. The Rajya Sabha passed the legislation post midnight by a voice vote, following its approval by the Lok Sabha earlier in the day, even as opposition members demanded its withdrawal and sought its referral to a parliamentary panel.Opposition MPs accused the government of rushing the Bill through without adequate debate and of scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that, they said, supported crores of poor households. Several members walked out of the Upper House, raised slogans against the government and tore copies of the Bill, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose alleged that the government had “bulldozed” the legislation. “This is an insult to India's poor, it is an insult to Mahatma Gandhi, it is an insult to Rabindranath Tagore. With just five hours' notice, this bill was given to us.We were not allowed a proper debate,” she said.“Our demand was such an important bill should be sent to the Select Committee and let the opposition parties examine it, let the opposition parties discuss it, let all stakeholders discuss it, but no, in a display of tyranny, in a murder of democracy,” Ghose said, announcing the overnight protest. “We are now going to sit on a 12-hour dharna, 12-hour dharna against the manner in which the Modi government has brought this black law against the people of India, against the poor of India, against the rural poor of India. ”Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala described the development as a “sad day for the country's labour force” and alleged that the government had hit the livelihoods of millions. “This is perhaps the saddest day for the labourers of India. BJP government has attacked the livelihood of 12 crore people by repealing the MGNREGA . They have proved that the Modi government is anti-farmer and anti-poor,” he said.Congress leader Mukul Wasnik said the original law was framed after extensive consultations. “When MGNREGA was drafted, consultations were held for 14 months. It was passed by Parliament with consensus. The scheme would put an extreme burden on states. As a result, this scheme will collapse,” he said.DMK leader Tiruchi Siva accused the government of erasing Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. “Likewise they have removed Mahatma Gandhi's name himself. Without Gandhi there is no freedom, that is the total belief in this country. Even in Britain parliament we are having Gandhi statue, but here in Indian parliament his statue is hidden somewhere, and now the scheme which bore his name, his name has also been removed,” he said.Defending the legislation, Rural Development Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the new law was necessary to address shortcomings in the old scheme and to boost rural development. “This Bill is very necessary as it will help provide employment opportunities, help development of rural India and take the country forward,” he said while replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha.Chouhan accused the Congress of misusing Mahatma Gandhi’s name for political gains and of disrupting parliamentary proceedings. “I heard the opposition with patience all these hours and expected the opposition to hear my response to the discussion. Making their points, making allegations and running away is like murdering the dreams and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.“The entire nation is watching their 'goondagardi' and the opposition is committing the sin of insulting democracy. House 'dadagiri se nahin chalega',” the minister added.He also cited funding figures to defend the government’s record, claiming that while the previous UPA government released Rs 2.13 lakh crore for MGNREGA, the NDA had released nearly Rs 8.53 lakh crore. The opposition, however, maintained that the passage of the Bill without detailed scrutiny set a dangerous precedent and said it would take its protest against the law to the streets across the country.",Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

Can Andhra’s rare earth corridor fuel India’s clean-energy dreams?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-andhras-rare-earth-corridor-fuel-indias-clean-energy-dreams/articleshow/126067460.cms,"The mineral-rich belt forms an unbroken stretch along Andhra’s coastline (Picture credit: A Sarath Kumar)

Along Andhra Pradesh’s sweeping 974km coastline, the waves wash more than picturesque beaches and bustling fishing harbours. Beneath the dark, heavy sands — from Srikakulam in the north to Nellore in the south — lies one of India’s most valuable and underexploited geological assets: rare earth mineral reserves that could define the nation’s cleanenergy, defence and semiconductor future.These beach sands contain vast quantities of monazite, the primary source of rare earth elements (REEs) and thorium, along with ilmenite, rutile, zircon, garnet and sillimanite, making the state a rich natural repository of strategic minerals.What distinguishes Andhra’s reserves is not only their abundance, but also their grade. Monazite extracted along this coast carries 55-60% rare earth oxides — among the highest in global benchmarks — and 8-10% thorium, considered a potential fuel for India’s next-generation nuclear reactors.The ore houses a complete suite of light REEs such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium and gadolinium, elements that power permanent magnets essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, missile guidance, satellite systems, fibreoptics, superconductors and advanced medical diagnostics.The mineral-rich belt stretches like a continuous corridor. Geological surveys identify promising deposits at Bhimunipatnam, Kalingapatnam, Kakinada, Narsapur, Machilipatnam, Chirala, Vodarevu, Ramayapatnam and Dugarajapatnam, forming an uninterrupted chain of strategic material potential.Estimates by the Atomic Minerals Directorate and Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) place India’s total deposits at over 300 million tonnes of heavy mineral sands (sand deposits rich in dense, valuable minerals like ilmenite, rutile and zircon), with 12-15 million tonnes of monazite, enough to support 40-50% of domestic rare earth requirements for decades.Andhra is estimated to hold 3035% of India’s monazite reserves.For long, these beaches have remained underutilised, overshadowed by concerns around atomic regulation, limited processing capacity and policy restrictions. Now, with global supply chains tightening and countries scrambling to diversify away from China — which controls nearly 85% of global REE processing capacity — the state has quietly moved into strategic focus.Recognising the opportunity, the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) has stepped up exploration and monetisation efforts with renewed urgency. The Centre has granted 16,000 hectares of beach sand-mining leases to the corporation, marking one of the largest allocations for any state. Of this, operational clearance has been issued for 1,000 hectares, recently allotted to a private developer through open tender. Encouraged by potential revenue prospects, the state has sought approval to open another 4,000 hectares, after which the corporation plans to scale out activities across the remaining 11,000 hectares on a fast-track basis.APMDC’s shift is not confined to mining. The focus now is on value addition within India — crucial because exporting raw ore leads to importing high-value end products at a steep cost. “We are concentrating on downstream processing facilities to make the country self-reliant,” APMDC managing director and senior IAS officer Pravin Kumar told TOI, underlining the state’s aggressive roadmap. “Exporting raw minerals forces us to import finished rare earth magnets, chips and components at a high premium. The Centre’s PLI (production-linked incentive) will be a game changer.”At present, monazite processing remains the exclusive domain of IREL, a Central PSU operating under atomic mineral regulations. Private players can mine associated minerals such as garnet, ilmenite and zircon but must hand over monazite to IREL after separation. To increase domestic refining capacity, IREL is establishing a 10,000-tonne-perannum monazite processing plant at Gudur, Nellore, scheduled for commissioning in 2026. Once operational, it is expected to become a central pillar of India’s REE value chain.In a major policy intervention aimed at cutting import dependence and accelerating green-tech manufacturing, the ministry of mines has rolled out guidelines for pilot projects to recover critical minerals — including REEs — from mining waste, red mud, fly ash and industrial tailings. The programme, approved under the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM), earmarks funding of up to Rs 100 crore from the National Mineral Exploration and Development Trust (NMEDT) for recovery-oriented R&D and commercial pilots.The mission targets securing domestic supply of 24 strategic minerals such as neodymium, dysprosium, yttrium and cobalt, vital for EV batteries, solar wafers, turbines and missiles. “These guidelines mark a pivotal step towards converting waste into wealth,” said Geetika Sharma, director (projects), NMEDT. Pilot studies may receive 90% central funding, enabling partnerships across PSUs, academia, startups and private mining companies.This policy push is particularly advantageous for Andhra Pradesh. Though placer deposits have for decades supported India’s titanium and zircon industries, enormous quantities of tailings with recoverable REEs, thorium and uranium have remained unprocessed due to lack of technology and regulatory clarity.Andhra Pradesh already possesses early-stage infrastructure that could scale with the new policy. A private REE-processing plant in Anantapur is operational and handles thousands of tonnes annually. IREL runs a beach sand separation plant in Visakhapatnam, generating tailings suited for rare earth extraction using hydrometallurgical and solvent-extraction techniques. Officials estimate that reprocessing alone could unlock a Rs 5,000-crore annual opportunity through circular extraction.“Our monazite reserves can yield dysprosium for EV magnets and terbium for high-performance turbines,” a senior mines and geology department official toldTo ensure accountability, proposals will be screened by an inter-ministerial project sanctioning committee, while technical validation will come from experts at IITBombay, IIT-ISM Dhanbad and CSIR-IMMT Bhubaneswar. Implementation pathways will be led by Jawaharlal Nehru Aluminium Research Development and Design Centre, Nagpur for mining waste recovery projects and Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), under the Centre’s department of science and technology, for tech-driven pilots.The Andhra government is preparing applications to recover REEs from thermal plant fly ash in Nellore and Krishnapatnam, known to contain trace rare earths. Collaboration possibilities with IIT-Hyderabad, National Mineral Processing Laboratory (Jamshedpur) and geologists are being explored, especially around bio-leaching and electrochemical extraction.Scientists say tailings (ore residues) at Andhra Pradesh and comparable IREL operations in Kerala suggest that over 80% REE extraction is achievable with modern technology.DAR Subramanyam, a retired economics professor from Acharya Nagarjuna University, noted that rapid scale-ups can reduce India’s import dependence from 95% to nearly 50% within five years, provided commercial plants are deployed under the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) framework.With global REE demand expected to grow tenfold by 2030, Andhra stands positioned to emerge as the country’s critical-mineral capital.The first call for proposals under the PLI window is expected shortly, signalling what experts describe as the beginning of a mineral renaissance on the state’s shoreline.From being a silent geological marvel, Andhra’s beaches are on the cusp of powering India’s transition to clean mobility, renewable energy and advanced electronics. The sands are no longer just a coastal landscape — they are India’s next strategic frontier.","Andhra Pradesh is estimated to hold 3035% of India’s monazite reserves.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

Student loan forgiveness landscape growing narrower

With inputs from Forbes

Student loan borrowers in the United States scored a major legal victory this week after a federal judge unequivocally refused to grant the US Department of Education additional time to process long-pending student loan forgiveness claims under the landmark Sweet v. Cardona settlement, providing renewed hope for thousands of borrowers who have been waiting months, and in some cases years, for much-needed relief.As reported by, the ruling affects more than 200,000 borrowers who applied for loan discharge under the Borrower Defense to Repayment programme and have been waiting for years for a decision. The court’s refusal to allow an 18-month delay reinforces a hard January 2026 deadline for relief and sends a strong message on government accountability in student loan administration.Thecase originated as a class action lawsuit filed by student loan borrowers against the first Trump administration. Borrowers alleged that the US Department of Education, under then Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, had unlawfully stalled or arbitrarily denied Borrower Defense to Repayment applications—sometimes leaving claims unresolved for years.Borrower Defense to Repayment allows federal student loan borrowers to seek loan cancellation if their educational institution engaged in misconduct, including misleading claims about job prospects, earnings potential, admissions standards, credit transferability, or the true cost of programmes.After prolonged litigation, the case was resolved in 2022 under the Biden–Harris administration through a binding settlement agreement designed to apply regardless of future political changes.Under the Sweet settlement, borrowers fall into different groups depending on when they submitted their Borrower Defense applications. Those who applied by June 2022 were eligible for automatic or expedited relief. Another group—known as “Post-Class Applicants”—submitted claims between June and November 2022.As per the settlement terms, Post-Class Applicants are entitled to full loan forgiveness if the Education Department fails to process their applications by January 28, 2026. It was this deadline that the department attempted to push back.Last month, the department argued in court that limited staffing and administrative resources made it impossible to review the remaining 200,000 applications on time, and requested an 18-month extension.The court overseeing the settlement firmly rejected the request. In a bench ruling on Thursday, US District Judge William Alsup declined to modify the settlement timeline, siding with borrowers and their legal representatives.“The student loan has been hanging over their head for how many years, how many decades, wrecking their credit,” Judge Alsup said during the hearing, according to. “It’s just not right.”Legal advocates for borrowers welcomed the decision. Eileen Connor, President and Executive Director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending (PPSL), which represents borrowers in the case, said the ruling reaffirmed borrowers’ right to timely justice after years of uncertainty.Following the court’s decision, the Department of Education must adhere to strict timelines. Borrower Defense claims from Post-Class Applicants who attended institutions on a court-approved list must be processed by January 28, 2026. If the department fails to meet this deadline, affected borrowers will automatically qualify for full settlement relief, including cancellation of eligible federal student loans and refunds of past payments.The department has until April 15, 2026, to complete reviews of all remaining Post-Class applications.The ruling comes at a time when federal student loan forgiveness options in the US are becoming more limited. As noted by, recent legislative and regulatory changes backed by congressional Republicans have weakened borrower-friendly rules governing the Borrower Defense programme.In addition, the Education Department has entered into a separate settlement that will eliminate the SAVE income-driven repayment plan, a Biden-era initiative designed to reduce monthly payments and accelerate loan forgiveness for eligible borrowers.Against this backdrop, the Sweet settlement remains one of the most consequential avenues for relief—making the court’s refusal to delay its implementation especially significant for hundreds of thousands of borrowers still awaiting resolution.","Federal court rejects US student loan forgiveness delay, clearing the way for relief to over 200,000 borrowers under the Sweet settlement.

MEA: Reasons are ‘personal’, diaspora an asset





No dual citizenship a key factor





Post-Covid surge, not just backlog





Who is leaving - and why





Remittances high, but concerns persist





NEW DELHI: Close to one million Indians have renounced their citizenship over the last five years, with annual numbers crossing the two-lakh mark consistently since 2022, according to data presented by the government in Parliament.The trend has reignited a crucial question why a growing number of Indians - particularly the wealthy and highly skilled - are choosing to give up their Indian passports.Responding to questions raised by Congress MP KC Venugopal in the Lok Sabha, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that 2.06 lakh Indians gave up citizenship in 2024, following 2.16 lakh in 2023 and 2.25 lakh in 2022. Earlier, 1.63 lakh renunciations were recorded in 2021, while the figure stood at 85,256 in 2020, the lowest in a decade due to Covid-related disruptions.Between 2011 and 2024, a total of over 20.6 lakh Indians renounced citizenship, with nearly half of them doing so in just the last five years, the government presented data during the ongoing winter session showed.Venugopal sought details on whether the government had studied the reasons behind the rising trend and what steps were being taken to curb citizenship renunciation, particularly among younger Indians.The issue has also been raised by other opposition leaders in recent years, who have flagged what they describe as a growing “exit of the successful” from India.Leading opposition members including TMC MP Mahua Moitra have previously as well questioned the government as to why people are renouncing Indian passports. During a debate on the economy she had asked whether this indicated a ""healthy economic environment"" or a ""healthy tax environment"". Moitra alleged that an ""atmosphere of terror"" created by the enforcement directorate (ED), with investigations primarily targeting opposition leaders and businessmen, was a contributing factor.Sanjaya Baru, media adviser to former PM Manmohan Singh, in his book ‘Secession of the Successful’, argued that India is witnessing a fourth wave of emigration, marked by the departure of high net worth individuals (HNIs), their families, and elite professionals. Citing Morgan Stanley data, Baru noted that around 23,000 Indian millionaires left the country between 2014 and 2023.Opposition leaders have repeatedly questioned whether rising wealth migration reflects concerns over quality of life, governance, education, taxation and long-term security, especially when compared to developed economies.In its written reply, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said the reasons for renunciation are personal and known only to the individuals concerned.“The Government recognises the potential of the global workplace in an era of knowledge economy,” the MEA said, adding that a successful and influential Indian diaspora is an asset. It added that the government’s focus was on engaging the diaspora and leveraging its expertise and soft power, rather than discouraging overseas citizenship.The MEA also placed on record a list of 135 countries whose citizenship Indians have acquired, underlining the global spread of the trend.One of the most cited reasons for Indians giving up citizenship is India’s lack of dual citizenship. Under Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, any Indian who voluntarily acquires foreign citizenship automatically loses Indian citizenship.For Indians abroad, citizenship often decides access to voting rights, social security, permanent residence, public-sector employment and legal protections. While Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status allows visa-free travel and limited economic rights, it does not give much of political rights.As a result, many long-term migrants - especially those with families - are left with little choice but to formally renounce Indian citizenship.While the sharp jump in 2022 was partly attributed to pandemic-era backlogs, the continuation of high numbers in 2023 and 2024 suggests a new baseline, analysts say.Before the pandemic, annual renunciations largely remained within a range of 1.2 lakh to 1.45 lakh for nearly a decade.Though occupation-wise data is not available, global studies show that Indians form one of the world’s largest skilled migrant populations. According to the UN, India has remained the largest source country of international migrants, with a diaspora of 17.5 million as of 2019.In the US alone, 81 per cent of Indian immigrants aged 25 and above hold at least a bachelor’s degree, significantly higher than both native-born and other immigrant groups, according to the Migration Policy Institute.Migrants often cite better pay, cleaner environments, reliable infrastructure, stronger civic services, education systems and clearer pathways to residency and citizenship abroad. For many, citizenship becomes the final step in a long migration journey that begins with education and employment.India remains the world’s top recipient of remittances, receiving an estimated $125 billion in 2023, according to the World Bank. However, opposition leaders argue that the steady outflow of citizens/ brain drain - especially among the affluent and skilled - calls for the need for reforms in urban living conditions, public health, education, social security and income parity.As renunciation numbers moves upwards of two lakh annually, the issue is likely to remain a political and policy flashpoint, particularly amid concerns over talent retention and long-term economic competitiveness.","2.06 lakh Indians gave up citizenship in 2024, following 2.16 lakh in 2023 and 2.25 lakh in 2022.

Bengaluru water crisis

Why is India running out of water?



Rising demand: India’s water demand is expected to outstrip supply by 2030

Agricultural overuse: Water-intensive crops like paddy in Punjab and Haryana

Encroachment of water bodies: Lakes and ponds disappearing, especially in cities like Bengaluru

Climate change: Erratic monsoons and declining river flows

Pollution: Industrial waste, sewage, and mining contaminating groundwater

Weak regulation: Outdated laws like the Easement Act of 1882, which ties groundwater ownership to land

Fragmented governance: Separate authorities for surface and groundwater management

Public apathy: Water treated as a free, unlimited resource

Groundwater overuse and contamination



Nearly 70% of groundwater sources are contaminated

India ranks 120th out of 122 countries on the global water quality index

Over-exploited (>100%): Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan

Critical (90–100%): Delhi

High stress (70–90%): Tamil Nadu and Puducherry

Moderate to low stress (<70%): All remaining states and UTs, including Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and several northeastern states.

Behind this lies a darker reality, an informal and often illegal groundwater trade.

In a narrow lane of India, men and women wait quietly with plastic drums lined in rows. Some squat, some sit, with eyes fixed on the bend ahead.Suddenly, the silence breaks. A water tanker reverses into the alley, its engine drowning out the waiting. Young men rush forward, climbing atop the truck, lowering pipes into the tank. Within moments, quiet order unravels into chaos.Hundreds of kilometres away, in rural India, women walk long distances to empty wells, dried-up tubewells and shrinking water bodies, hoping to find a few litres of water.Just because some cities suffered floods doesn’t mean you have water. For a country that supports nearly 17% of the world’s population with just 4% of its freshwater resources, water scarcity has become a daily reality, and not just a distant threat.With India’s population expected to rise from 1.3 billion to nearly 1.7 billion by 2050, the question is no longer whether India is facing a water crisis.But how soon parts of the country will run out!A water crisis occurs when the availability of safe, usable water falls short of demand. The World Bank defines water scarcity as a situation where annual per capita water availability drops below 1,000 cubic metres.India is steadily moving towards this threshold.Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, India has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources. According to NITI Aayog's Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), the country is facing the worst water crisis in its history, with nearly 600 million people experiencing high to extreme water stress.India’s per capita water availability stood at 1,486 cubic metres in 2021, placing it in the water-stressed category (below 1,700 cubic metres). Government estimates suggest this could fall further to 1,341 cubic metres by 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres by 2050, pushing large parts of the country closer to scarcity.Globally, freshwater reserves have declined sharply over the last two decades, with losses estimated at 324 billion cubic metres every year, enough to meet the annual water needs of 280 million people.According to the Union minister of Jal Shakti releases Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report of the Country for the Year 2025, “Groundwater assessment units across India are categorised as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited, based on the ratio of annual groundwater extraction and replenishment in the phreatic aquifer. The assigned categories aid in planning, management, and regulation of the country's groundwater resources. ”Water consumption worldwide increased by 25% between 2000 and 2019, with nearly a third of that growth occurring in already water-stressed regions, the report stated.Northern India figures prominently among these drying zones, alongside parts of northern China, Central America and the southwestern United States. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, worsening droughts and unsustainable land and water use have accelerated the decline.For India, the implications are stark. Agriculture, livelihoods, urban growth and ecological sustainability all hinge on groundwater, the country’s most heavily used and least regulated water source.Groundwater forms the backbone of India’s water security. According to the 2019 NITI Aayog report, the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) stated that the contribution of groundwater is nearly 62% in irrigation, 85% in rural water supply and 45% in urban water supply.Yet this invisible lifeline is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment 2025, India’s total annual groundwater recharge stands at 448.52 billion cubic metres (bcm).After accounting for natural discharge, the annual extractable resource is estimated at 407.75 bcm. Current extraction has reached 247.22 bcm, pushing the national stage of groundwater extraction to about 60.6%.While the national average may suggest moderate stress, the reality on the ground is far more uneven.Out of the total 6,762 assessment units, around 25% have been categorised as Overexploited, Critical, or Semi-Critical. These are areas where extraction is approaching or exceeding natural recharge, a warning sign that aquifers are under severe stress.States with the highest proportion of over-exploited and critical units include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In Punjab, groundwater extraction stands at over 156% of annual recharge. Rajasthan follows closely at 147%, while Delhi’s extraction level exceeds 90%, placing it in the critical category.Urban centres are not immune.Chennai already experienced ‘day zero’ in June 2019, when all four major reservoirs of the big city reservoirs ran dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas.A BBC report, citing UN projections, ranked Bengaluru second after Brazil’s São Paulo, among 11 global cities at risk of running out of drinking water. As water levels drop and summer temperatures rise, cities are imposing restrictions.Lakhs of residents across the 'city of dreams,' Mumbai are too grappling with acute water scarcity. In Bengaluru, authorities have banned the use of potable water for non-essential activities such as washing cars and watering gardens. Yet questions remain over whether fines and regulations alone can avert a full-blown crisis.In rural areas, the crisis manifests differently, in longer walks for water, abandoned wells and failed crops.Experts point to multiple, interconnected causes:India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, accounting for over 25% of global groundwater extraction. The consequences are severe:Groundwater extraction in India is assessed using data from the Minor Irrigation Census and sample surveys conducted by State Ground Water Departments. According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, the country’s total annual groundwater extraction is estimated at 247.22 billion cubic metres (bcm).The agriculture sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 87% of total extraction, or 215.10 bcm. Domestic use contributes 11% (27.89 bcm), while industrial use accounts for the remaining 2% (4.23 bcm).Water-intensive cropping patterns, such as paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, and it continues to strain aquifers, even in regions where rainfall is relatively adequate. As India’s population grows and incomes rise, food demand is expected to surge.According to the NITI report, India’s population is expected to increase to 1.66 billion by 2050. At the same time, per capita income is estimated to increase by 5.5% per annum. With increasing population and purchasing power, the annual food requirement in the country will exceed 250 million tons by 2050. The total demand for grains will increase to 375 million tons including grain for feeding livestock by 2050.”“This will increase the demand for food. The surge in demand for these water-intensive crops will, ceteris paribus, multiply our current agricultural consumption of water,” it added.Despite a national average that masks local crises, groundwater stress is highly concentrated. More than 25% of administrative units fall under over-exploited, critical or semi-critical categories in nine states and UTs: Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Puducherry.These regions face the highest risk of aquifer depletion, underscoring the urgent need for targeted groundwater management, crop diversification and demand-side interventions.Rainfall remains the primary source of groundwater recharge in India, but its distribution varies widely across regions and seasons. Most of the country receives rainfall during the southwest monsoon, while long dry spells dominate the rest of the year.Groundwater levels typically fall before the monsoon and recover partially during and after it. However, CGWB data shows that in 2024, more than 57% of monitored wells recorded a fall in water levels compared to the previous year, with significant declines observed in states such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Geology further complicates the picture.According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, Karnataka’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 19.27 bcm, while extractable resources stand at 17.41 bcm. While recharge and extractable resources have increased marginally from 2024, extraction has also risen slightly. Overall, the state has seen a modest improvement, with extraction levels dropping from 68.44% in 2024 to 66.49% in 2025.Central Maharashtra, a drought-prone region receiving only 400–700 mm of rainfall annually, remains heavily dependent on groundwater. The state’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 33.89 bcm, with extractable resources of 31.99 bcm. Extraction stands at 16.57 bcm, translating to a stage of extraction of 51.79% — a slight improvement from 2024.Punjab remains among the most over-exploited states. Its annual groundwater extraction (26.27 bcm) far exceeds its extractable resource (16.8 bcm), pushing the stage of groundwater extraction to 156.36%.Although extraction has marginally declined from 2024, the state continues to draw far more water than it replenishes, largely due to water-intensive agriculture.Rajasthan’s groundwater situation is similarly alarming. With an annual extraction of 17.10 bcm against extractable resources of 11.62 bcm, the stage of extraction stands at 147.11%. Despite slight improvements in recharge, over-extraction remains entrenched.Delhi’s groundwater extraction stands at 92.10%, placing it in the critical category. While extraction has reduced slightly since 2024, the city remains heavily dependent on groundwater to meet domestic demand.address India’s growing water crisis, the government has rolled out a series of initiatives aimed at conservation, recharge, and equitable access to water. One of the key programmes is the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), launched in 2019 as a nationwide movement to promote water conservation, groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting.Another major intervention is the Atal Bhujal Yojana, which emphasises sustainable groundwater management through community participation, improved recharge and regulated extraction.In urban areas, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 supports rainwater harvesting through stormwater drainage systems and promotes groundwater recharge via aquifer management plans.The Centre has also launched the Amrit Sarovar initiative, under which 50,000 water bodies, each roughly one acre in size, are being developed across the country to enhance local water storage and recharge.To improve transparency and monitoring, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has developed a GIS-based public platform called the India Groundwater Resource Estimation System (IN-GRES). The portal visualises groundwater recharge, extraction, rainfall and categorisation at the level of individual assessment units, allowing comparisons with previous years.Yet, even as policies and programmes expand on paper, a parallel and troubling reality persists.India’s water crisis is not just about scarcity, but governance. Groundwater ownership laws dating back to the Easement Act of 1882 allow landowners to extract water beneath their land with few restrictions.Fragmented water management, weak enforcement and limited public awareness have allowed overuse to continue unchecked.While government initiatives, from the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana to large-scale rainwater harvesting and aquifer mapping programmes, aim to reverse the trend, experts may warn that without behavioural change and strict regulation, these measures may not be enough.Water budgeting, which treats water like a financial account, balancing availability against demand is also increasingly being seen as a crucial tool to identify stressed regions before they reach breaking point.Tankers extract water from over-exploited aquifers, frequently without regulation or quality checks, accelerating depletion while raising concerns over contamination.For now, the scenes of tankers, queues and dried wells serve as a warning. India may not be out of water yet, but in many places, it is running out of time. This underground trade, operating largely unchecked risks pushing India towards a long-term groundwater collapse tomorrow.","NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

India Flags Pakistan Role In Bangladesh Protests, Backs Awami League Demand For Free & Fair Polls

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary standing committee on external affairs has warned that India is facing its most significant strategic challenge since the 1971 war, due to the evolving political and security situation in Bangladesh, pointing to the resurgence of Islamist forces, weakening domestic political structures and growing influence of China and Pakistan in Dhaka.The committee on Thursday tabled its 9th report titled ‘Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship’ in the Lok Sabha. The panel, chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , said that while the situation does not pose an immediate existential threat to India, it represents a deeper, long-term strategic test with implications for regional stability and India’s neighbourhood policy.“India faces its greatest strategic challenge in Bangladesh since the Liberation war of 1971. While the challenge in 1971 was existential, a humanitarian and a birth of a new nation, the latter was of a graver, a generational discontinuity, a shift of political order, and a potential strategic realignment away from India,” the report said quoting an expert.The committee took into account multiple testimonies from government officials and non-governmental experts, the panel also noted that Bangladesh’s ongoing political transition and shifting external alignments could reshape India’s security and foreign policy environment over time.According to the panel, a key source of uncertainty is the declining political dominance of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League. While the party secured 224 of 300 seats in the January 2024 elections, the panel flagged an estimated voter turnout of around 40 per cent, which raises concerns over popular participation, political legitimacy, institutional control and public confidence.On the stay of former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina in India the panel said, ""The Committee note that the stay of former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, in the country and India's approach in this regard is guided by its civilisational ethos and humanitarian tradition of offering refuge to individuals facing circumstances of grave distress or existential threat,"" the report said.”The panel recommended that the government should ""continue to uphold its principled and humanitarian approach"", consistent with India's values and international responsibilities, while ensuring that such situations are ""managed with due sensitivity"".The committee also pointed towards the emergence of youth-led nationalist sentiment alongside a renewed presence of Islamist groups, warning that the combination could act as a destabilising force with implications for both Bangladesh’s internal security and the wider region.Another major concern flagged by the panel is the expanding footprint of China and Pakistan in Bangladesh. It said these developments could dilute India’s traditional influence in Dhaka and complicate New Delhi’s strategic calculus in its immediate neighbourhood.“...The event was marked by collapse of Awami League dominance, the surge of youth-led nationalism, the re-entry of Islamists and intensifying Chinese and Pakistani influence collectively..if India fails to recalibrate at this moment, it risks losing strategic space in Dhaka not to war, but to irrelevance,” report added.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India has made concerted efforts to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments and to continue engagement with Bangladesh’s interim government, while supporting the wishes of the Bangladeshi people.On the question of collaboration between both nations, the route through SAARC and BIMSTEC also came up to which the foreign secretary told the panel, until Pakistan changes its state policy of cross border terrorism there can be no conversation around reviving SAARC.“We have made it very clear to anybody and everybody in SAARC who is coming up to us with proposals for reviving it that we cannot have dialogue and terrorism go on at the same time. Until Pakistan changes its policy of crossborder terrorism as an instrument of State policy, there is no possibility of going forward with SAARC. I did make the point also that BIMSTEC does pretty much everything that SAARC does and then some other things and since the organisation is headquartered in Dhaka, it would be useful if Bangladesh takes it forward. I must say that there was no pushback against it….” the report quoted foreign secretaryThe panel, however, questioned why Indian authorities failed to anticipate the political crisis despite what it described as warning signals and extensive media reporting ahead of the developments. In response, the government said the situation in Bangladesh is being monitored on a priority basis with continuous assessments underway.Concluding its report, the committee stressed that Bangladesh’s evolving political trajectory and external alignments would require sustained attention from India, given the country’s central role in regional stability.In its suggestions the committee said, “The Committee urge the Government to continue advocating a democratic, stable, peaceful, people-centric, forward-looking and inclusive Bangladesh, firmly anchored in the spirit of 1971 and mutual respect. The Committee further recommend that the Government should maintain sustained diplomatic engagement with all political, social, and civil society stakeholders in Bangladesh to foster an environment of trust and dialogue. Such engagement should be complemented by Track II and Track 1.5 diplomacy, involving Parliamentary exchanges, think tanks, academia, media, and cultural organizations, to strengthen people-to-people connections and counter misperceptions.”","The committee on Thursday tabled its 9th report titled ‘Future of India- Bangladesh Relationship’ in the Lok Sabha. The panel, chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, said that while the situation does not pose an immediate existential threat to India, it represents a deeper, long-term strategic test.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126059893,imgsize-1486742,width-400,resizemode-4/anti-india-protest-in-bangladesh-led-to-temporary-shutdown-of-two-indian-visa-consulates-ani.jpg"

Rahul Gandhi’s fading charm

NEW DELHI: The Congress 's internal churn burst into the open again recently after former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.Similar concerns were raised in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections this year in November, where the distance between the ""leadership"" and the workers was on display during seat distribution talks.Since its formation in 1885, the Congress has had problem of plenty. There were too many popular leaders, too many dedicated party workers and too many loyal supporters during the country’s freedom struggle.After Independence, the country rallied behind Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress, helping the party win almost every election. To its credit, the party served as a broad canopy under which different ideologies co-existed.Cut to the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election: everything seemed to go against the grand old party. After a 10-year run at the Centre, the Congress found itself reeling under corruption charges, anti-incumbency and a sudden exodus of senior leaders just ahead of the polls. The final nail in the coffin was the ""Modi wave"", which helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sweep away the general election.Since then, the stars have not aligned for the Congress. The party continues to face more or less the same problems it did a decade ago. It remains plagued by infighting, disillusioned workers and senior leaders jumping ship after flagging serious leadership issues.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran ""is unable to resonate with India's youth.""In his five-page letter, he also complained that he had not been granted an audience with Rahul Gandhi for almost three years. “This is not a personal grievance … but a reflection of a wider emotional disconnect felt by workers across India, who feel unseen and unheard,” he wrote.This is not the first time a party leader has complained about not getting an audience with the Congress scion. The list has only grown longer. Leaders such as Himanta Biswa Sarma, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Jitin Prasada have quit the Congress and joined rival parties after raising similar concerns.This raises a key question: why are so many leaders disgruntled with the grand old party, and why is it steadily losing its cadre across states?After suffering a debacle in the 2014 general election at the hands of the BJP, the Congress has lost more elections than it has won. Even after a promising performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the party soon lost steam.The sharpest slide came in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, where the Congress was reduced to just 16 seats. In Bihar, its tally halved from 12 to six, while in Haryana - where it hoped to convert Lok Sabha momentum into victory - it slipped from 42 to 37. Even in Delhi, where the Congress was trying to claw back to relevance, the party drew a blank for the third consecutive time.The only two states where the Congress did marginally better - Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand - were ones where it fought as a junior partner in a coalition.In political alliances, chemistry between parties is paramount. Historically, however, many regional parties allied with the Congress were either born out of splits from it or emerged from anti-Congress sentiment.This unequal match often creates friction for the grand old party. For instance, the Congress’s alliance with the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir appeared to be on the brink of collapse following sharp differences.Chief minister Omar Abdullah has, on several occasions, publicly expressed displeasure over the Congress’s decision to launch a campaign for the restoration of statehood without consulting its ally.Similarly, the Congress’s relationship with the Aam Aadmi Party has been turbulent within the INDIA bloc. After prolonged seat-sharing negotiations and resistance from the Congress’s Delhi unit, the two parties fought together in Delhi, Gujarat and Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls, but against each other in Punjab.Last year, they failed to reach a consensus on seat-sharing in the Haryana Assembly elections and contested separately. In the Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year as well, both parties fought a bitter battle, raising questions over how the two would function as allies within the INDIA bloc.In such situations, party workers on the ground - wired to defend their own party - often find themselves confused while coordinating with alliance partners who hold opposing ideological positions.The Congress 'high command' is also frequently accused of taking too long to act when power tussles erupt within state units.As an ongoing standoff between Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar forces the leadership into repeated deliberations, no decisive call has yet been taken.Similar leadership tussles played out in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where factionalism among state leaders eventually contributed to the party losing power. The common thread across these states has been the Congress leadership’s reluctance to act decisively in battles between the old guard and younger turks.In Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot - who as state president had led the party to a decisive victory in 2018 - staked claim to the chief minister’s post. The party, however, backed veteran Ashok Gehlot, who had led the Congress to defeat in 2013. Pilot and his supporters were left disappointed. When he intensified his campaign for the top job, Gehlot used his influence to quell the rebellion. Though the Gandhi family persuaded Pilot to stay, the high command’s bet on Gehlot failed, with the party losing the state in 2024.Several Congress leaders, including Sanjay Nirupam, have alleged that the party suffers from multiple power centres, each backed by its own lobby.Expelled from the party in 2024, Nirupam claimed there was no future for the Congress and accused the leadership of “tremendous arrogance”.“Earlier there was one power centre in the Congress. Now there are five - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Mallikarjun Kharge and general secretary KC Venugopal. All have their own lobbies, which keep clashing. In the middle of this, lakhs of workers like me are stuck,” Nirupam had said.In the Bihar assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi once again failed to make an impact. His Voter Adhikar Yatra, launched just days before polling, did not turn out to be the trump card the party was hoping it would. His repeated attacks on the Election Commission and allegations of “vote theft” also failed to resonate with voters.After the yatra, Rahul remained largely absent, returning to the campaign trail only in the last leg. His absence became a major issue amid unrest within party ranks, with leaders alleging discrepancies in ticket distribution.As the polls approached, cracks within the Congress’s Bihar unit resurfaced. Rebel leaders, including several MLAs, staged protests after being denied tickets and demanded the immediate replacement of the party’s Bihar in-charge, Krishna Allavaru, with a “political” appointee. As expected, the writing was on the wall and the party emerged as the weakest link in its alliance, recording the lowest strike rate among the major partners.The Congress seems to be mired in a cycle of post-mortems, exits, and letters for the time being, while its rival BJP is busy expanding its presence on the ground. As the five states/UT, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, gear up for the high-stakes elections next year, the real test no longer remains about winning for Congress, but whether the party can still reform itself in time.","Former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party. Similar concerns were raised in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections this year in November. The party continues to face more or less the same problems it did a decade ago.

Dhaka assures foreign missions of 'robust security'

NEW DELHI: India resumed operations at its visa application centre in Bangladesh's Dhaka on Thursday, a day after the facility was temporarily shut following a march by a large group of anti-India protesters towards the Indian High Commission, which was stopped by police.“The Indian Visa Application Centre (IVAC) in Dhaka is now operational and functioning normally,” an IVAC official told news agency PTI.However, the visa facilities in Khulna and Rajshahi were closed due to ""security concerns."" In a notice on its website, the IVAC said, “In view of the ongoing security situation, IVAC Rajshahi and Khulna will remain closed today. All applicants with appointments scheduled for today will be allotted fresh slots at a later date.”Bangladesh has five visa centres for those applying to travel to India. While the Dhaka centre - located at Jamuna Future Park in the country's capital and largest city - and the IVAC in Chattogram - the second-largest city - are currently operational, the facilities in Khulna and Rajshahi are closed. The fifth one is in Sylhet.Earlier on Wednesday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) summoned Bangladesh's high commissioner to India, Riaz Hamidullah, and conveyed its “strong concern” over announcements by certain extremist elements to create a security situation around the Indian mission in Dhaka.“We expect the interim government to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations,” the MEA said, adding that the envoy was apprised of India’s “strong concerns about the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh.”Hamidullah was also told that New Delhi expects the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations.In Dhaka, hundreds of protesters under the banner of “July Oikya” (July Unity) began a march towards the Indian High Commission on Wednesday afternoon, raising anti-India slogans and pressing several demands, including an end to what they described as “anti-Bangladesh conspiracies” and the return of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.Hasina fled Bangladesh last year following the student-led “July Uprising” against her government. After resigning and leaving the country on August 5, she has since been living in New Delhi.Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s foreign secretary, Asad Alam Siam, met foreign diplomats on Thursday, assuring them of the security of their missions and the maintenance of law and order ahead of the national election scheduled for February 12 next year, the Daily Star reported Foreign diplomats were also informed that the Election Commission would ""welcome"" election observers from abroad.Around 40 diplomats from the embassies located in Dhaka were present at the briefing.","India resumed operations at its visa application centre in Bangladesh's Dhaka on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday announced that the state government’s job scheme ‘Karmashree’ will be renamed after Mahatma Gandhi , saying she felt “ashamed” that the Father of the Nation’s name was being removed from welfare scheme at the national level.Speaking at a public event, Banerjee said the scheme, which provides 75 to 100 days of employment, would be renamed to honour Mahatma Gandhi, asserting that the state would uphold the legacy of national leaders if the Centre fails to do so.“We have started a scheme ‘Karmashree’, Gandhi ji name is not there. I’m really sorry, I'm ashamed.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

What was the controversy?

Opposition calls it 'cheap mentality':

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh on Thursday defended Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar after a video showing him pulling down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme went viral. He claimed that there was “nothing wrong” in the chief minister’s action.On reportedly being asked about the woman at the centre of the row may refuse to take up the government job, Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell”. He added that Kumar “has done nothing wrong” and framed the incident as a procedural act.“Whether she refuses the job or goes to hell, that is her choice,” Singh said.Defending Nitish, the union minister argued that the incident should not be viewed through a religious lens and described the chief minister’s action as that of a guardian verifying identity at an official function.“If someone is going to collect an appointment letter, should they not show their face? Is this some Islamic country? Nitish Kumar acted as a guardian,” Singh said.Drawing parallels with other official procedures, he added, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India.In India, the rule of law prevails.”The controversy stems from an incident earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme for newly recruited AYUSH doctors at the chief minister’s residence in Patna.A video shared by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on X shows Nitish Kumar on stage alongside deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey.When a woman doctor, identified as Nusrat Parveen, approached the stage with her face covered by a hijab, Kumar appeared displeased, remarked “What is this?”, bent down and pulled the veil down.The woman was seen visibly flustered as an official moved her aside, while Samrat Choudhary appeared to tug at Kumar’s sleeve, seemingly trying to restrain him.According to the Chief Minister’s Office, the programme involved the distribution of appointment letters to 1,283 AYUSH doctors, including Ayurveda, Homeopathy and Unani practitioners, with only 10 receiving letters in person and the rest online.The incident and union minister's comments drew sharp criticism from opposition parties. Congress MP Tariq Anwar called Singh’s statement indicative of a “cheap mentality” and condemned Kumar’s action as “shameful and saddening”.""These are third-rate people, they have a cheap mindset. They dont understand that our country is secular. Everyone is free to practice their religion. What Nitish Kumar has done is shameful and saddening,"" Anwar said.Reacting to Singh's statement, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said: ""This is exactly what we can expect from the BJP. If it had been a Hindu woman from Rajasthan or Haryana, wearing a veil, and I had removed it, would the BJP have said the same thing? Imagine the uproar if a Muslim leader had removed the veil of a Hindu woman. But now, because it was a Muslim woman doctor, the BJP's reaction is different. What else can we expect from them?""Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Iltija Mufti also expressed outrage, saying such remarks and acts are deeply offensive to Muslim women.""Only phenyl will work to clean this man's filthy mouth. You dare not touch the hijabs & naqabs of our Muslim mothers and sisters. Otherwise we Muslim women will set you right by teaching you a lesson you and your ilk will remember for all times to come,"" she said in a post on X.NCP (SP) MP Fauzia Khan also hit out at both leaders.""It is very saddening that responsible people do such acts, this will send a wrong message in the world. It is a personal decision of a woman as to how much she covers up and removing the veil is akin to disrobing a woman. He (Kumar) should have given a pubic apology but instead of that they are saying that what happened was right,"" she said.RJD MP Manoj Jha said the visuals were “unsettling” and raised serious concerns, adding that such actions did not send a good message from the state’s top constitutional authority.The Congress also came down heavily on the Bihar chief minister, calling the act “shameless” and “vile” and demanding his resignation.Congress MP Sukhdeo Bhagat said the incident was condemnable and violated traditions and faith, while the party said publicly humiliating a woman at a government event raised questions about women’s safety and dignity.""This does not seem appropriate from any angle. Treating a woman like this is condemnable,” Bhagat said.Leaders from other opposition parties echoed similar concerns. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said no one, regardless of position, had the right to publicly humiliate an adult woman for her choice of attire, stressing that equality must be rooted in consent. The AAP also criticised the incident, warning against normalising control over women’s choices.Amid the outrage, the BJP sought to counter the criticism by sharing an old video of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot removing a woman’s ghoonghat, arguing that the opposition was being selective in its outrage. BJP leaders also accused opposition parties of politicising the issue for electoral gains.The row further escalated after Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad made controversial remarks defending Kumar, which were widely criticised as misogynistic.Nishad later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments, even as opposition parties continued to demand an unconditional apology.",Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence.

India Speeds Up Visas For Chinese Businesses Amid Thaw In Ties; Beijing Calls It 'Positive Move'

Also Read |

China is reportedly pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, a move that experts and officials warn could seriously endanger water security, ecology and livelihoods downstream in India. As the river enters India as the Brahmaputra, any large-scale intervention upstream is seen as a direct risk to millions who depend on its natural flow.According to CNN, the proposed $168bn hydropower system will harness a steep 2,000 metre drop in altitude through an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and underground power stations.For India, the concern is not just environmental.Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu had warned that the project could be used as a “ticking water bomb”, with China potentially controlling the timing and volume of water released into the Brahmaputra. Sudden discharges could trigger floods, while withholding water could dry out large stretches of the river during critical periods.Minister of state for external affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh in August had issued a statement on the project stating that they are consistently monitoring the developments related to the Brahmaputra river.""The Government of India has taken note of reports about the commencement of construction of the mega dam project by China on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (upper reaches of the Brahmaputra) River in Tibet.This project was first made public as far back as 1986 and since then, preparations have been underway in China,"" the MEA had stated in response to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha.The MEA said that the government remained committed to safeguarding Indian interests in the region.""Government carefully monitors all developments relating to the Brahmaputra river, including plans by China to develop hydropower projects, and takes necessary measures to protect our interests, including preventive and corrective measures to safeguard life and livelihood of Indian citizens residing in downstream areas,"" the statement said.Much of the Brahmaputra’s water comes from monsoon rains and tributaries within India. However, CNN reports expert's claim that upstream manipulation can still disturb the river’s natural rhythm. Even limited changes could affect fertile floodplains, fisheries and groundwater recharge across Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, regions already vulnerable to climate stress.China has dismissed these concerns, as the Chinese foreign ministry has insisted that downstream countries will not be adversely affected.The technical scale of the project has also heightened fears. CNN quotes Brian Eyler, director of the Energy, Water and Sustainability Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, has described it as the most sophisticated hydropower system ever attempted, but also one of the riskiest.Any failure or miscalculation in such a seismically sensitive and ecologically fragile region could have cascading consequences downstream.Beijing’s management of the Mekong River has drawn repeated criticism from downstream nations, which accuse Chinese dam operators of worsening droughts by regulating water flow to suit power generation needs.The upstream developments have prompted India’s largest state-run hydropower company to push ahead with its own 11,200-megawatt project on the Brahmaputra, a move driven partly by fears of losing strategic and water security ground.Experts warn that competing mega projects on the same river system could worsen risks for both countries. Without cooperation and transparency, analysts caution, a dam-building race between India and China could undermine regional stability and place the future of the Brahmaputra and the millions who rely on it in jeopardy.","China is reportedly pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Concerned about instances of poor quality and substandard work in several national highway (NH) projects, the office of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has sought details of all show-cause notices issued to contractors since Jan 2024, the responses received from companies and the action taken so far. Agencies have been directed to submit the details within 15 days.TOI has learnt that the minister’s office said that representations regarding poor-quality work had been submitted to officials concerned and that, in many cases, show-cause notices were issued.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Also Read |

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill amid sustained opposition protests, leading to repeated disruptions and the adjournment of the House after a ruckus.The Bill, which replaces the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act , seeks to provide a statutory guarantee of 125 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to undertake unskilled manual work.Moving the Bill for consideration and passage, Union rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the legislation would ensure employment and help fulfil Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of self-reliant villages. He said the VB-G RAM G Bill would ensure all-round development of villages, make them poverty-free and fuel their growth journey.Opposition parties, however, mounted a sharp attack on the government over the repeal and renaming of MGNREGA. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra accused the government of undermining Gandhi’s legacy. She said the Bill was destroying the idea of Ram Rajya both in letter and spirit by repealing MGNREGA and renaming the scheme.Moitra also accused the government of “dishonouring” Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore by removing Gandhi’s name from the landmark rural employment law. Taking a swipe at the ruling dispensation, she said the Bill showed that the government believed in “Na kisi ka saath, na kisi ka vikas, na Rahim ka, na Ram ka”.Opposing the Bill, she said the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 had revolutionised rural India’s concept of livelihood security.Congress MP Jai Prakash said removing the name of the Father of the Nation from the legislation was “the biggest crime”. He claimed the proposed law would create fresh financial liabilities for states and deprive grassroots institutions such as gram sabhas of their right to decide on works under the scheme. He termed the Bill “anti-poor” and “anti-Dalit”, alleging it reflected a pro-rich approach.Speaker Om Birla had earlier said the debate on the Bill would take place on Wednesday, with the minister replying on Thursday before it was taken up for passage.Defending the legislation, BJP MP Brijmohan Agarwal said the previous Congress government had reduced MNREGA to a “dig the pit and cover the pit” scheme. He alleged it failed to strengthen the rural economy and led to large-scale corruption. Agarwal said the inclusion of “Ram” in the new law would deter corruption.According to the Bill, states will be required to frame schemes consistent with the new law within six months of the Act coming into force.",The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles - 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles - and said the reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.This order will impact over 14.7 lakh BS 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, buses and goods carriers; more than 38.7 lakh BS 2 compliant ones; and another 53.7 lakh BS 3 vehicles. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi passed the order on an application by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).Need to restrict plying of vehicles on basis of BS standards: CAQMOn Aug 12, an SC bench led by then CJI B R Gavai had said, “We direct that no coercive steps be taken against owners of vehicles on the ground that these are 10 years old (in case of diesel) and 15 years old (in case of petrol).”Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said BS 1, BS 2 and BS 3 vehicles have completed 24 years, 20 years and 15 years, respectively, and are a major cause of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The CAQM said a BS 1 diesel vehicle produces 5.4 times more CO (BS-2 two times more and BS-3 1.28 times more), 12.13 times more NOx (BS-2 8.75 times more and BS-3 6.25 times more) and 31.11 times more PM (BS-2 18 times and BS-3 2.3 times more) than a BS 4 compliant diesel vehicle.Agreeing to modify its Aug-12 order that had asked the authorities not to take coercive measures against end-of-life vehicles, the bench said only vehicles which are BS 4 and BS 6 compliant would not be proceeded against if they are older than 15 years.The CAQM, in its affidavit, said, “One of the criteria determining the fitness of a vehicle is its emissions. The emissions of any vehicle are tested against its BS standard category. Thus, an otherwise fit vehicle would still be emitting pollutants as per its BS standard. Since Delhi-NCR faces an extraordinary situation, especially during the winter season due to poor dispersal of pollutants on account of unfavourable meteorological conditions, there is a need to restrict the plying of polluting vehicles based on emission standards in Delhi-NCR. ”In compliance with orders of SC and National Green Tribunal, CAQM had issued a directive on July 8 mandating retail outlets to refuse fuel to all end-of-life vehicles with effect from Nov 1 this year in Delhi and from April 1, 2026, in five high-vehicle-density districts contiguous to Delhi, besides other actions in accordance with law.","The Supreme Court modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles.

‘Not Rummy, Solitaire’: Kokate Blames Staff, Denies Playing Rummy in Assembly

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Cabinet minister Manikrao Kokate on Thursday submitted his resignation to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , a day after he was divested of all his ministerial portfolios.Kokate lost all his portfolio after a Nashik court issued warrants for his and his brother Vijay's arrest in a 1995 EWS housing quota cheating case.Kokate has been sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for securing two flats in 1995 under the state's 10 per cent economically weaker sections (EWS) quota by understating their income.CM Devendra Fadanvis accepted Kokate's resignation and forwarded the same to governor Acharya Devvrat for further action.Earlier, Pawar said the ex-minister's resignation had been accepted in principle and was forwarded to CM Fadnavis for due consideration and acceptance.""In keeping with our party’s long-standing philosophy that the rule of law is supreme and above all individuals, the resignation has been accepted in principle. I have forwarded Shri Kokate’s resignation to the Hon’ble CM for due consideration and acceptance, in accordance with constitutional procedure,"" Ajit Pawar wrote on X.Meanwhile, Maharashtra governor Acharya Devvrat has allotted the Sports and Youth Affairs, Minority Affairs, and Waqf ministries, previously held by Manikrao Kokate, to Ajit Pawar.The governor approved the letter sent by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis in this regard yesterday.Kokate, who is the MLA from Sinnar, is the second NCP politician after Dhananjay Munde to have faced action since the Mahayuti alliance formed government in November 2024. Munde had to step down in March after the CM called for his resignation over allegations linking his associate Valmik Karad to the murder of Massajog sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.While Nashik commissioner of police Sandeep Karnik said they had received a non-bailable warrant against Kokate and his brother, Bombay high court has posted the hearing of the minister's application for relief on Friday. Kokate got admitted to Mumbai's Leelavati Hospital on Wednesday.Earlier, a section of NCP functionaries demanded that Kokate should resign, and even the opposition said merely divesting him of portfolios was not enough, and he should be disqualified with immediate effect.The court of additional chief judicial magistrate Rupali C Narwadiya in Nashik rejected Kokate's application citing medical grounds to seek four days to surrender and issued the arrest warrants.",Kokate lost all his portfolio after a Nashik court issued warrants for his and his brother Vijay's arrest in a 1995 EWS housing quota cheating case.

DEHRADUN: In the hills of Uttarakhand, with outmigration that has long hollowed out many of its villages, a political shift is taking root with a new cadre of Gen Z pradhans - many of them women, and barely out of college. Armed with degrees and smartphones, they are stepping into local governance with a determination to rebuild the places they call home.When Uttarakhand's latest panchayat results came out at the end of July, many young women entered seats long held by older generations as first-timers. Few months in, they are now challenging two long-standing Himalayan realities: migration and patriarchy. And they are doing so while shattering the stereotype of the pradhan-pati (village head's husband) model that dominates grassroots politics. For these 20-year-somethings, entering the panchayat is not a ticket to fame or wealth, but a conscious choice to ""return home"". And the mandate they've taken on is ambitious: fixing schools, strengthening healthcare, improving roads, and above all, slowing the steady flow of young people who leave the state in search of opportunity.At 22, Sakshi Rawat could have been working in a lab in Dehradun. Instead, three months after completing her biotechnology degree, she chose to return to her village, Kui, in Pauri Garhwal.This, even as her friends chased private jobs in cities. ""Most youngsters leave their villages after studying,"" Sakshi said. ""I want them to stay, to build something of their own here."" The decision to contest was entirely her own. Inspired by young grassroots innovators like Pawan Bisht of nearby village Maroda, who returned to the hills to pursue advanced farming, Sakshi believes Uttarakhand's revival will be youth-led. ""Our biggest challenge isn't geography or funds but mindset. People still think success lies outside the village. Real change will come when results at home become visible,"" she said.In Chamoli's Sarkot village, 21-year-old Priyanka Negi once wanted to be a mathematician. But her father, himself a two-time village head, saw the spark early and began taking her to block meetings. ""I was always drawn to numbers,"" she said, ""but during my graduation, I realised governance is the real math...."" Her priorities are clear. ""Road connectivity... Fix the roads, and half the problems of rural, hill life resolve themselves. ""For 22-year-old Deeksha Mandoli, leadership came early, as did motherhood. Married at 20 and a mother by 21, she is now the pradhan of Gulari village, Chamoli. An English graduate, she believes addiction among youth is an emerging issue. Deeksha rejects the old ""pradhan-pati"" dynamic with calmness. ""People now talk to us directly..."" In Chari, a Chamoli village with 250 voters, Kiran Negi has taken the new pradhan charge. Kiran, the youngest pradhan from her block, said ""This village is tiny, but problems aren't. Roads, water... Everything needs work."" The absence of a male figure by her side, has made her decisions more visible, Kiran said, challenging the old idea that ambition lives only in cities.","In the hills of Uttarakhand, a political shift is taking root with a new cadre of Gen Z pradhans.

The minister said 40% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is caused by vehicles.Asked about how the issue is tackled globally, Yadav said the govt has carried out a comparative study of measures taken by different cities, such as London, to improve air quality. ""Different countries have taken different measures. We are fully sensitive to this problem and are working on science-based solutions.""""Cities across the world that have reduced pollution have improved fuel quality.We moved from BS-IV to BS-VI.

That stay was withdrawn yesterday (Wednesday),"" Yadav said.He was referring to Supreme Court modifying its Aug order, which had barred coercive action against diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years in the National Capital Region (NCR), and clarifying that action can be taken against vehicles that do not meet BS-IV emission standards. Responding to a question, the minister regretted that Lok Sabha could not take up a discussion on air pollution on Thursday, saying it was due to the ""ruckus created by Congress members"" in the House. ""They (opposition members) stood on chairs and tore documents. It was total chaos,"" Yadav said.The minister also appealed to people to cooperate through their voluntary actions in the fight against air pollution.",Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Thursday said the govt was taking multiple measures to deal with the problem of air pollution.

NEW DELHI: The string of landmark judgments on gender equality could not help Shyla Joseph get an equitable 1/9th share of the property of her father N S Sreedharan, who had nine children but in his will disinherited her for marrying outside the community.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and K Vinod Chandran reversed the concurrent findings of the HC and the trial court which had doubted the will and allowed equitable partition of Sreedharan's property among the nine children, including Shyla.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""There can be no interference to the will which stands proved unequivocally. The judgment and decree of the high court and that of the trial court stands set aside. The plaintiff (Shyla) is found to have no claim over the properties of her father, which by a will have been bequeathed to the other siblings of the plaintiff.""Once the SC doubted the claim, senior advocate P B Krishnan, appearing for Shyla, requested the bench that her entitlement at best was just 1/9th share of her father's assets which is a negligible portion of the properties.The bench said the question of equality does not arise in a case relating to the wish of a man about division and inheritance of his properties.It said, ""We are not on equity, and the wish of the testator assumes pre-eminence. The last will and testament of the testator cannot be digressed from or frustrated."" While allowing the appeal of her siblings, the bench ordered dismissal of the suit she had filed for equitable partition of her father's properties.It said the rule of prudence cannot apply to the contents of a will, which is the wish of the individual who has absolute discretion to divide his properties. If all siblings had been divested of their inheritance through a will, then the rule of prudence could have been applied by the courts, the bench said.Referring to the reason for which Sreedharan had disinherited Shyla, the SC said, ""There is a reason stated for such exclusion, the acceptability of which to our minds, is not what the rule of prudence dictates. We cannot put the testator in our shoes... We cannot substitute our opinions in place of that of the testator; his desire prompted by his own justifications.""",Shyla Joseph was disinherited by her father N S Sreedharan for marrying outside the community. A Supreme Court bench reversed the concurrent findings of the HC and the trial court which had doubted the will. The bench said the question of equality does not arise in a case relating to the wish of a man.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126064889,imgsize-46086,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-upholds-mans-will-cutting-off-daughter-for-marrying-outsider.jpg"

It passed the order after both CM and governor consented for the panel. The dispute refused to die as both functionaries again did not come to consensus on selecting two out of nine names suggested by the committee and the court thereafter asked the panel to recommend names on the order of preference.As the matter was called Thursday, attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for governor, told SC that both functionaries have come to a consensus on who are to be appointed. ""We are happy to record that the chancellor and govt, in one voice, reported that appointment of VC in two universities have been made from empanelled list. We place our gratitude to the office of Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia.

Shockingly, even the child’s name was disclosed in the report in violation of legal protections.No executive magistrate was involved in the inquest as required under law, and the SIT’s progress remained ‘at the same page’ even in a second status report filed on Nov 24, the HC observed.","J&K and Ladakh high court handed over to CBI the investigation into the death of a 13-year-old girl found hanging from a tree.

The bill had sought to grant ownership rights to residents living in houses built on state land for over 20 years.Parra, the legislator from Pulwama, had described it as an “anti-bulldozer bill” meant to safeguard rights of residents issued eviction notices.The assembly on Oct 28 rejected the bill after Omar said granting ownership of illegally-constructed houses on state land would only reward encroachers.Mehbooba, however, said elected govt had a responsibility to safeguard the rights of people and it shouldn’t divest the public from their rights citing “strategic area” reasons and allot fertile land to forces. “CM should shift the project to barren land, not fields that feed and sustain families,” she said, adding she would take up the issue with the defence minister as well.

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle.

Where Tigers Get Caught Between Faith And Tourism | I Witness

Testing human tolerance

In early 2025, a motion-sensor camera high on the hills of Purulia district, West Bengal, blinked to life. The image it captured was unremarkable in isolation: the grainy silhouette of a tiger crossing scrubland. But for residents and forest officials, it was extraordinary. Purulia had never yielded a tiger sighting before. No camera traps, no spoor, no local memory of the big cat. The photograph was more than a record; it was a signal - that the landscape had begun to shift in ways people were only beginning to comprehend.Within weeks, researchers traced the animal's path through a series of camera traps: March 2024 in Chhattisgarh's Balrampur forest division; summer sightings in Jharkhand's Palamau Tiger Reserve; and by January 2025, in Bengal's Purulia and Jhargram. The tiger had wandered roughly 500 km through human-dominated terrain, crossing administrative and ecological boundaries in search of space.The tiger's journey is not an anomaly. It is part of a pattern. India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate - almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population. This rebound, often hailed as a conservation landmark, is the centrepiece of Project Tiger's story.Conservationists and forest staff took pride in the numbers, even as they now grapple with the consequences of unprecedented success.Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimate that nearly 30% of these 3,682 tigers - more than 1,100 animals - now roam outside notified tiger reserves, sharpening the challenge of coexistence. WII director GS Bhardwaj told TOI that a dedicated Tiger Outside Tiger Reserves (TOTR) project has already been initiated from 2025, with the focus on conserving both tigers and people. The project targets forest divisions that host dispersing tigers, aims to mitigate human-tiger conflict linked to TOTR, and envisages strengthening protection regimes beyond reserve boundaries.But there is a paradox embedded in that success: Project Tiger became ""a little too successful"", as an expert said. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes, fuelled by instinct, not intention. Tigers are inherently territorial; adults typically range across tens to hundreds of square km depending on prey and habitat. Studies in Indian landscapes have shown female home ranges between 30 and 64 sq km, with males sometimes exceeding 170 sq km. The average, even in prey-rich forests, often approaches 90 sq km.Bhardwaj said WII has advised all states to strengthen wildlife protection outside tiger reserves and carry out intensive monitoring of tigers moving beyond them, so that encounters do not escalate into human casualties or retaliatory killings.In the central Indian landscape - the broad swath of forests, hills and plateaus that includes Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and surrounding states - pressure is particularly acute. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, for instance, has one of the highest tiger densities in the country. A state-level review found territorial fights to be a major cause of death among tigers there between 2021 and 2023, reflecting intense competition for space and mates. With older males holding core territories, younger animals are pushed into buffer zones and near villages, raising the frequency of conflict. Bandhavgarh registers more than 2,000 cattle kills annually - a stark indicator of how tigers are pressed against the edges of ecological and social boundaries.Not all reserves exhibit the same degree of crowding though. In Uttarakhand, Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves are approaching saturation, but nearly half of India's reserves remain below what scientists describe as their ecological capacity. Forest officials in the state have reported that Corbett can support about 20 tigers per 100 sq km, while eastern Rajaji's capacity is around 14 per 100 sq km - figures that help explain why animals increasingly stray outside protected areas.As tigers move beyond core forests, their presence ripples through local communities in palpable ways. In early 2025, in several villages in Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit region, a prowling tiger caused schools to be closed. Children stayed home. ""Exams are coming,"" said a Class 5 student from Khalispur had then said, ""but we haven't even completed the syllabus."" Teachers refused to hold evening sessions. Parents stopped letting children walk alone. Tigers in Pilibhit often establish temporary bases in sugarcane fields, drawn by wild boars that feed on the sweet crop. Boars attract tigers. Sugarcane draws both. And between them lies the village.Elsewhere, the consequences have turned fatal. In Gadchiroli district of eastern Maharashtra, tiger numbers grew from zero to nearly 30 in five years - a startling shift in a landscape long considered tiger-scarce. With 12,000 sq km of forest, it appears generous on paper. But in practice, only about 7,000 sq km in two forest divisions is occupied. Human settlements, encroachments, and patchy prey base have constrained the actual carrying capacity. In 2024, 25 villagers died in tiger attacks across the Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions. Two problem tigers were captured. A tigress was spared because she had cubs. Though technically capable of holding far more - by some estimates, up to 300 tigers - Gadchiroli cannot even accommodate 25 without triggering conflict.In one forest-fringe home in Jharkhand, a tiger entered a family's hut, settled on a wooden cot, and waited. The family, stunned, watched in silence from a corner of the room. The tiger had wandered far from mapped territory. Its entry was a mistake. Its departure, hours later, was quiet. Nobody was hurt. The event became a story of awe and fear.These tigers are no longer sentinels of wilderness. They are migrants. Monarchs in exile. Each one a ghost of ecological success, walking into fields, hamlets and homes - not out of aggression, but because the forests behind them are full.In some landscapes, officials speak of ""social carrying capacity"" - not how many tigers the habitat can sustain, but how many human communities are willing to tolerate. In parts of Uttarakhand, tiger-inflicted fatalities have surpassed leopard attacks for the first time in years. In response, village volunteers called Bagh Mitras have been trained to monitor tiger movement and alert forest departments. Some report sightings through mobile apps. Others simply listen for silence - the kind that descends before a tiger appears.Translocation - moving tigers from dense parks to underpopulated reserves - has been tried. Odisha attempted it in 2018, without success. Intra-state efforts show more promise, but officials now lean toward corridor consolidation. Movement is safer when it's natural. But for that, corridors must exist - not just on policy maps, but on the ground.In the Terai Arc, at least 10 critical corridors are under threat from habitat loss and development. In central India, linear infrastructure - railways, highways, power lines - cuts across migration routes. And yet, some reserves offer hope. In Tadoba, tiger density rose 30% over a decade, with buffer populations expanding as prey base improved. In Sundarbans, the reserve is being expanded by more than 1,000 sq km to create space for 101 tigers now crowding its mangrove heartland.India now has more than 50 tiger reserves. Some are full. Others still hold ecological potential, if prey can be restored. The key lies not just in creating new habitat, but in connecting the old - allowing dispersing tigers to move without triggering conflict.Perhaps the tiger today is not just an emblem of wilderness, but a kind of refugee of success - displaced by recovery. The Purulia tiger's trek is both a biometric trail and a metaphor. It is the story of a tiger with nowhere to go, walking east until the land gave way to politics and fear.In the empty classrooms of Pilibhit, in the living room of a Jharkhand family, in the cattle sheds of Bandhavgarh, and in the forests of Gadchiroli now marked by claw and memory, India's national animal is no longer confined to the forest. The tiger has returned. The question is - where can it stay?","India's wild tiger population has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump

NEW DELHI: India has rejected China's claim of mediation in its conflict with Pakistan, reiterating its stand that the military action was paused following a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi claimed on Tuesday that the crisis involving India and Pakistan were among the ""hotspot issues"" mediated by his country in 2025. The assertion, similar to the US President Donald Trump's boasts of having played the peace broker in May, came as a surprise because of the time lag and the assessment here that Beijing was the undeclared participant in the4-day conflict arrayed on Pakistan's side.Indian govt sources expressed surprise at Wang's statement, whose country, in fact, provided crucial military assistance to Pakistan in May 7-10 conflict, and said it was as baseless as the repeated assertion of President Trump that he brokered a ""ceasefire"".They emphasised that China was not part of any conversation related to the cessation of military action. India, from PM Modi downwards, has repeatedly asserted that it agreed to pause the military action after Pakistani DGMO Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah reached out to his Indian counterpart Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai.India has consistently maintained there is no place for any third-party intervention in matters related to India and Pakistan, terming them bilateral.Wang had said, ""China mediated in northern Myanmar, Iranian nuclear issue, tensions between Pakistan and India, issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand.""India had targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK - following the killing of civilians, mostly tourists, by terrorists in Pahalgam - as part of Opeartion Sindoor, and had then responded to the hostile neighbour's military action.","China's foreign minister Wang Yi claimed on Tuesday that the crisis involving India and Pakistan were among the ""hotspot issues"" mediated by his country in 2025.

PANAJI: Holding him guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, a sessions court in North Goa handed Sandeep Verlekar, 55, a sentence of 6 years and 6 months in prison for assaulting his aged, bed-ridden mother under the influence of alcohol in Merces in 2019.Sandeep was arrested for dragging his 69-year-old mother, Laxmibai, from the bed, hitting her with his fists and leaving her out in the verandah, where she succumbed to her injuries.The court took a lenient view. It considered that Verlekar was an alcoholic and stated that he had no intention to kill his mother. The court directed that the imprisonment of 6 years, 1 month and 11 days already undergone by him be set off, and that he be released upon completion of the balance period.Public prosecutor Roy D'Souza told the court that he should be given the maximum sentence as he had committed a serious offence by assaulting his own bedridden mother. Rohan Desai, appearing under free legal aid, stated that he had been in custody for over 6 years since he was arrested in Nov 2019, and that he had two children.The court observed that the manner in which he had assaulted his mother showed that he had been under the influence of liquor and had no intention of killing her.""I also came to the conclusion that the act of assault committed by the accused was not committed with an intention to kill his own mother. Although it is a death caused, he never intended to kill his own mother. Therefore, according to me, a lenient view has to be taken against the accused,"" Merces sessions judge Irshad Agha said.The sessions court observed that there was no complaint of misbehaviour on his part during the period in custody. ""The period of sentence already undergone acted as rehabilitation for the accused as he could not access liquor. In this context, I do not find any reason that the accused will again turn alcoholic to commit any such act,"" the court stated.","Sandeep Verlekar was arrested for dragging his 69-year-old mother, Laxmibai, from the bed, hitting her with his fists and leaving her out in the verandah, where she succumbed to her injuries.

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: The Madhya Pradesh high court has refused to interfere with the judgment of a Pocso court in Narmadapuram district awarding 20 years of rigorous imprisonment to a person accused of having sexual relationship with a 17-year-old, whom he married later. The couple now has a child.A division bench of Justices Vivek Agarwal and R K Choubey said the consent of a minor to a sexual relationship was immaterial, and a decision to suspend the sentence of a person convicted for rape under the Pocso Act could be taken only by Supreme Court exercising its power under Article 142 of the Constitution.Earlier, counsel for the appellant contended that coordinate benches granted relief of suspension of sentence even in the case of a 14-year-old girl, whereas in the present case, the age of the survivor was 17 and she was a consenting partner.The bench, however, stated that it was a ""prerogative of the Supreme Court to take a call by exercising its authority under Article 142"".According to the prosecution's case, on June 1, 2023, the rape survivor lodged a police complaint in Itarsi stating that she used to visit her grandmother and became acquainted with the appellant on one such visit. On Feb 14, 2023, he invited her to lunch at his house. There, he raped her and threatened to kill her if she disclosed it to anyone, she alleged, adding he blackmailed and raped her on three more occasions.The accused married the survivor when he came out on bail during the trial.The appellant's counsel pleaded for leniency saying a son was born out of wedlock, and the survivor would be left to take care of him alone. The court, however, said since it was established that the survivor was a minor at the time, the accused could not be absolved of the charge.","Madhya Pradesh high court refused to interfere with Pocso court's judgment.

New Labour Codes: FAQs

Below is the list of FAQs on the new labour codes that have been released by the Ministry of Labour:

Which rules will be applicable during the transition period?

What does the term “wages” mean?

The definition of “Wages” covers:

All remuneration whether by way of salaries, allowances or otherwise payable to a person employed. This includes: Basic pay, Dearness allowance, Retaining allowance, if any

If the payments/allowances other than Basic pay, Dearness allowance and Retaining allowance exceed 50% or such percentage as notified of all remuneration, then amount exceeding 50% or such percentage as notified shall be added in the “Wages”.

Definition of wages and the components it would cover.

All remuneration whether by way of salary , allowances or otherwise. These include Basic pay, Dearness allowance and Retaining allowance, if any.

, allowances or otherwise. These include Basic pay, Dearness allowance and Retaining allowance, if any. If the allowances (except gratuity and retrenchment compensation) exceeds 50% of all remuneration, the excess amount shall be added back to wages.

Performance based incentives, Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs), variable part of the component or reimbursement-based payments to the employee shall not be part of the wages.

What is the 50% rule for allowances?

If the allowances and benefits together (except gratuity and retrenchment compensation) exceed 50% of the all remuneration, the excess amount shall be added back to wages.

Such added amount shall be treated as wages for statutory purposes.

Whether Leave Encashment be part of allowances?

Does this definition of wages apply to all labour laws?

This single definition of wages applies across all four Labour Codes

The same definition applies uniformly for statutory calculations

Explain the allowance rule with a clear illustration?

Total remuneration: ₹76,000 per month

Basic Pay + Dearness Allowance: ₹20,000

Allowances: ₹40,000

Other components (Gratuity and retrenchment compensation): ₹16,000

Total allowance paid: ₹56,000

Max. allowance allowed for calculation of wages (50% of total remuneration): ₹38,000

Excess allowance over 50% limit: ₹2000

₹2000 shall be added back to wages (Basic Pay + DA) for statutory compliances.

Statutory calculations shall be made on revised wages: ₹22,000

Whether Gratuity calculation will be applicable prospectively or retrospectively.

Clarification on gratuity calculation in view of many companies considering December month as year end.

When gratuity is payable to an employee?

On termination

On superannuation (retirement due to age)

On resignation

On death or disablement due to accident or disease

On expiration of a fixed-term employment contract

On any other event notified by the Central Government

Are there any special provisions related to gratuity in certain cases?

Death (paid to nominee or legal heirs)

Disablement

Expiration of fixed-term employment

Other events notified by the Central Government

How is gratuity calculated?

Piece-rated employees: Daily wages calculated as average of total wages for the three months preceding termination (excluding overtime)

Seasonal employees: 7 days’ wages per season

Fixed-term employment or deceased employees: Gratuity paid on pro-rata basis

Wages for the period preceding his disablement shall be taken to be the wage received by him during that period.

Wages for the period subsequent to his disablement shall be taken to be the wages as so reduced.

Does gratuity affect other agreements or awards?

Award

Agreement

Contract with employer

Whether the person drawing wages ₹18,000/- or more will be covered under the definition of worker as per OSH & WC Code.

Clarity on Core and Non-core activities.

Whether Journey Allowance for ISMW within the State for the long-distance workers may be allowed.

How will the ESI coverage be governed until the finalisation of Rules?

New Labour Codes: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances. Any allowance, excluding gratuity and retrenchment compensation, that exceeds 50 percent of total remuneration will be added back to wages for statutory calculations, while items such as performance incentives.Puneet Gupta, Partner, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India says that the draft central rules under the four labour codes provide clarity on several operational aspects that employers have been awaiting.“For instance, the Code on Social Security Rules specify that gratuity will be calculated on ‘wages’ last drawn, excluding components such as annual performance-linked pay, medical reimbursements, stock options, and meal vouchers. This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code. Establishments may make provision as per accounting norms.Gratuity shall be payable on following events:Completion of five years of continuous service is not necessary in case of:If the nominee or heir is a minor, the share shall be deposited with a competent authority and invested in bank/financial institution for the benefit of such minor until majorityFor every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months: 15 days’ wages per year (or such number as notified by Central Government) based on the rate of wages last drawn.Special cases:The maximum gratuity is as notified by the Central Government which is currently ₹ 20 lakhs.For employees re-employed after disablement:Nothing shall affect the right of an employee to receive better gratuity terms under any:Any person, who is employed in a supervisory capacity drawing wages exceeding ₹18,000/- (or an amount as may be notified by the Central Government from time to time) is not included in the definition of worker.Core and non-core activities are clearly defined under the OSH & WC Code, 2020 [Section 57]. Principal employer may engage contract labour for core activities which are ordinarily carried out through contractor, or of intermittent nature or involve sudden increase in volume of work requiring time-bound completion.As per OSH & WC Code, 2020, the employer shall pay to and fro journey allowance to ISMW once in a year from his native place to place of employment.The definition of wage has come into force with notification of the Code w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025.","The government has published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc. The draft rules are open for public consultation. The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules and draft rules under new Labour codes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126272451,imgsize-30740,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-codes.jpg"

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit. It grants long-term security and operational freedom. It is not tied to a single employer and does not impose requirements. Key features include full work freedom, self- employment, business ownership, and freelancing without sponsorship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126234204,imgsize-648989,width-400,resizemode-4/bahrain-golden-residency.jpg"

'India Will Be 3rd Largest Economy': PM Modi Sounds Warning To Trump, Says World is Betting on Delhi

India Becomes Fourth Largest Economy

High Growth, Low Inflation - The Goldilocks Situation

In a major feat, India has moved past Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms, according to the government’s year-end economic review. Not only that, the Indian economy is set to overtake Germany to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. A final confirmation will depend on the data released by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the first half of 2026 when the final figures for 2025 will be released.“With GDP valued at $4.18 trillion, India has surpassed Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy and is poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years with projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030,” the government release said.India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now. The size of its economy has doubled in the last ten years, and it is now eyeing the position of being the third largest in the world.A government economic note issued late Monday highlighted that India remains one of the fastest-expanding major economies globally and is well placed to maintain its growth pace.IMF forecasts for 2026 value India’s economy at $4.51 trillion, slightly above Japan’s projected $4.46 trillion.The government’s optimistic outlook comes even as the economy faces headwinds following the imposition of steep US tariffs in August linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Recent high-frequency data signals that economic momentum is holding firm. Inflation has stayed below the lower bound of the tolerance band, joblessness is easing, and exports are showing steady improvement, the government review noted.Financial conditions also remain supportive, marked by healthy credit expansion to businesses, while demand continues to be resilient, aided by a further pickup in urban consumption.India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY 2025-26, accelerating from 7.8% in the preceding quarter and 7.4% in the final quarter of FY 2024-25. This growth was driven by strong domestic demand, even as global trade and policy uncertainties persisted. Real gross value added rose 8.1%, underpinned by solid performance in the industrial and services sectors.The Reserve Bank of India raised its growth projection for FY 2025-26 to 7.3%, up from 6.8% earlier. The upward revision factors in sustained domestic demand, rationalisation of income tax and GST, softer crude prices, an early push in government capital spending, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions, all supported by contained inflation.“Ongoing reforms are likely to further enable growth prospects. The present macro-economic situation presents a rare “goldilocks period” of high growth and low inflation,” the review said.CPI inflation stood at 4.26% in January and gradually moderated over the first half of the year, before declining further to multi-year lows during the latter half. Headline inflation continued to soften and touched historic lows of around 0.25% in October. This sharper-than-expected disinflation was primarily driven by a correction in food prices.RBI has cumulatively cut the repo rate by 1.25% this year, down from 6.5% to 5.25%. The move reflected a balanced approach between supporting growth and managing inflation, aided by a favourable outlook for both headline and core inflation.India’s external position continues to display considerable strength. Supported by healthy growth in services exports and a steady rise in overseas remittances, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.3% of GDP in the second quarter of FY 2025–26, down from 2.2% in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the government release said.Remittance inflows rose by 10.7% year-on-year during the quarter, reinforcing external stability. With services exports maintaining momentum and remittance flows remaining strong, the CAD is expected to stay contained through 2025–26.“India’s growth outlook remains buoyant, with global and domestic institutions upgrading their assessments on the back of strong economic fundamentals. Reflecting broad-based momentum across key sectors, the Reserve Bank of India revised its GDP growth projection for FY 2025–26 upward from 6.8% to 7.3%,” the review said.","India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now.

Khaleda Zia’s funeral: EAM Jaishankar Hands Over Modi’s Letter To BNP Chief Tarique Rahman In Dhaka

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman, describing her as a leader of “rare resolve and conviction” whose legacy would continue to shape ties between India and Bangladesh.The letter was handed over by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who represented India at Khaleda Zia’s funeral in Dhaka on Wednesday. Zia, a three-time prime minister and the founding figure of the BNP, died on Tuesday after a prolonged illness, prompting an outpouring of condolences from regional leaders.In his message, PM Modi wrote, “Dear Tarique Rahman Saheb, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing away of your mother, Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Please accept my heartfelt condolences on this profound personal loss.” He recalled his meeting with Zia during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015, saying she “made many important contributions to the development of Bangladesh, as well as to the strengthening of India-Bangladesh relations”.PM Modi described Zia as “the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh” and said that while her death left “an irreplaceable void”, her “vision and legacy will endure”.Expressing confidence in Tarique Rahman’s political role, he added, “I am confident that her ideals will be carried forward under your able leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and will continue to serve as a guiding light to ensure a new beginning and the enrichment of the deep and historic partnership between India and Bangladesh. ”The prime minister also extended his thoughts to the Bangladeshi people, praising their “shared values, democratic traditions, and a deep sense of national unity”, and wished Rahman strength and fortitude in overcoming the loss.Jaishankar echoed similar sentiments during his interaction with Rahman, later posting on social media that he had conveyed “deepest condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India” and expressed confidence that “Begum Khaleda Zia’s vision and values will guide the development of our partnership”.On the sidelines of the funeral, Jaishankar exchanged greetings with several regional dignitaries, including Pakistan National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Nepal’s foreign minister Balananda Sharma.","PM Modi paid tribute to former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman.

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India welcomed the New Year 2026 with vibrant celebrations across the country, as people gathered in large numbers to mark the occasion with joy and festivity on Thursday night.Cities came alive with fireworks, cultural events, live music performances, and themed decorations as the nation stepped into another year.The outgoing year, 2025, was remembered for India’s focus on reforms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.“What makes the reforms of 2025 significant is not only their dimension but also their underlying philosophy. We modernised institutions, simplified governance, and strengthened the foundations for long-term inclusive growth,” he added, noting that his government prioritised collaboration over control and facilitation over regulation “in the true spirit of a modern democracy.”President Droupadi Murmu also extended New Year greetings to citizens in India and abroad, calling the occasion a symbol of renewed energy, positive change and fresh beginnings.“May the year 2026 bring peace, happiness and prosperity into our lives and infuse new energy to build a stronger and more prosperous India,” she said.In Delhi, popular spots including India Gate, Hauz Khas, Connaught Place were bustling with revelers celebrating the arrival of 2026.Ahead of the festivities, the Delhi Police shared a humorous social media post warning against drunk driving, saying, “Kuch Tests me Zero lana hi best hota hai.”In Bengaluru, large crowds of people gathered at the bustling intersections of Mahatma Gandhi Road and Brigade Road.Around five youths, who allegedly misbehaved with women revellers and later with police who questioned them, were detained at Church Street little before midnight. Another youth, in an inebriated condition and seen arguing heatedly with a police inspector at MG Road, was also detained and taken away from the spot.In Punjab, people gathered at the Golden Temple in Amritsar to welcome the New Year, while Mumbai saw large crowds at Juhu Beach, Chowpatty Beach, and Carter Road in Bandra.

Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

JAMMU: A village defence guard (VDG) opened fire after allegedly spotting a terror suspect in a remote village in J&K’s Rajouri district, even as security forces intensified surveillance in the upper reaches of Chenab region — Doda and Kishtwar districts — officials said Wednesday.Officials said the VDG fired about six rounds in the air upon allegedly sighting a terror suspect in Dali village in Rajouri’s Kalakote area late Tuesday. None was injured in the firing. “A joint team of the Army and police subsequently rushed to the spot and launched a search operation in the area, but found nothing suspicious,” an official said.A series of anti-terror operations was underway in the upper reaches of Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts in Chenab region, especially in areas bordering Udhampur and Kathua districts, officials said. Similar operations were also ongoing in the two frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch, as well as Reasi, which shares a border with Rajouri-Ramban in Jammu Division and Kulgam in south Kashmir, said officials.Security forces were anticipating that terrorists hiding in non-habituated (higher reaches) may try to enter the mainland, in view of the closure of mountain passes, to get commodities. The intensified operations by Army’s Rashtriya Rifles and J&K Police’s SOG were also extended to a large area in Chenab region, said officials.The Army, meanwhile, stepped up efforts to strengthen grassroots security by imparting training to VDGs — the “first responders” in the security grid — in Doda district. On Tuesday, about 150 VDGs from 17 remote villages along Doda-Chamba border, including women volunteers, underwent intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks, officials said. The training was being conducted at Shingini Panchayat in Bhalessa, around 90km from Doda district HQ, to equip volunteers with the necessary skills to protect their villages and act as the first line of defence, especially in vulnerable areas, an official said.Separately, a suspected Pakistani drone was spotted hovering briefly over Phulpur area near the International Border in Samba district late Tuesday. “Soon after the sighting, police and BSF personnel rushed to the spot and conducted a thorough search to ascertain whether any payload containing weapons or narcotics had been air-dropped, but found nothing on the ground,” an official said.","Village defence guard opened fire after allegedly spotting a terror suspect in a remote village in J&K’s Rajouri district.

NEW DELHI: The ""new normal"" in India's national security playbook took on a harder edge in 2025. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the country's zero-tolerance doctrine against terrorism, especially the kind nurtured across the border in Pakistan, became not just policy but a mindset. For years, Pakistan has acted much like a hostile neighbour, failing short of India's expectations while cultivating, training and unleashing anti-India sentiment and activities from its soil. In 2025, that long-running tension erupted into one of the darkest chapters in Kashmir's recent history.Crossborder terrorism and India's counterterror responses became defining markers of 2025. The Pahalgam massacre, one of the most horrifying attacks in recent years, shook the nation and ignited widespread grief and anger.The Prime Minister, who was abroad at the time, cut short his trip and returned to New Delhi immediately.In his first public remarks after the attack, switching briefly and unusually to English, he signalled India's mood and mission. ""Today, from the soil of Bihar, I say this to the whole world, India will identify, trace and punish every terrorist and their backers. We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth,"" he declared, framing a battle of ""Yuddha"" against terror from the land of ""Buddha.""The year went on to witness not just an ugly terror attack but also India's most far-reaching counteroffensive since the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes. Operation Sindoor , New Delhi's military retaliation after Pahalgam, targeted terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and PoK, making this the first time India expanded its precision strikes beyond PoK into mainland Pakistan.The operation, the government says, remains in a ""paused"" state. Alongside Sindoor, several other counterterror operations were carried out through the year, keeping a firm and continuous check on terror.April 22 began as a quiet spring morning in the Baisaran Valley in Pahalgam, a routine day for a popular tourist spot. Within hours, it became the scene of one of the gravest terror incidents in recent years. Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, from a proxy group of Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire on civilians in the meadows, killing 26 people and leaving the region shaken.Eyewitnesses recounted the attackers tried to identify victims' faith by demanding Aadhaar cards or driving licences, asking them to recite the kalma, and even forcing some to unzip their pants so they could check for circumcision. Unlike many other terror incidents, this attack reportedly did not follow a usual pattern, as the killings appeared to be carried out selectively.As soon as the news reached the national capital, New Delhi moved quickly. Union home minister Amit Shah reached the Valley the same day and also visited the site in Baisaran later. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was on an official trip to Saudi Arabia, cut short his two-day visit, skipped a scheduled state dinner to be hosted by Kingdom and returned to India immediately.Global leaders spoke to the Prime Minister, expressing condemnation and solidarity. The attack also coincided with the visit of US Vice President JD Vance, who was in India on a four-day trip with his family. From US President Donald Trump to then Nepalese prime minister KP Oli, several world leaders reached out to PM Modi, conveying support for India and strongly condemning the attack.""President Donald Trump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS called PM @narendramodi and conveyed his deepest condolences at the loss of innocent lives in the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir . President Trump strongly condemned the terror attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous attack. India and the United States stand together in the fight against terror,"" The ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X.As investigations began, it quickly became evident that the conspiracy once again traced back to Pakistan and its proxy terror networks. Evidence pointed clearly to crossborder involvement, with the planning and execution of the Pahalgam attack fitting the same pattern seen in past incidents in the region.For the agencies, Pakistan’s role was no mystery. Army units and intelligence teams followed the trail, identified those behind the killings, and eventually eliminated the Lashkar terrorists responsible for the April 22 massacre during Operation Mahadev in August.The very next day of attack, on April 23 -- India initiated retaliatory measures diplomatically against Pakistan. New Delhi announced a series of strict punitive actions, signalling a decisive diplomatic response.That evening, the ministry of external affairs, led by foreign secretary Vikram Misri, briefed the media after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Modi. The intent was communicated unambiguously: India would respond firmly to the Pahalgam attack and hold Pakistan accountable.The decisions taken were strong retaliatory steps aimed at exerting diplomatic and economic pressure on Pakistan, whose soil has long been used to support terror networks targeting India.The long-standing Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 with World Bank mediation, was put in abeyance with immediate effect. The move sent a clear message. The waters of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab are vital for Pakistan’s agriculture, particularly wheat and cotton, and form the backbone of its water security.Following the suspension, Pakistan faced a heightened risk of inadequate water storage earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025. Roughly 80% of Pakistani farmland depends on the Indus basin, as do most of its hydropower projects.India closed the Attari border ICP and instructed individuals who had crossed with valid endorsements to return through the same route immediately.Pakistani nationals were barred from travelling to India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. All previously issued SVES visas were cancelled with immediate effect, and Pakistani nationals in India were instructed to leave within 48 hours.India declared the defence, naval and air advisors at the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi as Persona Non Grata, giving them a week to leave the country.India simultaneously withdrew its own defence, naval and air Advisors from its high commission in Islamabad. These posts in both missions were formally annulled, along with the withdrawal of five associated support staff on each side.The staff strength in both high commissions was ordered to be reduced from 55 to 30, with the changes taking effect by 1 May 2025.These measures underscored a clear shift: Pakistan was pushed to the margins of India's diplomatic priorities, a direct consequence of the Pahalgam attack and its continuing role in crossborder terrorism.After days of rising tension and diplomatic fallout with Pakistan, India launched a decisive military response. On the intervening night of May 6 and 7, almost two weeks after the Pahalgam attack, the Indian armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor, targeting key terror bases, including high-value targets.The terrorists responsible for the Pahalgam attack were linked to LeT's proxy, The Resistance Front (TRF). The operation struck nine terror installations, including the Muridke base of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. The Bahawalpur base of JeM chief Masood Azhar was also targeted, resulting in the deaths of several of Azhar’s family members.According to the ministry of defence, the operation was so far ""focused, measured and non-escalatory,"" deliberately avoiding Pakistani military facilities.The Indian Air Force struck nine high-value terror camps where militants harboured and trained. These included:India made it clear that the precision strikes targeted only terrorist infrastructure and did not affect Pakistan's state or army installations.But in the following night, Pakistan carried out another misadventure and attempted retaliation with the barrage of drones and missiles, which were seen from several cities on border line.However, India's Sudarshan Chakra, a multi-layered integrated air defence system including IADS and the S-400, intercepted and neutralised all threats, including Turkish drones, Chinese missiles, and possibly some Pakistani aircraft, preventing any damage on Indian soil.The day after the operation, the MEA held a briefing led by foreign secretary Misri, joined by Colonel Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, to provide updates on the military action of the night.""These were neutralized by the Integrated Counter Unmanned Aerial System and other Air Defence systems,"" said Wing Commander Vyomika Singh during an MEA briefing.In response, India carried out further strikes inside Pakistan, targeting 11 key airbases, including Nur Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Bholari, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Skaru, and Jacobabad. The strikes reportedly destroyed around 20 percent of Pakistan Air Force infrastructure, including fighter jets and a SAM system. Over 50 personnel were killed at Bholari Air Base, including Pakistan squadron leader Usman Yousuf.Some bases, such as Rahim Yar Khan, remained non-operational for months.Military tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours eventually eased on May 10 after Pakistan's DGMO contacted the Indian counterpart to agree on a ceasefire on land, air, and water.However, India maintains that Operation Sindoor is just ""paused"" as the Prime Minister Modi, and Amit Shah clearly stated.In his first address after the strikes, he said, ""India has only paused military action and will retaliate on its own terms if another terror attack occurs."" He added, ""The three armies of India -- Air Force, Navy, and Army, along with BSF and military forces -- are on alert. After the surgical strike and air strike, Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has drawn a new line against terrorism. """"Operation Sindoor is not just a name but it's a reflection of the feelings of millions of people of the country,"" Prime Minister Modi said.Months later, IAF chief Amar Preet Singh confirmed the scale of losses inflicted on Pakistan. ""We have signs of one C-130 class aircraft and at least four to five fighter jets, most likely F-16s, along with one SAM system destroyed. We have clear evidence of a long-range strike exceeding 300 km, along with five high-tech fighters between F-16 and JF-17 class,"" he said.Soon after Operation Sindoor, the Army launched large-scale raids and counterterror operations across the Valley. One of the major actions was Operation Keller, a ""search and destroy"" mission initiated in May in the Keller forest area of Jammu and Kashmir's Shopian district.The Army, CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police conducted a coordinated manhunt to track terrorists believed to be hiding in the dense forest belt.During the operation, security forces eliminated three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists and recovered a significant cache of arms and ammunition, including AK-47 rifles, grenades and hundreds of rounds.Those killed included Shahid Kuttay, an LeT/TRF commander, and Hussain Thokar, both linked to recent terror activities in the region.Operation Keller underscored the heightened synergy between security forces and intelligence agencies after the Pahalgam massacre, marking the start of a sustained crackdown on terrorist networks in the Valley.The terrorists responsible for the April 22 Pahalgam massacre, in which 26 civilians were killed, remained on the run for months. Under Operation Mahadev, they were finally tracked down and neutralised.The operation, carried out over 12 days with precise intelligence inputs, led to the elimination of three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists confirmed to be involved in the Pahalgam killings.Union home minister Amit Shah announced the outcome during the Monsoon Session of Parliament: “I want to tell the House and the people of the country that those who killed our people in Baisaran Valley … all three terrorists have been killed.”He added that “Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev have sent a clear message to the masterminds of terror about the consequences of playing with the lives of Indian citizens.”The three high-profile Lashkar terrorists were killed on July 28 in an encounter in the Dachigam forest near Srinagar, where they had been hiding since the April attack.","The Pahalgam massacre, one of the most horrifying attacks in recent years, shook the nation and ignited widespread grief and anger. India's zero-tolerance doctrine against terrorism became not just policy but a mindset. Operation Sindoor targeted terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and PoK, making this the first time India expanded its precision strikes beyond PoK into mainland Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126273555,imgsize-760078,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early December was built illegally on a salt pan and operated for months without valid permissions, pointing to systemic failures and alleged collusion by local authorities, as reported by news agency PTI.The fire broke out late on December 6 during a crowded event after fireworks were set off without adequate safety measures or equipment. The club lacked emergency exits on both floors and was operating without valid permissions. The blaze killed 25 people, including tourists and staff.The report, made public on Wednesday, said the structure of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, stood in the middle of a salt pan or water body and was “not permissible under any law”, either current or past, violating the Goa Land Revenue Code and Coastal Zone Regulations.The inquiry revealed that the village panchayat issued an establishment licence to the operator in December 2023, valid only until March 31, 2024. Despite the licence not being renewed, the premises continued to function as a bar and nightclub, with no steps taken by the panchayat to seal it, even though the Goa Panchayat Raj Act empowers such action.Also read: Birch staff tried to douse fire with a glass and water bottle: Survivor Statements recorded during the probe showed that senior panchayat officials were aware of the lapse but failed to inform other departments, which continued granting permissions based on the expired trade licence.The report concluded that this amounted to collusion with the owners and a violation of conduct rules, PTI reported.Serious irregularities were also flagged in the original licensing process. The inquiry noted alleged forgery in the application, including entries added later in different ink, missing mandatory documents such as approved plans and land records, and a hurried approval process completed within days. Officials admitted they had not verified the house number or legality of the structure before issuing the licence.Despite multiple complaints over noise pollution and parking between January 2024 and December 2025, inspections repeatedly recorded “nothing found on the spot”, and directions of the Bombay High Court regarding night patrolling were not followed.Police have registered the case under several Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, negligence, forgery and criminal conspiracy.Eight people have been arrested so far, including co-owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra.",A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early December was built illegally on a salt pan.

US and India Stand Strong Against China: The Real Geopolitical Dynamics Unveiled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-china-relations-strategic-altruism-keji-mao-trumps-second-term-shift-on-india-india-and-china-relations/articleshow/126273059.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump

Why it matters: No more US “Strategic altruism” for India

The core claim of Mao, an analyst at China’s International Cooperation Center and founder of the South Asia Research Brief, starts with history. Since the late 1990s, he argues, Washington practiced what many Chinese scholars label “strategic altruism” toward India-absorbing real diplomatic costs to integrate New Delhi into the global order. The most visible example was the civil nuclear deal that carved out an exception to global nonproliferation norms. The logic: A rising democratic India would eventually help balance China in Asia.

That logic, Mao says, has broken down. During Donald Trump’s second term, the US imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods, raised visa fees, tightened outsourcing rules, and adopted rhetoric towards New Delhi that often sounded dismissive. Many Western observers, Mao notes, wave this away as a “Trump anomaly.” He rejects that view.

For Mao, the driver is structural. “The root driver is US anxiety over its declining strength, which now outweighs concern about external geopolitical threats.” In this frame, Washington is cautious with hard retaliators like China and Russia, but tougher on allies. His most vivid line captures the shift: Allies become “blood bags”, with the US preferring to squeeze partners for immediate gains over paying uncertain costs for long-run strategic contests.”

India, Mao argues, is especially exposed. It “has enjoyed US indulgence but lacks the industrial/economic heft of Japan, Europe or Korea to make major concessions-and is less willing to bend-so it is cast as ‘conspicuously ungrateful’.” Over time, he suggests, this friction could reduce tensions between Beijing and both Washington and New Delhi, paving the way for a realignment favorable to China.

The big picture

Zoom in: American decline, exaggerated

China’s numbers

Between the lines: Political turbulence in Beijing

Geography still matters

Why India won’t stay in China’s shadow

What next

Then as the Economist wrote, ""hubris haunts the Communist Party and in 2026 Mr Xi will be tempted to assert China’s interests more aggressively. That creates a risk of dangerous overreach in three areas: trade, Taiwan and new Chinese-run global rules.""

Bottom line

A new narrative about upcoming geopolitical upheaval is taking shape in a section of strategic analysts. As per this: China is destined for the top spot, while the United States and India slide into a “battle for second place. ”The argument is gaining traction among Chinese strategists and analysts, including Keji Mao, who says Washington’s long bet on India has soured and US decline anxiety is reshaping alliances.Mao’s logic is coherent-and comforting for Beijing. It fits a long-running Chinese conviction that American decline is destined and China’s rise is inevitable and durable. But it rests on assumptions that are far more fragile than they appear.However, the nature of power in the twenty-first century is not one-dimensional. It is a mosaic of capabilities-technological, financial, military, demographic, institutional-spread across domains and regions. In some, China will lead. In others, the US remains preeminent. India is carving out a distinct pole that neither mirrors China nor fully aligns with Washington.Framing the future as a simple race for first and second place flatters hierarchy but obscures how influence actually accumulates-and how constraints bite.The first weak link in Mao’s thesis is its linear view of US decline. History suggests a more cyclical pattern.From the Sputnik shock of the 1950s to Vietnam, from Japan’s rise in the 1980s to the 2008 financial crisis, predictions of American eclipse have been routine. Each time, internal dysfunction and polarization produced dire forecasts. Each time, scale, innovation, institutions, and alliances enabled adaptation.Trump can be read less as proof of terminal decline than as a backlash phase-an ugly but familiar spasm in democratic systems under stress. Democracies and market economies are messy, but they self-correct in ways centralized systems struggle to replicate.Nor does current evidence show a US retreat from Asia. Even amid trade disputes, Washington has deepened security cooperation with Japan, Australia, and the Philippines; reinforced ties with South Korea; expanded technology controls aimed squarely at China; and maintained a robust Indo-Pacific military posture. These are not the actions of a power resigning itself to second place.Also read: India–US ties: US embassy shares key moments of 2025; eyes stronger year ahead



Mao’s confidence also leans heavily on assumptions about China’s economic trajectory. Recent data complicate that story.As Bloomberg has reported, China’s economy looked resilient on the surface in 2025. Exports surged, growth hovered near the official target, and Beijing avoided a “bazooka” stimulus. Manufacturers moved up the value chain, and the trade surplus widened.Beneath the headlines, however, momentum has softened. Investment is heading for its first annual contraction since 1998. Retail sales growth has slowed to its weakest pace outside the pandemic. New home prices continue to fall, extending a property crisis with no clear end. To stabilize growth, Beijing has pledged broader fiscal support in 2026-targeting advanced manufacturing, technology innovation, and human capital.None of this signals collapse. But it does question the notion of effortless, linear ascent-and highlights the difficulty of rebalancing an economy while demographics worsen and political control tightens.Economic stress is compounded by political anxiety. Bloomberg reports that Xi Jinping probed a record number of senior officials for corruption in 2025, following earlier purges of top generals. With jockeying intensifying ahead of the next Communist Party congress, questions are emerging about governance quality and elite cohesion.As Alfred Wu of the National University of Singapore told Bloomberg, “For China, there is much more turbulence domestically.” Anti-corruption drives consolidate control, but they also raise uncomfortable questions about military readiness and decision-making in a system increasingly centered on a single leader.These internal stresses matter because they constrain how aggressively China can translate ambition into action abroad.GDP is not destiny. Geography and geopolitics remain powerful constraints-and here, China faces enduring disadvantages.China shares land borders with 14 countries and maritime boundaries with several more. It has unresolved disputes or strained relations with many of them, from India and Japan to the Philippines and Vietnam. That creates a neighborhood defined less by deference than by hedging and quiet balancing.Former Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan captured this reality in Foreign Policy: “No country will ever shun China. Every country wants as good a relationship with China as possible. But China’s overall geopolitical situation is not favorable.” He asks which states would “meekly acquiesce to China occupying the apex of a regional hierarchy.”For Japan, the Koreas, and Vietnam, national identities have long been defined in opposition to China’s civilizational pull. Subordination would require a wrenching redefinition of identity-making almost any alternative more attractive.This limits Beijing’s ability to convert economic weight into political dominance, a lesson the Soviet Union learned at great cost.Mao is right that India is not China in manufacturing-yet. But the leap from that observation to a future of permanent second place misses the dynamics of India’s rise.India’s strengths lie in demographics, services, digital public infrastructure, and strategic geography. Unlike China, India does not face the same pace of demographic aging. Its market size and political pluralism make it attractive to firms and governments seeking diversification away from China.India’s geography matters too. Sitting astride key Indian Ocean sea lanes and bordering China, it cannot be sidelined by Washington or easily coerced by Beijing. This gives New Delhi leverage-even when relations with the US are tense.US–India frictions under Trump are real. But friction is not rupture. Structural interests-balancing China, securing supply chains, cooperating on defense and technology-continue to pull the relationship back together. India’s rise does not depend solely on American indulgence; it rests on domestic reform, market scale, and a global environment eager for alternatives to China.For Beijing, the danger lies in mistaking temporary US–India strains for a permanent realignment. Overconfidence risks miscalculation-especially at a moment when domestic headwinds are rising and neighbors are wary.If Xi decides to invade Taiwan, whether in 2026 or 2027, China may get entangled in a protracted and unwinnable war. According to some calculations, even a blockade of Taiwan would lead to 7-9% decline in Chinese GDP. This may severely impact China's superpower aspirations.For Washington and New Delhi, the path ahead will be uneven. Trade disputes, immigration politics, and industrial competition will generate friction. But shared strategic interests and mutual leverage argue against a clean break.The more likely future is prolonged, contested coexistence: China rising but constrained; the US adapting rather than fading; India carving out a larger, more independent role.American decline is not destiny. India’s limitations are not permanent. And China’s rise-while real-is neither frictionless nor uncontested. The world they inhabit is too complex, too crowded, and too dynamic for any single power to conduct the orchestra alone.","Keji Mao: US anxiety over its declining strength now outweighs concern about external geopolitical threats. In this frame, Washington is cautious with hard retaliators like China and Russia, but tougher on allies. Mao’s logic is coherent-and comforting for Beijing. But it rests on assumptions that are far more fragile than they appear.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126274142,imgsize-1075489,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"
'Hate-filled agenda': Cong slams arrest of Nagpur Christian priest; demands action against Bajrang Dal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hate-filled-agenda-cong-slams-arrest-of-nagpur-christian-priest-demands-action-against-bajrang-dal/articleshow/126275380.cms,"KC Venugopal (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday strongly criticised the BJP following the arrest of a Christian priest and 11 others in Nagpur, Maharashtra, during a Christmas prayer meeting, accusing the party of pursuing a “hate-filled agenda of religious bigotry. ”The Maharashtra Police arrested 12 individuals, including Father Sudhir, a Malayali priest of the CSI South Kerala Diocese, Nagpur Mission, and his wife Jasmine, after a complaint allegedly filed by Bajrang Dal activists. The arrests reportedly took place around 8.00 pm during a Christmas prayer meeting in Nagpur.According to the leaders, people who later went to the police station to enquire about the incident were also taken into custody, and cases were registered against them.Congress MP KC Venugopal in an official post on X described the incident as “highly condemnable” and alleged that the arrest showed the BJP ""uses the state machinery to harass Christians under the bogus pretense of religious conversions.""Venugopal said growing polarisation had made life “unlivable for all minorities” in BJP-ruled states. He demanded that the FIR against the priest be withdrawn immediately and called for strict action against what he described as “Bajrang Dal goons,” whose alleged “hooliganism” led to what he termed a “frivolous case.”He said, “Those who take law into their own hands and destroy the secular fabric envisioned in our Constitution must be the ones receiving punishment - not innocent citizens.”Kerala Assembly Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan also condemned the arrests and sought urgent intervention from the Centre and the Maharashtra government. In a post on X, he tagged PM Modi and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, demanding the release of all those arrested.In his letter, Satheesan wrote, “I write this letter to register my strong protest and to seek your urgent intervention regarding the arrest of twelve persons, including a Malayali priest, in Nagpur on allegations of forced religious conversion.”He added that Father Sudhir is a native of Amaravila in Thiruvananthapuram district and has been serving in Maharashtra for the past five years, while the remaining 10 arrested individuals are natives of Maharashtra.Satheesan said all the arrested persons are currently being detained at the Benoda Police Station and are likely to be produced before a court shortly. He noted that CSI representatives attempted to secure bail at the police station but were directed to approach the court.Describing the incident as alarming, he said, “This incident is deeply disturbing and raises serious concerns about the violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India, particularly the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate religion. Arresting individuals for conducting a peaceful prayer meeting is unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of our democratic and secular values. ”","The Maharashtra Police arrested 12 individuals, including Father Sudhir, a Malayali priest of the CSI South Kerala Diocese, Nagpur Mission, and his wife Jasmine.

Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

SRINAGAR: A sessions court in Jammu and Kashmir has acquitted three people arrested in 2022 for allegedly possessing arms, observing that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were in “conscious and unauthorised possession” of the arms at the time of their arrest.Additional sessions judge Manjeet Rai on Tuesday said there was a “total absence of independent witnesses or corroborative evidence” to support the UAPA allegations of association with Al-Badr and an intended terrorist act.“Accordingly, all three accused, namely Wajid Ahmad Bhat, Masrat Bilal, and Rameez Ahmad Dar, are acquitted of all charges levelled against them in this case,” the court said, directing police to release them “forthwith, if not required in any other case.”As per the prosecution, during a checking operation at Batamaloo in Srinagar on Oct 10, 2022, the accused allegedly attempted to flee but were apprehended by police. One live grenade was recovered from Bhat, while another live grenade, an AK-47 magazine, and 30 live rounds were recovered from Bilal. Police claimed that Rs 47,500 in cash was recovered from Dar.The chargesheet said the accused disclosed that they were working as “terrorist associates” of Al-Badr and had received the arms and ammunition from a masked overground worker of the organisation in Kulgam in south Kashmir.However, the defence counsel argued that the entire case rested solely on police witnesses, without a single independent civilian witness, despite the admitted presence of a CRPF bunker and shops on three sides of the spot from where the accused were arrested.",A sessions court in Jammu and Kashmir has acquitted three people arrested in 2022 for allegedly possessing arms.

DRDO Successfully Tests Pinaka Long-Range Guided Rocket In Odisha, To Be Inducted In Indian Army

Spreading 'falsehood' against Modi govt: JP Nadda hits out at Mallikarjun Kharge; calls cong president ‘self-obsessed’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spreading-falsehood-against-modi-govt-jp-nadda-hits-out-at-mallikarjun-kharge-calls-cong-president-self-obsessed/articleshow/126275394.cms,"'MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan': Congress Announces Nationwide Protest Against VB-G RAM G Act

NEW DELHI: BJP president J P Nadda on Wednesday accused Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of spreading “falsehood” against the Narendra Modi government and said it was surprising that the main opposition party continued to peddle “lies” despite repeated electoral defeats.Nadda’s remarks came in response to a post by Kharge on X earlier in the day, in which the Congress president alleged that the BJP’s “loot, corruption and misgovernance” dominated the country in 2025.Hitting back, Nadda asked whether the Congress had anything left to do other than “spreading lies”.“The Congress lost in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and it was also completely wiped out in Delhi and Bihar. Mr. Kharge, in 2025, the people of the country rejected all of your lies. Despite this, you are still not giving up on spreading falsehoods,” Nadda said in a post on X.“There is no ground left beneath your feet, yet the amazing thing is that you still don't believe it,” he added, taking a swipe at the Congress through a Hindi couplet.The BJP chief urged Kharge to introspect instead of being “self-obsessed” and accused him of continuing to spread “lies”.In a point-by-point rebuttal of Kharge’s 14 allegations, Nadda rejected claims related to welfare schemes and election processes. On the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, he said, “You lied about MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), claiming it had been abolished and that the poor had been deprived of their right to work, while the truth is that it has been expanded and strengthened, with the number of workdays increased to 125 and payment guaranteed within 15 days. ”“And it has been linked to village empowerment. Incidentally, your leader was meeting anti-India people at George Soros-funded Global Progressive Alliance when the discussion was happening on it [Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill (VB-G RAM G)],” Nadda said, asking Kharge, “Isn't that right?”On allegations of “vote chori”, Nadda questioned how many petitions the Congress had filed before the Election Commission.“You once again lied about the SIR (Special Intensive Revision) and the BLO (booth level officer), claiming that people's right to vote was snatched away and that the BJP's vote-chori was caught. Mr. Kharge, it was the people of this country who caught your lies and your falsehoods were also rejected in court,” he said.Referring to Bihar, Nadda added, “What happened in Bihar, Mr. Kharge? How many of your booth level agents (BLAs) actually went to the ground? There was no theft of people's votes. They exercised their right to vote and shut down your shop of 'booth-theft and lies'.”Responding to Kharge’s criticism of the economy, Nadda said India was now the world’s fourth-largest economy and the fastest growing amid global uncertainty, contrasting it with the UPA years when the country was counted among the “fragile five”.“India's foreign exchange reserves are at a record high today, but you won't see it because you intend to defame the country,” he charged.On Kharge’s remarks on Aravalli mining, Nicobar, Hasdeo and Mumbai mangroves, Nadda accused the Congress of “hypocrisy” and spreading “falsehood”.“During the Congress rule, the hills were openly plundered. The Congress systematically destroyed the Aravalli range through extensive mining. Your government didn't save the Aravallis; instead, it sold them off. We, on the other hand, imposed a ban and limited mining in accordance with the court's decision,” he said.Nadda also targeted the Congress over its stance on the judiciary, alleging that no party had damaged its reputation as much.“When a judgment didn't go your way, you brought an impeachment motion against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Now you've brought an impeachment motion against a judge of the Madras High Court. You insulted two Chief Justices while they were still in office,” he said.","BJP president J P Nadda accuses Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of spreading “falsehood” against the Narendra Modi government.

SRINAGAR: The J&K high court set aside Wednesday the conviction of an elderly woman in a 1979 murder case from Uri near the LoC in Baramulla district of north Kashmir, citing 46 years of prolonged proceedings and her age-related infirmities.A single-judge bench of Justice Sanjay Parihar ruled that the sentence of Shameema Begam should be treated as already undergone, saying no useful purpose would be served by maintaining a substantive jail term after decades of litigation. The court ordered closure of the case, while saying that “the offence was committed in a heat of passion without premeditation.”The killing dates back to July 10, 1979, when Begam of Bijhama village struck her mother-in-law with an axe during a domestic quarrel. The older woman had intervened in an argument when Begam was repeatedly asked to irrigate maize fields and later died of head wounds four days later.Begam was arrested on July 21, 1979, and released on bail on Oct 25 that year. Police registered an FIR at Bijhama police station under sections 326 and 324 of Ranbir Penal Code, the criminal law then in force in J&K under Dogra-era statutes. After the victim died, the charge was converted to murder under section 302 RPC.The trial dragged on for three decades. On July 16, 2009, a trial court convicted Begam under section 304 RPC, holding that the act was culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and sentenced her to five years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 2,000. She was arrested after conviction but released on bail within days — on July 28, 2009.Begam appealed the verdict. The appeal remained pending for more than 16 years before coming up for final hearing. Her lawyer Nida Nazir said extraordinary delay in both trial and appeal violated Begam’s right to a speedy trial and warranted a sympathetic approach.HC called the case “a testimony to the systemic delay in the disposal of criminal cases”. While delay cannot ordinarily benefit a convict, the court said, it cannot ignore the reality of accused people remaining trapped in the criminal justice system for decades. “The appeal is accordingly disposed of,” the court said, bringing an end to one of Kashmir’s longest-running criminal cases.",Shameema Begam struck her mother-in-law with an axe during a domestic quarrel in 1979.

This trust controlled a company based in Jersey and the British Virgin Islands, 'Catherine Property Holding Limited (CPHL)', which in turn held ownership of the said high-value immovable property in London,"" the agency said in a statement.During the course of investigation, ED has found that ""Kasliwal, through S Kumars Nationwide Limited, cheated the consortium of banks to the tune of Rs. 1400 crore and also diverted the funds outside India in the guise of foreign investments and thereafter acquired immovable assets outside India which were concealed through a complex structure of private trust and companies in foreign jurisdictions.""","The property, valued at approximately Rs 150 crore, is being held under the beneficial ownership of businessman Nitin Shambhukumar Kasliwal and his family members.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

NEW DELHI: Days after Isro launched its heavy-lift rocket LVM3 carrying US BlueBird Block-2 satellite, rocket debris, suspected of the Indian space rocket, washed ashore on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The rocket part was found on Sunday evening along the Malai Munthal sea stretch near Trincomalee. Local residents and fishermen first spotted the object after it was pushed ashore by strong ocean currents, prompting alerts to Sri Lankan authorities.Experts suspect the fragment is a portion of the payload fairing, the protective shell that houses satellites, which typically detaches during the rocket's ascent. The payload fairing is five metre in diameter and 10 metre long. Following the spotting of the debris, Lankan naval officials were deployed to secure the site. This is not the first such incident in the region. In the past, debris from rockets launched from Sriharikota had occasionally been recovered in the waters of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.In the past, parts of Indian rocket debris were also found on the Australian coast. On July 31, 2013, officials had identified an object found on a beach in Western Australia to be a part of a rocket launched by Isro. The Australian Space Agency had then said it was likely debris from the “expended third-stage of a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle”.","The rocket part was found on Sunday evening along the Malai Munthal sea stretch near Trincomalee.

NEW DELHI: CJI Surya Kant has devised four categories of cases to prioritise listing and hearing of petitions filed by socially, physically, and financially disadvantaged people.The new categories of cases relate to those filed by disabled people and acid attack survivors, by senior citizens above 80 years, persons who are below poverty line and those who have approached the court through legal aid services that provide free advocate assistance to poor litigants.The new categorisation was needed as their cases used to get lost in the crowd of 800-odd cases that get listed on Mondays and Fridays, the two days in a week when 16 benches of SC entertain fresh petitions and determine whether these require longer hearing.A circular by the SC registry said, ""Members of the Bar, parties-in-person and all stakeholders are required to invariably mention the relevant head... under which the matter actually falls, in all the fresh petitions to be filed... and submit an appropriate application/letter along with the documentary proof issued by an appropriate govt authority in this regard.""Further, all concerned are also requested to provide the said details in pending matters/cases to enable the registry to appropriately update the matter under the respective head.This will enable the registry to prioritise listing of such cases,"" it said.The humongous volume of cases handled by the highest court of the country is unmatched by any country's Supreme Court, by a huge margin.

Terror, Tariffs, Polls: PM Modi’s Mic-Drop Moments That Set The Agenda In 2025

NEW DELHI: The Pragati-led ecosystem for monitoring of projects and flagship schemes has helped accelerate projects worth more than Rs 85 lakh crore in the past decade, PM Modi said Wednesday while chairing the 50th Pragati meeting online with secretaries and chief secretaries.Modi described the milestone as a symbol of the deep transformation India has witnessed in the culture of governance over the last decade. In a statement, the PMO said Modi shared clear expectations for the next phase, outlining his ""vision of reform, perform and transform, saying reform to simplify, perform to deliver, transform to impact"". He said reform must mean moving from process to solutions, simplifying procedures and making systems more friendly for 'ease of living and ease of doing business'.It added the PM spoke how outcome-driven governance has been strengthened through Pragati. He also said transformation must be measured by what citizens actually feel about timely services, faster grievance resolution and improved 'ease of living'.""The PM underlined that when decisions are timely, coordination is effective and accountability is fixed, the speed of govt functioning naturally increases and its impact becomes visible directly in citizens' lives,"" it said.On Wednesday, the PM reviewed five infrastructure projects across sectors, including road, railways, power, water resources and coal, with a cumulative cost of more than Rs 40,000 crore.During a review of the PM SHRI scheme, Modi said that the scheme must become a national benchmark for holistic and future-ready school education and added that implementation should be outcome oriented rather than infrastructure centric. He asked all chief secretaries to closely monitor the scheme and asked them to make efforts to see that PM SHRI schools become benchmark for other schools of state govts.He suggested senior officers should undertake field visits to evaluate the performance of PM SHRI schools.Recalling the origin of Pragati, PM said as Gujarat CM, he had launched the technology-enabled Swagat platform (State Wide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology) to understand and resolve public grievances with discipline, transparency and time-bound action. Building on that experience, after assuming office at the Centre, he expanded the same spirit nationally through Pragati, bringing large projects, major programmes and grievance redressal onto one integrated platform for review, resolution, and follow-up.","Modi described the milestone as a symbol of the deep transformation India has witnessed in the culture of governance over the last decade.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has banned the manufacture, sale and distribution of all oral formulations of nimesulide above 100 mg in immediate-release form, citing risk to human health and the availability of safer alternatives.In a notification issued on Dec 29 and published in The Gazette of India, the health ministry said it was satisfied that continued use of higher-dose nimesulide was ""likely to involve risk to human beings"" and that the prohibition was necessary in public interest.Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for pain, inflammation and fever. The ban applies only to oral formulations above 100 mg in immediate-release form and takes effect immediately. Lower-dose formulations are not covered.The order has been issued under Section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, after consultation with the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB), and bars manufacturers, distributors and sellers from producing or supplying the banned formulations.Nimesulide has been under regulatory scrutiny for over a decade. In 2011, the central govt prohibited six drugs, including nimesulide, following DTAB recommendations, and barred its use in children below 12 years amid concerns over liver toxicity.Earlier this year, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also flagged safety concerns, recommending restrictions on nimesulide use in patients below 18 years and above 60 years, and advising that formulations above 100 mg be banned. In India, the drug is sold under brands such as Nimulid, Nimtex and Nicip, with Nise among the largest-selling brands.Welcoming the move, Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, said, ""This is a prudent and timely decision taken by govt. The restriction on high-dose immediate-release nimesulide addresses a long-standing safety concern, especially when misused or taken without supervision. With safer NSAID alternatives readily available, limiting exposure to higher doses is clearly in the interest of patient safety. ""","Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for pain, inflammation and fever.

‘Amit Shah’s Hands Were Shaking’: Rahul Gandhi Hits Out At BJP-RSS, Warns EC In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission Wednesday issued a strict warning that intimidation of electoral staff by political workers will not be tolerated and that stringent action will be taken against miscreants who attempt to take the law into their own hands.After a meeting with a TMC delegation, officials said the poll panel urged party netas to ensure their ground-level representatives do not threaten staff on election duty. ""Intimidation of any electoral staff, including booth-level officers (BLOs), electoral roll officers, assistant EROs, and observers, by political representatives will not be tolerated,"" an official said.EC also urged the West Bengal govt to immediately release the enhanced honorarium for BLOs, as approved by the commission. In response, AITC sources said CEC Gyanesh Kumar should write to Union finance minister seeking release of Rs 2 lakh crore of Bengal's allegedly blocked funds. They added that even if the funds are not released, the AITC-led govt would pay a Rs 50,000 honorarium to BLOs if such a letter is written.In a separate development, the CEO of West Bengal informed Wednesday that it had received only eight claims and objections from over two lakh booth-level agents of national- and state-level political parties for inclusion of names in the electoral roll between Dec 17 and 31 after the publication of the draft electoral roll on Dec 16.","EC urges party netas to ensure their ground-level representatives do not threaten staff on election duty.

‘Amit Shah’s Hands Were Shaking’: Rahul Gandhi Hits Out At BJP-RSS, Warns EC In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally

NEW DELHI: After its delegation met the full bench of the Election Commission on Wednesday, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee alleged that 'vote chori' (vote theft) is not happening in the EVM rather it is being done through manipulation of electoral rolls and Congress and other opposition parties failed to catch it in states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar where they lost in the assembly polls.""If they would have caught that - BJP would have lost in these states,"" Banerjee said while highlighting that TMC will not let this happen in West Bengal which goes to the polls in a few months.While training his guns at the EC and BJP, Banerjee urged like-minded parties to catch the votetheft, allegedly being done through manipulation using software in voter rolls.Banerjee, the Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour said that the battle against “vote theft” cannot be won through debates on TV channels or social media and asserted that opposition parties - the Congress and others will have to be on the ground, at polling booths, to thwart manipulation at the stage of special intensive revision (SIR) and special summary revision.The remarks came after a 10 - member TMC delegation led by Banerjee met the Election Commission led by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and raised various concerns related to the Special Intensive Revision process in West Bengal. Banerjee said he told the CEC that “you are weaponising the electoral rolls”.“The EC has failed to address most of the concerns that we raised. We will not accept the final voter list if it has discrepancies”, Banerjee said alleging collusion between the EC and BJP.He said that the TMC was ready to ""fight it legally"" if required going forward. The 10-member delegation included MPs Derek O'Brien, Saket Gokhale, Kalyan Banerjee, Nadimul Haque, Ritabrata Banerjee and Mamata Thakur, and ministers from West Bengal. In the meeting with the Election Commission led by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar they raised various concerns related to the SIR process in West Bengal. Banerjee said he told the CEC that “you are trying to weaponise the electoral rolls”.Banerjee also alleged that Kumar was ""aggressive"" during the meeting and challenged the CEC to release the CCTV footage of the nearly two and a half hour meeting. He said the party would fight it legally if EC failed to address its concerns on SIR.Pointing that people wanted to vote for opposition parties like Cong, AAP and RJD in Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar, Banerjee said, “If the Congress had been able to catch this it would have won and the BJP would have lost. I appeal to all like-minded parties, especially those in the opposition: the theft is happening in the voter list, in the software, not in the EVM. You are failing to understand what algorithms and software are being run to disenfranchise and remove voters,” he asserted.He also questioned the EC's move to retroactively introduce a new category termed ""logical discrepancies"", summoning 1.36 crore voters for hearing on different grounds, including issues like unreasonable age gaps between parents and children, name and surname mismatches and address related issues. The party has demanded why the detailed discrepancy list has not been made public.Among the various issues raised with the EC, the TMC has challenged the poll panel to come out with the list of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas among the 58 lakh voters whose names have been deleted in the draft electoral roll. ""There is selective targeting, allegations of infiltration, which are leaked to malign West Bengal,"" Banerjee alleged.","Abhishek Banerjee says 'vote theft' is not happening in the EVM rather it is being done through manipulation of electoral rolls.

'Will Rid Bengal Of Infiltrators': Amit Shah Slams Mamata Banerjee’s 14-Year Rule, Sounds Poll Bugle

KOLKATA: Union home minister Amit Shah urged BJP functionaries and workers in Bengal to mentally lock in victory in the 2026 assembly elections. ""Dil pe likh lo, is baar hamari sarkar (Write it on your hearts, this time it's our govt),"" Shah said Wednesday, hours before leaving Kolkata.Addressing party workers, Shah set a specific target. ""Our workers have been killed and that has bled our hearts. This time, I want 22 out of 28 seats from areas in and around Kolkata,"" he said. On Tuesday, Shah had said BJP would form next govt in Bengal with a two-thirds majority.Kolkata district and adjoining urban pockets include constituencies such as Jadavpur, Dumdum, and central neighbourhoods like Jorasanko and Shyampukur. BJP failed to win a single assembly seat in these areas in the 2021 state polls, but led in Jorasanko and Shyampukur during the 2024 LS election count.During his hour-long address, Shah referred to Bhowanipore, the constituency from which CM Mamata Banerjee won the 2021 bypolls. When he initially said BJP had led in three civic wards there, party worker Navin Mishra stood up to correct him. Shah accepted the correction.""Hard work helped us lead in five civic wards in Bhowanipore,"" Shah said, revising his remark.Party seniors said Shah wants a breakthrough in the wider Kolkata belt - nearly 140 seats across Kolkata's periphery, North and South 24 Parganas districts to the east and south, and Howrah district across Hooghly river to the west. ""These are areas where the party is still weak. Shah wants us to penetrate this zone,"" a Bengal BJP neta said.Shah raised concerns about alleged infiltration and what he described as a ""changing demography"" around Kolkata. ""He said we may not fully grasp the danger now, but Kolkata is no longer safe. Infiltration will rise and the consequences will be serious,"" a functionary said, quoting him.The home minister also sought to counter perceptions of organisational weakness in the state. ""He told us to ignore narratives about a weak organisation. Compared to 2021, our strength has improved a lot,"" the neta added.Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh, meanwhile, dismissed Shah's claim that BJP will win Bengal in 2026 polls, saying party workers were being fed ""daydreams"" and faulty arithmetic. ""BJP's maths is wrong,"" Ghosh said, alleging the saffron party was building a narrative that Trinamool's victory margins would be offset by voter deletions under EC's SIR. ""Every 70-75% turnout means 25-30% didn't vote. Deletions will fall there. Let them daydream.""Responding to BJP's corruption allegations, he said netas facing graft charges ""turn saints"" after joining BJP, calling it ""the biggest washing machine"". Ghosh also rejected BJP criticism of Bengal's record on women's safety, citing cases such as Unnao, Hathras and Bilkis Bano in BJP-governed states.","Union home minister Amit Shah urged BJP functionaries and workers in Bengal to mentally lock in victory in the 2026 assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata-based businessman weaved a web of 60 shell companies with drivers, house-keeping staff, office boys, junior staff and relatives as directors and created a fictitious turnover of thousands of crores in iron & steel manufacturing, all on paper with no real business activity involved, and swindled a consortium of govt banks of more than Rs 6,200 crore, with the head of one of the lead banks playing accessory.The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities and with the help of S K Goel, then CMD of Uco Bank, managed to get loans of Rs 6,200 crore. ""Against loans of over Rs 6,200 crore, the company's liquidation value barely reached Rs 600 crore, and assets sold so far have realised only Rs 434 crore,"" ED has said in its investigation report.The entire operation was unearthed with Goel's arrest by ED on May 16 at his residence in New Delhi. The agency later identified properties worth over Rs 106 crore associated with family members and aides and attached them. Sureka and his associates were arrested in Dec 2024, as the agency started probing money laundering based on a CBI FIR against them.According to an ED investigation report, at the centre of this scam was Concast Steel & Power Ltd (CSPL) - once a flagship iron & steel group with plants across West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh - which was taken over by Sureka in 2008.Sureka conjured up the shell entities and with the help of Goel, who served as CMD of Uco Bank between 2007-2010, managed to get a total of Rs 6,200 crore in loans without interest and penalty.This money was laundered by the accused and quid pro quo to Goel was transferred in the name of shell companies that purchased properties on the bank CMD's behalf with the ownership of these firms later being transferred to Goel's family members.""It is a case study in how an entire financial ecosystem can be manipulated through fake turnover, circular transactions and system-wide blind spots, ultimately leaving public sector banks poorer by more than Rs 6,210.7 crore, excluding interest,"" a senior official said.The official further said 60 shell companies sprang up under the directorship of drivers, office boys and junior staff to help Sureka justify massive flows of funds.ED's investigation unearthed fake sales, purchases and transport billings where CSPL ""pretended to buy and sell iron and steel products"" with associated entities, backed by forged invoices, ledger entries, and transport documents. ""Fake transportation receipts were prepared to show trucks carrying goods between factories and shell companies, even though no truck ever moved, no goods were loaded, and no delivery was made. Yet on paper, CSPL looked like a bustling, high-volume operation with continuous production and sales,"" a source said.The probe further revealed that neither sale proceeds nor payments for purchases were made through banks, 99% of the transactions were merely book entries. Yet, during the entire operation lasting several years, it did not raise any alarm bells in the banks, which continued lending.""This meant Concast was essentially selling to itself and then realising these payments through accounting fiction. By 2017, the deception hit its peak - 99% of all sales to these entities were settled through book adjustments, not a single real rupee flowed in through the banking system,"" sources said.Purchases tell the same story. Over 50% of all raw material sourcing came from the same web of related-party entities. And just like sales, almost 90% of payments to these ""suppliers"" were made through internal adjustments - no real cash outflow, no genuine material movement, just rotating entries to manufacture expenses, inflate working capital needs, and justify massive fund withdrawals, the probe report said.","The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities.

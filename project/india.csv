How a modern IADS works

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Aug 23 successfully carried out the maiden flight-tests of the Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS). Held off the coast of Odisha, the test validated the country's first fully indigenous multi-layered air defence shield.During the demonstration, IADWS engaged and destroyed three aerial targets simultaneously - two high-speed fixed-wing UAVs and a multi-copter drone. The targets were neutralised at varying altitudes and ranges, proving the system's versatility against different airborne threats.The system integrates three indigenously developed technologies - Quick Reaction Surface-to-Air Missiles (QRSAM), Very-Short Range Air Defence System (VSHORADS) missiles, and a high-power laser-based Directed Energy Weapon (DEW). Together, they create a layered shield capable of countering everything from low-flying drones to high-speed aircraft and missiles.Control of all components is exercised through a Centralised Command and Control Centre, developed by the Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL). This ensures radars, communication networks, missile batteries, and directed-energy weapons function in unison, maximising reaction time and accuracy.At the heart of IADWS is the QRSAM, providing frontline protection to Army units on the move. Mounted on 8x8 high-mobility vehicles, it allows ""fire-on-the-move"" capability. Its dual-radar system - the Active Array Battery Surveillance Radar and Active Array Battery Multifunction Radar - provides 360-degree detection, tracking, and targeting of multiple threats. With a strike envelope of 25-30km and altitudes up to 10km, QRSAM can intercept aircraft, helicopters, drones, and missiles with precision.By filling the gap between man-portable short-range systems and long-range missile defences like the S-400, QRSAM forms the mobile first layer of the IADWS shield.Complementing QRSAM are the VSHORADS and DEW. VSHORADS, developed by DRDO's Research Centre Imarat, is a man-portable missile designed for low-altitude threats. Lightweight and field-deployable, it adds agility and flexibility to the IADWS framework.The most futuristic element is DEW. In April, DRDO showcased its 30-kilowatt laser against drones, helicopters, and missiles at ranges up to 3.5km. With 360-degree electro-optical sensors and jamming features, DEW marks India's entry into 'Star Wars'-style defence.DRDO chief Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning... We are also working on high-energy microwaves and electromagnetic pulses that will give us Star Wars capability.""Together, QRSAM, VSHORADS, and DEW provide India with a robust, multi-dimensional defence system.Tailored For Regional ThreatsGlobally, nations such as Russia, China, and Iran have developed sophisticated Integrated Air Defence Systems (IADS) to counter US airpower. These systems force US operations farther out to avoid detection. They link radars, mobile command posts, and space-based sensors to create a distributed, networked shield. Russia's S-400 is among the toughest, with radars reaching 400km and missiles of similar range. Though rarely fired to maximum distance, this capability enables flexible engagement within the given range. The challenge lies in neutralising not a single sensor or missile, but an interconnected web. India's IADWS mirrors this philosophy, tailored for regional threats.The IADWS test comes a few days after the successful trial of the Agni-V ballistic missile on Aug 20. It also draws lessons from Operation Sindoor in May, when India's multi-layered defences thwarted Turkish-origin drones and Chinese-supplied missiles used by Pakistan. The operation reinforced the need for homegrown systems tested in live combat scenarios.This renewed focus on indigenisation underlines a wider shift in India's defence ecosystem. From Operation Sindoor to the IADWS test, the pattern is clear: India is preparing to fight future wars with indigenous technologies.In his Red Fort speech on Aug 15, PM Modi urged Indian innovators and the domestic defence industry to develop jet engines indigenously - a technological gap that continues to haunt India's aerospace sector. Despite breakthroughs in missiles and radars, India still depends on foreign suppliers for engines, holding back projects like the Tejas fighter and AMCA stealth aircraft.While a HAL-GE joint venture is reportedly being discussed and the long-delayed Kaveri engine remains incomplete despite over Rs 2,000 crore invested, India's vulnerability in propulsion contrasts with its advances in air defence.This prolonged dependence on foreign jet engines, particularly from the US, France, and Russia, highlights a major vulnerability. While India has made breakthroughs in missiles, radars, and air-defence systems, its inability to master jet engine technology continues to hold back flagship projects like the Tejas fighter and the AMCA stealth aircraft. By situating the QRSAM success within this broader narrative, India's defence roadmap reflects both its recent achievements and the challenges that remain.","The Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS) is India's first fully indigenous multi-layered air defence shield.

NEW DELHI: The sentiment for a boycott of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the bill on dismissal of jailed ministers is growing, with Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday saying that the parliamentary panels are a sham and serve no purpose under BJP govt. The CPI stance after boycott decision by four opposition parties will increase the pressure on Congress to follow suit.CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash. “There was a time when members on the JPC could summon documents, scrutinise details and then make contributions. Now, the opposition’s suggestions are rejected out of hand. The JPC on Waqf bill is an example. It is of no value,” he told TOI .While the Left parties don’t have the strength to be in the parliamentary panels and depend on the govt’s goodwill to find a place in them, the CPI opinion carries weight since it could be seen as representative of other smaller Left constituents.The sentiment of an integral part of the opposition INDIA bloc follows announcements by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP that they will not participate in the JPC that is being formed to scrutinise the controversial bills, including the constitutional amendment.The offensive from the bigger INDIA bloc parties has forced Congress to take a relook at its inclination to join the proposed JPC in the interest of opposition unity. There is regret in Congress that compulsion of unity may nudge the party into following the cue of TMC-SP-Shiv Sena, arguing it will result in complications for the future, as well as when the three controversial bills come up in the parliament for discussion.Many key INDIA bloc parties like DMK, NCP (SP) and CPM have not spoken out yet, since they seem to be waiting for Congress to take a final decision. A Left outfit MP said no party would want to stand alone on the issue that will be viewed as a test of unity of the bloc.This has triggered speculation that a complete opposition boycott of the JPC is possible. While this marks a major division in the anti-BJP ranks, for a change it is not a split that ends up favouring BJP, but one of competitive hostility to the govt’s initiative. “We have to know how far we should go, because these are important issues where some points have to be put on record,” a pro-JPC MP said.",CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash.

This is not mandatory that devotees have to keep the idol for 11 days as some devotees keep it for 1 and half day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days or as per their convenience.Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra are the states that celebrate this festival the most. People are cautioned not to look for the moon on this day since it is believed that anyone, who does could be cursed. Thus, people should refrain from seeing the moon.Wake up early in the morning and clean the house specially the place, where you want to keep the idol. Decorate the place with flowers, lights and other decorative material. Bring Bappa at home according to the Muhurat. Place him there on the wooden plank, offer yellow flower garland or durva garland, light a diya with desi ghee, offer 11 blades of durva grass, offer modaks and boondi laddoos, sing bhajans and devotional songs to appease Bappa. Chant various Vedic mantras to invoke the idol, recite stotrams and names of Lord Ganesha. At the end of the puja, recite aarti of Lord Ganesha ""Jai Ganesh Jai Ganesh Jai Ganesh Deva"" and spend the entire day with Bappa.","For Hindus, Ganesh Chaturthi is a very important and major holy festival.

He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements.

Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region.

Who was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?

The UAE has officially declared a public holiday for government employees to mark the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which falls on Friday, September 5, 2025, according to the Islamic (Hijri) calendar.As this year’s observance coincides with a Friday, UAE residents may benefit from a long weekend (Friday to Sunday), providing a time for spiritual reflection and rest.The Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, and key religious dates, such as the Prophet’s birthday, are determined by the sighting of the new moon.On Saturday, August 23, 2025, the International Astronomy Center in the UAE confirmed that the crescent moon marking the start of Rabi Al Awwal (the third month of the Islamic calendar) was not sighted anywhere in the Arab world.Due to this, the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal— the date traditionally recognised as the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday— will be observed on Friday, September 5, 2025, in the UAE and several other countries.The 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal holds profound significance in Islam as it commemorates the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Across the Muslim world, this day is marked with prayers, religious lectures, and community gatherings that celebrate the Prophet’s life, character, and teachings.It is a moment to reflect on the Prophet’s message of compassion, justice, and unity, which remains central to the Islamic faith.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the final messenger of Islam, following prophets such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant, and passed away in 632 CE in Medina.Throughout his life, the Prophet played a transformative role— not only as a spiritual leader but also as a unifier and reformer of Arabian society. His teachings, preserved in the Qur'an and Hadith, form the foundation of Islamic belief and practice, continuing to influence over a billion Muslims worldwide","The UAE has declared a public holiday on Friday, September 5, 2025, for Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) birthday.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” He said no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams. SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123514961,imgsize-418059,width-400,resizemode-4/123514961.jpg"
India to begin testing new long-range interceptor missiles for defence shield next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-begin-testing-new-long-range-interceptor-missiles-for-defence-shield-next-year/articleshow/123536547.cms,"India’s Agni-5 Missile Test Sparks Panic In Pakistan, Raises Global Concerns Over Regional Stability

Poll Which aspect of the Mission Sudarshan Chakra do you find most crucial? Missile defence shield for protection Advanced technology for counter-strikes

NEW DELHI: India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha, which will be a critical element of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra (MSC)’ announced by PM Modi to provide security cover to strategic as well as vital civilian areas in the country by 2035.The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions, in 2026. It will be followed by M2 (250-km range) in 2027 and M3 (350-km range) in 2028 for the missile-based layered defence system being developed by DRDO, top sources told TOI.The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles (LR-SAMs) and related systems under Project Kusha by 2028 to, hopefully, pave the way for their induction from 2030 onwards, the sources added.This fully-automated LR-SAM system, which will rival the expensive Russian-origin S-400 Triumf air defence system deployed by the IAF in limited numbers, will be a part of the overall MSC plan to build a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around key locations.In this, it will be somewhat similar to the proposed `Golden Dome’ missile defence initiative of the US or the deployed Israeli `Iron Dome’, which only has to protect a very small country.It is estimated the expansive Golden Dome, with the capability to also shoot down missiles in space, will cost around $500 billion over the next 20 years.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, at the `Ran Samwad’ conclave at Mhow on Tuesday, said he was sure India could build its own “Iron or Golden Dome” under the MSC at “an affordable cost” with a whole-of-nation approach.“It will act both as a shield and sword,” the CDS said, in tune with the PM’s statement that the defence shield will not only thwart aerial threats but also launch counter-strikes to hit the adversary “many times more”.This clearly implies India will go in for a major expansion of its conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of missiles like Pralay (500-km strike range), BrahMos (increased range from 450-km to 800-km) and land-attack cruise missiles (1,000-km range).Gen Chauhan, on his part, acknowledged the proposed defence shield will require “a colossal amount of integration” of myriad capabilities as well as development of infrastructure and processes for “detection, acquisition and neutralisation of enemy air vectors, using soft and hard kill options, including kinetic and directed energy weapons (like lasers)”.The shield, of course, will require multi-domain ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) through an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors deployed on land, air, sea, undersea and space.Then, robust land and sea-based batteries of a wide array of short to long range SAM missiles, high-power lasers and other weapons will be needed. Finally, reliable command and control posts to manage the sensors and weapons with an integrated air picture to effectively respond in real-time.A small beginning was made with DRDO’s maiden test of an integrated air defence weapon system (IADWS) on Aug 23. It included quick reaction surface-to-air missiles (QRSAMS, with 30-km interception range), very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS, with 6-km range) missiles and a 30-kilowatt laser-based directed energy weapon (DEW, with 3.5-km range).“Many of the building blocks for the MSC defence shield have either been developed or are being developed. The real challenge will be to integrate them all. It will cost a lot of money for a large country like India,” a source said.A comprehensive defence shield will also include the operational deployment of Phase-I of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which has been developed by DRDO to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, DRDO also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions. The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles (LR-SAMs) and related systems under Project Kusha by 2028.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123536546,imgsize-392171,width-400,resizemode-4/123536546.jpg"

To R. Madhavan , he described Kailash as “the greatest mystical library on the planet and in the known universe,” emphasising its spiritual significance.Sadhguru also reflected on the broader role of regional cooperation: “Geographically congruent nations must come together… function geographically as one unit though politically and otherwise we are separate.” Speaking to Nag Ashwin, he urged young people to embrace spiritual growth early, noting it should not be reserved for later in life.","The reopening of the Kailash Yatra route through Tibet has allowed Indian pilgrims to undertake the spiritual journey.

KOCHI: Kerala high court Wednesday acquitted five former police officers, including one who was sentenced to death by a trial court in the Udayakumar custodial murder case. The murder took place at Thiruvananthapuram’s Fort Police Station in 2005.A bench of Justices V Raja Vijayaraghavan and K V Jayakumar set aside the conviction and sentences of former ASI K Jithakumar, former crime branch DSP T Ajith Kumar, retired SP E K Sabu and retired ACP T K Haridas, citing serious lapses in the CBI investigation. Jithakumar and S V Sreekumar had been awarded the death penalty by a CBI special court, while the others were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. Sreekumar died in 2020, during the pendency of the appeal, while another accused, Soman, had died pending trial.According to the prosecution, P Udayakumar, a 28-year-old man, was picked up by Jithakumar and Sreekumar at around 2.15am on Sept 27, 2005, while with a friend at Sreekanteswaram Park. A sum of Rs 4,000 was recovered from him, and he was taken to Fort Police Station, and then to the circle inspector’s office nearby where he was allegedly subjected to custodial violence. He was later declared dead at the medical college hospital.The prosecution claimed his death resulted from torture in custody.The initial CB-CID probe arraigned only three officers as accused, but the trial faltered as most prosecution witnesses turned hostile. Udayakumar’s mother then moved the HC, which ordered a CBI probe. CBI arraigned eight more police officers as accused; on the same day, their applications seeking pardons were filed before court. Pardon was granted on the condition that they make full and true disclosure of all facts and circumstances. CBI later filed its final report, naming six officers as accused. The trial court convicted and sentenced them, leading to the appeals before the HC.The bench held that CBI committed a serious illegality by filing its final report before a magistrate’s court in a case already committed to a sessions court, thereby violating the right of the accused to a fair trial. The procedure adopted in seeking pardons before the chief judicial magistrate was also found to be ex facie illegal and contrary to mandatory provisions of CrPC.","Kerala high court acquitted five former police officers, including one who was sentenced to death by a trial court in the Udayakumar custodial murder case.

This will help spread the message of govt's focus on welfare of the poor, they added.PM also asked ministers to hold events of their ministries and departments across the country instead of just hosting them in Delhi so that people know about the activities and schemes undertaken by the Centre.

Want to get elected as VP to protect Constitution: Sudershan Reddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/want-to-get-elected-as-vp-to-protect-constitution-sudershan-reddy/articleshow/123552318.cms,"PTI file photo

What led you to join the VP post contest in times considered to be highly polarised?

What do you have to say about the talk that numbers are already skewed in favour of NDA?

How do you see HM Amit Shah’s criticism of your judgment on disbanding anti-Maoist Salwa Judum militia, and BJP seeing the verdict through the prism of judicial bias?

What do you have to say on Shah’s criticism of your judgment on eviction of security forces from school buildings where they were lodged as part of anti-Maoist ops?

Your response to the statement of 18 ex-judges supporting you and around 56 others opposing?

What about criticism of ex-judges seeking constitutional posts — ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi accepting RS nomination and c

oncerns about impartiality of judiciary in 1967 when ex-CJI Subba Rao contested for VP post.

You have been meeting the leaders of various opposition parties. Your response to the contest being framed like a Tamil pride versus Telugu pride? Your reaction to YSRCP supporting the NDA candidate?

Interview of opposition Vice Presidential candidate Justice (retired) B Sudershan Reddy (Excerpts)Society is getting increasingly polarised. This must be stopped because I believe the biggest threat doesn’t come from govts alone in a democracy but the threat comes from citizens themselves when they try to divide society on the basis of religion, caste, language and region. To arrest this tendency I thought of contesting this election.I am a liberal Constitutional democrat and I want to get elected as the VP of the country to defend and protect the Constitution of India. Hitherto my duty was to uphold the Constitution. That is the distinction between the oath administered to a judge and Vice President and President of India.You know there is no whip, political parties as such do not vote. It is the members of the Parliament who vote and it is a secret ballot. Political party business should not enter this arena. Parties may choose their candidate but ultimately voters are the members of Parliament. Therefore, I don’t understand this fight of numbers...I am very optimistic and am going to appeal to all members of all political parties and I will be formally releasing a letter addressing all MPs soon.It is their choice. There are six balls in one over. After the sixth ball nothing remains.I think 5 or 6 are perhaps already over. Some are spinners, some are fast bowlers. Some spin they are trying. The most unfortunate thing is that no one would make such a comment if they have read the judgement. Infact, in the Salwa Judum judgement I was speaking about the menace of violence. I further said that it is the Constitutional duty and obligation of the state to protect the rights and liberty of its citizens. I said you cannot outsource your right to use arms whenever it is necessary to protect the society. I had said please do your duty and do not involve these innocent tribals.In those maoist areas, who are those kids going to school? They have hardly any facilities and whatever schools that were in existence were under the control of security forces depriving the children the right to get educated which is a guaranteed right. Apart from the Right To Education Act even the Constitution gives them that right. Should I presume that the mighty state is unable to provide accomodation to its security forces and occupied the school and college buildings. What is it that I said? You have taken away the school building, let the school be run.If a judge discharges his Constitutional obligation, interpreting the Constitution as per law as established can be dubbed and characterised as a bias tomorrow. God,...if there is one, save this country.What do I say about it? When I say divisive forces are at work this is what I meant. I must thank the 56 colleagues - authors of this text who may have signed or not...they gave me unsolicited advice that it is a political contest, you face it. I never asked them if it is a political contest or not because I have been repeatedly saying that it is a high Constitutional office.I won’t speak about any specific person. I am not asking anyone to nominate me. I am seeking an election appealing to MPs to consider my candidature on merit. Former CJI Subba Rao was attacked for writing the Golaknath judgment where you find the origin and basis of formulating that fundamental rights cannot be altered by Parliament. There is a foundation laid in that very judgment about the basic structure. Later, Kesavananda Bharati merely clarified that no it is not as if no part of the Constitution can be amended. ..it is not as if no part of fundamental rights can be amended but the Constitution’s basic structure cannot be amended. Those perhaps who believed at that time that anything and everything can be amended and that Justice Rao through Golaknath was coming in the way, therefore they unleashed an attack.In Salwa Judum, I was talking about social justice, the ideals enshrined in the Preamble, civil rights and liberties of the people and a Constitutional doctrine that the State alone has the monopoly to use weapons to quell violence. It cannot hire the services of an organised group. The moment you speak about some values in the Constitution, it is not palatable to some, they start spinning it.Ans: This nation is one. India that is Bharat is a union of states. There is no separate citizenship for Tamil Nadu and Telangana. Neither Shri CP Radhakrishnan ji has chosen to be born in Tamil Nadu nor Justice Sudershan Reddy chose to be born in Telangana. So there is nothing like Telangana versus Tamil Nadu. As far as YSRCP is concerned it is their political leadership’s choice but I don’t know what their MPs will do as there is no whip and it is a secret ballot. Therefore, why should I not appeal to everyone to consider my candidature for vice president when they vote.","Justice (retired) B Sudershan Reddy says society is getting increasingly polarised.

Singh: We must be ready for unforeseen challenges

NEW DELHI: The Indian armed forces and defence industry must be prepared for all kinds of security challenges from short-duration battles to even a five-year war amid the current unpredictable geopolitical situation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday, citing examples from Operation Sindoor and the long-drawn Russia-Ukraine war.""India has never been a nation that seeks war. We have never initiated aggression against anyone. However, the present geopolitical reality is quite different. Even though we do not harbour any aggressive intent, if someone challenges us, it becomes imperative that we respond with strength. We do not want anybody's land but we are ready to go to any extent to protect our land,"" Singh said, speaking at the 'Ran Samwad' conclave at Mhow. The armed forces and defence industry must remain ready for new innovations. tnnThe armed forces and defence industry must remain ready for unforeseen challenges while mastering existing technologies to stay ahead of the curve to effectively tackle complexities of modern-day warfare that now extends to space and cyberspace, defence minister Rajnath Singh said.Describing Operation Sindoor as a ""striking demonstration"" of technology-driven warfare and ""a great example demonstrating the success"" of indigenous weapons, Singh said, ""Our endeavour must be to define the battlefield and the rules of the game ourselves, compelling the adversary to fight there, so that the lead advantage always remains with us.""The sheer numbers of soldiers or the size of weapon stockpiles are no longer enough because cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellite-based surveillance and real-time intelligence are shaping wars of the future.""Technology is advancing at such a pace that by the time we fully grasp one innovation, another emerges to completely alter the course of warfare,"" he further said.With it also becoming difficult to predict how long a war will last, Singh said it is crucial to continuing strengthening the domestic defence industry. ""If any war stretches for two months, four months, a year, two years, even five years, then we should be fully prepared. We must ensure our surge capacity is sufficient...We have indeed made significant progressbut there is still a long way ahead,"" he said.""What we require today is not just defensive preparedness but also a proactive strategy. Future wars will not merely be battles of weapons; they will be a play of technology, intelligence, economy and diplomacy. The nation that masters the triangle of technology, strategy and adaptability will emerge as the true global power,"" he added.","The armed forces and defence industry must remain ready for new innovations.

In May too, Nagarathna had objected to Pancholi's elevation

Acting NEW DELHI: Acting on the recommendation the Supreme Court collegium made two days ago, the Centre on Tuesday notified the appointment of Justices Alok Aradhe and Vipul Manubhai Pancholi, chief justices of Bombay and Patna high courts, respectively, as justices of the apex court. The two judges will take oath on Thursday.One collegium member, Justice B V Nagarathna, had given a note of dissent over the choice of Justice Pancholi. The elevation of Justice Pancholi, in line to become CJI in Oct 2031 after the retirement of Justice Joymalya Bagchi, was opposed by Justice Nagarathna, who pointed out that he was 57th in the seniority list and the reasons behind his transfer from Gujarat HC to Patna HC in July 2023 must be looked into.Justice B V Nagarathna also said that Justice Pancholi was from Gujarat HC, which was already represented by Justices J B Pardiwala and Justice N V Anjaria, while underlining the reprimand the CJ of Patna high court got from Justice Vikram Nath.However, the other four members of the collegium - CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath and J K Maheshwari - found both Justices Aradhe and Pancholi to be suitable and competent for appointment.Justice Nagarathna had earlier, too, objected to Justice Pancholi's elevation to the apex court in May this year, leading the collegium to defer his name and instead recommend the name of Justice Anjaria.In her two-page dissent note, Justice B V Nagarathna had noted that recommending Justice Pancholi's name for appointment as Supreme Court judge, despite the reasons cited by her, could ""erode whatever credibility the collegium system still holds"".She wanted the collegium to reflect on the July 2023 transfer of Justice Pancholi, which was ""not a routine transfer, but a carefully considered move made after consultations with several senior judges, all of who concurred with the decision"".","Justices Alok Aradhe and Vipul Manubhai Pancholi, chief justices of Bombay and Patna high courts, respectively, will take oath on Thursday.

Pakistan Link In Pahalgam Confirmed: Funeral Of Attacker Neutralized In Op Mahadev Held In Pok

NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev, which saw Indian security personnel avenge the Pahalgam terror attack with targeted hits on Pakistani territory as well as the elimination of three Pakistani terrorists who had killed 26 innocent Indians in cold blood, have sent a clear message to the Pakistan-based terror masterminds about “the consequences of playing with lives of Indian citizens,” home minister Amit Shah said here on Wednesday.The comments came during Shah’s meeting here with Operation Mahadev bravehearts from the Indian Army , CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir police; during which he felicitated them on the successful neutralisation of Pahalgam mastermind Suleiman alias Faisal Jatt and his accomplices Afghan and Jibran, in an encounter in Dachigam forest area on the outskirts of Srinagar. “Technical analysis by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) conclusively established that the terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev were the ones who had unleashed the mayhem in Pahalgam,” said Shah.As part of Operation Mahadev, Indian Army para commandos, along with CRPF and J&K Police, had on July 28 eliminated the three Pahalgam attackers after cornering them in their temporary hideout, ending a long and painstaking manhunt to deliver justice to the 26 victims of Pahalgam attack.“I congratulate all the security personnel on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the public, for having fortified the sense of security among countrymen,” Shah told them.He noted that the personnel had shown the world that terrorists, irrespective of the change in tactics and strategy, cannot escape unscatched after harming Indian interests.Stating that Pahalgam attack was an attempt to derail the ‘Kashmir mission’ — defined by restoration of normalcy and boosting of development in the Valley — when tourism was at its peak, the home minister said the people of India were content with Operation Sindoor but this satisfaction turned into self-confidence with Operation Mahadev.“This trust in security forms the foundation of aspirations to see India take the lead globally, in every field,” said the home minister.Shah underlined that J&K police now take the lead in joint anti-terror operations conducted along with the Army and CAPFs in Kashmir.“Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev instilled a sense of joy and enthusiasm among those in power and the Opposition alike; both the sides expressed gratitude towards the forces,” Shah told the Operation Mahadev heroes.","Home minister Amit Shah felicitated Operation Mahadev bravehearts on successful neutralisation of Pahalgam mastermind Suleiman alias Faisal Jatt and his accomplices Afghan and Jibran. “Technical analysis by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) conclusively established that the terrorists killed in OperationMahadev were the ones who had unleashed the mayhem,” said Shah.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123549856,imgsize-41230,width-400,resizemode-4/123549856.jpg"

LUCKNOW: In line with the Yogi Government's directive, a statewide road safety campaign, 'No Helmet, No Fuel,' will run from September 1 to 30 across Uttar Pradesh, according to an official release.Led by district magistrates in coordination with road safety committees, the drive will see police, transport, revenue, and district administration officials working jointly to ensure two-wheeler riders comply with helmet rules under the Motor Vehicles Act Fuel will be denied at petrol pumps to those not wearing helmets, with the aim of promoting road safety rather than imposing a penalty. The Yogi Government has appealed to the public to extend full cooperation with the enforcement agencies.The initiative is lawful and designed in the public interest. Section 129 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, makes helmets mandatory for both two-wheeler riders and pillion passengers, while Section 194D prescribes penalties for violations.The Supreme Court's road safety committee has also advised states to give priority to helmet compliance.

Citizens, industry, and administration can work together to take concrete steps towards achieving the national goal of reducing deaths and serious injuries in road accidents.""No Helmet, No Fuel"" is not a punishment but a pledge for safety. This campaign will run from September 1 to 30 as a well-coordinated effort involving multiple government departments under the leadership of DMs. All citizens, petrol pump operators, and oil companies are appealed to extend their full cooperation.

Day of the Jackal

There are a number of reasons. After “Lady Doctors” did quite well, I received several offers to write about the first women lawmakers, engineers, lawyers and so on. But I didn’t want to be boxed in as a writer only covering forgotten women. I wanted to do something completely different in tone and subject.While exploring ideas, I came across the story of Virendranath Chattopadhyay, brother of Sarojini Naidu. Unlike Sarojini, who followed the Gandhian path, Virendranath was a revolutionary and anarchist, pursued by the British Secret Service across Europe. He lived in the UK, France, Berlin, Sweden, and finally the Soviet Union, where he was executed during Stalin’s Great Purge.I also discovered his rival, MN Roy, better known in West Bengal as a co-founder of Indian communism. He too had a dramatic life—pursued by intelligence agencies, becoming a protégé of Lenin, and escaping Soviet Russia just before Virendranath’s execution.Though there are scholarly works on both men, I realised no popular history combined their stories. So I set out to do just that—write an accessible, engaging book for the ordinary reader rather than an academic audience.That’s where it all began.I can’t take much credit for this—it wasn’t really investigative journalism. Scholars have long written about Chatto, and I acknowledge their work in my book. It’s not a secret, though perhaps not widely known in India beyond academic circles. There’s also been discussion on social media—long tweet threads, for instance—and that’s probably where I first came across the idea.What I realised, however, is that while his story is known in scholarly circles, we lack accessible popular histories of such figures. In India, when we talk about revolutionaries, most people know Bose or Bhagat Singh, but not others like Chatto, who were largely erased or forgotten.From there, most of my research happened at the British Library in London, where I’m fortunate to have access. I found valuable material on both men—particularly Roy, who wrote prolifically and left behind books and letters that gave me another important source.My own background of moving around a lot drew me to stories of people who lived across borders, and both Chatto and Roy were true cosmopolitans and internationalists. They spoke multiple languages—Chatto knew 14 or 15—and moved in circles with figures like Lenin, Stalin, Sun Yat-sen, Rosa Luxemburg, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gandhi and Nehru. That immediately fascinated me.As for why they were overlooked, there are several reasons. First, Chatto’s execution in Stalin’s Great Purge in 1937 was concealed for decades; his fate only came to light in 1991 when the KGB archives were opened. Even his family thought he had simply died. Second, both men lived abroad and wrote largely in foreign languages, so their work was inaccessible to most Indians. Third, they clashed with Gandhi, Nehru, and even Sarojini Naidu—Chatto once called his sister a puppet of Gandhi and Nehru—so naturally they were pushed to the margins.Ultimately, both were brilliant but uncompromising, and I describe them as “magnificent failures.” They achieved a great deal, but their refusal to play the political game ensured they were sidelined from mainstream Indian history.This book was a huge challenge because of its vast scope—three main countries, but also Mexico, Germany, France, Sweden and others. I don’t think I’ve entirely succeeded in capturing everything, simply because there were too many strands. My aim was not to include every single thing Chatto or Roy said, or every major character they encountered—otherwise the book would become unreadable. I kept it to under 300 pages and focused instead on conveying their human side.For me, this book is about what it is to be human: to try, to fail, to try again, to make mistakes, to have toxic relationships and repeat them, to struggle and still keep going. That was the essence I wanted to bring out in Chatto and Roy.I was especially glad about a review by Vappala Balachandran. As a former officer of the Indian secret service, he had known some of these figures personally, like ACN Nambiar. He wrote that the book captured both the tragic plight of Chatto—trapped and eventually executed by Stalin—and the humanity of these two men. That meant a lot to me, because my goal was not to overload the reader with detail, but to make these complex lives accessible and deeply human.Honestly, I don’t quite know how I managed. I worked with index cards and structured the book so that one chapter focused on Chatto and the next on Roy. That back-and-forth was intentional—I wanted readers to see what each was doing at opposite ends of the world. The chapters aren’t strictly chronological either; I begin each one with an anecdote to hook the reader before moving into the narrative.It was difficult to keep track of so many strands, and in hindsight I think the book could have used aor a timeline. I may add that in the next edition. But by the time you finish a book, you’re so exhausted you just want to hand it over to the publisher.This was also a huge project written on a very tight deadline—about 15 months. I know some factual slips and typos crept in, which I hope to correct in the next edition. It really was a challenging endeavour, and I’m not sure one ever feels fully satisfied.I hope so. I mean, the book is still sort of, you know, having reviews and finding its feet. And one thing I'm noticing is that I think it's mostly men who are reading this book, which I have no objection to, but it's a change from Lady Doctors, which I think mostly women read.A. I’m not sure, but a lot of dads are reading this book. Some call it a dad book and say they’ll give it to their fathers. I intended it for everyone, but many readers tell me their dads would love it. That’s fine—I have no issues with dads or anyone else reading it.I am obsessed with crime fiction. Most of what I read is crime fiction. But this book was influenced mostly by journalism, because I tried to make it very readable and simple. There is a lot of communist philosophy in Roy’s life, but I did not want this to be a book about philosophy.Every chapter starts with an anecdote, and then I go on to the factual things like where they were born or what they did. Anecdotes make popular history readable. My past in journalism influenced that, because in journalism you always need interesting anecdotes and quotes. Roy had many, as did others around him. For example, when he founded the Mexican Communist Party, which is unusual since he was an Indian, an observer wrote there were “six men and a calico cat. ” Quotes like these convey whole relationships.Crime fiction influenced the pacing. With history, you need to keep it fast and snappy, or the reader will stop. So, I avoided long philosophy, endless dates, or proceedings of the Communist International. That’s why I began the book with Chatto’s execution. A review of the book said I borrowed this opening from. I found this criticism odd because I haven’t copied anybody; I was just writing it as it was. I didn’t realise the similarity, since those are novels and mine is history.","Virendranath Chattopadhyay, brother of Sarojini Naidu, was executed during Stalin’s Great Purge in 1937. Chatto also had a dramatic life, pursued by intelligence agencies, becoming a protégé of Lenin, and escaping Soviet Russia just before his execution. Author realised no popular history combined their stories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123548047,imgsize-34016,width-400,resizemode-4/123548047.jpg"

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.

Najee Harris returns from eye injury as Chargers prepare for season opener in Brazil



Najee Harris outlook for 2025 and beyond



The Los Angeles Chargers received a major boost ahead of the 2025 NFL season. Running back Najee Harris, who suffered an eye injury during a Fourth of July fireworks mishap, has been activated from the Non-Football Injury/Illness (NFI) list. After missing training camp and the preseason, Harris practiced for the first time this week, giving the Chargers hope he could suit up when they open their season against the Kansas City Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, on September 5.Najee Harris’ road back has been carefully managed by the Chargers. His agent initially called the injury “superficial,” though the team kept details private. During his recovery, Harris gradually increased his workload—starting with walking laps in early August, moving to light drills with trainers by mid-month, and finally participating in individual practice sessions this week.General manager Joe Hortiz hinted during the preseason finale that Harris was “on track” for Week One, and Coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed that the running back remains a “possibility” to play. If Harris is available, it would extend his streak of never missing an NFL game, an impressive feat for a physical back who has logged over 1,000 rushing yards in each of his first four seasons.While Harris’ absence opened the door for rookie Omarion Hampton to claim first-team reps in camp, the Chargers had always envisioned a backfield timeshare.Offensive coordinator Greg Roman favors a balanced rushing attack, and Harris’ return creates the potential for a dynamic one-two punch. If Harris can take the field in Brazil, Los Angeles would debut a versatile backfield capable of complementing Justin Herbert’s passing game.The Chargers signed Harris not only for his production but for his reliability. He never missed a game during his four years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and consistently brought power running to the backfield. That durability was a missing piece for Los Angeles, whose ground game lagged well below league averages in 2024 despite an 11–6 playoff season.Now, with Hampton adding explosiveness and Harris providing steadiness, the Chargers could finally solve their rushing struggles. The team hasn’t had a 1,000-yard rusher in nearly a decade, but Harris’ track record suggests that could change. Harbaugh’s plan to manage his workload also ensures the veteran won’t be overused as he was in Pittsburgh.If Harris plays in Brazil, it will mark the beginning of a new chapter for both him and the Chargers. The pairing of Harris and Hampton has the potential to elevate the offense from good to elite—something the franchise has been chasing for years.Also Read: Selena Gomez reacts with sweetest message to best friend Taylor Swift’s engagement with Travis Kelce","Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris has been activated from the Non- Football Injury/Illness (NFI) list.

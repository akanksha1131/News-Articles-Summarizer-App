NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah signaled stable leadership ahead of upcoming civic polls, firmly dismissing speculation of a chief minister change and affirming that the party high command has ruled out any shift.Speaking amid preparations for local body elections in Bidar, he emphasised unity by noting multiple capable leaders within Congress while deferring final authority to Delhi.Responding to post-budget rumours of replacing CM Siddaramaiah, Yathindra said, ""They have been saying this, but the high command has clearly sent a message that there won't be any change in the leadership.""He further dismissed such claims, stating, ""I don't think there will be reason to speculate that there will be a change in the leadership.""Elaborating on his stance, he noted that while there are many capable leaders within the party, it does not automatically imply an impending change in leadership.He said, ""There are many leaders in Congress who deserve to, who can become chief minister. But the high command has to decide now. They have not told anything that there will be change in the leadership. So for now, I think the currents they will continue for five years.""Yathindra on Friday reiterated that the party high command had, through an internal communication, made it very clear that there would be no change in leadership. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, he said, ""According to me, the high command might not have said it openly, but have given a clear signal that there will not be any leadership change. So I believe that Siddaramaiah will be the CM for five years.""Reacting to his remarks, Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar , seen as a key contender for the chief minister’s post, responded with sarcasm, ""Yathindra is our high command, and let's accept what he says very respectfully,"" while adding that such speculation can only be addressed by the party high command in Delhi.The internal power tussle in the party came into focus after the Congress government in Karnataka completed half of its tenure, rekindling talk of an alleged power-sharing formula between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy, DK Shivakumar.","Karnataka Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah dismissed speculation of a chief minister change and affirming that the party high command has ruled out any shift.

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

NEW DELHI: All 14 IAS officers from West Bengal appointed by the Election Commission as central observers for the upcoming assembly polls in four states and a Union territory, including state home secretary Jagdish Prasad Meena, attended the observers' briefing organised by Election Commission here on Friday.One lady IAS officer from West Bengal was earlier granted exemption by EC on account of ""some unavoidable family circumstances"", sources in EC told TOI.As many as 1,444 central observers -- including 714 general observers, 233 police observers and 497 expenditure observers -- were briefed in three separate batches, including two on Thursday and one on Friday, regarding various aspects of upcoming polls in Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The third batch, which included IAS officers from West Bengal, was apprised on Friday on the preparation of electoral rolls, conduct of elections, poll expenditure, information technology and media-related matters. They were also given a demonstration of EVMs.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, in his address to the observers, cautioned them that there is no scope of deviation fromthe electoral laws and ECI instructions. He also spoke about new initiatives being taken in the forthcoming assembly elections, while directing them to ensure free, fair and transparent conduct of polls.Election commissioner S S Sandhu told the central observers that they carry a big responsibility as representatives of EC in the field. He called upon the officers to observe the highest level of conduct and ensure a level playing field for all candidates and political parties.Addressing the observers, election commissioner Vivek Joshi asked them to promptly address the grievances and complaints received by them.

IFS/IAS appointees can’t reappear for 2026 Civil Services exam; IPS can’t choose IPS again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ifs/ias-appointees-cant-reappear-for-2026-civil-services-exam-ips-cant-choose-ips-again/articleshow/128019955.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at regulating repeated attempts at Civil Services Examination (CSE) by candidates selected for IAS , Indian Foreign Service (IFS) or IPS, the updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.Even if such an appointment happens after 'prelims' 2026, the candidate will not be allowed to write the 'mains' exam or be considered for service from CSE-2026, as per the CSE 2026 rules notified on Wednesday.A candidate already appointed to IPS from an earlier CSE can apply for and appear in CSE-2026, but cannot relist IPS as his service preference. If a candidate is allocated IPS or any Group ‘A’ central service through CSE-2026, they will be allowed one improvement attempt in CSE-2027 by using a one-time training exemption. If a candidate selected through CSE-2026 neither joins training nor avails of exemption, his 2026 service allocation shall stand cancelled.Where a candidate selected through CSE-2026 reappears in CSE 2027 and obtains a better service, he must choose between 2026 and 2027 batch. If the candidate does not get any service in 2027 exam, he will be allowed to go back and join the service allocated based on CSE 2026. If the candidate does not join training of the finally chosen service (2026 or 2027), both the allocations shall get cancelled.After availing one improvement attempt (CSE-2027), the candidate cannot appear in CSE-2028 onwards unless he/she resigns from service. Candidates already in service from CSE-2025 or earlier, will have one chance to reappear in CSE 2026 or CSE 2027 without resigning. If they wish to appear for CSE 2028 and beyond, they must first resign from the allocated service. UPSC in its CSE 2026 notification has also done away with the cap on examination centre capacity for 'persons with benchmark disabilities' (PwBD) candidates , allowing them to be accommodated on priority. Initially, the existing capacity of each centre will be utilised by both PwBD and non-PwBD candidates. However, once a centre reaches full capacity, it will no longer be available for selection by non-PwBD candidates, while PwBD candidates will continue to have the option to select the same centre.CSE 2026 will also have more examination centres -- Meerut to decongest Delhi-NCR, Kanpur to ease pressure around Lucknow, and Bhubaneswar to supplement centres near Cuttack. It further allows candidates to indicate their preferred nearby cities from a dropdown menu, in addition to the notified examination centres. This data will serve as a survey of candidate preferences and may be used to identify locations for the creation of new examination centres, where feasible.","The updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.

JAMMU: Border-related challenges had changed significantly over the past 60 years, and therefore advanced technological solutions must be adopted to effectively address them, Union home minister Amit Shah said Friday as he visited the Gurnam and Bobiyan outposts located along the India-Pakistan International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir Later in the evening, Shah chaired a high-level security review meeting in Jammu at Lok Bhavan, which was attended by LG Manoj Sinha, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Union home secretary, IB director, J&K chief secretary and DGP, heads of CAPFs and other senior officers.At the meeting, while the home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies in dismantling the terror ecosystem, he directed them to remain alert and continue work in a coordinated mode to ensure that the gains made in recent times are sustained and the goal of a ‘terror free J&K’ is achieved at the earliest. He assured that all the resources would be made available by the govt to achieve this.Shah said the terror eco-system nurtured by elements inimical to the country in J&K had been almost crippled due to the concerted efforts of the Narendra Modi govt. Efforts for de-radicalisation had seen major success, he said, and instructed for taking more initiatives for youth engagement. Innovative measures to further reinforce the watertight security cordon were also discussed in the meeting.This was the second security review meeting chaired by the Union home minister within a month. On Jan 8, he had chaired a high-level review meeting in Delhi on J&K’s security situation.Earlier in the day, the home minister, addressing BSF personnel at the border posts in the sensitive Hiranagar sector, said while courage, alertness and dedication of personnel remained crucial, many emerging challenges were now technology-driven. “The govt will invest substantial funds to modernise the entire border security system based on technology. This modernisation will provide improved border infrastructure and advanced equipment for BSF personnel, enabling them to perform their duties more effectively,” he said.Lauding the border guarding troops, Shah said whenever the country’s borders had faced threats of intrusion or infiltration, BSF had stood like an impregnable wall, resolute in its commitment to safeguarding the nation. “The bravery and valour displayed by BSF during Operation Sindoor have added a golden chapter to its six-decade-long history,” he added.The home minister commended the sacrifices of BSF sub-inspector Mohammed Imteyaz and constable Deepak Chingakham in Pakistani firing during Operation Sindoor.Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the Govt of India was fully committed to the welfare of security personnel, the minister said, and announced that a special welfare scheme for BSF personnel will be introduced soon. He also appreciated the significant contribution of BSF women personnel towards border security. He later had lunch with the soldiers.","Amit Shah visited the Gurnam and Bobiyan outposts located along the India- Pakistan International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir.

HAL Clarifies AMCA Status, Says It Will Bid For India's Fifth-Generation Fighter Jet In 2035 Phase

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","HAL has received five engines from GE as on date.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

The impasse over the India-Pakistan T20 WC match showed no signs of being resolved, after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif weighed in on the issue, calling their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision”. It was a “considered stance” to support Bangladesh, he said.“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won’t play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field. We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh,” the PM said.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Nazrul acknowledged Sharif’s decision. “Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote in a social media post.As the start of this contentious World Cup nears, speaking at a pre-tournament captain’s press conferences from two different locations – Mumbai’s BCCI headquarters and from Colombo — both teams’ captains broke their silence on the issue.“We haven’t refused to play against Pakistan. They have refused. The mindset is pretty clear. We have not said no, it has come from them,” India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said.“The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue. Our flight is booked for Colombo and we are going,” he added.Salman Ali Agha, his Pakistani opposite number, said, “The India game is not in our control. It’s the govt’s and PCB’s decision and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we will do that.”“If we have to play them again in the semifinal or final, we will have to go back to them (govt) and act on their advice,” added the Pakistan skipper. The Indian captain acknowledged that the situation is “not easy” for those involved in the issue, including the ICC.“I feel it is not an easy job. It is not my call. I am sure they (the ICC) might be working out something as well but it has come from the other govt or the nation, how can they (the ICC) help as well? Their (Pakistan’s) decision is not in my control. I wish I could take their decisions, but then it is their call,” said Suryakumar.“We have been told that we have to play a game in Colombo on Feb 15th. We played them three times in the Asia Cup, we played some good cricket. We won (all the matches) and we were very happy. Similarly, if we get an opportunity in Colombo, we will definitely play,” he added.Earlier, Inter national Cricket Council (ICC) had expressed serious concerns over the Pakistan govt’s decision.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” it had said. “This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif calls their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision’ India captain Suryakumar Yadav: “The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127969189,imgsize-493153,width-400,resizemode-4/india-vs-pakistan.jpg"

The arrest came after high drama at his Patna residence, where police arrived to take him into custody.Speaking to reporters, Yadav said he was unwell and expressed fears over his safety. “I am not well... I don't know what will happen with me,” he said.Ahead of the arrest, Yadav told ANI that he feared the police might harm him and insisted that he wanted to be taken directly to court instead of a police station. He said the court had summoned him the next day and suggested that house arrest could have been considered. He also questioned the police for arriving in civil clothes, saying he initially thought they had come to kill him. Referring to the case, he noted that it was registered nearly 35 years ago and questioned the need for his arrest at this stage.“I have doubt that these people might have killed me. I will go straight to the Court. I will not go to the police station. If they want, they can house arrest me. The Court has called me. Police reached here in civil uniform like criminals.

'Can't be compelled': SC allows termination of minor's 30-wk fetus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minor-has-right-over-reproductive-choice-supreme-court/articleshow/128008025.cms,"Minor has right over reproductive choice: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: It was difficult for Supreme Court to decide - protect the interests of a 30-week pregnant minor girl who did not want an illegitimate child and seek termination of pregnancy or save the unborn child who, as a 30-week fetus, has a beating heart. But the scale of justice tilted in favour of the girl and SC allowed termination of pregnancy, saying she can't be compelled to give birth to a child.Finding itself in the tricky situation as it was asked to prioritise the competing interests, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan admitted it was not easy for it to decide the case. The court finally allowed the plea of the pregnant girl's mother.NEW DELHI: A minor's mother sought Supreme Court's permission for termination of her daughter's pregnancy, taking into consideration that the child would be illegitimate and the girl had to live her life with mental trauma and social stigma. The court said the girl has a right over her reproductive autonomy.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 allows abortion up to 20 weeks based on the opinion of one registered medical practitioner, and up to 24 weeks for specific categories of women (including rape survivors and minors) with the opinion of two doctors.Contending that she did not want to give birth to the child, the petitioner sought abortion on the grounds that continuing with pregnancy and giving birth would cause her trauma.Maharashtra govt however, told the court that the fetus at 30 weeks had a beating heart and termination at this stage would result in premature birth of a child who would face the risk of abnormality. The lawyer for the state, Devanshi Singh, contended that the baby could be handed over to an orphanage.The bench asked the state whose interests it was trying to protect. The lawyer responded that it was for the court to take a call. She also brought to the notice of the bench an earlier order passed by SC in 2017, when termination of more than 30 weeks pregnancy was allowed as the girl was only 13 and a rape survivor.Considering the totality of the situation, the court passed the order in favour of the girl but said that termination of pregnancy should not result in feticide. ""It is an illegitimate child. We don't want to comment on the relationship. They cannot get married and she has to carry the stigma for the rest of her life. We have to consider her mental aspect. Can the court ask her to continue with the pregnancy and deliver the child? If we do, then people would not come to court to seek permission and they would go to quack and illegal centres for abortion and life and health would be put at risk,"" the bench said.""Whose interest would prevail is the question. It is very difficult to decide,"" the SC bench said.With any delay likely to complicate the situation further, the bench directed termination of pregnancy. ""We direct the JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai, to conduct the procedure of medical termination of pregnancy of the daughter of the appellant herein by bearing in mind all medical safeguards,"" the bench said.The mother had moved SC, through lawyer Shantanu Adkar, after her plea was rejected by Bombay HC, which had held that a forced termination would amount to feticide as the ""fetus is healthy and viable"". It had directed that the teen be provided comprehensive medical and psychological support until her delivery and the child be given away to a registered orphanage.According to the petition, the pregnancy was the result of the girl's relationship with a friend. The mother alleged that the friend had forced the girl into a physical relationship after promising to marry her and FIR had been filed against him.",The court said the girl has a right over her reproductive autonomy. Maharashtra govt told the court that the fetus at 30 weeks had a beating heart. The court passed the order in favour of the girl but said that termination of pregnancy should not result in feticide.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128008111,imgsize-182462,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor-headed Jan Suraaj Party on Friday was criticised by the Supreme Court for filing a writ petition seeking annulment of recently concluded Bihar assembly elections on the ground that the poll-eve Rs 10,000 dole to women was a corrupt practice that altered the level-playing field.""How many votes did your party get? People rejected you in the elections. Now you want to use the judicial platform to garner popularity,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi. JSP contested 238 seats and failed to win a single seat mustering a poor 3.4% of the votes. The party got less votes than NOTA in 68 constituencies.JSP's counsel C U Singh said that the distribution of Rs 10,000 under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojna, amounting to a total of Rs 15,600 crore, during the period when the model code of conduct for election was in force amounted to corrupt practice. Terming the doles as freebies, Singh said Bihar is one of the top five fiscal deficit states, and spending such a huge amount from exchequer without economic planning would further impact its financial health.The SC bench said, ""There is a difference between legal and constitutional questions and fiscal policy. If a governing political party is causing harm to the state through its economic policy, then it is for the people to vote it out.We cannot entertain such petitions. It is an omnibus election petition seeking to annul the entire election.""""You file an election petition for each constituency and prove that because of the corrupt practice the candidate has won. Otherwise, if a candidate has won by a margin of 10,000 votes and there were only 1,000 women who got the dole, why should his election be set aside,"" the bench asked.When the counsel continued to persuade the court to examine the legality and constitutionality of election-eve freebies, the bench said it would seriously examine the issue in the pending petitions but not at the instance of a political party which lost the election badly. ""All political parties indulge in the same freebies game once they come to power,"" the bench said.""Why did you not challenge it when the announcement was made about giving Rs 10,000 to each woman in Bihar by the govt,"" the SC bench said.It told the party to move Patna high court. ""You withdraw the petition and file a petition in the HC. We will have the benefit of HC's view,"" the bench said. JSR withdrew its petition.","JSP's counsel C U Singh said that the distribution of Rs 10,000 under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojna amounted to corrupt practice.

What’s at stake when it comes to your plate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-at-stake-when-it-comes-to-your-plate/articleshow/127979060.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. ‘Would you like fries with that?’ The girl behind the counter asked the American standing before me at the McDonald’s outlet. He hesitated. A long hesitation for what should have been the simplest of decisions. Big Mac. Drink. Fries. Yes or no. I grew impatient. Why was his choice so difficult? Only later did it strike me that the difficulty did not lie in the fries. It lay in the burger itself. Vegetarian. Vegan . Flexitarian. A single patty had splintered into moral choices. In that moment, under fluorescent lights and digital menus, I realised that food , once a matter of hunger , had quietly become a matter of conscience. The World Economic Forum recently published data on changing global food habits. Vegetarianism, once considered marginal in the West, is steadily rising across Europe and the United States. Curiously, it is declining in large emerging economies such as India, where traditional diets are slowly yielding to speed, packaging and convenience. Among Gen Z in Europe, vegetarianism is being embraced with fresh intensity: protecting animals, reducing environmental strain. The logic is simple. Growing plants asks less of the earth than raising animals. Vegetables require less land, water and energy. Fewer forests are cleared, fewer resources extracted, fewer gases released. That is why a vegetarian diet produces nearly two and a half times less carbon emissions than a meat-based one. Eating vegetarian for a year can save emissions equal to removing a small family car from the road for six months. Yet the case for meat-eating carries its own dignity. Across history, meat has been nourishment in difficult climates, insurance against crop failure, and a compact source of strength where options were limited. For many communities even today, meat is not indulgence but woven into livelihoods and traditions. In this light, meat-eating is not moral neglect, but practical inheritance. But long before climate charts and sustainability panels, the Tamil land approached food through a softer instinct—not calculation, but empathy. Across the world today, vegetarianism is no longer eccentric. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs adopt plant-based diets for health and longevity. European govts encourage reduced meat consumption. What appears newly awakened is, in truth, deeply old. This is where Thiruvalluvar excels as a poet of compassion. Avisorinthu āayiram vēṭṭalin oṉdṟaṉ Uyirsegutthu uṇṇāamai naṉdṟu Better than a thousand burnt offerings Is One life un-killed, un-eaten . A thousand ritual fires may blaze, but they do not equal the quiet mercy of restraint. Tamil Sangam literature echoes this gentleness. Puranānūru speaks of ascetics as kollā nōṉbiṉar, those who have vowed not to kill. Akanānūru describes hospitality through rice, milk, curd, fruits, honey, and vegetables. Meat appears openly in most places; its absence elsewhere is deliberate. Vegetarian food is not portrayed as denial, but as choice shaped by feeling. Power too once learned restraint. Emperor Ashoka’s edicts from the third century BCE recorded reduced slaughter, protected animals, and banned killing on certain days. After Kalinga, remorse hardened into mercy, carved into stone. Valluvar reminds us that progress is not only about what we invent but about what we choose not to harm. It was the same voice that echoed in saint poet Vallalar’s verse: ‘I shed tears seeing plants that wither without water’. And somewhere between a burger choice and a spared life, the question remains quietly unanswered.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah presented on Friday the National Conference (NC) govt’s second budget, peppered with references to challenges arising out of last year’s Pahalgam attack, Operation Sindoor and devastating floods.Presenting the Rs 1.27-lakh crore budget for 2026-27 as he also handles finance, Omar proposed two dedicated emergency hospitals and bullet-proof ambulances in frontier areas prone to shelling, cross-border attacks and natural disasters. One hospital will come up in Uri and the other in Poonch. Both had borne the brunt of Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.“...In J&K, just as our economy was consolidating with renewed vigour, the barbaric terrorist attack at Pahalgam and its aftermath shocked us. The devastating floods in Aug-Sept severely battered Jammu region. All sectors, including tourism, handicrafts and agriculture, are badly affected. There is a substantial loss of jobs and business, leading to financial stress on families,” Omar said.The CM announced full fee waivers for students of economically weaker families from Class 9 to college, free LPG cylinders for families under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), monthly sponsorships for orphans, scholarships for tribal students, and free govt transport for those with disabilities.Plans were also unveiled to increase seats in medical colleges, while Rs 180 crore was allocated for modernisation of Amarnath Yatra infrastructure.Omar’s rivals were not impressed. “Central funds have effectively been diverted towards party (NC) legislators. There is nothing for common people,” said leader of opposition Sunil Sharma of BJP. PDP MLA Waheed Parra dismissed the budget as “mere repackaging of centrally sponsored schemes”.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over his controversial remarks on ""troubling Miya Muslims"", calling them unconstitutional and divisive.Owaisi mocked the chief minister, saying, ""I want to give you Rs 2 as alms,"" and accused him of reducing constitutional governance to prejudice and intimidation. In a lengthy response, Owaisi said India's Constitution guarantees equality and non-discrimination, regardless of religion or community. ""The Constitution says all are equal. No discrimination should be done, whether it is a chief minister or anyone else,"" he said.Owaisi alleged that Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam were being scapegoated for issues ranging from migration to rising prices. ""If vegetable prices increase in Assam, Miya Muslims are blamed. If someone wants to vote, they are told to go to Bangladesh,"" he said, adding that such rhetoric amounted to targeting a community for political gain.The AIMIM leader's remarks came after Sarma made statements encouraging action against ""Miya Muslims"" in Assam.Sarma said, ""Trouble the Miya Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam ... We are directly against the Miya Muslims. We are not hiding anything.""The comments triggered a political storm in the election-bound northeastern state, with opposition parties accusing the BJP of resorting to communal polarisation to consolidate votes.The BJP, however, has long maintained that its focus in Assam is on addressing illegal immigration and protecting indigenous rights. Bengali-speaking Muslims have frequently been labelled “illegal infiltrators” in political discourse, an issue that has remained central to Assam’s electoral politics.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi launched a sharp attack on Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over his controversial remarks on ""troubling Miya Muslims"" Sarma said, ""Trouble theMiya Muslims by any means.

A tourism map still in motion



For years, planning a holiday in India meant choosing between two familiar choices: beach or hills. Goa or Manali. Sand or snow.Not anymore.Today, the most searched destinations on travel apps are just as likely to be Ayodhya as Alibaug, Varanasi as Vagator, Ujjain as Udaipur. A generation that grew up posting sunsets from shacks and selfies from mountain cafés is now booking flights to temple towns, river ghats and heritage streets.India’s tourism map is changing — quietly, steadily, and faster than many imagined.Across India, places once considered peripheral to mainstream tourism – religious towns, heritage cities, riverfront settlements and small cultural hubs – are emerging as year-round travel destinations.Ayodhya, Varanasi, Ujjain, Prayagraj, Dwarka, Puri, Hampi, Madurai and Maheshwar are no longer niche or purpose-driven stops. They are becoming central nodes in India’s tourism geography, drawing millions of travellers who are not just pilgrims, but explorers, photographers, students, influencers, backpackers and international visitors.What’s driving this change is not one factor, but a convergence: religious revival, infrastructure investment, social media discovery, generational travel habits, and a redefinition of what “travel” means in India today.The most decisive force reshaping India’s tourism map is the scale and transformation of religious travel.India has always been a land of pilgrimage, but for much of the post-liberalisation era, religious tourism remained largely disconnected from mainstream travel narratives. Pilgrims travelled with families, stayed briefly, and rarely engaged with destinations beyond ritual.That distinction has collapsed.Data from the Union ministry of tourism and state governments shows that religious tourism now accounts for more than half of all domestic tourist visits in India. In several states, pilgrimage-led travel has overtaken leisure tourism as the primary driver of footfall.Uttar Pradesh illustrates this transformation most starkly. The state reported over 130 crore domestic tourist visits in a single year – 2025, making it India’s most visited state. The surge has been driven overwhelmingly by pilgrimage and heritage circuits connecting Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Mathura–Vrindavan.Ayodhya, once a relatively modest religious town, has undergone a dramatic transformation since the inauguration of the Ram Temple. Annual visitor numbers now run into millions, outpacing several long-established heritage destinations.The city’s airport, railway station, road network and public spaces have been redeveloped to accommodate a scale of travel previously unimaginable for a town of its size.Last year’s Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, a once in 144 year affair, alone drew footfalls on a scale rarely seen anywhere in the world, making it the largest religious congregation, so much so that it was even visible from space.Varanasi, long considered a place one visited once in a lifetime, has emerged as one of India’s fastest-growing cultural destinations. State government figures show tourist visits crossing 10 crore annually in 2024, with foreign arrivals rising sharply over the past three years. What was once seen primarily as a site of ritual and renunciation is now firmly embedded in India’s travel economy.Tamil Nadu tells a similar story. Temple circuits linking Madurai, Rameswaram, Kanchipuram and Tiruvannamalai account for a majority of domestic travel into the state, drawing millions annually.Maharashtra’s Shirdi–Pandharpur belt, Odisha’s Puri, Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain and Maheshwar, and Gujarat’s Dwarka and Somnath now function as high-volume, year-round tourism economies. Karnataka’s Udupi and Hampi, and West Bengal’s Kalighat and Dakshineswar reflect similar patterns.“Faith has become infrastructure-led,” said a senior employee of a travel agency in Delhi, working at a tech savvy firm which thrives on social media added, “Once access improved, demand exploded.” He says, the jump in visit plans to cities like Varanasi, Chopta, Kedharnath has increased manyfold, and when the char dham yatra opens, demand shoots up.Interestingly the crowd mostly has youths, reflecting a shift from assumed travel preferences.If religious tourism is the backbone of the new travel map, religious events are its accelerators.India’s religious calendar is dense with gatherings that combine faith, spectacle, culture and community – often on a scale unmatched anywhere else in the world. These events are no longer seen only as spiritual congregations; they have become major tourism drivers with global visibility and measurable economic impact.The Maha Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj, held once every 12 years at the Sangam of the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati, remains the best example. The most recent edition drew hundreds of millions of visits over several weeks, making it the largest human gathering on the planet – so vast that it was visible in satellite imagery. Beyond the ritual bathing, the Kumbh now attracts cultural tourists, photographers, researchers, vloggers and international visitors seeking to witness a phenomenon unmatched in scale.By the end of the event over 660 million people took a dip in Triveni Sangam. The festival generated approximately 1.2 million jobs in sectors like tourism, transportation, healthcare, and retail, significantly boosting the both state and national economies.The organisation of the event saw major revamp for the city, from over 200 roads renovated and 3 lakh plus trees planted.Post event data released by the state shows, trade in daily essentials reached Rs 17,310 crore, while the hotel and travel sectors were at Rs2,800 crore. Religious materials and flowers generated approximately Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 800 crore, respectively.Alongside the Maha Kumbh, the Magh Mela, held annually at Prayagraj, has emerged as a major draw in its own right. While smaller than the Kumbh, it attracts crores of devotees over its duration, sustaining tourism flows every year rather than once a decade.Temporary cities rise on the riverbanks, supported by transport networks, sanitation infrastructure and cultural programming – an example of how religious events are now treated as logistical and tourism exercises at scale.“These events create massive short-term employment and long-term tourism memory,” said an official involved in last year's Mela administration. “People return later with families, friends, even tour groups.” He added, “during mela people come to stay for weeks at times the entire month of snan.”In eastern India, the Puri Rath Yatra draws millions of devotees annually, turning the coastal town into a global focal point for weeks. Odisha government estimates show hotel occupancy peaking across the state during the festival period, while transport networks operate at full capacity.Artisans, street vendors and small businesses see a surge in income, while the event also introduces many first-time visitors to Odisha’s beaches, crafts and heritage circuits.In Varanasi, Dev Deepawali has evolved from a local religious observance into a marquee tourism event. Lakhs of lamps illuminate the ghats of the Ganga on Kartik Purnima, drawing domestic and foreign travellers months in advance.If you think you can walk past the roads of the old holy city easily during and around the month of Diwali, think again. Every corner of the city is filled with people, tourists and visitors. Ghats bustle through the night and probably the night life is never better there.Durga Puja in Kolkata, now recognised by UNESCO, blends religion, art, music and urban culture, drawing tourists not just from India but from Bangladesh, Europe and Southeast Asia.Similarly, Deepotsav in Ayodhya, Holi in Mathura–Vrindavan and Barsana, Navratri in Gujarat, and Thrissur Pooram in Kerala,function as major tourism magnets. These festivals blend religion, culture, music, food and visual spectacle, extending stays and broadening visitor profiles beyond traditional pilgrims.“The festivals are no longer spikes; they are anchors,” said Naveen Singh, a resident of Varanasi who runs a hotel. “They fill rooms, generate repeat visits and stabilize demand.”What is notable is that these events are no longer treated as isolated spikes. State tourism boards actively integrate them into annual calendars, align transport and accommodation planning, and promote them digitally as experiential travel moments.The transformation of religious destinations is not only about numbers.What’s changed is not just where people are travelling, but how they are travelling. Increasingly it is about how these places are experienced, the mark that the visit leaves on the people's mind.Cities like Varanasi, Ujjain and Dwarka are no longer framed merely as sites of ritual obligation. They are increasingly experienced as layered cultural spaces. They are being reimagined – by travellers as much as by planners – as experience-led destinations.Morning boat rides on the Ganga, evening Ganga aartis framed by restored ghats, heritage walks through ancient neighbourhoods, classical music performances, local food trails, classical music performances, and café culture tucked into centuries-old lanes – all now form part of the itinerary.The sacred and the everyday coexist – and travellers engage with both.This shift has been enabled by sustained infrastructure investment: expanded airports, redeveloped railway stations, improved roads, pedestrian corridors, lighting projects and riverfront development.Government schemes such as PRASHAD and Swadesh Darshan have focused on improving tourist facilities around religious and heritage sites, while state tourism departments have leaned into festival-led tourism to keep destinations active year-round.What emerges is a new category of travel – one that blends faith, culture, leisure and storytelling.Leading travel companies of the country are also playing a crucial role in facilitating these travel experiences. Providing millions of devotees and visitors seamless travel solutions, including flight bookings, customized pilgrimage packages, and guided experiences, ensuring a smooth spiritual journey for attendees.While speaking at an event, Rikant Pittie, CEO and Co-Founder, EaseMyTrip said:“Spiritual tourism in India is witnessing significant growth as more travellers seek meaningful experiences at sacred destinations. In 2024, India’s religious tourism market was valued at US$ 202.8 billion, and is expected to grow to US$ 441.2 billion by 2032. Pilgrimage sites like Varanasi, Rishikesh, Tirupati, and Shirdi are attracting millions of devotees annually, contributing to both cultural preservation and economic growth. With improved infrastructure and digital advancements, accessibility to these sites has become easier, further fueling interest in spiritual travel.”India’s foreign tourist arrivals are yet to fully recover to pre-Covid levels, and international media has pointed to concerns ranging from cost to pollution and infrastructure stress. But the recovery, where it is happening, is highly destination-specific.Foreign travellers are increasingly gravitating toward cultural depth rather than checklist sightseeing. Hampi and parts of Rajasthan (deserts and old cities) and Madhya Pradesh, the likes of Khajuraho, and select Himalayan towns have seen renewed interest from overseas visitors looking for immersive experiences – slow travel, spiritual exploration, history, architecture, and everyday life.For many international travellers, India’s emerging destinations offer something that over-touristed global cities no longer do: authenticity without over-curation.For instance, global pop icon Dua Lipa’s travel pattern to India offers a telling anecdote. She first visited the country in 2018 for a vacation with her then boyfriend Issac Carew, explored several iconic locations, including Ranthambore, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kerala, and Goa.She returned again in 2023 on her fourth visit to the country, in late December to spend New Year with her family, this time in a very low profile exploring streets and small towns of Rajasthan. The trip was so out of the media gaze that people only found out about it once Dua herself posted pictures on her social media. Interestingly, during her interaction and exploration with people on streets she received warm welcome and hospitality, but notably no one recognised her to the star she is.Perhaps the most consequential shift reshaping India’s tourism geography is generational.India’s Gen Z and young millennial travellers are not chasing the same markers of travel that defined earlier decades. Monuments still matter, but they are no longer the sole focus. For this cohort, travel is experiential, social and performative.For many, travel is not an escape from daily life, but an extension of identity – curated, shared and remembered through content.Suchna Yadav, a content creator/ influencer working with a travel agency in Delhi says, ""I used to think maybe i'm little old school in my choices or something, that i like visiting the places like Vridnavan, or Chopta temple and other places, but working here made me realise that actually it's not just me. The number of young people I see opting to visit places like Kedarnath, temple circuit in UP, Vaisno Devi and that to in groups (like a group of young guys, or friends, and then families are always there) is just like okay everyone is searching peace. ""Travel platforms report a sharp rise in bookings to spiritual and heritage destinations among travellers under 35, often combining pilgrimage with leisure, photography and food exploration.Well many today discover and decide their travel plans according to the social media, but there are also people who have it the old classic way – movies.Aastha Jha, a young journalist working in Delhi has been to Varanasi twice. She started off her travel journey from the city and her most recent visit has been there as well. The reason? ‘Masaan’ (movie).“Watching Masaan, I was so fascinated by the ‘Ye dukh kahe khatam nahi hota be’ scene, that I made up my mind...if I travel, I will definitely go to Benaras,” she said.Social media has fundamentally altered how destinations are discovered.Instagram reels, YouTube vlogs and travel influencers have turned once-understated towns into aspirational stops. A single viral sunset video from Dwarka or a café walkthrough in Varanasi can reach millions.This has changed the rhythm of tourism:In this new ecosystem, travel is not always about escape. It is about visibility, storytelling and identity.Beyond the headline destinations, India’s tourism boom is quietly lifting lesser-known places into the spotlight.These destinations benefit from a trickle-down effect – travellers extending trips, seeking quieter experiences, or deliberately avoiding crowds.Alongside religious festivals, concerts and large-scale cultural events have emerged as powerful drivers of domestic travel.These events often trigger short, high-intensity travel bursts, filling hotels, boosting transport demand and introducing new audiences to destinations.The effect is cumulative: travellers arrive for an event, discover a place, and return later for leisure or exploration.Over the past couple of years multiple national and international celebrities have held concerts across the country, and their impact has been phenomenal.Now a global superstar Diljit Dosanjh ‘Dil-Luminati’ tour was a sold out game, spanning through multiple cities and the story was the same everywhere, immense demand and sold-out, high-energy shows. So has been the results of Lollapalooza India, Sunidhi Chauhan’s ‘I am Home India tour’ and Shreya Ghosal’s ‘All Hearts Tour’ all of which have been monumental successes.The massive crowd in every show has not been only the locals but people travel cities, states to attend these concerts and events.Similarly, international acts like The Coldplay concerts, Ed Sheeran’s India tour, Maroon 5, Cigarettes After Sex, Akon and many others triggered massive short-term travel spikes. Hotels sold out, flight fares surged, and cities that rarely featured on tourism maps saw first-time visitors.Last year when Coldplay performed in Ahmedabad, the record-breaking shows, featuring 1.34 lakh attendees, created a massive Rs 641 crore economic impact.One of the attendees was Kikruheno Casavi, then a student in Delhi now a working professional in Kohima. She along with her friends who flew all the way from Kohima visited the Ahmedabad, paid much more for the flights to hands down everything from hotels to local travel and food, when compared to regular time, given the high demand, at the end she ended of spending close to lakh on the concert, that was a good influx into the economy. So has been the impact of these massive events on the domestic travel and economy.One of the most profound changes in Indian tourism is how destinations are discovered.For decades, tourism marketing centred on a narrow set of icons – beaches, palaces, monuments. Today, social media has emerged as a powerful equaliser. A single Instagram reel of a sunset in Dwarka or a café walk-through in Varanasi can reach millions, bypassing traditional campaigns entirely.Unlike curated brochures or seasonal campaigns, digital storytelling is organic, constant and often driven by travellers themselves. A single reel, vlog or photo series can introduce millions to places that once barely featured on travel maps. As a result, destinations are no longer marketed only as pilgrimage stops or heritage sites, but as spaces for culture, leisure, food and everyday exploration.Travel platforms, too, have adapted. Pilgrimage packages now integrate leisure, experiences and flexible itineraries. Boutique stays, heritage homestays and experiential tours have become anchors of tourism ecosystems.The change in narrative – from “must-see” landmarks to “must-feel” moments – has made India’s emerging destinations more accessible, relatable and aspirational, particularly for younger travellers.In many ways, the tourism boom reflects not a discovery of new places, but a reframing of familiar ones – amplified by platforms where authenticity, not advertising, now drives attention.The tourism shift has tangible economic consequences. Hospitality players report higher occupancy rates across the year, not just during peak seasons. Local economies – transport operators, guides, artisans, food vendors – benefit from sustained demand rather than seasonal spikes.At the same time, challenges are mounting. Overcrowding, waste management, environmental stress and infrastructure capacity pose real risks. Experts warn that without heritage-sensitive planning and sustainability measures, the very qualities drawing travellers could be compromised.What’s clear is that India’s tourism map is no longer static – or metro-centric.It is being reshaped by faith and culture, by digital discovery, by younger travellers redefining value, and by destinations once overlooked now stepping into the national and global imagination.The shift underway is not about discovering new places, but about seeing familiar ones differently. And in that reframing, India’s tourism future is quietly being rewritten.And in that shift, the most interesting stories may lie far beyond Mumbai and Goa.","India’s tourism map is changing — quietly, steadily, and faster than many imagined. Places once considered peripheral to mainstream tourism are emerging as year-round travel destinations. The most searched destinations on travel apps are just as likely to be Ayodhya as Alibaug, Varanasi as Vagator.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127992027,imgsize-149154,width-400,resizemode-4/changing-tourism-map-of-india.jpg"

Shivakumar's sarcastic response

What's the controversy

NEW DELHI: Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah on Friday said he believed there would be no change in Karnataka’s leadership and that his father Siddaramaiah was likely to remain chief minister for the full five-year term.Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Yathindra said the party high command had given a clear signal, even if not publicly, that there will be no leadership change. He said the issue was settled and that no one in the party had said Siddaramaiah should be removed.“According to me, the high command might not have said it openly, but have given a clear signal that there will not be any leadership change. So I believe that Siddaramaiah will be the CM for five years,” he said.Yathindra also said that apart from media discussions, the leadership change issue was not being discussed in political circles. He added that the government should focus on other matters, including the upcoming budget and the state’s financial situation.Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar , who is also seen as a contender for the chief minister’s post, responded sarcastically to Yathindra’s remarks.“Yathindra is our high command, and let's accept what he says very respectfully,” Shivakumar told reporters in Mangaluru.He added that if anyone had to clarify the issue, it would be the party’s central leadership in Delhi.The leadership issue had gained attention after the Congress government completed half of its five-year term in November 2025. There has been speculation about a possible power-sharing arrangement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar when the government was formed in 2023.Shivakumar has previously said discussions on the issue were held with the Congress high command and that while a decision had been taken, its timing is yet to be finalised.Last month, DK Shivakumar’s brother had said Rahul Gandhi had assured the deputy chief minister that a decision would be taken at an appropriate time.",Yathindra Siddaramaiah says there will be no leadership change in Karnataka.

In a major institutional reform aimed at transforming urban mobility in the national capital, the Delhi government under the leadership of Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has initiated the process of drafting a comprehensive Bill for the creation of the Delhi Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (DUMTA) along with a dedicated Delhi Urban Transport Fund (DUTF).""The proposed legislation seeks to rationalise, integrate and coordinate Delhi's presently fragmented transport ecosystem under a single, coherent planning and governance framework. The move marks a significant milestone in the government's vision to create a modern, efficient, people-centric and environmentally sustainable transport system for the Capital,"" a statement read.To ensure expeditious and inclusive drafting of the proposed law, the statement said that the Chief Minister has constituted a high-level task force under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary. ""The task force has been mandated to prepare and submit the draft Bill at the earliest, reflecting the government's sense of urgency and commitment to reform. This decision responds to long-standing demands from urban planners, transport experts and civic stakeholders for a unified transport authority capable of synchronising planning, investment and operations across agencies. ""Recognising that Delhi's rapid urbanisation, rising population and mounting vehicular pressure demands systemic solutions rather than piecemeal interventions, the Chief Minister has taken a proactive step by setting the legislative process in motion.The task force brings together senior officials from key departments including transport, urban development, finance, planning, public works and Delhi Police. It also includes representatives from major civic and transport authorities such as the Delhi Development Authority, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Delhi Transport Corporation, the National Capital Region Transport Corporation and Indian Railways. CM has suggested that renowned experts in urban transportation may also be co-opted to ensure that global best practices and local realities are seamlessly integrated into the proposed framework.Explaining the rationale behind the initiative, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta noted that Delhi's transport agencies have historically functioned in silos, with limited coordination in route planning, infrastructure development and service delivery.""DUMTA will bring cohesion to Delhi's entire urban mobility system. By placing all modes of transport like metro, buses, regional rail, railways and feeder services, within a single planning jurisdiction, we will ensure that mobility solutions are integrated, efficient and citizen-focused,"" the CM said.The Chief Minister emphasised that DUMTA will play a critical role in decongesting Delhi's roads by strengthening public transport, improving last-mile connectivity and encouraging a shift away from private vehicles. This, she said, is integral to the government's long-term strategy to combat air pollution, one of the Capital's most pressing challenges. Vehicular emissions remain a major local source of pollution, and expanding a reliable, well-connected public transport network is central to achieving sustainable environmental outcomes.""Our government is working on short, medium and long-term solutions to address...""","The proposed legislation seeks to rationalise, integrate and coordinate Delhi's presently fragmented transport ecosystem under a single, coherent planning and governance framework. The move marks a significant milestone in the government's vision to create a modern, efficient, people-centric and environmentally sustainable transport system for the Capital.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127985911,imgsize-99800,width-400,resizemode-4/whatsapp-image-2026-02-06-at-15857-pm.jpg"

‘Cannot force her to continue pregnancy’: SC allows abortion of 30-week pregnant minor — why this ruling matters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-force-her-to-continue-pregnancy-sc-allows-abortion-of-30-week-pregnant-minor-why-this-ruling-matters/articleshow/127984216.cms,".

Why the ruling matters

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the medical termination of a 30-week pregnancy of a 17-year-old girl, observing that courts could not force a woman, especially a minor, to continue a pregnancy if she does not want to.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said the key issue was the minor’s right to decide whether she wanted to continue the pregnancy. They observed that the girl was a minor facing an unfortunate situation and did not wish to give birth.The court also considered the hospital medical board’s report, which stated there was no threat to the life of the mother or the child if the pregnancy continued. However, the judges said the girl’s reproductive autonomy must be respected.During the hearing, Justice Nagarathna said such cases involve difficult moral and legal questions. She pointed out that if courts do not allow safe medical termination in such situations, people may turn to unauthorised and unsafe medical providers, which can be dangerous.Medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) is legal in India under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021.The law allows abortion up to 20 weeks with the opinion of one doctor. For certain categories, including minors, rape survivors, and women with disabilities, abortion is allowed between 20 and 24 weeks with the opinion of two doctors. The law also applies to unmarried women.By allowing the termination, the Supreme Court also showed that each case must be considered on its own facts, especially when a minor is involved and has clearly expressed unwillingness to continue the pregnancy. The decision underlines that courts can step in to protect the rights, safety, and dignity of women when required.","Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said the key issue was the minor’s right to decide whether she wanted to continue the pregnancy.

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday alleged that Tirupati laddus were prepared using ghee adulterated with ""bathroom-cleaning chemicals"" during the previous Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy–led YSRCP government.Addressing a village meeting in Kalugotla village of Kurnool district, Naidu claimed, ""Ghee made out of bathroom-cleaning chemicals was used in laddus by them (the previous YSRCP government).""He alleged that the earlier regime had undermined the sanctity and prestige of Lord Venkateswara Swamy by allowing adulterated prasadam (consecrated food) to be used at the Tirumala temple.Naidu further claimed that such adulterated ghee was supplied not only for Tirupati laddus but also to the famous Srisailam temple during the YSRCP rule.Ghee mixed with chemicals was allegedly used in the preparation of laddus for nearly five years under the previous government, the chief minister added.Naidu said there are two types of chemicals used in ghee, noting that some are of vegetable origin and costlier, while animal fat is cheaper.Reiterating his charge, Naidu said the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) report stated that animal fat was used.Responding to claims by YSRCP leaders that a CBI-led special investigation team (SIT) had given a clean chit in the case, Naidu alleged that Reddy's uncle and former TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy himself had earlier admitted that adulteration had taken place.Naidu said his government was trying to correct the alleged wrongdoing and claimed there was a ""lot of difference"" between the laddus being prepared now and those made during the previous regime.He alleged that Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) had been desecrated due to the use of adulterated prasadam.Responding to these allegations, YSRCP chief and former chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said the CBI had given a clean chit to Subba Reddy and B Karunakar Reddy in the case.Speaking to reporters, Reddy reiterated that the CBI SIT had categorically stated that there was no adulteration of animal fat in the ghee""As claimed by (chief minister) Chandrababu Naidu there was no trace of beef tallow, lad or animal fat in the ghee supplied to TTD. Chandrababu Naidu undertook a malicious campaign to insult the sentiments of (Tirupati) Venkateswara Swamy devotees,"" he said.""Not only that, the CBI also gave a clean chit to former TTD chairmen Subba Reddy and Bhumana Karunakar Reddy stating that they did not indulge in any wrongdoing,"" Jagan added.However, Naidu rejected claims of a clean chit, stating that the CBI report does not certify anywhere that there was no adulteration. He further accused them of spreading false narratives and launching counterattacks to divert attention from the issue.","Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu alleged that Tirupati laddus were prepared using ghee adulterated with ""bathroom-cleaning chemicals"" during the previous Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy–led YSRCP government.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government over what he called a denial of facts surrounding the publication of former Army chief General M.M. Naravane’s memoir, saying the issue was “right under your nose” and accusing the government of evading key questions raised by the Opposition.Kharge’s remarks came after Opposition parties walked out of the Rajya Sabha during the Prime Minister’s reply to the debate on the President's address yesterday, alleging that their concerns – particularly on national security and China – were not addressed.""There is no need to react to the PM's speech, but I would like to respond to the things he said. Because repeating the lies has been one of his habits,” Kharge said, referring to the Prime Minister’s speech. “In 97 minutes of this speech, the PM did not say anything conclusive, he didn’t reply to any of the concerns we had raised during the discussion, but only spoke about the last 100 years, 75 years and 50 years.”Referring to the controversy over former Army Chief General Naravane’s memoir, Kharge questioned the government’s claim in Parliament that the book had not been published.“When we talk about the country’s defences, we received the published book by General MM Naravane (Retd), but how did you not get it? And you say in the parliament that the book hasn't been published. How can the Defence Minister say that the book is not published? It is a privilege. It is right under your nose,” Kharge said.He alleged that both home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh repeated the same position in the House before Rahul Gandhi brought an alleged ""memoir"" of ex-Army Chief Naravane in Parliament. “In the end it turned out to be true,” he said.Kharge also questioned the government’s response when Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of China during the debate.“Why were they troubled when LoP Rahul Gandhi raised the issue (China issue)? Listen to the truth and reply… deny it,” he said.Kharge said the Opposition decided to walk out as it felt the Prime Minister had failed to substantively respond to the debate. “It is so unfortunate that he had no substance and answer to the issues we had raised in the House. Later, they only kept abusing me,” he said.Rejecting allegations that the Congress had insulted the Sikh community, after Rahul Gandhi’s comment calling Union minister Raveneet Bittu “traitor” snowbowled into a big controversy, drawing sharp reaction from BJP.Kharge said, “We respect the Sikh community.” He cited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying, “Dr Manmohan Singh, a renowned economist was appointed the Finance Minister and PM twice, the same post as Modi ji.”Accusing the ruling party of relying on attacks rather than governance, Kharge said, “In the last 10 years, what have they done except abuse the Congress?”",Mallikarjun Kharge criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government over what he called a denial of facts.

From Exam Stress to Life Skills: PM Modi Engages Students in Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday interacted with students across the country in the 9th edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026, offering guidance on exams, personal growth, skills, technology use and nation-building ahead of the board examination season.During the interactive session, PM Modi engaged in a wide-ranging conversation with students, addressing exam stress, time management, leadership, wellness and pursuing dreams. Later, students also sang self-composed songs before him.As examinations of CBSE, ISCE and other state boards approach, PM Modi interacted with select “exam warriors” as part of the annual programme. This year, the interactive sessions were held with students from Devmogra in Gujarat, Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, Raipur in Chhattisgarh and Guwahati in Assam, besides the prime minister’s official residence in New Delhi.The 2026 edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha focused on helping students remain stress-free during examinations and encouraging a stronger emphasis on learning, in line with the National Education Policy 2020.PM Modi told students, “Not dreaming is a crime. One should definitely dream, but merely humming about dreams never works. Therefore, one should consider action as paramount in life.”Highlighting the need for balance, he said students must manage studies, rest, skills and hobbies together.“There should be a balance in everything in life. If you lean too much to one side, you will surely fall,” he said.The prime minister stressed that both life skills and professional skills are equally important. “There are two types of skills - life skills and professional skills. If someone asks me which one to focus on, I would say focus on both. They go hand in hand,” he said, adding that skills begin with knowledge and cannot be acquired without learning and observation.“The beginning of skill is with knowledge; its importance cannot be underestimated,” he said.PM Modi cautioned students against treating education as a burden and warned against half-hearted learning. “Education should not feel like a burden. It requires our total involvement. Education in bits and pieces doesn't guarantee success,” he said, adding that exams should never become the ultimate goal.“Life is not just about exams. Education is just a medium for our development. Instead of focusing only on marks, everyone should focus on improvement in life, which goes beyond classrooms and exams,” he added.Speaking about teachers, the prime minister said good educators focus on overall development rather than only exam-oriented teaching. “There are times when teachers only teach what is important for exams, but a good teacher teaches everything and focuses on overall growth,” he said.On digital habits, PM Modi warned students against wasting time online. “Don't just waste time because the internet is cheap in India. I have made a law against betting. We will not let that happen,” he said. While noting that gaming can be a skill if used wisely, he added, “Gaming is a skill. It involves speed and helps personality development, but try to find your expertise by choosing better quality gaming.”Advising students to trust their own study styles while remaining open to guidance, PM Modi said, “Listen to everyone's advice, but change your pattern only when you want to. I have become PM. Still, people tell me to work in different ways. But everyone has their own pattern.”“Some people study better in the morning, some at night. Whatever suits you, believe in that. But also take advice, and if that benefits you, then only add it to your life structure.”Sharing a personal reflection, the prime minister said growth does not mean abandoning core principles. “Even I changed a few things but did not leave my principal pattern,” he said.Reiterating the broader purpose of education, PM Modi said, “Ultimate goal cannot be results in an exam, but all-round development in life.” On mental well-being, he added, “Education should not be a burden and everyone should be totally involved as half-hearted education does not make life successful.”The prime minister also urged students to focus on inner growth and self-awareness. “Tame the mind, then connect the mind, and then keep the subjects you need to study. Then you will always find the student successful,” he said, advising them not to dwell on the past. “Don’t think about the past. Try to live what is in front of you,” he added.Looking ahead to India’s future, PM Modi reminded students of their role in building a developed nation. “You all will be between 35-40 years old in 2047. Who am I working hard for to build a Viksit Bharat? Should you also not work towards it?” he said, calling on young Indians to support domestic manufacturing. “We need to emphasise and ensure to buy and use Indian products,” he added.Calling on students to become responsible citizens, the prime minister stressed cleanliness, awareness and wise use of technology. “Technology is a boon, and we need to embrace it… Use AI wisely to boost your wisdom and personality,” he said.During the interaction, PM Modi welcomed students with the traditional Assamese ‘Gamosa’, describing it as a symbol of women’s empowerment in the Northeast. “This is an epitome of women's empowerment for the Northeast, especially Assam, as the women weave it at home with love and dedication,” he said.Launched in 2018, Pariksha Pe Charcha has grown into one of the country’s largest education engagement initiatives, with more than 4.5 crore registrations recorded this year.","PM Modi engaged in a wide-ranging conversation with students, addressing exam stress, time management, leadership, wellness and pursuing dreams.

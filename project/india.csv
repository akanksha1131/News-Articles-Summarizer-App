"We have EdTech, but is it the right one?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-have-edtech-but-is-it-the-right-one/articleshow/124009353.cms,"To prepare for the future, investing in human capital is key, and early childhood education can offer the highest returns. Betting on this, non- profits across India are decentralising education using tech & innovation

The writer is founder-CEO of The Convergence Foundation, and founder chairperson of Central Square Foundation

Indian children born today will enter the workforce as young adults by 2047. At this point, India has largely won the battle for universal school enrolment. The one that beckons is universal school learning — imparting highquality education that will create opportunity for all and provide the human capital for a developed India by 2047.Economics Nobel Laureate James Heckman’s work on human capital emphasises the high return on investment in early childhood education (ECE), as early interventions enhance cognitive and non-cognitive skills critical to long-term success. The well-known Heckman curve shows that for all stages of education, the highest economic returns come from the earliest investments in children. To raise the collective intelligence of the nation there is a strong case for investing heavily in ECE, raising its share of the Samagra Shiksha budget to 5% (up from around 2% currently).The ubiquity of smartphones in India today — a recent survey reported a smartphone ownership of 1.5 per household in urban India and 1.3 in rural India — offers a never-before-seen opportunity to rapidly scale up high-quality educational inputs to children across the country regardless of their socio-economic status.This is a simple idea with great power. Educational non-profits have begun work on precisely this, and these efforts will only expand in future.For instance, Rocket Learning, a non-profit launched in 2020, has developed interactive and highly engaging educational content that can be delivered over WhatsApp to teachers, parents and children. Every day on these micro-WhatsApp groups, it sends low-income teachers and parents contextualised content in the local language that they can use for play-based activities with children in the classroom or at home. These activities take less than 20 minutes and involve readily available materials.Research shows that greater parental involvement in children’s education leads to improved academic performance. That sense of participation is reinforced by encouraging parents and educators to share images and videos back to the WhatsApp groups, creating a sense of a shared learning community.Chimple is an android app developed in India, that uses games to instil foundational literacy and numeracy through a teacher-directed, at-home learning model. Using the app, a teacher can remotely assign content for children to practise, based on the teaching plan for the week. In a pilot study involving Class 1 and 2 students in Haryana, the treatment group saw a 50% improvement in test scores over the year with 10 minutes of usage of Chimple in a day. Similar improvements were recorded in English as well, and the low performing learners at the baseline benefited even more.Going up to higher grades of schooling, new learning opportunities can be reinforced by generative AI — a powerful use case for which is Personalised Adaptive Learning (PAL). Instead of the rigid, one-size-fits-all mode of learning that conventional classrooms offer, students can learn at their own pace and in their own space with PAL — making engaging, immersive and interactive learning available at even the remotest of locales. If children of the elite have an edge because they have access to individual high-quality coaches to quickly resolve their problems, such access can be universalised with the help of PAL.Educational non-profit Central Square Foundation (CSF) is working with Khan Academy to contextualise Khanmigo, India’s AI-powered personal tutor for low-income contexts. State govts are beginning to leverage PAL for their school systems. Andhra Pradesh has been a pioneer here as it has made PAL part of its World Bank-aided Supporting Andhra’s Learning Transformation (SALT) programme. Use of PAL to heal educational divides can only grow in future.PAL, however, is not the only AI use case in education. AI can generate the learning content itself — scripts, rhymes, worksheets and illustrations are created using LLMs, saving time and boosting creativity. AI can translate and dub across languages, simplify animation and personalise audio with voice cloning. AI can also drive data analysis at the back-end, using incoming messages to draw nuanced insights into how well specific educational programmes are working.CSF has entered into partnerships to build an AI-powered Teacher Coach for govt school teachers, which can provide actionable feedback to teachers and identify effective levers for measurable improvements in classroom practice. AI tools can also grade large volumes of student work, reducing five minutes of paper checking time to 20 seconds. They can provide nuanced understanding of a student’s performance and actionable insights based on it, thus reducing teachers’ workload and enabling them to engage more students.India’s EdTech sector is already large and bound to grow further. But what parts of it are relevant and useful, and go from being a handmaiden for the rich to being universally enabling? In order to evaluate the many available EdTech solutions, CSF has developed — jointly with IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi — an evaluation index that enables govts and other users to make quality-led, evidence-informed choices regarding EdTech procurement for schools, especially those catering to low-income students.The index is called EdTech Tulna, and helps define quality standards for what good EdTech looks like. It creates exhaustive tool-kits and training for decision-makers to apply these standards to evaluate EdTech products, and publishes reviews of products to drive demand and shape supply.Apart from EdTech innovations, there are innovations at the level of school governance and regulation that can dramatically uplift quality. At present, regulation of schools is heavily input-focused. This priority must now shift to measurement of outcomes, which should be reported transparently, publicly and regularly. Such data will allow parents to choose the best school for their children and vote with their feet, building pressure to improve school quality. It will also allow the best schools to emerge as exemplars whose best practices can be replicated at others too.Other countries have followed this transparency model to effectively improve school quality — including the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted, UK), Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA, Dubai) and Sistema de Medición de la Calidad de la Educación (SIMCE, Chile).The National Education Policy (NEP 2020) talks about a school regulator called the State School Standards Authority (SSSA) to set standards and publicise the level of each school in the state, based on those standards. To be effective, SSSAs need to function independently of the department of education and other govt bodies, and assess the quality of all schools — whether public or private — impartially. As NEP 2020 recommends, they should shift regulation from being overly restrictive (especially for private schools) to being “light but tight”. SSSAs should regularly report on the quality of schools and put these out in the public domain.Every child in India deserves a chance to reach their full potential. With new technologies as well as enabling reforms, we will be well on our way towards fulfilling that dream.","Indian children born today will enter the workforce as young adults by 2047.

Early roots in Bahadurgarh

Graduation at Hansraj College

Pursuing postgraduate studies at Delhi University

Beyond classrooms: Sports and student activism

Campaign promises and vision as President

The student politician as a product of DU’s ecosystem

Aryan Maan has secured a major win in Delhi University politics by being elected President of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) 2025. Representing the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ABVP ), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Maan’s victory reflects both his grassroots connect and the organisational strength of ABVP on campus. His journey from Bahadurgarh, Haryana, to the capital’s premier university system underscores the diverse social and academic backgrounds that shape Delhi University’s leadership.Born and raised in Bahadurgarh, Haryana, Aryan Maan’s student leadership stems from a background shaped by regional aspirations and a keen interest in youth mobilisation. His roots outside Delhi resonate with the significant number of students in the university who migrate from across India for higher education. This has also influenced his campaign themes of accessibility, affordability, and infrastructure reforms.Also See: Aryan Maan wins DUSU 2025 presidency as ABVP dominates Delhi University student elections Maan’s academic journey within Delhi University began at Hansraj College, where he pursued his undergraduate studies. He completed his B.Com degree in 2025, building a reputation not only as a diligent student but also as an active voice in campus debates. Hansraj, known for producing leaders in academia, politics, and business, gave him both the platform and networks to step into active student politics.Currently, Aryan Maan is enrolled in a Master’s programme in Library Science at Delhi University. This choice of discipline sets him apart from the conventional law, commerce, or political science tracks pursued by many student leaders. It also reflects his long-term academic interest in research, knowledge systems, and access to learning resources.Maan is also known as a football player, adding a sporting dimension to his personality. His active participation in athletics has contributed to his appeal among students who look for well-rounded leaders. Parallel to sports, his involvement in ABVP-led campaigns—ranging from protests against fee hikes to initiatives for improved campus infrastructure—strengthened his reputation as a hands-on organiser rather than a symbolic candidate.Also See: Who is Rahul Jhansla? The SBSC grad and law student who became DUSU Vice President 2025 For the 2025 DUSU elections, Aryan Maan outlined a set of promises centred on enhancing the student experience. These include subsidised metro passes, free Wi-Fi across campus, accessibility audits to support students with disabilities, upgraded sports facilities, and financial assistance for final-year research scholars. Now, with his election as DUSU President, the challenge will be in translating these commitments into concrete outcomes.Aryan Maan’s trajectory underlines how Delhi University continues to serve as a breeding ground for India’s next generation of leaders. With his blend of academic pursuit, athletic involvement, and grassroots activism, he represents a modern model of the student politician: one grounded in local roots, shaped by the university’s plural environment, and aspiring for a larger role in shaping youth-centric policy debates.","Aryan Maan has secured a major win in Delhi University politics by being elected President of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) 2025.

The third nuclear submarine in this class, INS Aridhman, is undergoing trials.The reactor now under development at Barc will provide a major operational advantage to newer submarines, such as greater endurance and longer submergence time.According to him, government is focusing on the design and development of nuclear submarines because of their importance in the nuclear triad; they provide a survivable and mobile platform for second-strike capability. The other two legs of the nuclear triad are the Army and the Air Force.In another development, Barc is also designing a light-water-based 200 MWe Bharat small modular reactor (SMR), a 555 MWe SMR and a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor for clean hydrogen production by integrating it with a thermochemical plant, according to Atomic Energy Commission chairman A K Mohanty’s statement at the 69th conference of the IAEA in Vienna this week.",Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is developing a reactor that will help more than double the endurance levels of the Indian Navy's next-generation submarines.

JAMMU: A special NIA court in Jammu has extended by 45 days the custodial remand of two accused arrested on charges of harbouring Pakistani terrorists involved in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Special judge Sandeep Gandotra on Thursday extended the remand of Pahalgam locals Bashir Ahmad Jothat and Parvaiz Ahmad, who hail from Baisaran and Batkote, respectively, beyond the stipulated 90-day period to allow the NIA more time to complete its probe into the massacre of 26 people, after public prosecutor Chandan Kumar Singh submitted that the investigation was at a crucial stage, and several witness statements yet to be recorded.The investigating agency also stated that crucial evidence was still awaited, including analysis of mobile phone data linked to Pakistani numbers, forensic reports from CFSL Chandigarh and NFSU Gandhinagar, and DNA profiling of seized blankets, shawls and bedsheets to establish links with the slain terrorists. Arms and ammunition recovered in a July 28 encounter were also under forensic analysis, the prosecution said.The two accused were arrested on June 22, and have been in judicial custody at Amphalla district jail in Jammu. Their 90-day remand was set to expire on Sept 19.Opposing NIA’s application for extension of remand, defence counsel Ashwani Kumar countered that the accused had already been in custody for two months without conclusive evidence, and the agency had failed to complete investigation within the time granted.Rejecting the defence plea, the court noted that the allegations were grave and directly linked to national security, and granted 45 days’ extension while directing the investigating officer to complete the probe expeditiously.In another case, the same court dismissed the bail application of Tanveer Ahmed Wani, former chief of the LoC Traders Association, who is accused of channelising funds from Pakistan to strengthen the network of the Hizbul Mujahideen.Wani, a resident of Pulwama, was arrested in Feb 2020. According to the NIA, he had strong links with Pakistan-based Hizbul leadership and personally handed over cash to terrorists. He also facilitated meetings and maintained an over-ground worker network to route money for terror activities.After hearing the prosecution and the petitioner’s counsel, judge Gandotra noted that the accusations were serious and directly linked to national security. The gravity of charges under IPC and UAPA barred bail at this stage, he ruled.","Bashir Ahmad Jothat and Parvaiz Ahmad are accused of harbouring Pakistani terrorists involved in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.

'Could have stayed silent': Ian Bremmer praises PM Modi for 'defying' Trump; how it had positive impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/could-have-stayed-silent-ian-bremmer-praises-pm-modi-defying-trump-how-it-had-positive-impact/articleshow/123997468.cms,"India’s oil purchase from Russia



US-Pakistan ties



From dead economy to great country



American political scientist and Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer praised PM Modi for publicly rejecting US President Donald Trump’s claim of mediating between India and Pakistan during the escalation in May following Operation Sindoor.Bremmer described the move as a rare show of resistance against Washington that stood out on the global stage, claiming that other countries would have “sucked it up and not said anything”.In an interview with ANI, Bremmer said PM Modi’s decision to openly contradict Trump was an example of personality-driven diplomacy.“There have been no consequences to the Russians for telling Trump no. And I think Modi is in that space, right? Because Modi could have easily not embarrassed Trump about the India Pakistan issue and instead Modi decided to publicly say no you had nothing to do with this and really did embarrass Trump on the global stage.”“Modi decided personally that he was going to make this public, he was going to embarrass the US president even though the US president is much more powerful than Modi is. And you know most other leaders in that position have chosen to remain silent,” he said.To stress his point, Bremmer cited UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s example who chose to be more accommodating towards Trump, even if he didn’t agree with him in private..“Some of them have even proactively talked about how amazing Trump is, how wonderful Trump is. I mean, look at Kier Starmer, who certainly doesn't like what Trump stands for, but loves the fact that he got a better deal from Trump than other countries have. He's in a very weak position,” Bremmer explained.In early August, Trump raised tariffs on India by 25% for continuing to buy Russian oil, saying the trade was helping Moscow’s war effort. This pushed the total tariff on Indian goods entering the US to 50%.Bremmer said that PM Modi’s close ties with Russia gave a direct message to the US president.“He got into Putin 's limousine just like Putin got into Trump's limousine and made it very clear as Trump was saying, ‘I'm going to increase tariffs on you because you're buying all this oil.’ Modi saying, ‘I'm going to do whatever I want with Putin and I'm not going to listen to you.’ That was a very direct message,” Bremmer said.Pointing to what he called hypocrisy over US pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil, the political scientist said, “I wouldn't talk about oil, I would talk about the Americans buying Russian uranium, billions of Russian uranium and fertilizer. So at the same time the Americans are telling you don't buy oil, the Americans are buying Russian product and and they're not suggesting that they're going to stop.”He added that India’s refusal to accept Trump’s claims had not harmed bilateral relations. “I think that was, it was noticed but it did not lead to negative consequences. In fact, it probably made Trump pay more attention to the need to engage with Modi in a friendlier way. I would say that worked.”On the broader India-US relationship, Bremmer was cautious. “I don't think the relationship is fundamentally broken. But the idea that the US is going to become India's reliable trusted great power partner is clearly not in the cards,” he said.Bremmer also warned of India’s declining trust in the United States as it inclines towards Pakistan.“I think there's less trust. I think that there is a sense in India that the US is less reliable than it used to be. Part of that is the Pakistan relationship with the United States both officially as well as unofficially and the business connections. Part of it is Trump's recklessness in diplomacy, his desire for credit and his indifference to how that may affect others that he's working with.”When asked if this was about trade or personality politics, Bremmer linked it also to Washington’s ties with Islamabad. “Well, I think it's about Pakistan too, right? I mean, the US suddenly is working more closely with Pakistan,” he said.He also criticised the Trump administration’s approach, suggesting it was driven largely by economic and business interests. “This is mostly about business...There is a kind a of lack of ethics, a kleptocratic and oligarchic impulse with the family, and a constellation of people that are around the administration, trusted by light, who are conducting a lot of business with Pakistan. And that has brought them in. I don't think it's a particular strategic shift. I think it's opportunistic, and it's about some money,” he said.Bremmer further noted that US support in Europe had already weakened. “If the Americans aren't even interested in a strong Europe, it's hard to imagine they're going to be very interested in a strong India,” he observed.Turning to regional developments, he linked the Saudi-Pakistan mutual defence pact to growing frustrations with Washington’s handling of Israel’s actions in Gaza.Talking about Trump’s changing remarks about India’s economy, Bremmer was dismissive.“Trump changes what he says about you on a dime depending on, you know, sort of how he feels in the moment. It has nothing to do with with the Indian economy.”Earlier on July 31, the US President wrote on his social media platform, “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”However, days later on September 10, he changed his stance, “I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!”",Bremmer praised PM Modi for publicly rejecting US President Donald Trump’s claim of mediating between India and Pakistan during the escalation in May.

'Manmohan Singh Thanked Me For Meeting Hafiz Saeed': Yasin Malik's Bombshell Claim; BJP Slams Cong

SRINAGAR: Former J&K CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti wrote to home minister Amit Shah on Friday, taking up cudgels on behalf of jailed separatist Yasin Malik and seeking ""a compassionate and urgent review"" of the terror funding case against him on grounds of what she described as ""his long-standing commitment to non-violence"".""Over the years, Malik engaged in dialogue involving senior officials, intelligence personnel, and even controversial figures like Hafiz Saeed, all with the tacit consent of Indian agencies. These efforts represented a painstaking and deliberate attempt to build bridges in a deeply fractured land,"" Mehbooba said, referring to Malik's recent affidavit in Delhi high court.The PDP president, whose many controversies include her claim that J&K accepted the Indian tricolour in 1947 on certain conditions and constitutional guarantees, said she was writing to Shah ""not merely as a witness but as someone who has lived through the turbulent times of Kashmir, bearing its grief, enduring its silences, and holding on to its fragile hopes"".She claimed Malik's journey was no secret. ""In 1994, he took a courageous and rare decision to lay down arms and embrace political, non-violent means to pursue change. According to his sworn affidavits, this shift was neither unilateral nor impulsive but encouraged and facilitated through back-channel understandings with Indian agencies,"" the letter states.In his affidavit, Malik spoke of his involvement in backchannel diplomacy, including private meetings with PMs, ministers and intelligence chiefs.He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison by an NIA court on charges of receiving foreign funding and collaborating with terrorist groups. NIA has since appealed to Delhi HC to turn his life term into death penalty.""This appeal does not seek to undermine the judiciary's authority but calls for the responsible exercise of democratic instruments to honour both justice and mercy. The spirit of India, I firmly believe, lies in our capacity to show magnanimity and uphold promises made in pursuit of peace,"" Mehbooba's letter pleads.Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone accused the ex-CM of ""hypocrisy"".

He sought liberty to withdraw the civil revision, with the right to revive it if a compromise application is not filed before trial court within 90 days. The request was not opposed by counsels representing Jyotiraditya Scindia and other respondents.The dispute stems from a 2010 suit filed by the three aunts seeking their share in the family's vast fortune.They argued that daughters have equal rights in their father's property under succession laws. Jyotiraditya Scindia later filed a counter-suit.

They expect a better performance than in 2020, when key ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) had contested independently.Home minister Amit Shah, who will steer the alliance strategy, held the first round of meetings with Janata Dal United boss and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna on Thursday. Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, senior JDU netas Sanjay Jha and Vijay Kumar Choudhary also attended the meet.Alliance sources said the two lead allies are likely to agree on contesting almost an equal number of seats, while sparing a reasonable number for other partners, including Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas), Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM).Sources said EC is likely to announce Bihar poll dates in the first week of Oct.

""All netas in the Patna meeting agreed to finalise seat-sharing in Sept,"" said a senior NDA member, adding that initial talks have been quite positive with no bottlenecks.Though JDU and BJP are likely to contest an equal number of seats, there is a possibility that JDU will take a couple of more seats to position Nitish Kumar's regional powerhouse as the lead party.Asked about NDA contesting the polls under Kumar, though there has not been a formal announcement he will continue as CM in case of the BJP-led bloc wins, the alliance neta said, ""A formal announcement is not needed as allies are contesting under Nitish Kumar, therefore, it is implied that he is the CM candidate too.""The 30-minute Shah-Kumar meeting was described by NDA sources as a courtesy call.

LJP (Ram Vilas) has also sought ""respectable"" representation, with party's Jamui MP Arun Bharti hinting at a claim of 43-137 seats.

"ABVP claims 3 of 4 Dusu posts, NSUI reduced to 1",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abvp-claims-3-of-4-dusu-posts-nsui-reduced-to-1/articleshow/124009015.cms,"(L to R) ABVP’s Deepika Jha, Aryan Maan, Sarthak Sharma (Delhi secy) & Kunal Chaudhary celebrate (Image credit: Tarun Rawat)

NEW DELHI: The RSS-backed ABVP bagged three key positions, including that of president, in the fiercely contested Delhi University Students' Union (Dusu) elections while the Congress-backed NSUI, which held the top post last year, managed to secure just one. The counting of votes took place Friday.ABVP's Aryan Maan won the president's post, receiving 28,841 votes to defeat NSUI's Joslyn Nandita Choudhary (12,645 votes) by a margin of 16,196 votes. NSUI's Rahul Jhansla emerged victorious as vice-president, getting 29,339 votes to defeat ABVP's Govind Tanwar, who managed 20,547 votes. ABVP's Kunal Chaudhary secured 23,779 votes to win the secretary's post, defeating NSUI's Kabir, while Deepika Jha claimed the joint secretary's post with 21,825 votes, overcoming NSUI's Lavkush Bhadana.ABVP's vote share climbed from 34.7% to 48.1%, its highest in over a decade.""The students of DU have sent a strong message... they trust us,"" Maan said after the victory, draped in the tricolour and surrounded by his jubilant supporters. He promised his first priority as president would be to push for concessional metro passes for students, a long-standing demand across colleges. ""We will work for every student and address all their concerns,"" he said.Aryan Maan's victory on Friday in the Dusu elections carried particular significance, not only because it reclaimed the top post for ABVP after last year's loss, but also because of its scale. The margin for the presidential race leapt from just 1,343 votes in 2024 to over 16,000 this year, a more than 12-fold increase.As the results trickled in at Delhi University Sports Centre in North Campus, the streets echoed with applause and cheers. Outside, supporters gathered, chanting ""Maan, Maan"" as the newly-elected president was hoisted onto the shoulders of his followers, waving the tricolour.A large crowd showered flower petals on the winners as they reached the Arts Faculty. In line with Delhi High Court's directives, the usual fanfare of firecrackers and dhols was largely absent, though occasional drumbeats could be heard. However, ABVP clarified it was not responsible for these. At the Arts Faculty, the winners posed before the Swami Vivekananda statue soon after, continuing a long-standing campus tradition.NSUI's Rahul Jhansla, who had the highest vote tally among all winners, outlined his priorities with quiet determination: ""My top priority is to launch mental health initiatives, with at least one counsellor in every college. I have been raising student issues for six years, and I will continue to stand up for them.""ABVP's Kunal Chaudhary expressed gratitude to the student body, saying, ""I thank every DU student with folded hands - this victory is because of them. My focus will be on getting Wi-Fi installed across colleges and pursuing metro travel concessions.""Deepika Jha, also from ABVP, called the moment ""emotional and proud"". ""For women students, we will work to create girls' common rooms in all colleges and ensure regular patrolling outside girls' colleges,"" she said, as supporters showered her with garlands.Among the AISA-SFI candidates, Anjali received 5,385 votes for president, Sohan Kumar secured 4,163 votes for vice-president, Abhinandana Pratyashi got 9,535 votes for secretary and Abhishek Kumar garnered 8,425 votes for joint secretary.In 2024, NSUI won the president's post after a seven-year gap. Its national president Varun Choudhary wrote on X: ""NSUI fought well... not just against ABVP, but against the combined force of DU admin, Delhi govt, central govt, RSS-BJP & Delhi Police. Yet thousands of DU students stood firmly with us.""Since its start in 1954, the Dusu elections have been a cornerstone of student politics, influencing discourse across the university's 52 affiliated colleges. Over the years, ABVP has emerged as a dominant force, notably sweeping all four key posts in 2015 and continuing its strong performance by winning three major positions in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2023. Yet, NSUI has remained a persistent challenger, achieving a major breakthrough in 2017 by securing two posts and frequently claiming the vice-president position in subsequent years, consolidating its presence on campus.Voter turnout this year rose to 39.4% from 35.2% in 2024. Turnout has reflected the shifting tides of student engagement, ranging from 36.9% in 2016 to a peak of 43.8% in 2018. These variations underscore the competitiveness of DU politics, with Dusu serving as a microcosm of broader democratic processes in the country.The ""None of the Above"" (NOTA) option drew notable support in the DUSU elections for 2025-26, with 23,674 students opting for it across the four posts. This surge highlighted a clear sense of discontent among the student electorate.","The RSS-backed ABVP bagged three key positions, including that of president.

NEW DELHI: Moving fast on PM Narendra Modi’s Independence Day announcement, the Union cabinet has approved setting up of a High Level Committee (HLC) which will study and suggest measures to deal with the demographic changes arising from illegal immigration. It will also study “other abnormal causes” behind the issue what Modi has called a security challenge.TOI has learnt that the proposal got the go ahead in the last cabinet meeting held on Sept 10. Sources said home minister Amit Shah had briefed his cabinet colleagues about the setting up of the HLC in the light of illegal immigration, particularly in border areas. The details of composition of the panel and the timeline for giving the recommendations are not yet known.They added that soon there would be a detailed notification about the HLC, including the terms of reference of the panel which may also have some representation from bordering states.In his last Independence Day speech, the PM had announced the launch of a High-Power Demography Mission to address the “severe crisis” of a “deliberate conspiracy” to alter the country's demography. Terming illegal immigration as seeds of a new crisis being sown, Modi had said infiltrators are snatching away the livelihoods of the youth.“These infiltrators are targeting our sisters and daughters. This will not be tolerated. These infiltrators are misleading innocent tribals and seizing their lands. The nation will not endure this. When demographic change occurs, particularly in border areas, it creates a crisis for national security. It threatens the unity, integrity, and progress of the country. It sows the seeds of social tension. No country can hand itself over to infiltrators. No nation in the world does so—how then can we allow Bharat to do so?” Modi had said.Both the PM and home minister have highlighted the issue of illegal immigration in their recent addresses at rallies in Assam and Bihar. Last week, Modi, in his address in Assam, had blamed Congress for the ongoing demographic challenges while branding the main opposition party as “defenders of infiltrators and anti-national forces”. The PM had said, “Any change to demography is a danger to national security. BJP’s objective is to protect the country from infiltrators and restore its integrity. ..We will show the way we dedicate our lives to remove infiltrators.”Last month, Shah had urged district magistrates of border districts to take action to remove illegal encroachments within 30 km from the borders while stating that demographic changes in border areas directly impact country’s security and they could be part of a “deliberate design”.",The High Level Committee (HLC) will study and suggest measures to deal with the demographic changes arising from illegal immigration.

Pakistan's 'Lies' Shredded By Own; Lashkar Man Reveals Muridke Bombing 'Truth' I Details

Elimination of nine terror infrastructure in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor has led major Pakistan-sponsored terrorist groups, particularly Jaish-e-Muhammed and Hizbul Mujahideen, to move deep inside Pakistan, closer to the Afghanistan border. The intelligence establishment has received credible visual confirmation that the two outfits are shifting their bases to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK).JeM has been aggressively expanding its training facility - Markaz Shohada-e-Islam - at Mansehra in the Khyber region. Photographs have confirmed construction activity and an increase in logistical inflows at the site.On the other hand, Hizb, under the command of ex-SSG commando Khalid Khan, is constructing a new training facility named ""HM-313"" in Bandai, KPK. While the land was purchased in Aug 2024, construction there started only in mid-May. Boundary walls and initial training infrastructure have been completed, photographs show. The ""313"" nomenclature is a symbolic tribute to the Badr Ghazwa (a historic Islamic battle) and al-Qaida 's Brigade 313, reflecting Hizb's intent to attract global jihadi legitimacy.On Sept 25, JeM is planning a recruitment drive in Peshawar's Markaz Shaheed Maksudabad to commemorate Yusuf Azhar - Masood Azhar's brother who was killed in Operation Sindoor. It is there that a new alias for the outfit - al-Murabitun (defenders of land of Islam) similar to an al-Qaida group of Western Africa - will be announced.The decision to relocate reflects a significant tactical adaptation by the groups, which now view traditional locations as vulnerable to Indian precision strikes.KPK offers greater depth due to its geography, proximity to Afghan frontier, and existing jihadi safe havens dating back to the Afghan war, an intelligence note reads. This movement is being conducted with full knowledge and direct facilitation of Pakistan's state structures, as evidenced by overt JeM gatherings held under police protection and the tacit involvement of political-religious outfits like Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), the note added.KPK is now being repositioned as a rear command zone for JeM, while PoK continues to serve as a forward operating platform for infiltration.The intelligence establishment has flagged the Jaish-led event at Garhi Habibullah in Mansehra, where a public recruitment drive kicked off barely seven hours before the start of the India-Pakistan cricket match on Sept 14. The event, ostensibly organised as part of a Deobandi religious gathering, was in fact a coordinated mobilisation effort led jointly by JeM and JUI in the presence of Mulana Mufti Masood Ilyas Kashmiri alias Abu Mohammad, JeM's chief for KPK and Kashmir.""His presence at a public rally guarded by both JeM cadre armed with M4 rifles and local police officers, including inspector Liaqat Shah of Garhi Habibullah police station, reflects both state complicity and the boldness of JeM's revivalist strategy,"" an intelligence officer said.

Dehradun On Red Alert As Heavy Rainfall Triggers Cloudburst, Tamsa River Swells Up

NEW DELHI: Reckless development activities may well have exacerbated weather-related devastation in north India this monsoon, but the sheer amount of rain the region received almost without a break was unprecedented in recent decades. Total rainfall across north India since June 1 crossed 740mm on Friday, making it the wettest monsoon in the region in 37 years, and the third wettest since 1950.Uncharacteristically for north India, it rained without a major break through the season. It's for the first time since 1978 that all four monsoon months - June to Sept - saw surplus rainfall in the region. Only on three other years, including 1978, have these four months receive above-normal rainfall in north India, as per IMD records since 1950.While the region recorded 42.2% more-than-normal rain in June, mainly on account of bountiful pre-monsoon showers, the surplus was 13.2% in July, 34.4% in Aug and 62.3% so far this month (till Sept 19).Overall, 741.4mm of rain has been recorded across north India since June 1 against a normal of 563.6mm, which translates to a surplus of 31.5%. This is the highest monsoon rainfall in the region since 1988, when 813.5mm was logged.","Total rainfall across north India since June 1 crossed 740mm on Friday.

SC quashes FIR lodged after foreign court orders and separation abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-quashes-fir-lodged-after-foreign-court-orders-and-separation-abroad/articleshow/124008622.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Indian-origin Austrian citizen, Tina Khanna, separated from her husband Nitin Ahluwalia, an Australian citizen, and took their child in 2013 to Austria, where the man won the litigation for the child's custody. In April 2016, he was granted divorce by an Australian court.As a classic example of misuse of IPC Section 498A by women, flagged many a time by the Supreme Court , Tina in May 2016 lodged a complaint with SSP, SAS Nagar, alleging dowry demands and physical and mental torture. Nitin moved Punjab and Haryana HC seeking quashing of the FIR, but his plea was rejected. He moved SC, which in Dec 2017 stayed proceedings on the FIR.Nearly a decade after the FIR was lodged, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra has quashed the FIR and criticised the woman's conduct.Writing the judgment and regretting the failure of mediation attempts between the parties, Justice Karol said, ""We are disappointed in the lack of foresight shown by both parties, particularly when it comes to the well-acknowledged ill-effects of continued, strained and hostile relationship between the parents on a young child."" ""In this case, the child was born in Sept 2012, and the parents have been in litigation from the time when she was not even a year old to the day this judgment is delivered,"" he said.Tina's counsel argued that as India was not a signatory to The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 1980, the decree passed by the courts in Austria need not be considered by the SC.The bench took note that Tina had filed the FIR a month after the Australian court granted divorce on Nitin's petition as the couple were separated for three years. It said the FIR appears to be a counterblast as Nitin had two orders in his favour -- courts in Austria ordering Tina to bring the child back to Australia and the other by the courts in Australia accepting Nitin's plea for divorce.SC said although Tina argued before Austrian courts better education facilities were the reason she shifted her daughter to Austria from Australia, it was found she had been living in India in the past years and did not comply with directive to return the daughter to Australia. Assessing that FIR painted a picture that was far from truth, SC said period of dowry and cruelty allegation period noted in FIR was beyond date of divorce granted by the Australian court.","An Indian-origin Austrian citizen, Tina Khanna, separated from her husband Nitin Ahluwalia, an Australian citizen.

Navigating the boss labyrinth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/navigating-the-boss-labyrinth/articleshow/123995367.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“Agalaadhu Anugaadhu Theekayvaar Polga:





Igal Vendhar Serndozhugu vaar”

Moving with the bosses is like sitting by the fireside;

Neither too close, nor too far.

In high-powered organizations, one lesson shines above all — protect the boss ’s ego. Disagree you may, but gently. Always accept the boss’s decision as final and weigh words like gold.We like to believe that careers are built on talent and hard work. But often, they are shaped by the temperament of the person we report to. Employees do not leave organisations; they leave their bosses. Bosses can wound in many ways—the one who makes your best efforts seem miniscule, the one who basks in the glow of victories but points an accusing finger at failures, the micro-manager who controls every move, and the monster manager who thrives on making others’ lives miserable.Even brilliant leaders are not exempt. Craig M Wright, an American scholar, studied the leadership styles of several geniuses such as Edison, Picasso, Henry Ford and Steve Jobs, who were masterminds and yet poor as leaders. Jobs, for instance, was allegedly obsessively controlling and prone to fits of rage. A few who worked under him have remarked that suffering soars as much as creativity under him.How then did employees survive their ire? By adapting. Some endured the storms in silence, some mastered the art of reading moods, and some simply left when the strain became too much. If this is the case with corporates—where checks and balances still exist—what about kings who held supreme power?History is filled with tales of such unchecked arrogance. Maharaja Jai Singh (1882–1937) despised defeat. Opponents in games were warned to lose, yet once during a polo match the opposite team triumphed. Furious, the Maharaja torched his horse, blaming it for the loss. On another occasion, he felt insulted at a Rolls-Royce showroom in London, and bought seven cars, shipped them to India, and used them as garbage carriers. King Farouk of Egypt (1920–1965) fared no better; he disliked the look of a railway station and ordered it to be demolished. Power, when absolute, often slid into cruelty.So how should one navigate a bully boss in the modern workplace? Experts say one should ever confront them mid-tirade. If the attack is by email, resist the urge to strike back instantly. Wait, and bring up the incident calmly in private. You may never get an apology, but your quiet reminder signals that respect cannot be trampled on. With narcissistic bosses, the path is different. Their charm is a mask that slips in time. When it does, the best course is to plan an exit, but carefully, without burning bridges.Centuries before, Thiruvalluvar anticipated these struggles in his chapter ‘Dealing with the Supremely Powerful’. His counsel is precise:·Do not compete with your boss·A bad impression is hard to erase. So try not to make any mistakes·Your boss may be friendly. Do not take liberties—never laugh out loud or whisper in his ear·Do not interrupt or question rashly·Intimacy does not mean privilegeAnd then comes his most profound metaphor, inThat, perhaps, is the timeless art. Whether in the court of kings or corporate corridors, survival rests, not in confrontation or servility, but in balance—knowing the exact distance at which one can sit, feel the warmth and not get burnt.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124000930,imgsize-51472,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124000930.jpg"
"BJP neta's son fakes 'death' to dodge Rs 1.4 crore loan, held",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-netas-son-fakes-death-to-dodge-rs-1-4-crore-loan-held/articleshow/123986018.cms,"Vishal Soni fabricated his own death.

Neta's son also tried to stage kidnapping

BHOPAL: What began as a frantic river rescue in MP's Rajgarh district a fortnight ago, has unraveled into an elaborate fraud - Vishal Soni, son of Rajgarh BJP leader Mahesh Soni, fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans, sending police, administration, and SDERF teams on a 10-day, 20-km search of the Kalisindh River, even as he remained hidden in Maharashtra.The drama began unfolding on Sept 5, when police received information about a car sinking in the Kalisindh river. Divers retrieved the vehicle, only to find it empty. The car was identified as belonging to Vishal Soni, prompting a large-scale rescue mission. Following allegations of negligence by Vishal's father, three separate teams scoured the river for nearly two weeks, covering a 20-km stretch.When no sign of Vishal emerged after eight days, suspicions deepened. Station house officer Akanksha Hada obtained Vishal's mobile call detail records, which revealed his location in Maharashtra.Acting swiftly, MP police - assisted by their counterparts in Maharashtra - apprehended Vishal in the Fardapur police station area of Sambhaji Nagar district.During interrogation, Vishal confessed to owning six trucks and two public vehicles but being overwhelmed by debts exceeding Rs 1.40 crore.""I was told that if I got a death certificate, the bank loans would be waived,"" he reportedly told police.On September 5, at 5 am, Vishal collected money from his truck driver near Gopalpura, drove to the riverbank, switched off his car's headlights, and pushed the vehicle into the river before fleeing on the driver's bike to Indore. Reading newspaper reports of his own ""death,"" he traveled to Shirdi and Shani Shingnapur.When news reached him that police had traced his location, Vishal attempted to stage a kidnapping by tearing his clothes, rolling in dust, and filing a false report at Fardapur police station.Two days prior to his arrest, police had questioned Vishal's father and brothers, who admitted suspecting he was staying with relatives. Police noted that there was no direct constitutional provision to penalise a man for faking his own death, so Vishal was handed over to his family without a formal case.","Vishal Soni fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans.

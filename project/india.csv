NEW DELHI: As many as 650 weapons were surrendered in Manipur over the past week in response to governor Ajay Bhalla ’s appeal for voluntary surrender of all illegal weapons , including those looted from armouries in the wake of outbreak of ethnic violence in May 2023. This has raised hopes that Manipuri people may be more receptive to the appeal, particularly in view of peace having sustained in the state over the past few months, unbroken even by the exit of N Biren Singh government and imposition of President’s rule.It is this hope that prompted Bhalla to extend the deadline for the voluntary surrender of looted and other weapons to March 6. The extension came ahead of a detailed review of the situation in Manipur by home minister Amit Shah here on Saturday, where Bhalla, heads of various security forces deployed in the state and the state police chief will be present.The strategy that appears to have worked this time with the rebels — who were cold to previous appeals to turn in the looted weapons — is the government’s outreach to village heads and civil society leaders across Manipur to echo Bhalla’s appeal to their respective communities and warn them of the consequences of ignoring it. The ‘consequences’, which will kick in after the deadline is past, include police/security raids in their villages and tough, criminal action against any youth/rebel still in possession of looted or illegal weapons.“Right now there is assurance that the youths will not be penalised if they surrender the ill-gotten weapons. Besides, the option given to them to hand over their weapons to the village head or community leader, rather than going directly to the police, ensures that they don’t get identified by the police and face possible action or profiling at a later stage,” a senior Manipur govt officer told TOI.As many as 6,020 arms were looted after ethnic clashes broke out in Manipur in 2023. While nearly 3,900 weapons have been recovered by the police and other security forces so far in raids and searches, these also include sophisticated arms that the Manipuri insurgents had from before.Surrenders of looted arms in Manipur have been negligible but for the past one week, with people belonging to Valley areas not confident of turning in the weapons they had looted to purportedly defend themselves against ethnic violence by the 'armed' members of the rival community. The fact that the suspension of operations (SOO) pact between the govt and Kuki-Zo insurgent groups, which allows the latter to retain their weapons with certain conditions, has not been renewed, only added to the rival community’s reluctance to let go of their weapons.","As many as 650 weapons were surrendered in Manipur over the past week in response to governor Ajay Bhalla ’s appeal for voluntary surrender of all illegal weapons.

High courts can stay discharge orders only in rare cases: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-courts-can-stay-discharge-orders-only-in-rare-cases-sc/articleshow/118639888.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Observing that staying a trial court's reasoned order to discharge an accused in a criminal case resulted in curtailing the liberty granted to him, Supreme Court on Friday said high courts should stay an order only in rare and exceptional cases when the discharge order prima facie looked ""perverse"".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said a discharged accused stood on a higher pedestal than an accused who was acquitted after a full trial as discharge order was passed at the threshold when no incriminating material was found against the person. It said staying of discharge order in such cases resulted in the person becoming an accused again.""An order staying the order of discharge is a very drastic order which has the effect of curtailing or taking away the liberty granted to the accused by the discharge order. As a result of the order staying the order of discharge, the order of discharge ceases to operate, and the sessions court can proceed to frame charges against the accused and try him further. Thus, the stay of the discharge order has a grave consequence of depriving an accused of the liberty granted under the discharge order,"" the bench said.The court set aside Delhi high court 's order which had stayed a discharge order without hearing the accused. SC agreed with senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who, appearing for the petitioner, said the consequence of the stay order was that trial would proceed against the petitioner even though he stood discharged.""It is only in rare and exceptional cases, where the order of discharge is ex-facie perverse, that the revisional court can take the extreme step of staying that order. However, such an order should be passed only after giving an opportunity of being heard to the accused. Moreover, while granting the stay, the court must mould the relief so that the trial does not proceed against the discharged accused,"" the bench said.""When a revision application challenging the order of discharge is admitted for hearing, the high court may exercise power under Section 390 by directing the person discharged to appear before the trial court and by directing the trial court to admit him to bail on appropriate terms and conditions. If such an order is passed after the admission of the revision application against the order of discharge, it is a sufficient safeguard for ensuring the presence of the discharged accused at the time of hearing of the revision application and for undergoing trial, if the order of discharge is set aside,"" it added.",Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said a discharged accused stood on a higher pedestal than an accused who was acquitted after a full trial.

NEW DELHI: Pune Crime Branch on Friday arrested an accused in the Swargate bus depot rape case from a village in Shirur Tehsil of Pune district.Dattatray Gade was taken into custody around midnight from Pune's Shirur tehsil after being on the run since the incident on Tuesday. The victim was reportedly waiting for a bus to return home to Phaltan, about 100 km away, after work.The accused, who has previous criminal records, had allegedly approached her, falsely claiming that the bus to her destination was parked elsewhere. He led her to a MSRTC Shivsahi bus parked in the depot, where he allegedly raped her.Also read: Drones, dog squad, 100 cops: How police tracked down Pune bus rape accused hiding in sugarcane field The accused has a criminal record with six cases involving theft, robbery and chain-snatching in Pune and Ahilyanagar district.

SEBI appoints Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey as new chairman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-private-sector-experiment-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey-named-sebi-chief/articleshow/118611693.cms,"Tuhin Kanta Pandey

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Government on Thursday named finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey as the new Sebi chairman , opting for a civil servant to once again lead the market regulator after current chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch , a former ICICI Bank executive, faced controversies, including allegations of conflict of interest. Buch's term ends on Friday.Pandey, who turns 60 in August, has been given a 3-year term at Sebi. This marks another instance of a serving bureaucrat being appointed to a regulatory post before retirement. Barring Puri Buch, the other 10 Sebi chiefs have either been IAS officers or have come from the public sector.Once Pandey takes charge, three of four financial regulators will be led by IAS officers, with pension regulator Dipak Mohanty (an ex-RBI executive director) being sole exception. The 1987-batch IAS officer has had a long stint in the finance ministry, having served as secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) for five years.During that period, he was involved with privatisation of Air India and involved with several public issues by public sector companies, exposing him to stock markets. In Jan, weeks before the Budget, Pandey was moved to the revenue department.The soft-spoken officer, who hails from Punjab, holds a master’s degree in economics and had served as finance secretary in Odisha and was earlier in Planning Commission. He also holds an MBA from the University of Birmingham.Pandey is known to be a stickler for rules and has a very clean image. Not shy to speak his mind, he makes his point, without offending anyone. One of the first tasks before him would be to deal with staff challenges, which came to the fore during Puri Buch’s tenure, when Sebi employees held a demonstration at the agency’s BKS headquarters, in what was seen as a revolt against new HR policies. He has to restore the confidence among stakeholders that the Sebi chief is impartial.","Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey named new Sebi chairman.

India backs EU’s quest for just peace in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-backs-eus-quest-for-just-peace-in-ukraine/articleshow/118637170.cms,"PM Narendra Modi with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen

PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support – in a leaders’ statement after their meeting Friday – for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that’s based on respect for international law, principles of the UN Charter and territorial integrity and sovereignty.The leaders also reiterated their commitment to the “vision of the two-State solution” with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, consistent with international law. This is the first time India has reiterated its support for the two-state solution at the highest level since President Donald Trump announced his plan to overtake Gaza.The solidarity with the EU on Ukraine is particularly significant in the context of what happened in the UN this week when EU States led by France managed to water down the US “forward looking resolution” on Ukraine in the General Assembly that called for lasting, but not just and comprehensive, peace and a swift end to the conflict. The language used in the India-EU leaders’ statement is similar to one of the 3 amendments that France introduced in that resolution - just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine that respects the United Nations Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The amendments meant that the US had to abstain from voting on its own resolution in the General Assembly, although it was later adopted in the Security Council in its original form, with 10 votes in favour. The UK, France and the remaining members – Greece, Slovenia and Denmark – abstained.Interestingly, neither leader explicitly mentioned the Ukraine issue in their media statements that followed their bilateral meeting. While describing India as a pillar of certainty in an increasingly uncertain world, von der Leyen only said that authoritarian states are getting bolder, ignoring borders and threatening peace at sea.However, at a public event earlier in the day, she lashed out at Russia for trying to tear Ukraine apart and said what the EU seeks is for any peace talk to lead to “just and lasting” peace. Playing on India’s concerns about China’s expansionism, the EU leader said a failed Ukraine would not just weaken Europe but also ""intensify"" challenges in other parts of the world. “Not least in this region. Other countries around the world are watching very closely whether there is any impunity if you invade a neighbour or violate international borders. Or whether there are real deterrents,’’ said von der Leyen, adding peace, security and prosperity are indivisible in this world.The landmark EU visit, which saw von der Leyen accompanied by the College of Commissioners for the first time, had been in the works for almost 6 months but happened finally at a time its transatlantic alliance is threatening to unravel because of Trump’s policies. The president said wars, conflicts and coups have erupted in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in Africa and across different regions, adding what happens in one part of the world matters to both Europe and India.“With a free and prosperous Ukraine, that can join the European family. And Europe is ready to live up to its responsibility when it comes to security and defence. We will step up our defence spending to ensure that Member States have access to the full spectrum of capabilities that this new reality demands,’’ she added, talking about historic steps to protect Ukraine and its future.",PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.

She identified trade, technology and connectivity as other areas for taking India-EU ties to the next level, saying the relationship can become one of the defining partnerships of the century.Without specifically talking about US President Donald Trump or his trigger-happy treatment of allies, she also said both India and the EU stood to lose from a world of spheres of influence and isolationism, and gained from a world of cooperation and working together. ""Because we can offer each other distinctive alternatives and tools to make ourselves stronger, more secure and more sovereign in today's world. The kind of offer that cannot really be replicated by others,"" she said.On a new security and defence partnership with India, von der Leyen said this would help both sides step up work to counter common threats whether on cross-border terrorism , maritime security threats, cyber attacks or the new phenomenon: attacks on critical infrastructure.""There is a lot that we can build on. For instance, the recent collaboration on maritime security. And I am delighted at India's interest in joining defence industrial projects under the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation. India is working hard to diversify its military supply and to access new capabilities. And I believe we can help each other to deliver on our security objectives,"" she said.Talking about the geopolitical and geoeconomic headwinds that both EU and India are confronted with, von der Leyen said the world had reached another inflection point. She said this was not a time to place limits on India-EU cooperation. ""Or to get stuck looking for agreement on every issue of regional or global concern. It is time to be pragmatic and ambitious. And to realign our priorities for today's realities,"" she said.Describing IMEEC as a potential modern golden road, von der Leyen said it could make trade between India and Europe 40% faster. ""It is a green and digital bridge across continents and civilisations. This can be a win-win-win for Europe, India and our partners. We are ready to invest in concrete projects that can already start making these connections happen,"" she said.""Make in India and 'made in Europe' can work together to drive our industries forward. And our common interests in de-risking our economies, in particular in sensitive technological areas, can help drive our economic security,"" she added.","European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the 27-member bloc will explore a future security and defence partnership with India.

Uttarakhand avalanche: Mana villagers saved by ancient wisdom & annual migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-avalanche-mana-villagers-saved-by-ancient-wisdom-annual-migration/articleshow/118637614.cms,"Each Nov, as doors of Badrinath temple close, residents of Mana move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape harsh winter

DEHRADUN: Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas , had already emptied out when disaster struck. By the time an avalanche crashed down the Mana-Ghastoli route on Friday morning, smothering everything in its path, the roads were deserted, the homes abandoned. As a result, not many heard the sound of ice fracturing, snow cascading, and the earth shuddering under its weight. They are now counting their blessings.The villagers' migration, a ritual dictated by centuries of wisdom, is more than tradition - it is survival. The Himalayas demand deference, and the people of Mana have long known when to step aside. ""We are fortunate we had shifted to lower locations; otherwise, many people could have been trapped,"" said Pitambhar Molpha , the village headman.Each Nov, as the doors of the Badrinath temple close, the residents of Mana undertake their annual migration, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape the harsh winter. They move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district. They return only when the Badrinath yatra is about to begin.The avalanche - just 500 metres from the village - was neither the first nor the last. ""Avalanches have been reported here in Feb and March before,"" Molpha said. ""At this time of year, workers are engaged in removing snow from the main routes. There is also an army camp near our village.""For those who leave, there is always the lingering question of what remains. Sandeep Aswal, who runs a tea stall - once known as the 'last tea stall of the country' and now rebranded as the 'first tea stall' - has watched tourists come and go, drawn by Mana's mystique. ""It is an unfortunate incident. Since the village is empty, we don't have any updates on whether the avalanche impacted the area. But we feel blessed that all 400 families had already moved,"" he said.","Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas, had already emptied out when disaster struck.

Bihar assembly elections: Has Nitish Kumar lost his bargaining power?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-elections-has-nitish-kumar-lost-his-bargaining-power/articleshow/118633751.cms,"So, is there merit in opposition charge or can Nitish still dictate terms in alliance?

Can Nitish switch again?

Has the BJP has made another flip-flop difficult for Nitish?

NEW DELHI: Has Nitish Kumar lost the sheen and also the bargaining power that helped him dominate Bihar's political landscape for over two decades? The critics of Nitish Kumar say that the recent cabinet expansion, which saw 7 BJP MLAs join his ministry, is a clear indication of who is calling the shots in Bihar.The opposition in Bihar claims that the BJP has ""completely hijacked"" Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and is enjoying power by using the chief minister as a mask.""People should look into the background as to how many cases are against those who have been inducted into Bihar cabinet. This is the last cabinet expansion of the CM (Nitish Kumar). NDA will be finished in 2025. The CM is not able to be at the post. He is tired. He has been losing his credibility. The people of Bihar don't want a Khatara Gaadi (outdated vehicle) but a newer one,"" leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav said.""It was not a cabinet expansion of Bihar but of the BJP. JD(U) has been completely hijacked. The BJP wants to finish the JD(U). Many of the leaders are there in JD(U), but their hearts are with the BJP. The BJP wants to be a dominant force here, but their dream will remain a mere dream,"" the RJD leader added.Another strong critic of Nitish Kumar, former election strategist Prashant Kishor who has floated his own outfit Jan Suraaj Party, also lambasted the BJP for ""enjoying power while using Nitish Kumar as a mask."" The former JD(U) national vice-president claimed that ""loot of public money and assuaging some estranged castes"" were the intentions behind the cabinet expansion ""with hardly six months left for polls"".Both the BJP and the JD(U), two key constituents of ruling NDA, strongly rejected opposition's charge and launched a counterattack.The Janata Dal (United) said that the RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) will get so few seats in the Bihar assembly elections that its leader Tejashwi Yadav will not even get the status of leader of opposition. JD(U) national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said the RJD rule under Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi had left Bihar in dire straits and it was Nitish Kumar who worked to improve its condition on every development metrics.The JD(U) leader alleged that the people of Bihar still ""shudder"" thinking of the ""jungle raaj"" of the RJD rule, when numerous caste massacres occurred, and people were killed in broad daylight and were abducted for ransom.Union minister and BJP MP Giriraj Singh also attacked Tejashwi Yadav and said that ""choron ko sab najar aate hain chor."" (Thieves see everyone as thieves). ""There is a proverb used in villages 'choron ko sab najar aate hain chor'. Since Lalu Yadav's government was a government of 'gangsters' and hence they see others with the same lens,"" the BJP MP said.In the 2020 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar was reduced to being the junior partner in NDA for the first time as the BJP got more seats than the JD(U). Interestingly, it was another NDA constituent, the Lok Janshakti Party of Chirag Paswan that played a key role in this change of power dynamics by strategically fielding candidates against JD(U) and ensuring division of votes. However, the BJP kept its pre-poll promise and formed a government under Nitish Kumar.But the change in number dynamics once again sowed the seeds of unease between the two long-term allies. Nitish once again jumped the NDA ship and joined hands with Lalu Prasad's RJD, only to return back to the NDA fold ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Well, Nitish Kumar, who has already made so many alliance flip-flops, can definetly decide for another switch. But the big question is will he dare to do that again? While anything is possible in politics, but with his credibility already under stake - a decision to change alliance ahead of assembly elections will be very difficult for Nitish. Another moot question is will Tejashwi be willing to take him back in Mahagathbandhan and under what conditions? In all his earlier tie-ups with RJD, Nitish was the undisputed leader and Tejashwi his deputy.The BJP has been very focussed on Bihar ahead of the year-end assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made 8 MPs from the state Union ministers after winning the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Bihar has gained the most in the last two Union budgets - getting several projects and central doles. Prime Minister Modi held a mega rally in Bhagalpur earlier this month which was literally the launch of NDA's election campaign in the state. The Prime Minister made a strong farmers' outreach from Bihar disbursing close to Rs 23,000 crore to nearly 100 million beneficiaries of Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana across the country. With so much of largesse from the Centre, it will be difficult for Nitish to think of and justify any alliance switch to the people of the state.Nitish Kumar, who has had a dominating presence in the state, is perhaps passing through the toughest phase of his political career. Rumours around his health have not helped the matters. Little wonder, Prashant Kishor, friend-turned-bitter critic of Nitish Kumar has thrown an open dare at the Bihar chief minister . ""I challenge Nitish Kumar to spell out the names of ministers in the state cabinet without looking at a piece of paper. If he thus demonstrates his mental soundness, I would give up politics and start working for him,"" Kishor said attacking the JD(U) chief.Assembly elections in the state is still many months away and it will be interesting to see how Nitish adapts to the changed ground realities.","Opposition in Bihar claims that the BJP has ""completely hijacked"" Nitish Kumar's JD(U) Nitish once again jumped the NDA ship and joined hands with Lalu Prasad's RJD, only to return to the fold ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118634232,imgsize-974938,width-400,resizemode-4/118634232.jpg"

Above-normal heatwave days likely in March: IMD

NEW DELHI: The past month was the warmest Feb in India since record keeping commenced in the country in 1901 and the upcoming hot weather season (March-May) is likely to be warmer than normal in most parts of the country with a high number of heatwave days during the period, the IMD said on Friday.Both months of 2025 so far have figured among top three warmest on record, as Jan was the third warmest since 1901. Earlier, 2024 was declared the warmest year in records dating back to 1901.Back-to-back warm winter months and the forecast of above-normal heat in March may negatively impact winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed during their maturing phase. Forecast of higher-than-normal heatwave days may threaten the output in certain states where sowing was delayed.""Above-normal heatwave days are expected over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, MP, Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and north Karnataka from March to May,"" said D S Pai, senior IMD scientist, while releasing the outlook for the hot weather season.India during February recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal. The month recorded the warmest minimum (night) temperature and the second warmest maximum (day) temperature since 1901.Among four homogeneous regions, this was the warmest-ever February in central India, the third-warmest in south India, fifth-warmest in northwest and ninth-warmest in east and northeast India.

NEW DELHI: In contrast to the general refrain that lawyers extract money from gullible clients ignorant about the legal processes, a private company successfully dodged payment of legal assistance fee to a lawyers' firm successfully by exploiting a little-known provision in Indian Partnership Act .'The Chennai Law Firm' had filed a suit against Reyvish Associates Pvt Ltd seeking recovery of over Rs 6.5 lakh legal fees due to it for legal assistance rendered to the company. A Chennai city civil court directed the company to pay up the money with 12% interest.The company challenged this order before the Chennai principal judge in the district court and argued that the law firm was an unregistered one and hence cannot file a recovery suit against any party. The principal judge accepted the argument, reversed the trial court decree and ordered that no suit could have been filed by the unregistered partnership firm of lawyers.Madras HC, refused to entertain an appeal by the law firm saying as the payment arose from a contract, the lawyers' firm could not have filed a suit because of the bar under Section 69(2) of Partnership Act, which provided that - ""No suit to enforce a right arising from a contract shall be instituted in any court by or on behalf of a firm against any third party unless the firm is registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the register of firms as partners"".In the appeal before Supreme Court bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, the law firm argued that the lawyer's fee is a statutory due and hence was recoverable through a suit.

JAMMU: Incessant rains continued to lash Jammu for the third straight day on Friday, leading to the deaths of a mother-son duo and halting traffic on the strategic Jammu-Srinagar National highway due to piles of snow, landslides, slush and boulders. The rains had caused three deaths on Thursday, taking the total to five in the past 24 hours.Early Friday, Shano Devi (50) and her son Raghu (25) died when a boulder rolled down and hit their two-wheeler in Moungari area of Udhampur district, officials said.Elsewhere, 12 workers were rescued from the flood fury. “Around 11 labourers were rescued from Ujh river in Rajbagh area of Kathua,” an official said, adding they were putting up a shed near a construction site when they were suddenly marooned in the flash floods. Police and SDRF teams rescued a truck driver trapped in floods in Niki Tawi area of Jammu.The situation on the Srinagar highway remained grim. “No fresh traffic was allowed owing to accumulation of snow between Ramsoo and Qazigund, shooting of stones, landslides and mudslides at various places between Nashri and Banihal. Traffic was suspended around 7pm Thursday, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded,” an official said.Batote-Doda road was also closed due to landslides, while Bhaderwah-Chamba road, Mughal road and Sinthan road were shut due to snow, traffic police posted on X. “Inclement weather affected helicopter services to Sanjichhat ( Vaishno Devi shrine) from Katra on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Himachal Pradesh leader of opposition Jairam Thakur hit out at the Congress government accusing it of pressuring temples under its control to contribute funds for the 'Sukh Ashray' scheme, a government welfare initiative.Taking to social media platform X, former CM Thakur claimed that 36 major temples managed by the state have been asked to provide financial assistance for running the scheme. He alleged that while the Sukhu-led government ""opposes Sanatana Dharma and makes anti-Hindu statements,"" it is now seeking temple funds to sustain its flagship program.In a video message, Thakur further alleged that district administrations were coercing temple trusts to transfer money to the government treasury. “A secretary in the Himachal Pradesh government has issued a letter to deputy commissioners, directing them to collect funds from temple trusts and deposit them in the treasury to finance government schemes. This is unprecedented and unacceptable,” he said.Thakur asserted that previous governments had only sought contributions from temples in times of natural disasters, but this move to divert funds for regular welfare programs was unprecedented. “They are not just requesting funds; they are actively following up and applying pressure. This decision must be opposed. Temple trusts and committees should resist this move,” he urged.The Sukh Ashray scheme aims to provide better opportunities for orphans, single and destitute women, and the elderly. In a letter dated January 29, the Art, Language, and Culture Department formally requested temple trusts to contribute to the Mukhya Mantri Sukh Ashray Yojna/Kosh and Mukhya Mantri Sukh Shiksha Yojna/Kosh as part of their charitable activities.Jairam Thakur vowed to strongly oppose the decision in the upcoming Vidhan Sabha session starting February 10 and beyond. “We will fight this both inside and outside the assembly,” he said, reiterating BJP’s stance against the move.Himachal Pradesh Congress chief Pratibha Singh responded to allegations by Jairam Thakur regarding the state government's request for funds from temples to finance the Sukh Ashray scheme.Singh said that the government was running the Sukh Ashray scheme to support the education of helpless children and to give them a better life. She further stated that the scheme was for a good cause.Speaking to ANI, Singh assured that the scheme's intent was noble, stating, ""Our government is running the Sukh-Aashray scheme for a good cause. This scheme was launched for the helpless children, to support their education and give them a better life...""She further said that the money was not just being used to run the finances of the temple and the government had called everyone to donate amount for the welfare of the children.""It is not only about temples.

We have to agree to work on a new strategic agenda, and I see three main avenues. First, we will work together on economic growth. The potential is immense.

We have had sincere and meaningful discussions, yesterday on various issues. We have asked our teams to work on a mutually benefit Free Trade Agreement and to realise it by the end of this year.""Von der Leyen's visit, accompanied by the entire College of Commissioners, marked a historic moment in India-EU relations. It highlighted the EU's intent to diversify its partnerships, particularly in the wake of potential tariffs from Washington and ongoing tensions with Russia and China.A key focus of the visit was the long-pending free trade agreement between the EU and India. Von der Leyen expressed her commitment to finalizing this agreement in 2025, which would significantly boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation.Additionally, discussions centered on enhancing strategic alignment, including a proposed security and defense partnership aimed at countering common threats such as cross-border terrorism and cyber-attacks.""We must take our trade and technology council to the next level... We know that growth and economic security go hand in hand, and by sourcing the product we need from the partners we trust, we avoid harmful dependencies and build stronger economies...

The party specifically told state members that unnecessary media controversies should be avoided.As the meeting came in the backdrop of a spate of controversies and speculations about the steering of the state unit, sources said there was unanimity among Kerala functionaries that concerns about the lack of leadership pertained to the top of the hierarchy, and not the lower levels. The view from a cross section of leaders has political significance in view of speculations that the state president K Sudhakaran can be replaced.However, AICC state in-charge Deepa Dasmunshi said the leadership issue was not on the meeting's agenda. She also stressed on "" collective leadership "" as the Congress brass' message. Meanwhile, it was learned that there would be no change in KPCC leadership and Sudhakaran would continue.The meeting chaired by party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and attended by Rahul Gandhi, PCC chief Sudhakaran, LoP V Satheesan, K C Venugopal, and senior netas and MPs including Ramesh Chennithala, K Suresh, P J Kurien, Priyanka Gandhi, Shashi Tharoor, Hibi Eden, Jebi Mather, Dean Kuriakose, among others.Dasmunshi, quoting Rahul Gandhi, said he spoke about the connect between Keralites and Congress, and warned party biggies not to do anything that ""disrespects"" people.

DEHRADUN: The area near Mana village in Uttarakhand, where an avalanche struck the BRO workers' camp on Friday, burying at least 57 men - of which 22 are still missing - is considered one of the most avalanche-prone and high-risk zones in the state.Friday's avalanche hit a stretch of the national highway linking Mana to Ghastoli, a region classified as a high-risk avalanche zone. In fact, this is not the first time that Indian Army and BRO camps were hit by an avalanche in this region. In April 2021, a glacial burst-triggered avalanche struck Malari-Sumna area in Chamoli district, near the India-China border, killing at least 10 people. The victims were BRO workers engaged in construction activities.According to officials of the State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA), several avalanches were recorded in recent years across the state's higher reaches, including Gaumukh Glacier, Hemkund Sahib, Ghastoli, and the Kalindi-Badrinath track.According to USDMA, avalanches are common in the Himalayan region with altitudes over 3,500 metres and where the slope is generally more than 30 degrees. North-facing slopes are known to have avalanches in winter, whereas south-facing slopes usually get them during the springtime.Commenting on the avalanche risk in Uttarakhand, Piyoosh Rautela, former executive director of USDMA, said, ""Just like landslide-prone zones, avalanche-prone areas can also be mapped. Once identified, no camps or settlements should be established in these high-risk zones."" He further added, ""In most avalanche incidents, it is either tourists or workers operating in these regions who usually become the victims since almost all the inhabited villages in these high-altitude regions are migratory, with residents relocating to lower areas during winter.""","Avalanches are common in the Himalayan region with altitudes over 3,500 metres.

NEW DELHI: GNSS-based tolling on NHs won’t take off in the immediate future as senior government officials have told a Parliamentary panel that the new system will be deployed only after India has its own requisite constellation of navigational satellites with full coverage.Sources said that in response to a question on the new tolling mechanism, a top road transport ministry official told the parliamentary standing committee on transport and tourism headed by JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha on Thursday India’s own fully functional satellite navigation system and technology are necessary to protect the privacy of citizens and ensure security of data. The official added that government won’t use any foreign navigational system for this purpose.This comes even as road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has been maintaining that government would soon start the new toll collection system to do away with physical toll barriers and to bring relief to highway commuters. He has also said that the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) will ensure people pay for the exact distance travelled on a highway.GNSS is a network of satellites that provides positioning, navigation, and timing services. Though India has Navigation with India Constellation (NavIC) system, there have been issues. Unlike GPS or Galileo, NavIC is a regional navigation system, meaning its coverage is restricted to India and nearby regions.Sources told TOI that officials referred to the crashing of a plane last year for several reasons, including GNSS disruptions. They added that govt wants to ensure that the new tolling system uses India’s own navigation system.Meanwhile, the recommendation of a high-powered committee set up by the road transport and highways ministry on the roll out of GNSS-based tolling is awaited for preparing the roadmap.At present, the NHAI has started inviting tenders for the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) mechanism for toll collection. In MLFF tolling, there is no physical plaza as well. The tolling system consists of field equipment and sensors mounted on gantries, which capture information from passing vehicles. This data is transmitted to the electronic toll payment system for deduction of user fee from FASTag.",Senior government officials have told a Parliamentary panel that the new system will be deployed only after India has its own requisite constellation of navigational satellites with full coverage.

Sanjay Bhandari wins appeal against extradition to India over risk of mistreatment at Tihar jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanjay-bhandari-wins-appeal-against-extradition-to-india-over-risk-of-mistreatment-at-tihar-jail/articleshow/118637201.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

LONDON: Defence middleman Sanjay Bhandari has won his appeal against extradition to India from London on the grounds that he would be at real risk of extortion, torture or violence in Tihar jail and at risk of a flagrant denial of justice at trial.Bhandari had appealed the Nov 7, 2022 decision of district judge Snow at Westminster magistrates’ court to allow his extradition to India on six grounds. A hearing took place in Dec 2024, and on Friday high court judges Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Steyn handed down judgment allowing his appeal on two of those grounds, namely that his extradition would be a breach of article 3 (torture or inhuman treatment) and a breach of article 6 (the right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), making it unlawful. They discharged him.The Indian govt has 14 days in which it can apply to get a point of law of general public importance certified by the high court and then apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. But this is rarely granted.Delhi was seeking to extradite Bhandari to face two charges: wilfully evading taxes by not declaring foreign assets and foreign income amounting to Rs 665 crore on his Indian tax return and money laundering.His undisclosed foreign assets include 19 foreign bank accounts, six companies and four properties in London and Dubai, the charges state.The judges dismissed an assurance from the Indian govt that Bhandari would only be interrogated in Tihar jail, saying that Bhandari would “ be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials. The nature of the allegations against him, and the publicity in relation to them in India, are such that he would be perceived to be a very rich man and therefore a prime target for extortion. In view of the extreme overcrowding and very significant level of understaffing in Tihar prison, it would be very difficult for even the most conscientious of prison officials to protect him from extortion and mistreatment at the hands of other prisoners, including gang members. Add to that the compelling evidence that incidents of prison officials, including senior officials, taking bribes, engaging in, and facilitating, extortion, occur all too commonly, it is clear that he would face a real risk of proscribed treatment.”They pointed out that Tillu Tajpuriya was murdered by other prisoners in Tihar jail on May 2, 2023, and Ankit Gujjar was killed on the night of August 3-4, 2021 allegedly by top jail officials.“The evidence is that the use of proscribed treatment to obtain confessions is commonplace and endemic,” the judges wrote. They blamed this on the “lack of will to stamp out the use of torture, reflected in the failure to ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.”They also cited torture allegations made by British citizens Jagtar Singh Johal and Christian Michel. “It is apparent that the acceptance in India of torture or other serious mistreatment as a method of evidence-gathering extends beyond the police and investigating bodies, such that it is unlikely that Bhandari could look to prison officials for protection from the organisations that are engaged in investigating him,” they said.Because Bhandari would have to prove the attempt to evade tax was not wilful, rather than prosecuting authorities having to prove it was wilful, they said this was a flagrant denial of his rights under article 6, as it “fundamentally destroys the fairness of the prospective trial”.","Defence middleman Sanjay Bhandari has won his appeal against extradition to India from London.

However, he was quickly administered oxygen and responded well to treatment, according to AFP report.The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been receiving treatment at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital for the past two weeks, experienced a bronchospasm episode that led to a sudden respiratory decline.""The Holy Father promptly underwent broncho-aspiration and began non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with a good response on gas exchange,"" the Vatican said in a statement.Despite the setback, Francis remained alert and cooperative throughout the ordeal, and doctors are closely monitoring his condition over the next 24 to 48 hours to assess any further deterioration, a Vatican source said.Pope’s condition remains serious but stableEarlier on Friday, Vatican insiders had suggested that Francis' condition was no longer critical, following gradual improvements. However, his medical team remains cautious, keeping his health status “reserved”, meaning no predictions can be made about his recovery.The pontiff, who had part of his lung removed as a young man, is prone to respiratory infections and has battled chronic bronchitis in recent years. His age and pre-existing respiratory condition mean that full recovery could take time, doctors warn.Despite his health struggles, Francis continues to work from his hospital suite, engaging in breathing exercises, resting, and praying.Resignation speculation growsThis fourth hospitalisation in his 12-year papacy—the longest so far—has reignited speculation about whether Francis might step down. With his packed schedule leading up to the Jubilee year celebrations, Vatican expert Marco Politi suggested that if the pope recovers, he may complete the Jubilee year but could then reconsider his position.Francis has previously stated that he is open to resigning, following in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 due to health concerns. However, before his hospitalization, he repeatedly affirmed that he was not yet ready to retire—and may never be.For now, the focus remains on the pope’s recovery, as the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics await further updates on his health.","Pope Francis, currently hospitalised with pneumonia, suffered a breathing crisis on Friday, causing him to vomit.

After years of negotiations for an India-EU free trade agreement (FTA), PM Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen finally set a deadline - end of this year - for a balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement, in a significant takeaway from the EU leader’s visit.Describing India-EU partnership as natural and organic - one that’s based on trust and shared democratic values - Modi announced both leaders asked their teams to finalise by the year end what would be, according to von der Leyen, the largest deal of its kind in the world. The leaders asked the officials to work as trusted partners to enhance market access and remove trade barriers, according to a joint statement.India and the EU will hold the 10th round of FTA negotiations in March since the talks were relaunched in 2021. Agreeing that meeting the deadline won’t be easy, von der Leyen said timing and determination matters. EU officials reiterated after the meeting that they will continue to seek reduction of tariffs by India on wines and cars, without which the agreement won’t be possible, but said that commitment matters at the political level.Modi also said that to strengthen the investment framework, the leaders discussed progress on the ongoing discussions for an Investment Protection and GI (Geographical Indications) Agreement this year. They agreed to take concrete steps to carry forward the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor initiative, with Modi saying it will drive global commerce, sustainable growth and prosperity in the future.While there was talk about enhancing cooperation in AI, semiconductors and space, both leaders also focused on peace and security in the Indo-Pacific, agreeing to work for inclusive development in third countries in the region. In a joint statement, they reaffirmed their commitment to promote a free, open, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific built on international law and mutual respect for sovereignty. Modi welcomed the EU joining the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).In her media statement, the president also said that her visit was taking place at a time the 7 planets in the solar system had come into perfect alignment. “They say this signals transformation and growth. The planets are aligned – and so are Europe and India,’’ she said.The joint statement said that the leaders expressed satisfaction at growing cooperation in the defence and security domain, including joint exercises and collaboration between Indian Navy and EU Maritime security entities. The EU side also welcomed India’s interest in joining projects under the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and in negotiating a Security of Information Agreement (SoIA). Citing threats from authoritarian states, von der Leyen said that now is the time to step up security and defence cooperation on land, at sea and in space and have more joint exercises in the Indian Ocean.The leaders also committed to exploring a formal security and defence partnership. “They reiterated their commitment to international peace and security, including maritime security by tackling traditional and non-traditional threats to safeguard trade & sea lanes of communication,’’ said the statement.Modi said that the leaders have prepared a blueprint for collaboration in the areas of trade, technology, investment, innovation, green growth, security, skilling and mobility.“Our growing cooperation on issues related to Defence and Security, is a symbol of our mutual trust. We will take forward our cooperation on Cyber Security, Maritime Security and Counter Terrorism,’’ said the PM, adding a bold and ambitious roadmap will be launched at the India-EU summit later this year. The leader stressed in the joint statement the need for stronger international cooperation to combat terrorism, including cross-border terrorism and terrorism financing in a comprehensive and sustained manner.","PM Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen finally set a deadline - end of this year - for a balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement.

February this year was warmest since record keeping commenced in 1901: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/february-this-year-was-warmest-since-record-keeping-commenced-in-1901-imd/articleshow/118633962.cms,"February 2025 experienced the highest temperatures since 1901, with IMD predicting March to May will also be unusually warm, impacting crops in India. Most regions anticipate above-normal heatwave days, posing risks to vulnerable populations, especially the elderly and children.

NEW DELHI: This year's February was the warmest February in India since record keeping commenced in the country in 1901 and the upcoming hot weather season during March-May in most parts of the country is likely to be warmer with reporting of more number of heatwave days during the period, the IMD said on Friday.It was the second consecutive month of the year that figured among the top three in record terms as Jan 2025 was the third warmest Jan since 1901.Back-to-back warmer months and the prediction of above-normal temperature in March may negatively impact winter-sown crops such as wheat and rapeseed during their maturing phase. Forecast of more heatwave days may threaten the output in certain states where sowing was delayed.“Above-normal heatwave days are expected over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and northern parts of Karnataka during March to May,” said D S Pai, a senior scientist at IMD, while releasing the temperature/ rainfall outlook for hot weather season.India during Feb recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal. The month recorded the warmest minimum (night) temperature and the second warmest maximum (day) temperature since 1901.Among four homogeneous regions, Feb 2025 was the warmest Feb in central India as well whereas it was third warmest Feb in south peninsular India, fifth warmest in northwest and ninth warmest in east & northeast India. Mean temperature in central India was 24.6 degree C whereas it was 26.75 degree C in peninsular India, 20.14 degree C in east & northeast India and 17.11 degree C during the month in northwest India.March is going to be warmer too with most parts of the country expecting above-normal temperatures both during the day and night. “Monthly maximum (day) temperatures for March are likely to be above normal over most parts of India, except over some southernmost parts of peninsular India, where below normal maximum temperatures are likely,” said Pai.During March, above-normal heatwave days are likely over most parts of central India and adjoining northern parts of south peninsula and some areas of northwest and east India.Heatwaves pose significant risks to vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, leading to heatstroke, dehydration, and strain on infrastructure.","India during Feb recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal.

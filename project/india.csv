BJP linked Gandhi’s remarks to ‘

George Soros

playbook’

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , has been summoned by the district judge court of Sambhal in connection with a complaint filed over his controversial remarks stating that the Congress party ’s fight was not only against the BJP and RSS but also against the Indian State itself.Issuing the notice on Thursday, the court has directed him to either appear or submit a response on April 4.According to the news agency ANI, Advocate Sachin Goyal confirmed that the court accepted the complaint and issued the notice to Gandhi.""Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had made a statement on 15 January 2025 that 'We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS and the Indian State itself'. Simran Gupta had filed a case in the special MP/MLA court to register an FIR against Rahul Gandhi. The CJM had quashed it on the grounds of jurisdiction,"" Advocate Goyal said.The complaint was initially dismissed by the CJM court on jurisdictional grounds, but a revision petition led the district judge court to intervene and summon the Congress leader.The controversy was triggered by a speech Gandhi delivered on January 15, 2025, during the inauguration of the Congress’s new headquarters, Indira Bhawan, in Delhi.In his speech, he alleged that the BJP and RSS had “captured every single institution” of the country and that opposition parties were now fighting the Indian State itself.""Our ideology, like the RSS ideology, is thousands of years old, and it has been fighting the RSS ideology for thousands of years. Do not think that we are fighting a fair fight. There is no fairness in this. If you believe that we are fighting a political organisation called the BJP or RSS, you have not understood what is going on. The BJP and the RSS have captured every single institution of our country. We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS and the Indian State itself,"" he saidApart from the Sambhal court case, Gandhi is also facing legal trouble in Guwahati, where an FIR was filed under Sections 152 and 197(1)d of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The charges include acts endangering the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India, which are considered cognizable and non-bailable offences.The FIR also accused him of inciting unrest and separatist sentiments.“Unable to gain public trust through democratic means, the accused now seeks to foster discontent against the government and the Indian State,” the complaint stated. It also accused Gandhi of trying to exploit his political platform to spread falsehoods and instigate rebellion.Rahul’s remarks also ignited a sharp political backlash from the BJP, with senior leaders accusing him of acting against India’s interests.BJP National President JP Nadda claimed that Rahul’s statements aligned with the agenda of US-based billionaire George Soros, who has been accused by Indian politicians of funding anti-government narratives.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya also accused the Congress leader of declaring an “open war against the Indian State itself”, while finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman questioned how Gandhi could make such remarks while holding the Constitution in his hands during public events.During the same speech at Indira Bhawan, Rahul also raised concerns over alleged irregularities in Maharashtra elections , particularly regarding a sudden rise of one crore voters between the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls.“We are uncomfortable with the way the Election Commission operates. Why would the Election Commission refuse to make the voters’ list transparent?” Gandhi questioned. He accused the poll body of withholding critical electoral data, which, he argued, was necessary for transparency.Additionally, Gandhi attacked RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat , who had recently stated that India attained “true independence” only after the construction of the Ram Temple. Rahul labelled Bhagwat’s comments as “treason” and an insult to India’s independence movement.","Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, has been summoned by the district judge court of Sambhal.

LUCKNOW: Abhishek Prakash , CEO of Invest UP and former district magistrate of Lucknow, was suspended Thursday following charges of irregularities in the evaluation process for a proposed solar manufacturing project in the state. Also, the city police Thursday arrested a middleman on the charge of demanding a bribe for the approval of the solar project, at the behest of a senior official of Invest UP.The charges against Prakash, a 2006-batch IAS officer, were investigated and have been, prima facie, found to be true, a govt press release said. The inquiry concluded that his conduct could hinder objectives of the UP Industrial Investment and Employment Promotion Policy 2022, damaging investor confidence and tarnishing the state’s image as an investment-friendly destination, the press release added.Sources in the govt said the chief minister’s office (CMO) directed aprobe into the case after receiving a complaint. In the complaint, Vishwajit Datta of SAEL Solar P6 Pvt Ltd wrote to the CMO on March 20 stating that his firm wanted to set up a manufacturing unit for solar cells and solar powerrelated parts in UP. He further stated that officials at Invest UP demanded 5% of the project cost to clear the proposal, which he refused to pay.The complainant said their application was submitted to both Invest UP and online. However, before the application was presented to the evaluation committee, a “senior official in Invest UP” gave him the number of one Nikant Jain and told him if Jain recommended his project, it would be cleared immediately by the evaluation panel and state cabinet. Jain then made a demand of 5% of the project cost as commission and asked for the amount in cash in advance, a demand Datta said he rejected. Though the project went on to receive approval by the evaluation committee, it was not finally cleared. Datta stated in his complaint that Jain again told him that only he could help get this project cleared. Police arrested Jain Thursday.","Abhishek Prakash, CEO of Invest UP and former district magistrate of Lucknow, was suspended Thursday following charges of irregularities in the evaluation process.

Premeditated crime

Muskan Rastogi , accused of murdering and dismembering her husband, Saurabh Rajput, spent her first night in Chaudhary Charan Singh district jail in extreme distress, as per reports. She was placed in the women’s barrack while her lover and co-accused, Sahil Shukla, was lodged separately in the men’s section.According to senior jail superintendent Viresh Raj Sharma, Muskan remained completely silent upon arrival and refused to eat. Jail sources told news agency PTI that Muskan cried throughout the night. Both accused had reportedly requested to be housed in adjacent barracks, but their request was denied.Also read: How Muskan lured lover Sahil to murder ex-merchant navy officer Saurabh Rajput ""Muskan remained silent and did not interact with anyone. She also did not eat the provided food,"" Sharma said.Earlier on Wednesday, Muskan and Sahil were presented in the court of the chief judicial magistrate and remanded to 14-day judicial custody. Their court appearance turned chaotic when a group of enraged lawyers physically assaulted them outside the courtroom. Sahil's clothes were torn in the scuffle before police managed to intervene and escort them to safety.The dismembered body of Saurabh Rajput, which was found encased in cement inside a blue drum, was cremated late Wednesday evening after undergoing a post-mortem examination.Investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil had a long-standing relationship, having reconnected in 2019 through a WhatsApp group of former schoolmates. Muskan, who married Saurabh in 2016, allegedly saw him as an obstacle to her future with Sahil, leading to the murder plot.Also read: Drugged, beheaded, tricked with fake snapchats; how Muskan, his lover killed ex-merchant navy officer Saurabh, a former Merchant Navy officer, returned from London on February 24 to celebrate Muskan’s birthday, unaware of the gruesome fate awaiting him.

The couple then stabbed him to death before dismembering his body in an attempt to dispose of the evidence.They initially planned to discard the body parts in different locations but later opted to seal them inside a plastic drum filled with cement and sand. Before executing their plan, Muskan ensured her six-year-old daughter was sent to her grandmother’s house.After the murder, the couple travelled to Himachal Pradesh, attempting to evade suspicion. However, upon their return to Meerut on March 17, Saurabh’s family lodged a missing person complaint, leading to police action. Investigators uncovered inconsistencies in Muskan’s statements, and during interrogation, she and Sahil confessed to the crime. The blue drum containing Saurabh’s remains was subsequently recovered from their residence.Muskan’s parents expressed deep remorse over their daughter’s actions. Her father, Pramod Rastogi, insisted that she and Sahil deserved the death penalty. “Muskan has lost the right to live. Such a person does not deserve to walk the earth,” he said.","Muskan Rastogi, accused of murdering and dismembering her husband, spent her first night in Chaudhary Charan Singh district jail in extreme distress.

'Uddhav govt suppressed the case'

Opposition question timing



'Attempt to defame'

Salian's lawyer defends plea timing

NEW DELHI: A fresh plea in Disha Salian's death, filed by her father Satish Salian in the Bombay high court, has resurrected the political storm in Maharashtra as the new petition sought action against ex-minister Aaditya Thackeray Salian's father knocked on the doors of the high court alleging a cover-up by the Mumbai Police in the probe of Disha's death case, which was closely followed by the alleged suicide of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput for whom she worked as a manager.Satish Salian has expressed apprehension that Mumbai cops concluded Disha’s death as a case of suicide or accidental death without thoroughly considering forensic evidence, circumstantial proof, and eyewitness testimonies.The Salian family claimed the probe, which they initially suspected to be genuine, was a cover-up.In the petition, Disha's family has urged the high court to direct the registration of an FIR against Aaditya Thackeray and to transfer the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The Salian family's new legal recourse has blown up into a political hullabaloo, with the BJP leaders seeking action against Thackery and the Shiv Sena (UBT) netas dismissing the political rivals' remarks as a ""distraction"" and an ""attempt"" to malign Aaditya's image.BJP MLA Ameet Satam accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) government of ""suppressing"" the Disha Salian's death case.''Salian's father has told the media that he suspects his daughter was gang-raped and murdered. He has filed a petition in the court. The previous MVA government suppressed the case. The then Mayor met him (Satish Salian), misled him, and pressurised him not to speak. He has said a minister in the previous MVA regime was involved. This is a serious allegation,'' Satam said according to the news agency PTI.""Powerful people and those born with silver spoons in their mouths should not be let off,'' Satam said, without naming anyone and demanded that ""those named should be arrested for custodial interrogation"".Building on Satam's charges, minister Nitesh Rane said that as per a Supreme Court judgement, a person against whom such allegations are made should be arrested immediately, and demanded to know whether ""the former minister"" will be arrested.Thackeray family's loyalist Sanjay Raut questioned the timing of the petition, saying the ""discussion is being created around that petition"" to douse off the Aurangzeb issue.""I don't know what is in the petition. But the time chosen for the petition is when the atmosphere in Maharashtra is heated over Aurangzeb. Some power is working behind the petitioner. All powers are behind them. Discussion is being created around that petition, leaving aside the Aurangzeb issue. There is no need to name the people who are behind this,"" Raut told ANI.Congress leader Bhai Jagtap also questioned the timing of the petition, however, he said it is the right of Disha's father to approach the court.""I don't know much. It is his right, he (Disha Salian's father) can go (to court) anytime. But my question is that if you feel that injustice has been done to you, if you feel that your case has not been presented properly, then there was an opportunity to appeal at that time; why did you not go at that time?"" Jagtap told ANI.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP-SCP) leader Rohit Pawar also attacked the BJP, accusing the party of politicising late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death for elections and claimed that the party would do politics over Disha Salian after her father sought a probe into her death.Interestingly, Shiv Sena, which was part of Uddhav Sena before Eknath Shinde orchestrated a vertical split in 2022, appeared divided on the issue.While Shiv Sena legislators on Thursday staged a silent protest in the Vidhan Bhavan demanding a CBI probe into the Disha Salian death, the party MLA Sanjay Gaikwad urged political parties to refrain from 'politicising' the matter, asserting that reports on the case indicate the absence of any political angle.""The CID report shows that there isn't a political angle in this case. The police do not have solid proof of murder or rape in this case. I request all political parties not to indulge in such dirty politics,"" Gaikwad said.Aaditya Thackeray said on Thursday that there has been a continuous attempt to defame him for the last five years. Echoing Sanjay Raut's claim, Aaditya Thackeray said the matter was intentionally raked up to divert the attention of the people from critical issues, especially after the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) said that Aurangzeb's tomb is a not a relevant matter.""Where is Maharashtra being taken in terms of crimes? Women atrocities, farmer suicides, farmers distress, the situation of Maharashtra is getting worse. ""We have exposed the government on this and also on the Aurangzeb issue. A Minister had to resign (Dhananjay Munde resigned in connection with the Beed Sarpanch murder),"" Thackeray said.Advocate Nilesh C Ojha, representing Satish Salian, on Thursday made serious allegations against Aaditya Thackeray, referring to him as an ""accused"" in Disha's case. Ojha claimed that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh was unwilling to take action against Thackeray. He also alleged that ""corrupt"" police officials attempted to cover up the case.""During the murder, Uddhav Thackeray's government was there (in Maharashtra), and the accused was his son Aaditya Thackeray. The corrupt police officials tried to cover up the case. After 2.5 years, Shinde's government came, and Fadnavis was the Home Minister. This matter has not come all of a sudden,"" Ojha told ANI.Ojha also clarified that the matter was not being raised ""suddenly"" and that the Shinde government had formed a State Investigation Team (SIT) in December 2023. A written complaint submitted in January 2024 also asked for an FIR to be registered.""In September 2023, we filed a PIL, which also raised the issue of registering an FIR and taking action. The state government formed an SIT in December 2023. A written complaint was also submitted on January 12, 2024, which asked for an FIR to be registered for gang rape and murder against Aaditya Thackeray, Sooraj Pancholi and others,"" he said. As this happened, Ojha said that Disha's father approached him to file the petition.","A fresh plea in Disha Salian's death, filed by her father Satish Salian in the Bombay high court, has resurrected the political storm in Maharashtra. The new petition sought action against ex-minister Aaditya Thackeray Salian.

""I feel that there are some loopholes in the police probe. There could be more suspects. All suspects must be arrested,"" he asserted. Expressing disbelief over the circumstances of the crime, he added, ""I can’t believe uncle went all the way there (the accused wife’s workplace). He was also well-built physically, so I don’t feel just two people could do this.""According to Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP South) Digant Anand, the crime was committed in a fit of rage when Dhannalal confronted his wife and her lover at Deendayal’s shop, where she worked.

When the chief secretary tried to stop him, the chief minister ignored his intervention and continued with his conversation nudging the officer on his shoulders again and again.

His repeated speeches and actions in the House clearly show he is not normal.

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday conducted extensive searches on Open Society Foundations (OSF), promoted by US billionaire currency speculator and hedge fund operator George Soros who has been accused by BJP of acting against India’s interests.The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.Sources said Open Society Institute, US, has been put under prior reference category (PRC) by the home mini stry since 2016 due to allegedly undesirable activities. So, OSI is required to secure prior sanction from the ministry to send funds to FCRA-registered organisations in India.Sources said investigation found Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF), OSI’s social impact investment arm, provided funds to 3 Indian companies — Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd (RSPL), Rootbridge Academy Pvt Ltd (RAPL), and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt Ltd (ASAR). These companies received approximately Rs 25 crore from SEDF between 2020-21 and 2023-24.SEDF funds to RSPL were through compulsorily convertible preference shares. However, since SEDF could not make foreign donations directly to Indian NGOs without MHA approval, the George Soros-funded entity explored alternative options to bypass PRC restrictions. FDI in RSPL is suspected to be a colourable arrangement violating FDI norms, officials said.“RAPL, incorporated in 2019, received Rs 2.7 crore from SEDF as commission agent services without rendering any services. This suggests RAPL acted as an agent for SEDF to bypass FCRA provisions for funding NGOs in India,” a source said.ASAR, incorporated in 2016, received Rs 2.9 crore from SEDF as ‘service fees’. The investigators, however, are not convinced and suspect the funds to be donations in disguise, meant for NGOs in lieu of services which were, in fact, never rendered to SEDF.OSI group also set up an investment company, Aspada Investment Company (AIC), in Mauritius to channelise funding to India.Aspada Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd was established in Bengaluru to manage SEDF’s investments in India. However, the body, now Lightrock Investment Advisors Private Limited, was not in the loop about Rs 300 crore SEDF provided to 12 NGOs.ED action coincides with the heat Soros has been facing back home in the US after the election of Donald Trump as President.

What is Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act?

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday for allegedly using the IT Act to block content on the micro-blogging site. The case has been filed in the Karnataka high court.In the plea, the X has challenged what it called unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship.It raised concerns over the Centre's interpretation of the Information Technology (IT) Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which X argues violates Supreme Court rulings and undermines free expression online, according to the news agency PTI.The lawsuit alleged the government is using the said section to create a parallel content-blocking mechanism, bypassing the structured legal process outlined in Section 69A.Section 69A of the IT Act allows the government to order content removal for national security, public order, or sovereignty concerns, giving companies a clear legal basis to act. In contrast, Section 79(3)(b), companies argue, is vague, forcing platforms to decide what content is illegal, exposing them to lawsuits or backlash.Companies often use Section 69A as a defense, arguing they should only be liable if the government explicitly orders content removal, rather than guessing what is illegal. This shifts responsibility to the government, protecting platforms from legal risks and accusations of bias while ensuring compliance with official directives.X further claimed the government's current approach contradicts the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in the Shreya Singhal case, which established that content can only be blocked through a proper judicial process or the legally defined route under Section 69A.Social media companies complain about Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act because it creates legal uncertainty, forcing them to remove content even when it's unclear if it's illegal. The social media platforms allege that the vague definition of ""knowledge"" of illegal content makes them fear lawsuits, leading to over-censorship and suppression of free speech. The law also places a huge burden on platforms to police billions of posts daily, which is technically challenging.Social media platforms have also legally challenged the government's Sahyog portal, a system developed by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs to manage takedown requests under Section 79(3)(b) and enable direct coordination between social media companies and law enforcement agencies.X has refused to assign an employee to the platform, arguing that it serves as a ""censorship tool"" that pressures companies to take down content without proper legal scrutiny. The lawsuit claims this is yet another government attempt to regulate online discourse without judicial oversight.",Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: The brutal murder of Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput has sent shockwaves through Meerut, with his grieving family demanding the death penalty for his wife, Muskan Rastogi , and her alleged lover, Sahil Shukla. Saurabh’s mother, Renu Devi, accused Muskan of killing her husband, locking his body in a room, and then going on a trip as if nothing had happened.Saurabh had been missing since March 4. The horrific crime was exposed when laborers hired to move a heavy drum from the couple’s rented house struggled with its weight. When one of them questioned Muskan about its contents, she casually said it was ""house junk."" However, as they attempted to shift it, the lid accidentally opened, releasing a foul smell. Suspecting something sinister, the laborers immediately informed the police.According to Saurabh’s mother, even their young daughter might have been aware of the crime. “Neighbors told us that she (their daughter) was saying, ‘Papa has been kept in the drum.’ She might have seen something, or else why would a child say such a thing?” Renu Devi said.Police investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil allegedly stabbed Saurabh to death, chopped up his body, and sealed the remains in a drum filled with cement to hide the crime. Muskan’s landlord had reportedly asked the couple to vacate the rented house, which is when she and Sahil attempted to shift the body.After the body was discovered, Muskan fled to her mother’s house, allegedly to inform them of what had happened. However, Saurabh’s mother claims Muskan’s family already knew about the murder. “She (Muskan) reached her mother’s house, and her mother met a lawyer before they went to court. They were trying to cover things up, but the police caught them,” Renu Devi said.Police arrested Muskan and Sahil on Tuesday and presented them before the court on Wednesday. They have been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.Meanwhile, Saurabh’s family is devastated, claiming he sacrificed everything for Muskan, only to be betrayed in the most gruesome manner. “Saurabh left his job and family for Muskan, but she took his life,” his parents said.Renu Devi recalled how Saurabh had distanced himself from his family after marrying Muskan. “I tolerated everything for the happiness of my son and daughter-in-law. Now, she has killed my son.”The grieving mother, overwhelmed with grief, demanded strict punishment. “They all (Muskan’s family) should be hanged along with that boy (Sahil),” she said.Meanwhile, Muskan’s own parents have disowned her, expressing deep remorse over her actions. “It would have been better if she was never born,” her mother, Kavita Rastogi, told reporters.Her father, Pramod Rastogi, called for the harshest punishment. “Muskan has lost the right to live.

How flights will move from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai Airport & options for demolishing CSMIA T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-flights-will-move-from-mumbai-to-navi-mumbai-airport-options-for-demolishing-csmia-t1/articleshow/119169626.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from Mumbai’s Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) when the latter gets operational later this summer. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.The Adani Group is also weighing options for the demolition of T1 — whether to bring down the entire structure in one go this winter or do it piecemeal. T1 comprises of T1A, B and C buildings which were built over last 50 years with 1B being constructed in 1965; 1A in 1992 and 1C in 2010.“We are in talks with all airlines. As far as Indian carriers are concerned, the plan is to shift equal percentage of flights by them from CSMIA to NMIA. Foreign airlines with few flights will not like to split operations and will continue to operate from one hub only in Mumbai MMR. Some foreign airlines want to move fully to NMIA,” said people in the know. Air India has about 140 daily flights to and from CSMIA; Akasa 57 and AI Express about 15. IndiGo, the biggest Indian carrier in market share terms, did not give this figure.“We are weighing the option of either starting NMIA operations with domestic flights. In that case, domestic flights will be shifted first. Or we could start both domestic and international simultaneously, in which case both will be shifted,” said sources.The rate of shifting flights will also depend on how fast T2 capacity grows from 4 crore passengers annually (CPA) to 4.5 CPA and whether T1 goes down in one go or in phases — basically the capacity of CSMIA. “The existing T1 handles 1.5 CPA. T1 demolition will start 4-5 months after NMIA gets operational, which means by this Nov or Dec. We hope to increase T2 capacity by mid 2026. These decisions will be taken shortly,” they said.Airlines also want clarity on these issues. The reason: They are selling tickets for flights, some of which will get shifted. “Once we inform passengers that their flight, for say July/Aug, has been moved to NMIA, we don’t know whether it suits them or not. To minimise this, we need clarity at the earliest. We don’t have same issues with whenever Noida Airport opens as we are not selling tickets for there yet,” said a senior airline official.Meanwhile, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) is also in talks with aviation authorities to lift the cap on hourly flight movements. This was done to ease the severe congestion seen perennially at CSMIA. The aviation ministry had two years back directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during ""high intensity runway operations” (HIRO) periods from 8-11 am and 5-8 pm and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during non-HIRO period.“We are confident of handling more flights without affecting time performance, at least from our side as an airport. MIAL has been in talks with authorities to lift that cap. We are in process of increasing CSMIA runway capacity. Gatwick, the world’s busiest single runway airport handles 54-55 flights an hour,” sources added.",Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted to Navi Mumbai International Airport. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.

Philippines calls for India to join 'squad' alliance to counter China in Indo-Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-calls-for-india-to-join-squad-alliance-to-counter-china-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/119231037.cms,"Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr with armed forces chief Gen Romeo Brawner Jr

NEW DELHI: Bearing the brunt of China’s aggressive expansionist tactics in the South China Sea , the Philippines now wants India to join the relatively new `Squad’ strategic alliance it has forged with the US, Australia and Japan to counter such threats in the crucial Indo-Pacific region .Pointing to China’s “illegal, coercive and disruptive Grey Zone” tactics to claim territory and build militarised artificial islands in the South China Sea region, Philippines chief of staff of armed forces General Romeo S Brawner said countries like India and South Korea should also be `included’ in the Squad.China was clearly the big dragon in the room when top military officers of the `Quad’ (India, US, Australia and Japan) and the Philippines got together to discuss maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific during the Raisina Dialogue here on Wednesday.“The three artificial islands created by China give it effective control over the South China Sea. They have built a 2.7-km runway, with air defence and other missile systems, on Mischief Reef…Moving forward, it is our belief that they will take full control of the South China Sea,” Gen Brawner said.China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms. Japan, on its part, is doubling its defence spending to improve its current war-fighting capabilities and prepare for the future, said Japanese chief of joint staff Gen Yoshihide Yoshida.US Indo-Pacific Command chief Admiral Samuel Paparo, who also dwelt upon the prospect of China forcibly intervening in Taiwan, in turn, said all countries that believe matters should not be “settled by force” should build and maintain a strong deterrence posture.China, with the world’s largest Navy of 370 warships and submarines, now of course also deploys seven to eight naval vessels on a permanent basis in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), including dual-purpose research or spy ships to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India believed it was its responsibility to ensure IOR remains peaceful and stable, with unhindered passage of trade. “A Navy that does not deploy does not deter. So, we have been deploying far and wide…We are quite capable of maintaining MDA (maritime domain awareness) in the IOR. We are aware of who is doing what, where and how,” he said.India is “keeping a close watch” on dual-purpose and other naval vessels operating in the IOR, sharing intelligence, building bilateral, trilateral and multilateral partnerships, and helping island nations build capacity, Admiral Tripathi added.Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, sitting in the audience, asked whether the new Trump administration can be trusted to remain steadfast about its partners in the Indo-Pacific. The consensus, by and large, was that while the US may rollback from Europe, the Indo-Pacific would remain on the top of Trump’s radar screen.“We foresee an increase in support to the Indo-Pacific,” Gen Brawner said. Admiral Paparo added that the Trump administration had reiterated its commitment to the Indo-Pacific and its partners there. One of the first meetings of the new administration was of the foreign ministers of the Quad, he added.","China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms.

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on Thursday played cricket at Mumbai's iconic Wankhede Stadium with Kiwi spinner Ajaz Patel, former batter Ross Taylor, and pacer Trent Boult.During his visit, Luxon reflected on the long-standing cricketing ties between India and New Zealand, which have resulted in some of the sport's most historic moments.Luxon took to Instagram, sharing pictures from his visit to the stadium where New Zealand players Boult, Mitchell Santner, and Bevon Jacobs are preparing for the Mumbai Indians’ (MI) Indian Premier League (IPL) campaign opener against arch-rivals Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at Chepauk Stadium in Chennai on March 23.In his post, Luxon reminisced about Ajaz Patel’s remarkable achievement of becoming only the third bowler in Test cricket history to take all ten wickets in a single inning during a match against India at Wankhede in 2021. He humorously added that despite Patel’s historic feat, he himself was not dismissed by the spinner.""Nothing unites New Zealand and India more than our shared love of cricket. Right here at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, Ajaz Patel took the third-best figures in the history of Test cricket. Just for the record, he didn’t get me out,"" Luxon wrote in his Instagram post.Additionally, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president, Ajinkya Naik, issued a press release praising the visit.""Today, as the President of the Mumbai Cricket Association, it was an absolute honour to welcome the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Christopher Luxon, to the iconic Wankhede Stadium,"" Naik stated.""We took him through the rich legacy of Mumbai cricket, highlighting Wankhede’s role in shaping some of India’s greatest cricketers and its historic moments, including the 2011 World Cup victory. Given the deep cricketing ties between India and New Zealand, it was a proud moment to showcase how Mumbai continues to be a powerhouse of talent and passion for the game."" he added.Luxon’s cricket connection also extended to his official visit to Delhi, where he shared a heart-warming moment with local children, playing a friendly game of cricket with former New Zealand international Ross Taylor. This gesture further strengthened the bond between the two nations.The two countries’ cricketing rivalry was recently showcased in the ICC Champions Trophy Final in Dubai, where India defeated New Zealand. However, in a thrilling Test series last year, the Black Caps halted India’s winning run on home soil by defeating them in the series.","New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon played cricket at Mumbai's iconic Wankhede Stadium with Ajaz Patel, former batter Ross Taylor, and pacer Trent Boult.

"Indian Army: India Clears ₹7,000 Crore Deal for Indigenous ATAGS Howitzers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-mega-deal-for-big-indigenous-artillery-guns/articleshow/119234281.cms,"CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns

NEW DELHI: Big indigenous guns are finally booming. The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Wednesday cleared the around Rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) for the Army , in a major boost for home-grown capability to manufacture such heavy-duty howitzers .The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army, with the contract expected to be inked next week, top sources told TOI.Designed and developed by DRDO , the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems . Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns after it emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%.TOI was the first to report that the ATAGS deal would be inked within this fiscal after clearance from the CCS. The orders for ATAGS are likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.India, incidentally, has also secured a couple of export orders for the ATAGs, which officers say have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.With ATAGS having an “all-electric drive technology” to ensure maintenance-free reliable operations over longer periods of time, India will be able to export the guns in large numbers in the years ahead, an officer said.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army.

NEW DELHI: Military modernisation proposals worth over Rs 54,000 crore, ranging from BrahMos missiles and six ‘Netra’ airborne earlywarning and control (AEW&C) aircraft to upgraded Russian engines for T-90 tanks, naval anti-aircraft missiles and torpedoes, were given preliminary nod by defence ministry on Thursday.Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) accorded “acceptance of necessity (AoN)” to additional Army regiments and IAF squadrons of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450km from the original 290km, worth around Rs 20,000 crore, sources told TOI.BrahMos missiles, jointly manufactured with Russia in India, have become the “prime conventional (nonnuclear) precision-strike weapon” for the armed forces, with contracts worth over Rs 55,000 crore already inked over the years. The grant of an AON, of course, is just the first step in the long-winded procurement procedure that can take years before the final contract is inked. Towards this end, DAC also approved guidelines to reduce timelines at various stages to make the process “faster, more effective and efficient”.Another key takeaway was the fresh AoN granted for six ‘Netra’ AEW&C Mark-1A aircraft or “eyes in the sky” for IAF to boost surveillance capabilities along the borders as well as help direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets.The new Netra aircraft, which will entail mounting indigenous active electronically scanned array antenna-based radars, electronic and signal intelligence systems on Brazilian Embraer-145 jets, will cost over Rs 9,000 crore. With IAF currently making do with just three Netra Mark-1 planes and three Israeli ‘Phalcon’ radars mounted on Russian IL-76 aircraft, India is lagging far behind Pakistan, let alone China, in this arena.The Navy, in turn, got AoNs for additional indigenous shiplaunched Varunastra torpedoes and Russian Shtil antiaircraft missiles for its four 3,900-tonne upgraded Krivak-III class frigates. While the first frigate INS Tushil has sailed to India from Russia, the second will come later this year.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at a cost of around Rs 13,000 crore. AoN was also granted for procurement of 1,350 horsepower engines from Russia for T-90S ‘Bhishma’ mainbattle tanks, which currently have 1000 HP engines. The force has inducted around 1,300 T-90S tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia. “The engine upgrade will enhance the battlefield mobility of these tanks especially in high-altitude areas by increasing the power to weight ratio,” an official said.","BrahMos missiles, jointly manufactured with Russia in India, have become the “prime conventional (nonnuclear) precision-strike weapon” for the armed forces.

A securityman also died in the gunfight.Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI that the bigger encounter was in Bijapur's Gangaloor, a hotbed of insurgency that has seen much bloodshed. This is the first major operation in Gangaloor after the March 3 surrender of Maoist commander Dinesh Modiyam, who called the shots in the area. As many as 26 of Modiyam's ex-comrades were killed in the encounter. The operations in Bijapur & Kanker - nearly 300km apart - were launched simultaneously.In just 80 days, 113 Maoists have been killed by security forces in Chhattisgarh - 91 of them in Bijapur. Last year, 287 Maoists were neutralised in the Bastar division.Union home minister Amit Shah lauded the forces' bravery, saying: ""Our soldiers have achieved another major success in the direction of ' Naxal-Free India Campaign '. Many Naxals were killed in two operations by our security forces in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur and Kanker. Modi govt is moving forward with a ruthless approach against Naxals, and despite various facilities for surrender and inclusion, it is adopting a zero-tolerance policy against those Naxals who refuse to surrender. The country is set to be Naxal-free by March 31 next year.""Sundarraj said a joint team of Bijapur and Sukma District Reserve Guards (DRG), CoBRA commandos and CRPF personnel set out on an operation in Gangaloor based on specific inputs about the presence of Maoists.The first exchange of fire took place around 7am and intermittent firing went on till after noon.When the guns fell silent, the forces found 26 dead Maoists scattered across the battleground.Police also rounded up a group of senior cadres in the forest, sources said, adding that the search is still under way.The body of DRG jawan Raju Oyam, who was killed in the encounter, has been evacuated. ""His sacrifice will not go in vain,"" chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai said, adding, ""Our fight against Naxalism continues with great strength.""In Kanker, a joint team of DRG and BSF hit Maoists of North Bastar Marh division.

NEW DELHI: Posing questions to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok that lead to inflammatory responses may result in criminal action against the user as well as the platform, official sources have said, just as the Centre told X (formerly Twitter) - which has filed a lawsuit in the Karnataka high court challenging what it calls Indian govt's unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship - that it needs to follow the law of the land on content takedown requests.Even as the chatter started getting thicker over the use of abusive words and slang by Grok in its Hindi responses to user queries, X decided to challenge the central govt in court over the interpretation of the Information Technology Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which the micro-blogging platform has alleged violates Supreme Court's rulings and undermines free expression online.The petition, scheduled for hearing on March 27, seeks a declaration to the effect that Section 79(3)(b) does not vest the govt with powers to issue an order to block information posted on X. X argues that such an order can only be issued under Section 69A of the IT Act, read with the IT Rules, 2009.","Posing questions to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok that lead to inflammatory responses may result in criminal action against the user as well as the platform, official sources have said.

Apples from Thar: Rajasthan farmers cultivate a taste of Himalayas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apples-from-thar-raj-farmers-cultivate-a-taste-of-himalayas/articleshow/119276846.cms,"JAIPUR: The Thar in Rajasthan stretches duney and dry. Summer temperatures climb to a blistering 49°C. But the desert is changing. A fruit synonymous with the Himalayas has found an unexpected home in this sea of sand and scorching sun. Apples - red and ripe. What seemed impossible is now a flourishing reality for farmers in Sikar and Jhunjhunu districts, defying conventional wisdom about the fruit's need for cool climates.Santosh Khedar, a farmer from Beri village in Sikar, never imagined her small experiment would turn into a successful apple orchard. A single sapling given to her in 2015 by National Innovation Foundation in Gujarat has multiplied into a thriving apple farm yielding more than 6,000kg of fruit each season.""Since we have a certificate of organic farming from Rajasthan Organic Certification Agency, if the market price for apples from Himachal and Kashmir is Rs 100 a kg, we are selling it at Rs 150/kg,"" said Santosh's son Rahul, who studied agriculture, determined to ensure the family farm continued to thrive.The family had long grown lemon, guava, and sweet lime on their 1.25-acre farm, but an apple tree seemed like a fantasy. ""We were initially sceptical,"" Santosh said. ""We watered the plant and used organic fertilisers as needed. A year later, we saw apples growing on it.""Her neighbours laughed at the idea. Apples? Here? They shook their heads at the thought. But Santosh's tree did not care for their disbelief. In its second year, it bore nearly 40kg of fruit.The secret to this unexpected success lies in the HRMN-99 apple variety , specifically developed to withstand extreme temperatures. ""This variety can grow in arid regions where summer temperatures exceed 40°C,"" Rahul said. Encouraged by the results, Santosh and her family acquired more saplings and used grafting techniques to expand their orchard to 100 trees. ""Ab to paani bhi koni laage jyada (Now, we barely need extra water),"" she said.Apple trees require minimal irrigation once they mature. ""By the time the plant is five years old, it only needs watering once every two weeks,"" deputy director of horticulture Madan Lal Jat said. ""Flowering begins in Feb and the apples are ready for harvest by June.""Those who once scoffed at Santosh are now eager to follow in her footsteps. ""Jo manya konya ve ib podho maange hai,"" she said in her native dialect, meaning: ""Those who didn't believe now ask for a sapling."" In nearby Katrathal village, farmer Mohit Chaudhary has cultivated 50 apple trees. Horticulture official Jat sees a growing trend. ""Ten years ago, people in Barmer cultivated dates and pomegranates. Now, we have farmers growing strawberries in Chittorgarh and Bhilwara,"" he said. ""In five years, apple farming could spread across more regions,"" he said.","Santosh Khedar, a farmer from Beri village in Sikar, never imagined her small experiment would turn into a successful apple orchard.

Supreme Court ruling set to ease govt land acquisition process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-ruling-set-to-ease-govt-land-acquisition-process/articleshow/119276265.cms,"SC: Validating bid to nullify state’s land buy nothing short of permitting fraud

NEW DELHI: Frowning at vexatious litigation relating to land acquisition, which delays projects for decades, Supreme Court Thursday ruled that when a govt acquires land for public purposes using its sovereign powers, it cannot be frustrated by creation of third-party rights after the acquisition.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said even a public body for whom an acquisition was done can't give the land to someone through a private agreement as only govt has the power to withdraw acquisition for the entire land, or a portion of it.Litigation relating to acquired land, mainly because of creation of third-party rights, has been a key factor for delay in execution of many projects, especially national highways.This ruling may help ease the impediments caused by post-acquisition litigation.The case that warranted the ruling pertained to acquisition of 33 acres abutting Narela-Bawana Road to enable Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board to establish its grain market. The acquisition notification was issued in Oct 30, 1963 and the award determining compensation issued on Jan 10, 1986. When a woman claimed ownership over a portion of the land, the Board chairman surreptitiously entered into a private agreement with her and agreed to release half of the claimed land to her while permitting her to claim compensation for the other half.Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar said the flow of events turned curiouser and curiouser as in 'Alice in Wonderland'. After the chairman's retirement, the Board disputed the agreement. But Delhi high court allowed the woman's plea for arbitration of the dispute with the Board relating to the acquired land. The arbitrator appointed by the HC ruled in favour of the woman and said the return of the land was valid.""When the state uses its sovereign power of eminent domain and acquires land for a public purpose, such an exercise cannot be set at naught by the beneficiary of such acquisition, the Board, by entering into a private agreement shortly after the acquisition so as to reverse the usage of the power of eminent domain by the state,"" Justice Kumar said. ""Validating this dubious enterprise by a statutory beneficiary of a compulsory acquisition would be nothing short of permitting a fraud on the exercise of such sovereign power by the state,"" he added.""Given the further fact that the only objective of the said agreement was to thwart the compulsory acquisition of the subject land by returning a portion thereof to Bhagwan Devi, the agreement was patently opposed to all tenets of law,"" the bench said while quashing the orders of the HC and the arbitral award.","Litigation relating to acquired land has been a key factor for delay in execution of many projects, especially national highways. Ruling may help ease the impediments caused by post-acquisition litigation.

The issue of land acquisition getting stuck or delayed has been flagged in several govt reports and even at the Pragati meetings chaired by PM Narendra Modi.""Once the land acquisition issue is resolved, projects can be put on fast-track mode.

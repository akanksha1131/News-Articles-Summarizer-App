Miraj’s sitars find a home abroad but face an uncertain future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mirajs-sitars-find-a-home-abroad-but-face-an-uncertain-future/articleshow/118131011.cms,"The sitars of Miraj still sing. They resonate with the same depth of sound that once captivated the world through Pandit Ravi Shankar’s fingers, enchanted by Vilayat Khan’s mastery, and found an unexpected champion in George Harrison’s “Norwegian Wood”.. For now, the chisels still strike, the polish still gleams, and the strings still hum. But how much longer?The artisans of this small city in Maharashtra’s Sangli district have breathed life into the sitar for 300 years. Today, these same hands, calloused by generations of craftsmanship, struggle to hold on to a tradition that is more inheritance than profession.Inside the timeworn workshops in the narrow alleys of Miraj, the artisans stand at a crossroads. While the craft wavers at home, Miraj’s sitars are finding a market across the oceans. In US, Germany, and UK, musicians cherish the handcrafted instruments.The demand for these instruments is vast — greater than ever, in fact — but the hands that craft them are growing fewer. Where once thousands laboured, only a few hundred remain.Mohsin Mirajkar, a seventh-generation sitar maker, knows this struggle intimately. At 43, he has dedicated his life to carving, stringing, and tuning the instrument that defines his family’s legacy. Yet, he watches helplessly as younger generations turn away.“The effort it takes to make a sitar is immense,” he said. “With less effort, they can earn more in IT or engineering. The demand is huge, but we can’t even meet 25% of it.”The irony is stark. While the world craves the authentic voice of Miraj’s sitars, the very hands that shape them are forced to consider a future without them.“During the pandemic, only doctors and essential workers were in demand,” said Mohammed Saeem Shikalgar, a young sitar maker, who balances the art with his medical studies. “I love making sitars, but I needed a backup. If this tradition fades, I will have something to fall back on.”To the untrained eye, a sitar might seem like just another instrument, its shape familiar, its sound enchanting but distant.Yet, behind its curved frame lies a labour of profound patience.It begins with a kaddu (gourd) — immersed in water, softened, and then dried until the moisture evaporates, leaving behind a hard ened shell. This humble vegetable is carved and shaped into a hollow body, its curves sculpted with an understanding that is more instinct than technique.Craftsman Imran Salim described the process: “The polishing, the carving, the bridge, the turning pegs… everything has to be perfect. Each sitar takes about 20 to 25 days. You can’t rush it. It must be allowed to find its own voice.”But time, the very thing these artisans honour, is now their greatest adversary. The rise of mass-produced sitars — factory-made imitations that lack the warmth of handmade ones — has only added to their woes.Miarj’s fame was built upon its musical heritage, attracting luminaries like Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Pandit Venkatesh Kumar, Ustad Rashid Khan, and sitar virtuosos Shujaat Khan and Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan. Even Hridaynath Mangeshkar turned to Miraj for instruments that carried not just notes but soul.The city’s sitars still travel across borders, finding homes in concert halls, in the hands of maestros, in the quiet corners of music lovers who understand their worth. Yet, one cannot ignore the silence creeping in behind the melodies.","The artisans of Miraj have breathed life into the sitar for 300 years.

"Dalai's brother, champion of the Tibet cause, and thukpa",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalais-brother-champion-of-the-tibet-cause-and-thukpa/articleshow/118130922.cms,"KALIMPONG: Most residents of Kalimpong, and adjoining Siliguri and Darjeeling, have no clue the thukpa that had been filling their bowls for over half a century came from a factory set up by the Dalai Lama 's elder brother, a towering spiritual figure among Tibetans, who passed away on Saturday at 97.Way back in 1966-67, Gyalo Thondup not only built his residence, Tagtser House, in Kalimpong but also set up a noodle-making factory, Trans Himalaya. The popular Tibetan dish, thukpa, soon became a staple of the region, where Tibetans came as refugees. In no time, Trans Himalaya's produce was being exported to Sikkim and other parts of India as well as to adjoining Bhutan and other countries.While the thukpa produced by Trans Himalaya became a rage, most people in the region were not even aware the 14th Dalai Lama's elder brother lived in Kalimpong.""If we look at the history of noodles in Kalimpong... Gyalo Thondup started it in an authentic Tibetan style. By the 1970s, it had become extremely popular. His noodles were in demand until Covid,"" said trader Subash Pradhan who sells noodles in Kalimpong.Thukpa making involves rolling the dough, cutting it into thin strands with a techno blade, leaving it at room temperature for three days, and then sun-drying it for another day. Lhamo Thondup, an aide of the Dalai Lama's brother, had mastered the art and was the guiding force behind Trans Himalaya. His grandson Tenzing Rigzin now owns Eagle Noodles , another prominent Kalimpong brand.The Tibetan community remembers the leader differently.

He tried his best to negotiate with China for Tibet's freedom and has left behind a great legacy,"" said a businessman.","Dalai Lama's elder brother Gyalo Thondup set up a noodle-making factory in Kalimpong.

"6 months after riot, 11 UP families return not to homes but rubble",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-months-after-riot-11-up-families-return-not-to-homes-but-rubble/articleshow/118130895.cms,"BAREILLY: Six months after the violence, the dust in Gausganj still hasn't settled. On July 18, communal clashes left one Hindu man dead and several injured. In the days that followed, 42 Muslim families fled or were forcibly displaced, and eight homes were bulldozed by the administration for ""encroaching on government land"". The 58 Muslim men held continue to languish in jail.Scattered and uncertain, the displaced families sought refuge in the homes of relatives in different villages, only to move again when they could afford to rent modest dwellings. With no stable income, they continued working as labourers whenever they could find work. Their children, once students, saw their education come to an abrupt halt.Now, 11 families have returned under security cover - not to homes, but to rubble, looted cupboards, shattered doors, and a village that doesn't know whether to welcome them back or push them away.Shafeekan, 60, steps carefully over what used to be her doorstep, now just a jagged remnant of concrete. ""At least I have my home back,"" she says. ""We are a family of daily wagers and I have no money to fight the cases of my two sons and husband. I don't know how they'll come out of jail.""Ruksana Begum, 62, sits on the narrow ramp of her front porch, her gaze darting toward the cops patrolling the village. ""We do not want to talk. We have no problem,"" she murmurs, before vanishing behind a tattered curtain.Mohd Tahir, 23, is here, but not to stay. ""I don't live here anymore. I work in Haryana,"" he says, his voice low, his eyes watchful. ""I came to settle my parents. Nothing is left. We have to start from scratch.""Al Jabah, 9, won't be going back to school soon. ""I saw my schoolbag torn. I don't go to school now,"" she says.For now, the survival of these families depends on charity. ""An NGO provides us with meals and basic necessities like utensils and brooms,"" says Mevish Jahan, whose son Yasinis behind bars. ""Our electricity metres are broken, and water supply is erratic.""Gausganj, once home to marginal farmers and labourers, became an open battleground following the violence. Livestock was taken. Tractors and farming equipment were seized. Land, too, is now under threat. ""We get offers through common connections, asking us to sell at throwaway prices,"" says a returnee. ""When we protested, we were threatened with more FIRs. We have little hope of justice.""For some families in the village, resentment still runs deep. Tejpal, a 23-year-old Hindu man, was killed in the riots and his family is still seeking justice. ""He was my nephew,"" says panchayat assistant Raj Kumari. ""He was murdered. And now they are being allowed back? How can we tolerate this? Today, police are with us, but what about after six months? Who will guarantee our security?"" Tensions are expected to peak as Holi approaches. ""We have set up a police picket at the village entrance,"" says Shahi SHO Amit Balyan. ""A large Hindu gathering is expected, so we're keeping a heavy force deployed.""","On July 18, communal clashes left one Hindu man dead and several injured. 42 Muslim families fled or were forcibly displaced, and eight homes were bulldozed.

WHO: Use low sodium salt to reduce heart attack risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-use-low-sodium-salt-to-reduce-heart-attack-risk/articleshow/118130308.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a renewed effort to reduce sodium intake, WHO has recommended that people should consider replacing regular table salt with Lower-Sodium Salt Substitutes ( LSSS ).LSSS refers to the salt form in which a certain percentage of sodium chloride is replaced with another mineral, most commonly potassium chloride. Use of LSSS when compared to regular salt is linked with reduction in heart attack and stroke risk, WHO said.WHO, in 2012, had issued a guidance document that was later adopted by member states including India which set a global target to reduce mean population sodium intake by 30% by 2030. But current trends suggest slow progress which is why it has come up with this new strategy to promote LSSS, in addition to encouraging member states to reduce overall sodium intake.It is sold by different brands in India and has 15- to 30% less sodium. However, its uptake is very low due to higher cost and low awareness. Pink Himalayan salt, black salt and sea salt, that are growing in popularity, do not fall in this category.WHO recommendation is based on findings from 26 randomised controlled trials in adults in which assignment to LSSS compared to regular salt resulted in reductions in blood pressure over 56 days to five years of follow-up. LSSS is not only low in sodium, but also contains potassium which is associated with lower levels of blood pressure.However, WHO warns, high levels of potassium can be harmful to those with impaired kidney function because their kidneys may not be able to excrete mineral leading to hyperkalemia - a condition that affects heart function and can be life-threatening. WHO guideline on LSSS is, therefore, not applicable for individuals with kidney impairments or with other circumstances or conditions that might compromise potassium excretion. As there is insufficient evidence of the benefits of substituting regular table salt with LSSS in children & pregnant women, these two categories have also been kept out of the ambit of WHO recommendation.Dr Mohit Gupta, professor of cardiology at Delhi's G B Pant hospital said switching to low-sodium salt substitutes can be beneficial for most people in reducing sodium intake and lowering blood pressure, thereby decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases .Dr Kameshwar Prasad, head of neurology at Fortis Healthcare and Dr Kunal Gandhi, senior consultant, nephrology at Amrita Hospital Faridabad, on the other hand, suggested that it may be better to encourage cutting down salt intake instead of promoting LSSS.","LSSS refers to the salt form in which a certain percentage of sodium chloride is replaced with another mineral, most commonly potassium chloride.

Apply mind: SC to Gujarat government on Congress MP's poem recital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apply-mind-sc-to-gujarat-government-on-congress-mps-poem-recital/articleshow/118130098.cms,"It's a poem, not against any religion: SC backs Congress MP

NEW DELHI: Observing that a poem recited by Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi did not seem to be against any religion, Supreme Court on Monday asked the Gujarat govt ""to apply its mind"" to the poem and take a stand on the politician's plea to quash criminal proceedings initiated against him in the state for hurting religious sentiments.The court granted two weeks to the state govt to take a decision while highlighting that it was just a poem and creativity was also important for society. The bench said Gujarat high court did not appreciate the meaning of the poem while hearing a plea filed by Pratapgarhi.Appearing for the Congress MP, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, ""The judge (of Gujarat HC) has done violence to the law. That is my worry.""Reading English translation of the poem, which was attached by Pratapgarhi in his petition, the bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said, ""It is ultimately a poem. It is not against any religion. This poem indirectly says even if somebody indulges in violence, we will not indulge in violence. That's the message which this poem gives... that we will quietly suffer the violence but we will not do anything. So that somebody who indulges in violence will be dethroned. It is not against any particular community.""As the state govt sought time to file its reply and sought adjournment, the bench told its lawyer, ""Please apply your mind to the poem. After all, creativity is also important."" The court also extended its interim order by which the MP was protected in the case lodged against him for posting a video clip with the poem 'Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno'.On Jan 17, HC had refused to quash the FIR, saying there was a need for further probe. It had said the poem's tenor indicated something about the throne and that responses to the poem on social media pointed to a potential disturbance in social harmony. It had said all citizens, especially an MP, should behave in a manner that did not disrupt communal or social harmony.After Gujarat HC order, Pratapgarhi appealed in SC which on Jan 21 granted him protection. Noting that he had not been arrested in the case so far, SC had said ""no further steps shall be taken in any manner on the basis of the FIR"".",The court granted two weeks to the state govt to take a decision while highlighting that it was just a poem and creativity was also important for society.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

Thakur called out LoP in Lok Sabha and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi saying, ""Rahul ji, zero check karlijiye,Speaking in the Lok Sabha during a debate on the Union Budget, Thakur held up a sign that read, ""12,00,000 income par 0 tax,"" referencing the tax relief for the middle class announced in the budget.

His question was met with a resounding ""zero"" from BJP MPs.Thakur declared that under Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, Congress had set a record for consistent electoral failure.

NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave.However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail.In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.",The BJP broke 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the 70-member Delhi assembly.

NEW DELHI: The Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction) became the latest in chorus of political parties slamming YouTuber and podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia for his ""inappropriate"" remark on the show India's Got Latent, calling it ""in poor taste"". However, the party also raised issue against the ""disproportionate outrage"" surrounding the controversy.Party spokesperson Anish Gawande warned that the backlash could be used to justify tighter government control over digital content creators under the proposed Broadcasting Bill.""Ranveer's comments on India’s Got Latent were in poor taste, but the disproportionate outrage risks setting a dangerous precedent,"" he said in a post on X.Gawande said that while Allahbadia’s comments were offensive, the response should not pave the way for increased censorship. “Many of us have spoken out against the proposed Broadcasting Bill, which threatens independent digital creators—we should not let this case become the pivot upon which the bill gains public support,” he said.The proposed legislation, designed to overhaul India's broadcasting regulatory framework, had sparked concerns about classifying independent news creators as broadcasters. Initially intended to focus on OTT platforms and digital news, the scope of the legislation was later broadened to include social media accounts, TOI had earlier reported. ""This law is not about accountability—it’s about control. The government has already scrutinised political YouTubers for their 2024 election coverage, and this bill would make it easier to regulate and silence them. We must be careful. Outrage against one creator should not justify a law that will curb free speech for all,"" Gawande added.Allahbadia, widely known as BeerBiceps, apologised after facing a wave of criticism for his controversial question to a contestant on the show. In a video statement, he admitted his comment was ""not just inappropriate, it wasn't even funny"" and distanced himself from comedy, saying, ""Comedy is not my forte. I am just here to say sorry.""A formal complaint was lodged against Allahbadia, comedian Samay Raina, and influencer Apoorva Makhija with the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra Women's Commission, accusing them of using obscene language to gain online popularity.The national human rights commission (NHRC) has also taken cognisance of the matter, writing to YouTube’s public policy head in India and calling for the episode’s removal. The NHRC’s letter alleged the show contained ""highly objectionable, inappropriate, and obscene remarks,"" which violated various laws, including the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Information Technology Act.Allahbadia, who has collaborated with the government in the past and received a National Creators Award from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has since requested the show’s producers to remove the controversial sections. “All I can say in the end is sorry. I hope you can forgive me as a human being,” he said in his apology video.","Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction) slams YouTuber and podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia for his ""inappropriate"" remark on India's Got Latent.

The same workers who are seen with Ashish Tayal during the assembly elections are also seen with the BJP's opposing candidate Chitra Sarwara. What is the relationship?

Offence is best defence: Politics of confrontation

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal 's dream run in Delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - Kejriwal's AAP has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections. The BJP has finally managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The former Delhi chief minister, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, ran a very aggressive campaign against the BJP and also targeted the Congress. So, why did Kejriwal lose? Here's a look at some of the tricks that failed to click for the AAP chief.Arvind Kejriwal, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, resigned as chief minister of Delhi in September 2024, months ahead of elections to take a high moral ground on the issue of corruption.""I am ready for Agni Pariksha. Two days later, I will resign as chief minister. I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict,"" Kejriwal had said at the time of resignation.Kejriwal, who had refused to resign even when he was in jail, eventually gave up his chair amid turmoil faced by him in the Delhi excise policy case. Several top leaders, including Kejriwal himself, faced accusations of accepting bribes from liquor companies in exchange for favorable policies. Eventually, several AAP leaders were jailed in connection with the case.Kejriwal's claim to fame in his first two terms was his transparent and pro-people governance model. The AAP chief claimed credit for transforming Delhi's government schools and his Mohalla clinics provided cheap medicare to the poor. In the 2020 elections, Kejriwal sought votes for his work and AAP campaign centred around the change it had brought to the lives of the people. However, this time around AAP's campaign was centred around its attacks on the BJP leadership and the Congress. Kejriwal, who along with top AAP leadership faced several corruption charges, focused less on development and governance narratives. He called BJP ""Gali Galauj Party.""In the middle of the campaign, Kejriwal dropped a bombshell as he accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna waters to kill people of Delhi. Kejriwal's charges gave a toxic turn to Delhi campaign with both BJP and Congress going all out against the AAP chief. At the end, as the results show - the people of Delhi were not swayed by his ""concerns"" for them.Arvind Kejriwal tried to woo the middle class by unveiling his party’s manifesto for them. He claimed that the middle class were ignored by successive governments and accused other political parties of treating them as ""just an ATM for the government"". Ironically though, Kejriwal's manifesto did not mention what he would do for the middle class if voted to power but only listed seven demands from the Centre to improve their lives. Little wonder, at the end the Centre's sops for the middle class in the Uunion Budget appealed more to Delhi voters than the AAP's demands.Confrontation has been a part of Kejriwal's politics right from the beginning. This time around it was no different. Right through his campaign, Kejriwal trained his guns at Delhi Police and the Election Commission. Kejriwal accused the Election Commission and Delhi Police of colluding with the BJP to subvert the electoral process and prevent AAP from campaigning. Kejriwal targeted Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and alleged that he ""wants a job post-retirement"" and was ""destroying the country"" for the post. Kejriwal's decision to take on the Congress along with the BJP boomeranged as on several seats, AAP's margin of defeat is less than the votes polled by the Congress candidate. Both Kejriwal and Rahul made relentless attacks against each other giving an opportunity to mock the allies-turned-rivals and take digs at opposition unity.",Arvind Kejriwal's dream run in Delhi has come to an end.

Mother Noor Jahan and father Suraj rushed him to hospital where doctors were flummoxed: Sai had symptoms they couldn't diagnose. Eventually, he was taken to a private hospital in Pune city and it was there that specialists had answers for the couple - their son had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).By early February, the Chavans' neighbourhood of Nanded Gaon had enough cases to be classified as the ""primary outbreak zone"" - nearly 90 cases would come from this area and nearby localities of Kirkatwadi, Sinhagad Road and Khadakwasla, all that were not long ago merged with Pune Municipal Corporation.On February 4, almost a month after the first cases emerged, health authorities released their findings.

The well's water was only chlorinated, unlike the rest of Pune's supply which goes through an elaborate purification process at a treatment plant. Incidentally, the well was also the source of water for households across Kirkatwadi, Nandoshi village, Dhayari, Sinhagad Road and DSK Vishwa township.Vikas Joshi, a resident of DSK Vishwa, whose brother is in hospital on oxygen support with GBS symptoms, says, ""There is no point in having a water filter here at home because the supply itself is so contaminated.

NEW DELHI: Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025 broke tradition with an open-air, informal conversation at Sunder Nursery, replacing the conventional auditorium setup, as students engaged with PM Narendra Modi in a free-wheeling discussion around diet, stress, technology and personal struggles related to examinations.Modi revealed, ""Had I not been PM, I would have liked to work in the skill development ministry."" He advised the young audience to ""break hierarchical barriers"" and emphasised, ""True leadership is about inspiring and guiding others, not just giving orders.""Focusing on skill development, Modi said, ""Degrees are valuable, but skills make you indispensable."" He shared examples of young entrepreneurs and innovators who turned their passions into careers, emphasising that adaptability and continuous learning define success today. ""You are lucky to be growing up in an era with so much technology... but you must decide whether you are using it wisely.""Are you spending hours watching reels, or are you learning something from technology? Technology is not a storm that will sweep you away-it is a tool. If you use it properly, it will empower you,"" PM Modi said addressing a common complaint parents have of their children.Students participated in a candid exchange with Modi, marked by warmth and spontaneity. ""Earlier, we met him on stage, but this time, it feels personal,"" one student shared. Another added, ""No scripts, no formality - just open discussion. It makes us feel heard.""The discussion covered a wide range of topics, from language and culture to health and mindfulness. Akanksha from Kerala praised Hindi, prompting the PM to recite a poem. ""Society wrongly associates success with exam scores. But real success comes from persistence. A good cricketer focuses on the ball, not the noise in the stadium. Similarly, students should focus on learning, not stress,"" Modi said.Traditional food customs were also highlighted as students enjoyed til-gud (sesame-jaggery) sweets. ""Just like we offer guests something at home, he shared with us,"" a student observed. PM Modi underscored mindful living, asking, ""Do you know how many teeth we have?"" to stress proper chewing habits.On exam stress, he reassured students, ""Marks don't define you."" Modi told students that knowledge and examinations are two different things. One should not view exams as be-all and end-all in life, he said.Stress, he said, is like a pressure cooker, and urged students to express their emotions openly. ""Depression often arises due to lack of communication,"" he noted, encouraging them to embrace challenges: ""Every difficulty brings an opportunity to grow.""Encouraging students to balance hobbies with studies, he used an analogy: ""If you have a pet dog at home, do you stop spending time with it just because exams are near? No, because it brings you joy. Similarly, hobbies refresh the mind and keep you balanced.""Urging parents to not use their children as models to ""show off"", he said they should not compare them with others and instead support them. When asked what advice he would give talented students who work hard but don't achieve success, Modi said ""rather than focusing on what someone is lacking, appreciate what they excel at. If you encourage them, they will feel valued. Instead of just studying for exams, students should also write-like poetry or essays-to express their thoughts.""He reinforced the importance of curiosity and lifelong learning, telling students, ""Be inquisitive. Never stop asking questions. Learning doesn't end with exams; it's a lifelong pursuit.""

NEW DELHI: If a convicted person is barred from government employment, what is the rationale behind provisions in the Representation of the People Act that allow a convicted criminal to contest elections and become a lawmaker six years after he has served the sentence, Supreme Court asked on Monday.After two landmark judgments on electoral reforms - mandatory disclosure of assets and criminal antecedents by candidates, and prescribing automatic disqualification on conviction and sentence beyond two years - a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan decided to foray into a possible third by agreeing to test the constitutional validity of parts of Sections 8 & 9 of RP Act - should there be a life ban on the convicted on contesting election?The SC asked government and EC to file replies to the plea by advocate-petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay in three weeks.Supreme Court said if Union government and EC did not file their responses within the stipulated period, it would still proceed with the matter and posted further hearing on March 4.Under the RP Act, a person is eligible to contest elections six years after he has served out the sentence awarded to him upon conviction in a criminal case or one concerning moral turpitude or corruption. Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Vikas Singh gave the example of a convicted criminal not being eligible for a peon's job in government but being eligible, six years after completion of prison term, to be a lawmaker. Drawing the court's attention to rising crimes by juveniles, Singh said even if held guilty for murder, a juvenile aged 17 would not get imprisonment of more than three years. This means, by the age of 26, he would be eligible to contest elections and if backed by a political party, he would stand a fair chance of becoming a lawmaker.Though this example caught the bench's imagination, Justice Manmohan appeared more aware of ground realities and machinations of convicted politicians in getting around even the six-year ban, making their wives either the CM or lawmaker. ""We must not do something that would provide another ruse for politicians to retain control through remote control,"" he said.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria supported the petition and told the court that the time had come to test the constitutional validity of certain parts of Sections 8 and 9 of RP Act that allowed a convicted criminal/politician to enter/re-enter the political arena.Tamil Nadu's additional advocate general Amit Anand Tiwari said the main stakeholders, national and state parties, should be given notice for their responses. The bench said these days SC proceedings were widely reported and it would hear arguments from all stakeholders, whosoever decided to address the court on this issue.In 2003, in People's Union for Civil Liberties case, SC had for the first time directed candidates contesting an election to declare their assets and criminal antecedents. This order was reinforced by another order in 2018, mandating candidates to file affidavits giving details of their criminal antecedents and details of their own and spouses' assets.",Supreme Court asks government and EC to file replies to the plea by advocate- petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay in three weeks.

India to cite recent duty cuts in bid to escape Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-cite-recent-duty-cuts-in-bid-to-escape-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118129430.cms,"25% steel tariff won't hit India's shipments to US

NEW DELHI: As President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US (on top of existing metal duties), India is getting ready to unbracket itself from countries he has called ""worst tariff manipulators"", citing its recent duty cuts to point to a reduction in average duties in recent years.On Monday, Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett said India has high tariffs that lock out imports, and added that Modi had a ""lot to discuss"" with Trump as they meet later this week.Following Budget announcements on tariff cuts for bikes, including the iconic Harley Davidson, and other products in the run-up to PM Modi's meeting with Trump, officials said they have prepared the ground for the PM to point to Trump that his govt is sensitive to White House's concerns and has undertaken a comprehensive look at tariffs to bring them down to Asean rates. They also pointed out that the reduction was a signal to the world that tariff rates were not high as perceived by some trading partners.The reduction in the Union Budget is estimated to have lowered the average duty by a percentage point to 10.6%. Average tariffs on imports from US have also come down over the years. In fact, for the top 30 imports from the US, including oil, gas, diamonds and airplanes, the levy is going up to 7.5% at the most, officials have said.Officials are also laying store by US' strategic requirement to have good strategic ties with India, that Trump may not breach New Delhi's pain barrier on threshold.Though Modi and Trump have enjoyed a good rapport since the latter's first term, the govt recognises that nothing can be taken for granted while dealing with a US president who sees himself as a transactionalist with an unrivalled capability to get the best deals for the US.While the proposed 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has rocked the world, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on India's shipments to the US. During the last fiscal year, India's export of iron and steel was estimated at $475 million, with iron and steel products adding up to another $2.8 billion. Export of aluminium and articles made of this metal were estimated at just under $950 million in 2023-24. The largest sources of US steel imports are Brazil, Canada and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to govt and American Iron and Steel Institute data.In 2018, the previous Trump administration had imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium, citing national security concerns. These tariffs covered most primary steel products, except stainless steel, and included steel pipes and tubes. The tariffs applied to most countries, triggering a wave of retaliatory measures and escalating tensions in global trade. This had also prompted American auto companies to slash production.Trump had clubbed India, along with China, Brazil and Mexico, as a high-tariff country and threatened action. So far, however, India has not faced any specific action and both sides have spoken about strengthening trade and economic relations. Modi's meeting with the US president is expected to only smoothen the process, given the close bond that the two leaders share.Trump's announcement pushed up gold prices, seen as a safe haven during turbulent times, while the dollar inched higher. While the sensex closed 550 points lower on Monday, global stocks seem to have shrugged off the threat. Global markets have been on the edge, wary of a possible trade war. The prospect of higher tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium in particular is, however, not good news for India as the domestic industry is already complaining of cheap imports flooding the markets. This could get worse if Trump goes ahead with his plan, likely Monday, as China would look at the vast Indian market to cover some of the probable losses in the US.The domestic steel industry has petitioned govt to impose 20-25% safeguard duty on steel to shield domestic players from predatory imports. Small businesses and exporters are, however, wary of these levies and have sought a ""balanced response"" so that Indian consumers do not end up paying more. An analysis by GTRI showed that India's iron and steel imports have grown from $10.4 billion in FY2018, when the US-China trade war began, to $18.6 billion in FY2024.","President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US.

The scheme, marketed as a CSR initiative by large companies, claimed to empower women and support low-income households. Women could own a brand-new scooter priced at Rs 1.2 lakh for just Rs 60,000. Laptops, water tanks, fertilisers, and sewing machines were also promised at massive discounts. This generous offer was allegedly devised and executed by Ananthu Krishnan , 28, of Kudayathoor in Idukki district, a self-styled social activist with an eye for deception.The scheme, police sources said, was nothing more than a sophisticated Ponzi operation, rechannelling funds from new investors to fulfil promises to earlier ones - until it all came crashing down.On Jan 30, Ananthu was arrested and police froze the bank accounts linked to the operation, cutting off the flow of funds. An SIT was formed to uncover the full extent of the fraud. By then, the scam had already ensnared between 30,000 and 40,000 people, many of whom had taken loans to invest. Over 3,000 people have filed complaints, with investigations estimating the total fraud amount at Rs 500 crore. In just 34 FIRs, Rs 37 crore was confirmed as swindled.As per investigators, Ananthu lived extravagantly on the bilked money. He rented luxury apartments in Kochi's Marine Drive, spent heavily on a posh lifestyle, and invested in properties in at least five locations across Idukki and Kottayam. Ananthu had carefully built an image of credibility. Fluent in English and active on social media, he posed for photos with celebrities, politicians, and govt officials, adding an air of legitimacy to his scheme.He said large corporations were funding the initiative under CSR obligations, and to make it appear authentic, he even approached companies & NGOs for real CSR contributions, though none materialised. A project named 'Women on Wheels' was the gateway to the scam's success. Initial investors received scooters, fuelling trust & encouraging more bargain-hunters to invest. Soon, the scheme expanded, offering household items at steep discounts.But as with any Ponzi scheme , the money eventually ran dry and left thousands in the lurch. A single complaint to Kerala's police chief triggered the first probe. ""We didn't know the magnitude of the scam when the first FIRs were registered,"" police said. Ananthu's scam was more than just a solo act. It involved a web of NGOs and influential figures. Many organisations unknowingly acted as intermediaries, collecting money from investors and forwarding it to the scam. The scam had also spilled into Kerala's political circles, with accusations surfacing against politicians from multiple parties.","Ananthu Krishnan, 28, of Kudayathoor in Idukki district, was arrested on Jan 30.

To address these issues, the report recommends raising public investment in higher education to 6% of GDP, implementing performance-based funding, and granting greater autonomy to SPUs to improve governance and research capacity.SPUs, which serve as the backbone of India's higher education sector, are struggling with outdated infrastructure and insufficient research facilities, limiting their ability to produce impactful academic work. The report warns that access to digital resources remains a challenge, with only 32% of SPUs having fully functional digital libraries, making it difficult for students and faculty to access global research databases.The report highlights that over 40% of faculty positions remain vacant in SPUs, leading to an unfavourable student-teacher ratio of 30:1, compared to the recommended 15:1. As a result, students receive limited academic mentorship and research guidance, affecting both their learning outcomes and employability. ""SPUs must prioritise faculty recruitment and retention strategies. Without adequate teaching staff, the goal of improving academic standards cannot be achieved,"" states the report.The report notes that tuition fees in SPUs are, on average, 60% lower than those in private institutions, making higher education more accessible to students from socially and economically disadvantaged groups (SEDGs).To revitalise SPUs, the report proposes a multi-pronged reform strategy. It calls for public investment in higher education to be raised to at least 6% of GDP, in line with National Education Policy 2020 recommendations. It also suggests performance-based funding models to incentivise research, greater autonomy for SPUs in decision-making, and stronger academia-industry linkages to enhance graduate employability. Additionally, initiatives such as One Nation One Subscription (ONOS) scheme, which provides free access to over 13,000 global research journals, should be expanded to benefit all SPUs.The report underscores that govt colleges, particularly those affiliated with SPUs struggle with accreditation due to high NAAC costs, restricting their access to quality improvement funds. Additionally, bureaucratic inefficiencies delay curriculum updates & faculty recruitment, affecting academic quality.","State public universities (SPUs), which enrol 81% of India's higher education students, are grappling with severe faculty shortages and outdated infrastructure.

"Concept of ‘brain-dead’ unscientific, says petitioner: SC struggles to understand medical jargon, adjourns hearing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concept-of-brain-dead-unscientific-says-petitioner-sc-struggles-to-understand-medical-jargon-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/123776993.cms,"NEW DELHI: Attuned to understand the legal jargons, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday found it difficult to digest the medical terminology saturated arguments of a doctor who challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994.Appealing against a Kerala HC judgment, Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. He said Sections 2(d) and 2(e) THOTA, relatable to brain death, are unconstitutional.Section 2(d) provided the meaning of ‘brain-stem-death’ as a stage when all functions of the brainstem have ceased permanently and irreversibly. Sec 2(e) provided that ‘deceased person’ means a person in whom permanent disappearance of all evidence of life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in a cardio-pulmonary sense, at any time after live birth has taken place.As he continued to explain brain-stem death, and its different meanings in different countries, Justice Kant-led bench said, “It is almost impossible for us to understand the medical terminologies you use. Why don’t you make a presentation on this before the National Medical Commission or experts from the health ministry?”“Ultimately, even if the court or the authorities accept your definition of bran-death, ultimately it would require the government to move a Bill in Parliament to amend the law.Can SC direct Parliament to amend a law? Will it not violate the Constitution-mandated separation of power,” the bench asked.Dr Ganapathy said organ transplant is the biggest business in India and only the poor patients are declared brain-dead to enable harvesting of the organs for other rich patients. “Why is it that hospitals declare only poor patients as brain-dead and not the kin of a SC judge, advocate or a rich and influential person,” he asked.The bench said, “If Parliament chose a definition of brain-death, the courts must accept it. We will not be able to change it even as the Supreme Court. You may argue that the brain-death definition given in the law is incomplete, but it is not an incorrect one.”When the court was about to dispose of the appeal, Dr Ganapathy said his earlier petition, challenging another order of the Kerala HC asking him to approach appropriate authority regarding malpractice in hospitals in declaring a person brain-dead, is pending since 2018 and requested that the present appeal be tagged with that one. SC gladly agreed to escape the medical jargon.","Dr S Ganapathy challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994.

'BRICS Vampires': Navarro Targets India Again; Loses Cool After Russia Fact-Check On X, Poll Debacle

US President Donald Trump 's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday continued his rant and this time trained his guns at the member countries of Brics , calling them ""vampires"".Navarro claimed the member countries of Brics cannot survive without trading with the United States.""They’ve long hated each other—and none survive without selling to the United State."" he added.Trump's adviser raked up several examples where he tried to convince that the alliance is not working out.""The bottomline is that none of these countries can survive if they don't sell to the United States, and when they sell to the United States their exports, they're like vampires sucking our blood dry with their unfair trade practices.

But I don't see how the BRICS stays together since historically they all hate each other and kill each other,"" he said.Also read: 'Too funny': Navarro's poll on X falls flat; Trump aide again guns for India ""Let's see how this is going to work out... Russia is getting into bed with China. China claims they own Vladivostok- the Russian port, and they're already through massive illegal immigration into Siberia, basically colonizing Siberia, which is the biggest landmass of the Russian semi-empire, so good luck with that, Putin, and then India, of course, is at war with China for decades.It was China that gave Pakistan a nuclear bomb. You got ships flying around the Indian Ocean now with Chinese flags. Modi, see how you kind of worked that out. Meanwhile, the Brazil economy is going down the tubes because of Lula's socialist policies- well, they keep the real leader of that country in a cell.

SC stays projects in proposed Goa tiger reserve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-projects-in-proposed-goa-tiger-reserve/articleshow/123776893.cms,"PANAJI: In a major setback to Goa govt's ambitious plans to start hinterland tourism activities in five sanctuaries, Supreme Court on Monday granted a stay on carrying out any development activities in the proposed tiger reserve areas in state.SC, hearing a special leave petition by the state govt challenging a July 2023 Bombay HC order directing the state to declare Mhadei wildlife sanctuary and its surrounding areas as a tiger reserve in three months, referred the matter to Central Empowered Committee (CEC) and sought a report within two weeks. The bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and A S Chandurkar said until the report is filed, and SC examines it, Goa govt would not carry out developmental work in the areas which are the subject matter of the Bombay HC order.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi arguing for Goa said if the 2023 order for designating wildlife sanctuaries - Mhadei, Bhagwan Mahavir, Netravali, Cotigao and Bondla - as a 1,000sq-km tiger reserve is implemented, the state would have to earmark one-third of its entire geographical area as a protected zone. ""If in one-third of its geographical area is earmarked as tiger reserve, tigers will roam the streets not human beings,"" Rohatgi said and faulted the HC order for taking recommendation of National Tiger Conservation Authority as gospel truth.In response to the court's query as to whether any steps were taken by forest department pursuant to NTCA's recommendation to the state govt to notify Mhadei-Cotigao wildlife sanctuaries as a tiger reserve, senior counsel Normal Alvares appearing for NGO Goa Foundation said the state responded positively to the recommendation and demarcated 745.18sq-km as tiger reserve, which is why the HC directed it to notify the tiger reserve within three months.Goa State Board for Wildlife has already outlined a proposed core zone of 587sq-km and a buffer zone of 167sq-km within the existing protected areas, where no relocation is required. Alvares told SC the areas for the proposed reserve were already notified as wildlife sanctuaries and national park and that not an inch of Goa's land outside the existing protected areas was to be notified as a tiger reserve as per the area already demarcated by forest department.The bench said this issue would require further examination by the CEC, whose assistance in fact finding is taken by the Supreme Court in environmental matters.",Supreme Court on Monday granted a stay on carrying out any development activities in the proposed tiger reserve areas in state.

AGRA: Semi high-speed trains Gatimaan Express and Vande Bharat, which usually run at 160 kmph, have been operating at a reduced speed of 130 kmph for over a year, largely due to the absence of the Kavach system on the Delhi-Agra rail route. The Railway Board had directed the speed reduction from 160 kmph to 130 kmph (maximum speed) until the automatic train protection system (Kavach) became operational.As per an RTI reply by Indian Railways to TOI, clarified: ""Train numbers 12049, 12050, 12001, 12002, 20171, 20172, 22469 and 22470 are currently being operated at a speed of 130 kmph. As per Railway Board letter no. 2021/Sig/Kavach/Vande Bharat dated June 24, 2024, the above-mentioned trains will be operated at a maximum speed of 130 kmph on the Agra-Delhi section until the automatic train protection (ATP) system becomes operational. ""On June 24, the Railway Board issued a letter and stated the issue of speed of these trains was examined, and specifically mentioned three trains: 20171/20172 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Rani Kamalapati Vande Bharat Express), 22470/22469 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Khajuraho Vande Bharat Express) and 12049/12050 (New Delhi-Virangana Lakshmibai Jhansi Gatimaan Express).Gatiman is India's first semi high-speed train, launched in April 2016 to connect Delhi's Hzt Nizamuddin station with Agra Cantt in just 100 minutes, which runs between Nizamuddin and Jhansi.It used to run at a speed of 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra as tracks were laid there to suit the train's speed. In addition, trains 20171/20172 and 22470/22469 also used to run at 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra.Similarly, New Delhi-Rani Kamalapati Shatabdi Exp (12002/12001) used to run at 150 kmph between Delhi and Agra. The RTI stated the combined ""punctuality of these trains between April 1 and July 31 stood at 77.9%."" Giving details about the Kavach system in the Delhi-Agra section, the RTI added: ""ATP work is in progress in the Palwal-Bhuteshwar section of North Central Railway. Equipment has been installed, energised and RFID tags are fixed at the site. An Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) inspection has been done by the inspecting authority and the ISA report is awaited. ATP work is in progress in Bhuteshwar-Agra section of North Central Railway. Tender awarded on March 31, 2025.""Kavach is an indigenously developed automatic train protection (ATP) system. It is a highly technology-intensive system which requires safety certification of the highest order (SIL-4). This system involves the placement of RFID tags on tracks in station areas and other places, installation of stationary 'Kavach' units at several places such as stations, and installation of towers and antennas along the tracks.","Gatiman is India's first semi high-speed train, launched in April 2016 to connect Delhi's Hzt Nizamuddin station with Agra Cantt in just 100 minutes.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

US tariffs: Trump signs order granting exemptions; zero duties begin Monday for aligned partners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-trump-signs-order-granting-exemptions-zero-duties-begin-monday-for-aligned-partners/articleshow/123736960.cms,"PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports. The move covers offering exemptions covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US. While some trade deals have been announced, exact details of many are yet to emerge.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

On Cam: Indian-Origin Sikh Man Shot Dead In Los Angeles; Video Released By US Police

Poll Should stricter laws be implemented regarding public behavior? Yes, definitely. No, that is unnecessary.





JIND: A 26-year-old man from Haryana's Jind district was shot dead in California, US, after he objected to a man urinating in public on Saturday.The deceased, Kapil, was working as a security guard. Son of Ishwar from Barah Kalan village, Kapil was on duty when he confronted an individual for urinating outside the premises, village sarpanch Suresh Kumar Gautam told TOI. The man, in response, shot him dead on the spot, the sarpanch added.Kapil, the only son of a farming family, had travelled to the US two-and-a-half years ago. He is said to have entered the country in 2022 through the ""donkey route"", crossing the jungles of Panama and scaling the Mexico border wall, a journey that cost his family around Rs 45 lakh. After his initial arrest, he was released through legal proceedings and had since been settled in the country.The family was informed of the death by a relative living in the US. Kapil has two sisters, one of whom is married.""The entire village is standing with the family, but they are deeply broken in this time of grief,"" said sarpanch Gautam.He added that the family plans to meet with the deputy commissioner to demand that Kapil's body be brought back to India. ""We hope for the govt's full support,"" he said.","26-year-old man from Haryana's Jind district was shot dead in California, US.

Third-country visa applications banned

US Tech Jobs Under Fire? Marjorie Greene Demand Ban On Indian Work Visas Amid Tariff Tensions

Appointment delays and tighter processing

Interview waivers eliminated

Proposed duration caps on student visas

Rising scrutiny and consequences

What it means for Indian students

Longer waits for appointments within India.

Loss of flexibility after the ban on third-country applications.

Mandatory interviews for nearly all categories of applicants.

Uncertain academic timelines due to proposed duration limits.

Higher risks of penalties for any breach of visa rules.

Indian students aspiring to study in the United States are facing a sharper set of hurdles after the US government enforced stricter visa application rules, rolled back pandemic-era flexibilities, and moved toward regulatory changes that will significantly reshape how international students live, study, and work in America. These new policies have introduced greater uncertainty and complexity in the application process, affecting not only prospective students but also universities and communities that rely on their presence. As a result, many students now have to navigate increased bureaucratic challenges, higher costs, and longer processing times, all while adapting to evolving legal requirements.The US Department of State has barred all non-immigrant visa applicants, including student (F-1), visitor (B1/B2), and work visas (H-1B, O-1), from applying outside their country of citizenship or legal residence. The directive, effective from early September 2025, ends a pandemic-era practice that had allowed Indian applicants to seek appointments in third countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Germany, or Brazil to bypass heavy backlogs at home.The US clarified that exceptions will apply only in limited circumstances where a country has no functioning US visa operations. This means all Indian applicants are now compelled to apply through US consulates in India, where waiting times already range from over three months in Mumbai and Hyderabad to nine months in Chennai.Education consultancies confirm the fallout. Applicants who had booked or started applications abroad must now refile in India, repay fees, and face longer delays. Industry representatives noted that many Indian students had used third-country applications as a workaround since mid-2025, when securing slots in India became increasingly difficult.The appointment crunch in India has worsened since July 2025, when US missions reduced student visa processing capacity while introducing new digital screening protocols. Though extra slots were later added, waiting times remain high. According to reports from Ahmedabad, approval rates for student visas have fallen below 50 percent, leaving many applicants stranded. Some have been forced to defer admissions or switch destinations altogether.From September 2, the US State Department has also eliminated most non-immigrant visa interview waivers. Children under 14 and seniors over 79, who were previously exempt, must now appear in person for interviews. Indian students applying for F and M visas are required to attend consular interviews without exception.The end of waivers has further strained appointment schedules at US consulates in India, adding another layer of delay and uncertainty for students trying to align their visa approvals with university start dates.Alongside procedural changes, the Department of Homeland Security has proposed ending the long-standing “duration of status” system. Instead of being allowed to remain in the US for as long as their program requires, students would be issued fixed-term visas capped at four years.Those who need more time, for instance, Ph.D. candidates or students on Optional Practical Training, would have to apply for extensions, with additional fees, paperwork, and biometric checks. The draft rule also includes limits on school transfers, bars second degrees at the same or lower level, and restricts the duration of language training.The US Embassy in India has issued repeated warnings to students about strict compliance requirements. Violations such as missing classes, working without authorisation, or failing to maintain full-time enrollment can result in visa revocation, deportation, and permanent bans on future US travel.In Ahmedabad and other centres, students have already reported denials despite confirmed university admissions, and some have been unable to secure interviews altogether. Those missing the current admission cycle face losing an entire academic year.For the more than 330,000 Indian students already in the United States, and thousands preparing to travel, the new measures add up to:The shift underscores a harder line on student mobility. For Indian families investing heavily in US higher education, the path ahead now comes with mounting costs, uncertainty, and the risk of missed opportunities.","The US Department of State has barred all non-immigrant visa applicants, including student (F-1), visitor (B1/B2), and work visas (H-1B, O-1) The directive, effective from early September 2025, ends a pandemic-era practice that had allowed Indian applicants to seek appointments in third countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Germany, or Brazil.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas. These findings reaffirm the state’s importance as a global biodiversity hotspot and highlight the need for continued investment in scientific monitoring and conservation,” said Ngilyang Tam, state’s principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden (wildlife and biodiversity).",Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats.

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Aam Aadmi Party ’s J&K unit chief and Doda MLA Mehraj Malik was on Monday detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on charges of disturbing public order.While the unprecedented action came amid a massive protest against Malik, the lone AAP MLA in J&K Assembly, by govt employees across the district for allegedly using abusive language against Doda district’s deputy commissioner (DC) Harvinder Singh and using a social media platform to target him, the move drew condemnation from political parties, with CM Omar Abdullah describing it as an assault on democracy.“There is no justification for detaining Mehraj Malik under PSA. He’s not a threat to ‘public safety’ & using this discredited law to detain him is wrong. If the unelected govt can use its powers against an elected representative like this then how does anyone expect the people of J&K to continue to have faith in democracy (sic.),” Omar said in a post on X.AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal also took to X and asserted that the MLA would continue raising his voice for the people. “Is demanding a hospital for the people of your area such a grave crime that an elected MLA has to be thrown in jail for it? Mehraj Malik is the lion of AAP,” Kejriwal said in his post.BJP and Sikh bodies, however, had criticised the MLA’s abusive behaviour with public functionaries, terming him a “habitual trouble maker” and calling for action against him.PAS was previously invoked against a number of political functionaries in J&K, including former CMs Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who were detained after the abrogation of Article 370 and held in prolonged custody under the Act, an administrative law that allows a person to be kept in preventive detention for up to two years without charge or trial.Malik, who was held at Dak Bungalow before being shifted to district jail, addressed his followers online, saying, “I am fighting for people’s rights. It is not my family’s fight, it’s the fight for my people.”The row erupted after a police case was registered against the MLA under BNS for removing medical equipment and drugs from a govt-run Ayushman Arogya Mandir, Health and Wellness Centre, in Kencha village. In a statement online, Malik said he had already submitted a request to the Doda chief medical officer to relocate the health centre, as demanded by the people, to a more suitable site. But, at Singh’s behest, an FIR was filed against him for theft, he alleged, accusing the DC of attempting to “favour the mafia”.Protesting govt employees condemned the use of derogatory language and baseless allegations against the DC, terming them as “unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable”, and lauded the officer for his exceptional service, integrity and dedication to public welfare, especially in flood-hit hilly district. The protesters accused the AAP legislator of habitually hurling abuses at senior govt officers and provoking youths against the official machinery.","Mehraj Malik was detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on charges of disturbing public order.

When people’s sentiments came to the fore, the administration’s anger was directed at them instead. First of all, we need answers for the act that led to this situation. What was the need to install that plaque there? The present structure of the Hazratbal shrine was created by Sheikh Abdullah, and you will not find his plaque anywhere,” Omar said.According to NC’s Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah, Jammu and Kashmir police have detained more than 30 people for allegedly defacing a plaque bearing the National Emblem inside Kashmir’s most revered shrine on Friday. Police have not issued any statement on the detentions so far.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said her party would approach Hazratbal police station for the registration of an FIR against Andrabi for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Muslims by placing a plaque with the National Emblem inside the shrine.In a post on X, the former CM claimed PDP had approached “Nigeen police station” to file an FIR “but it was denied”. “I urge @JmuKmrPolice to initiate an FIR immediately given the gravity of the offence — deliberately hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims, thereby provoking them,” Mehbooba said. Her daughter, PDP representative Iltija Mufti, claimed, “Laws in Kashmir are being turned upside down on their head by being applied inversely. Instead of filing an FIR against the waqf chairperson for wilfully hurting religious sentiments of Muslims, police have caved in to her threatening orders by booking 50 civilians. No accountability for her hurtful irresponsible actions.”Andrabi, at the centre of controversy, is visiting shrines. On Sunday evening she visited Aasar-e-Sharif Jinab Sahib Soura Shrine Srinagar. After the visit she wrote on X, “Prayed for peace and harmony for all. Took stock of the ongoing construction works at the shrine campus, including the new grand mosque. Also reviewed facilities for devotees.”At the mausoleum of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah on the latter’s 43rd death anniversary, NC politicians, including education minister Sakina Itoo, said the FIR in the case should be withdrawn and all “detainees should be released”. The minister sought action against the Waqf Board for “misusing the National Emblem”.J&K BJP spokesman Sajid Yousuf Shah said “whatever has happened at the Hazratbal shrine is debatable, whether a plaque with the National Emblem should have been there or not. But attacking the emblem and disrespecting the shrine is condemnable.” “Those who committed this heinous act are backed by political parties to divert public attention to hide their failures.” He said he expected “harsh punishment” for the culprits, “including those glorifying and shielding them”, and demanded that those who had “vandalised the Ashoka emblem must be booked under the PSA (J&K Public Safety Act). ”",Omar Abdullah reiterates that J&K Waqf Board should not have placed a plaque inside the Hazratbal shrine.

The shooting took place at a major intersection at the northern entrance to Jerusalem, on a road that leads to Jewish settlements located in east Jerusalem.The attackers shot people waiting at a bus stop, said the police, while Israeli media reported the attackers also boarded a crowded bus and opened fire inside.Footage from the scene showed commuters fleeing during the morning rush hour as gunfire erupted near a bus stop.Paramedics described chaos, shattered glass, and multiple victims lying unconscious on the road and sidewalk.Israel police reported that two 'terrorists' were 'neutralised' shortly after the assault, though they did not clarify their condition.Hundreds of Israeli security personnel rushed to the area to search for additional attackers or explosives. The military said it has encircled Palestinian villages near Ramallah in the West Bank as part of stepped-up security measures following the attack.Hamas hailed the assault as a 'natural response to the occupation’s crimes,' though it stopped short of claiming direct responsibility.","PM Narendra Modi strongly condemned the heinous terrorist attack on civilians in Israel.

The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.

However, past records of procurement scams suggest the rot may run much deeper.A closer scrutiny of the data reveals that in at least nine districts, procurement figures exceeded actual production reported in 2022-23. In Chhindwara, 7,628 tonnes of pulses were procured this year against a production of 3,074 tonnes in 2022-23.

Justice Sanjeev Narula, however, ruled there was no infirmity in the SRB order as his offence was of the ""gravest order"" and struck at the security of the State. The HC said prolonged incarceration is a relevant factor and the reviewing authority must weigh it, but it cannot prevail over the larger interests of society where the underlying crime was designed to destabilise the State and spread fear among its citizens and international visitors.Sodozey was a close aide of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, one of the principal conspirators in the kidnapping case who was released in 1999 in exchange for passengers aboard the hijacked IC-814. He was convicted in 2002 under the provisions of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), a stringent anti-terror law of that time, besides IPC Foreigners Act, for acting under the banner of the banned terrorist outfit Harqat-ul-Ansar.He was awarded death penalty which the commuted to life imprisonment by SC in 2003.In the recent order, Justice Narula said: ""The petitioner, in concert with his co-conspirators, abducted and held captive four foreign nationals, not for private gain or personal animosity, but with the intent of compelling the sovereign Govt of India to yield to demands of a militant organisation. Such conduct is not merely an ordinary crime but an attack upon the very fabric of civil order, striking at rule of law and the security of the State. The broader objective, employing fear and intimidation to secure political ends, marks this case apart from conventional offences, placing it in a category of exceptional gravity.""The convict argued the maximum prescribed term of incarceration, inclusive of remissions, is capped at 25 years, and havincompleted over two decades in jail, he is eligible under the 2004 policy of Delhi to be released.","Nasir Mohd Sodozey alias Aftaab Ahmed had challenged the Sentence Review Board (SRB) order of June 30, 2023.

""It is, in fact, an achievement of police officers if they succeed in apprehending militants instead of killing them in an encounter,"" the court held, observing that successful arrest of armed militants advances the spirit of govt policy.Justice Jagmohan Bansal passed the order on Sept 4 while allowing a petition filed by Sonam Kamboj of Bathinda district, who was considered ineligible for recruitment to the Punjab police under a category reserved for wards of police personnel who have taken part in at least three encounters.In 2021, Punjab police invited applications for several posts, including sub-inspectors and intelligence officers. Kamboj, the daughter of a serving police officer, applied under the quota for wards.However, her claim was rejected by a committee constituted by the Punjab DGP, which concluded that her father had participated in only two encounters, whereas the 1996 policy laid down three. The state argued that one of the FIRs cited by the petitioner could not be treated as an encounter since no exchange of fire took place, even though four militants were arrested.As per the state, ""encounter"" means an exchange of gunfire between terrorists and police which results in a casualty.After hearing all the parties, HC held that the 1996 policy is a piece of beneficial legislation and its interpretation by Punjab govt seems to be ""pedantic and un-holistic"". The court observed that the object of the policy was to encourage as well as protect sincere and brave police officers. The expression ""encounter with terrorists"" cannot be interpreted in a way that there should be gunfire and casualty.""In the instant case, the police party was successful in apprehending four militants with arms and anti-national material.

"Accept Aadhaar as voter ID proof, SC directs EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accept-aadhaar-as-voter-id-proof-sc-directs-ec/articleshow/123775716.cms,"NEW DELHI: Accepting a major demand of the opposition, the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the Election Commission to accept Aadhaar cards, in addition to the 11 documents specified under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), as a proof of identity of a person to enable him to file application for inclusion in the Bihar electoral roll.After hearing senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who complained that EC was acting contrary to a series of directions by SC to accept Aadhaar as proof of identity, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered, ""Aadhaar cards shall be accepted as proof of identity of a person for filing applications for inclusion/exclusion of names from the voter list. It shall be treated as the 12th document (under SIR).""The direction for inclusion of Aadhaar as a document in addition to the 11 allowed by EC came after the poll panel's strong resistance to the petitioners' repeated pleas for acceptance of Aadhaar as an identification document. Justices Kant and Bagchi said Aadhaar card is not alien to the Representation of People Act as one of its provisions provides for Aadhaar as identity proof.The Election Commission through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told the bench that of a total of 7.24 crore names included in the draft Bihar voter list, 99.6% of voters have submitted one of the 11 documents specified under SIR. ""The clamour for making Aadhaar as an identity document is probably to include illegal migrants in the voter list without verification of their citizenship,"" he said.The bench took note of the EC's concern and said, ""The authorities concerned will verify the genuineness of Aadhaar cards like any other document submitted by a person seeking inclusion or exclusion of name from the voter list and that Aadhaar will not be considered a proof of citizenship."" It posted the matter for further hearing on Sept 15.EC, which was also being represented senior advocate Maninder Singh, told the bench that opposition parties have not been able to point out any serious lapse with regard to 65 lakh exclusions on the triple counts of death, permanent migration and dual enrolment. Dwivedi and Singh said RJD, leader of the opposition alliance in Bihar, has alleged mistakes with regard to only 265 names.SC also issued notice to EC on an application by Ashwini Upadhyay seeking intensive revision of electoral rolls in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. The Mamata Banerjee govt has already filed a petition in SC against SIR in Bengal.When EC said Aadhaar is forged by illegal migrants, the bench said there are instances of even the other 11 documents, including passport and birth certificate, being forged.""Those who are claiming citizenship based on forged documents would have to be eliminated after scrutiny. No illegal migrant can be included in the voter list,"" the court said. The bench said EC revision manual suggests passport and birth certificate as proof of identity but to make the electoral roll inclusive, the commission went beyond these two to specify 11 documents which could be relied upon as identity proof. The top court asked EC to issue necessary directions to the booth-level officers (BLOs) to accept Aadhaar as an identity proof for those seeking inclusion and exclusion of names from voter list.",The Supreme Court on Monday ordered the Election Commission to accept Aadhaar cards as a proof of identity of a person to enable him to file application for inclusion in the Bihar electoral roll. The direction for inclusion of Aadhaar as a document in addition to the 11 allowed by EC came after the poll panel's strong resistance to the petitioners' repeated pleas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123775761,imgsize-130487,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"
Delhi labourer is marathon champ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-labourer-is-marathon-champ/articleshow/123774988.cms,"Rohit Kumar working at a construction site in Delhi (Image: Rohit Kumar)

DEHRADUN: At a construction site in Delhi, Rohit Kumar can sometimes be spotted running with bricks on his back. A resident of Bihar's Khagaria, he may look like another labourer battling at a work site. But Kumar is also a marathon runner.The 32-year-old has secured podium finishes in at least seven marathons, including Lucknow, Dehradun and Prayagraj. His latest feat - finishing second in a gruelling high-altitude marathon in Spiti in Aug - even took the Indian Army by surprise.Commending his effort, Army's Uttar Bharat posted on X: ""At just 32, Rohit Kumar, a daily wage labourer from Delhi, doesn't chase records or sponsorships. He runs to survive, fuelled by necessity, not luxury... No coach, no fancy gear. Just raw resolve.""Kumar said he has run in over 100 marathons, averaging five a month. ""Now I am focusing on quality runs. That is why I participated in the high-altitude Spiti marathon organised by the Army, where I finished second in the 77 km Kunzum La-Kaza Ultra under the Surya Spiti Challenge,"" he told TOI.His timing in the male open category was 7:48:52, close to winner Nikhil Singh's 7:42:44.Impressed, the Army has offered him support for future runs. ""I have been invited to another high-altitude marathon in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh. They assured me of covering my travel, food and lodging. Hopefully, I will get another podium finish,"" he added.Kumar's story could have been different. After enrolling in a medical course in Russia, he spent two years there before money ran out & his farmer-parents called him back in 2017. Struggling to find jobs back home, he took work at construction sites.In 2020, stuck indoors during Covid, he began watching videos of global marathons in New York, London and Tokyo. Inspired, he started training, squeezing time between hard labour shifts. His day begins at 4.30am with running, followed by construction work from 8 am to 5 pm, where carrying loads up floors doubles as endurance training. In the evening, he swims for an hour before cooking dinner and resting.Kumar now dreams of representing India in the Triathlon at the 2028 LA Olympics. ""I spend Rs 20,000 a month on diet and equipment from my Rs 30,000 earnings to realise this dream,"" he said.Assuring all support to Kumar, PRO Defence (Dehradun), Lt Col Manish Srivastava said, “The Indian Army is always there to support such raw talents who have the potential to make the country proud in sporting events on national and international levels. Kumar, too, will get all the support to help him excel and achieve his Olympics dream.”","Rohit Kumar, 32, has run in over 100 marathons, averaging five a month.

Aryna Sabalenka has been open about navigating personal tragedy while continuing to dominate the tennis world. Following the sudden passing of her ex-boyfriend, Konstantin Koltsov, in March 2024, the Belarusian star found support in a new relationship with Brazilian entrepreneur Georgios Frangulis. The two went public in spring 2024, and since then, he has become a familiar face courtside, cheering her on at major tournaments.Aryna Sabalenka admitted that her new relationship came during an incredibly difficult chapter in her life. She credited Georgios Frangulis with helping her focus on joy beyond the pressures of tennis.“There was a really tough period where I was really happy to have him by my side, always cheering me up, always making sure that we are doing some fun stuff,” Sabalenka told People. “But I make sure I kind of forget about tennis and focus on the good things and enjoy my life. Even when things are going wrong in my career. So yeah, he was my biggest support and yeah, really happy to have him by my side.”Their relationship became public when they were first pictured together in April 2024. Since then, Frangulis has been spotted regularly in her player’s box, including at her title run at the 2024 US Open.Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, to a Greek family originally from Thessaloniki, Frangulis pursued law at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado but never became a lawyer. His passion was always in entrepreneurship. After graduating in 2014, he moved to the United States, first living in Miami and later in California.A spiritual person, Frangulis has spoken about how faith shaped his outlook. “I go to church a lot, talking to God does me good. I was influenced by both branches of the family. The spiritual side has always been important to me – as well as intuition,” he told Forbes Brazil.In 2016, Frangulis founded Oakberry, an açaí-based brand that has since expanded worldwide. Known for its bowls and smoothies, Oakberry now has hundreds of locations across more than 40 countries. By January 2024, Sabalenka herself became an ambassador for the brand, later launching her own signature bowl.“Most of the time I go for Oakberry bowl; I think it's healthy and a good thing to start your day,” Sabalenka said in an interview. “It has everything you [want]: protein, carbs, vitamins, fruit. It's like an energy bowl, so I feel ready to go after I have it.”Beyond business, Frangulis balances his entrepreneurial career with his passion for motorsports. He has raced in Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge events and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, finding in racing both adrenaline and escape.Georgios Frangulis has a visible presence in Aryna Sabalenka’s careerWhile Oakberry has sponsored tennis tournaments before, Frangulis admitted the experience of sitting in Sabalenka’s box is far more intense. “The toughest part is being in the box. It’s one of the most stressful situations I’ve ever experienced,” he said.“I never say anything during matches. I try not to show too much emotion, because Aryna notices everything – what everyone is doing in the box. I just clap as loudly as I can and make sure she feels supported.”Also Read: Who is Naomi Osaka’s husband?

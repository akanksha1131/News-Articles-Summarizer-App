NEP push ignites DMK-BJP row as Congress watches from sidelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep-push-ignites-dmk-bjp-row-as-congress-watches-from-sidelines/articleshow/118657136.cms,"DMK workers protest last week against Hindi ‘imposition’ (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu’s protest over the withholding of central funds for schemes under Right to Education and Modi govt’s linking of these funds to implementation of the NEP by states, has reignited the “language war”. It’s a full-blown showdown between BJP and DMK for now, but there’s growing anxiety about whether it could force other players to take sides, adding to the already volatile political mix.When CM M K Stalin wrote to PM Modi, demanding release of Rs 2,512 crore for RTE schemes, Centre pointed to TN’s non-implementation of NEP. Stalin shot back, declaring he would not agree to the “imposition of Hindi” even for many more crores. Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan reacted, telling Stalin: “NEP 2020 upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures students continue to learn in the language of their choice.”The north-south dimension of the issue is pronounced. Southern states like Karnataka and Kerala, and even others, take pride in their local languages and are receptive to suggestions that the north is imposing itself further — this, after having cornered political power post-Independence. Stalin’s remarks reflect DMK’s long-standing commitment to a two-language policy — Tamil and English — rooted in the state’s Dravidian ethos and its historical resistance to Hindi dating back to the anti-Hindi agitations of the 1930s and 1960s.The lure of language as a political weapon is evident. Since TN upped the ante, Punjab in the north and Telangana in the south have announced that Punjabi and Telugu, respectively, would be compulsory main languages in schools.The political edge to this spat has left the protagonists wary. While BJP is enthusiastic about Hindi, it also realises it cannot endear itself to the local population in the south by reinforcing its image as the party of north India. It is a key player in the bipolar politics of Karnataka, increasingly strong in Telangana, and is making an eager push in TN, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh by hoping to win over allies.The tightrope walk for BJP was evident when its TN chief K Annamalai alleged DMK was “deliberately misconstruing the NEP for political gains”. It has stressed in the southern states that the DMK’s allegation of Hindi imposition is without a basis as the three-language, which was first rolled out under Congress govts, focuses on the promotion of all Indian languages, rather than a specific one.Congress, meanwhile, has chosen to watch the battle from the sidelines. Party functionaries privately argue there is merit in DMK’s allegations, pointing to how acronyms of central schemes — and even the three new IPC-CrPC laws (Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita) — are chaste Hindi, without English equivalents. They call this new trend insensitive to southern sentiments, warning that it risks rekindling fears of “cultural imperialism”. They believe the row, if protracted, could also touch a raw nerve in the north-eastern states.However, the principal opposition party is mindful that it is a north Indian party and cannot take a position where it is perceived as “anti-Hindi”. This is why AICC has adopted anuanced stance on the language issue. Many point to the historical handicap that national parties like Congress, which must cater to all regions, are saddled with — unlike regional parties, which can pander to very local sentiments.This paradox was m ost evident in the 1990s when Samajwadi Party mascot Mulayam Singh Yadav crossed swords with late DMK neta M K Karunanidhi over the language issue, despite being allies at the Centre. The alliance along “secular vs communal” lines persists even today, though SP has since moderated its Hindi impulses by not joining the issue in recent years.Despite lingering concerns, Congress sources claimed the risk of a blowback is minimal, as language has not been a significant issue in the north for many years. They believe political planks in upcoming elections — like Bihar and Kerala — will revolve around caste census, social justice and anti-incumbency, rather than language.BJP will not make Congress’s tactical silence a big issue because it does not want its southern push to be hurt. But at the grassroots level, it will highlight Congress’s refusal to distance itself from Stalin in the same way it talked up DMK’s anti-Sanatan stand and Congress’s disinclination to disengage itself from it.","Tamil Nadu’s protest over the withholding of central funds for schemes under Right to Education has reignited the ‘language war’ The north-south dimension of the issue is pronounced.

Troops now have 365 days to eliminate 'last of the Maoists',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/troops-now-have-365-days-to-eliminate-last-of-the-maoists/articleshow/118654879.cms,"IGP Sundarraj said the door is open for Maoists to shun violence and surrender, or have a final face-off with security forces

RAIPUR: The 365-day countdown for the Centre's deadline for elimination of Maoists has begun.Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI on Saturday that 310 Maoists had been killed since Jan 2024 and that there are barely ""400 regular armed cadres"" left in Bastar division. A total of 385 Maoists have been slain since 2021, which means the bulk of them were killed in the last year.Even the Maoist central committee is greatly weakened and has only 12-14 active commanders left, he added. These numbers give security agencies confidence that they will be able to meet Union home minister Amit Shah's vow to eradicate naxalism by March 2026. Bastar division now has only around 1,200 Maoists left, the IG said, adding, ""The door is open for them to shun violence and surrender, or have a final face-off with security forces.""""With 385 naxalites killed since 2021, Bastar is left with around 400 regular armed cadres. The remaining 700-800 are militia men who serve as a support system, members of the cultural wing, like Chetna Natya Manch and Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangh (DAKMS). The central committee is also shrinking. Our major concern, as well as target, are the uniformed ones, mostly in PLGA formations , and senior-level cadres of Battalion 1,"" P Sundarraj told TOI.Battalion 1 is headed by dreaded Maoist commander Madvi Hidma, whose home turf is now bristling with security forces, and where basic needs, like roads, water and electricity, are pouring in, thanks to the establishment of police camps.Many central committee members have died due to age-related ailments or have been arrested in the past four years, and those left will also be eliminated automatically with the end of naxals, said police. Sundarraj said that militia members often turn out to be just as dangerous as hard-core PLGA cadres, but the focus is to bring them to the mainstream as they understand the phrase ""Jiska Dum Uske Hum (We stand with the powerful)"". ""They realise they are being used as a tool. Once they are on this side of the fence, they only want development and facilities,"" the IG added.Former Maoist Badranna, who now lives in Jagdalpur, said he believes real solution to naxalism is peace talks.Security experts, however, told TOI that these numbers are just a perception and it's not possible to have an exact naxal cadre count. ""For sure, Maoists have suffered massive losses of late and have been pushed to the brink. Their aggression is almost depleted, yet it's a long fight ahead,"" an internal security veteran cautioned.""If naxalism comes to an end next year, no one can guarantee that no violence will happen after March 31, 2026, but the focus is not based on a single-point agenda. The area of their dominance has decreased, their strength is not the same, security camps are bringing about development that people want, so we are hopeful of reaching the desired goal,"" said IG Sundarraj.","Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI that 310 Maoists had been killed since Jan 2024.

NEW DELHI: India's aim to emerge as a developed country by 2047 is a "" realisable ambition"", said Arvind Panagariya , chairman of the 16th Finance Commission , while also stressing that the country's per capita income would need to grow at 7.3% in dollar terms to achieve the threshold of $14,000 over the next 24 years.""Certainly if we do the right things in the years to come, our prospects of getting to the Viksit Bharat ambition of the PM is very much realisable dream and realisable ambition,"" he said on Saturday in his address at the 49th Civil Accounts Day.He said the country's per-capita income, in 2023-24 dollar terms, is about $ 2,570, which is very low compared to countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, China, United States and other European nations. ""What that means is that India has the advantage that it is feasible even with existing technology, reasonable capital accumulation and skill acquisition to push the per capita income. India because of its current low per capita income has an enormous room for catch up and that catch up gives it the opportunity to grow significantly faster,"" said Panagariya.The Columbia University professor said India has gone on to gradually improve its governance system and a lot of economic reforms that had to be done have been done. He said more reforms need to be done and those will happen and this will enable India to sustain high growth rates.""Today, our per capita income in dollars is about $ 2,500. To get to $ 14,000 in 24 years or by 2047-48, what growth rate do I need for per capita income?.. my per capita income from 2023-24 onward has to grow annually at 7.3%,"" he said, adding that the $14,000 was the threshold set by the World Bank for defining developed countries.Panagariya, who has served as the first chairman of govt think tank Niti Aayog, cited United Nations data which has estimated that population in the country would grow 0.6% by 2050. He said that this would mean that to achieve a 7.3% growth in per capita income, India's GDP will have to grow at 7.9% during the next 24 years.""Our growth rate (in real dollar terms) for the last 21 years was at 7.8%...

From two moms to none: Why 4-month-old HIV+ Mumbai baby is nobody's child,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-two-moms-to-none-why-4-month-old-hiv-mumbai-baby-is-nobodys-child/articleshow/118654518.cms,"Representative image

NAVI MUMBAI: A four-month-old baby girl has become nobody's child after a Hindu woman delivered her at KEM Hospital by fraudulently using the Aadhaar card of a Muslim woman who wanted to adopt the baby without going through the long, legal adoption procedure.The Muslim woman wanted to have another child for herself following a miscarriage during her second pregnancy, and the Hindu woman, who was pregnant, did not want the child as she said her husband was a drug addict. So they struck a deal.On getting a firm assurance from the Muslim woman that she would adopt the child, the Hindu woman delivered the baby using the Muslim woman's Aadhaar card. However, the baby is now ill and was in January detected as HIV positive at Wadia Hospital, so the Muslim woman doesn't want her anymore.While the baby has currently been admitted to a hospital in Kalwa, the state's women and child welfare department has lodged a zero FIR against both women for giving up or accepting and selling or buying a child illegally under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and for cheating with common intention under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Police said the mother of the baby girl and the Muslim woman live in the same neighbourhood in Kalyan. It was six months into her pregnancy that the woman told the Muslim woman that she did not want to have the child, which was when the Muslim woman offered to adopt the child. Using the Muslim woman's identity card, the Hindu woman delivered the baby in October 2024 at KEM Hospital. A birth certificate was issued bearing the name of a Muslim girl and mentioning the Muslim woman as her mother.Five days after discharge from hospital, the Muslim woman took the child home. The baby underwent an appendicitis surgery at Wadia Hospital in Jan this year, where she was detected as being HIV positive. Following this, the Muslim woman was taken for HIV tests. Having learnt of the baby's HIV infection, though, the Muslim woman disowned the baby and revealed the details of how she had got her to the hospital staffers, who alerted the local Sakhi centre of the women and child welfare department in Mumbai.Thereafter, on February 21, an email was sent by the local Sakhi centre giving details about the case to the Thane district child protection helpline.The child protection committee staffers could not trace the Muslim woman but succeeded in obtaining the cell number of the woman who gave birth to her. Accordingly, a zero FIR was filed with Manpada police station in Thane on Feb 28. The case has been transferred to Bhoiwada PS in Mumbai for further investigation.An officer of Thane district child protection committee said, ""People should follow adoption rules, and adoption complexities also need to be relaxed through the intervention of the women and child welfare department. This case raises questions about the identity checks of pregnant women who get admitted to govt-run premier hospitals for delivery.""Activists have long been demanding inquiries into such illegal adoptions which may be happening in hospitals, maternity homes, and clinics.","A four-month-old baby girl has become nobody's child after a Hindu woman delivered her at KEM Hospital by fraudulently using the identity card of a Muslim woman.

DAHOD (GUJARAT): In the next one month, India will get the country's most powerful and modern rail engine with 9,000 horsepower (HP) that can pull freight trains with a load of 4,500-5,000 tonnes and at top speed of 100 kmph.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, while reviewing the progress of the electric locomotive production at Dahod Workshop on Saturday, said 89% of the engine that is ready for the launch has the Made in India component. This is the first loco factory in Gujarat.“I throw a challenge to engineers and technical professionals to achieve 100% Make in India engines. There is a huge potential for export of these engines. The first loco will be ready for launch in 30-40 days,” Vaishnaw said at the factory.Increasing the speed of freight trains remains a major concern for the railways. To increase average speed of freight trains and faster clearance of tracks to operate more trains, railways needs to deploy more high HP and high-speed locomotives.In 2020, railways had manufactured 12,000 HP electric locomotives at Electric Locomotive Factory in Madhepura (Bihar). But this model has two engines compared to the ones being manufactured at Dahod that have single engines.“So, the new one that will be rolled out will be the most powerful engine of railways in India. Now, the introduction of these 9,000 HP engines will help to bring revolution in freight operations. The locomotives, being manufactured at Dahod will be compatible with digital tracking system, Kavach, green features with 3-phase propulsion system,” a railway official said.Railway ministry said the Dahod workshop will manufacture broad gauge electric locomotives for Indian Railways and standard gauge electric locomotives for the export market.Earlier in the day, Vaishnaw reviewed the progress of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai Bullet Train project, including the upcoming station at Anand and inspected a steel bridge comprising two spans across NH-48. Each span weighs 1,500 tonnes and has been fabricated at a workshop near Hapur in Uttar Pradesh.The jointing of steel members using specialised bolts that has been designed for a 100-year lifespan.The minister also reviewed the progress of the Ahmedabad station redevelopment project.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said 89% of the engine that is ready for the launch has the Made in India component.

AI Express starts flights from Hindon Airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-express-starts-flights-from-hindon-airport/articleshow/118650224.cms,"NEW DELHI: Residents of Ghaziabad and nearby places now have the option of flying direct to many parts of India from Hindon Airport . Air India Express on Saturday operated it first Kolkata-Hindon-Goa flight, making its 180-seater Boeing 737 MAX the biggest passenger aircraft to operate from this defence enclave. While inaugurating the service, Union aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said, “One day, I hope to see Hindon to London flights .” The direct connectivity from western UP’s Hindon comes months before the upcoming Noida International Airport at Greater Noida’s Jewar becomes operational later this summer.AI Express , which became the first big airline to operate from both the IGI Airport and Hindon, will start operating 40 weekly direct flights from Hindon to Bengaluru, Chennai, Goa, Jammu and Kolkata by March 22, 2025. For a few days this month starting March 10, the airline will also operate a thrice weekly Hindon-Mumbai flight. The airline sees the entire north/east Delhi NCR, western UP’s Ghaziabad, Meerut and Noida as key catchment areas.Minister Naidu said: “With the addition of Hindon to its growing network, Air India Express is not only strengthening connectivity but also offering greater flexibility across the NCR. The launch of services from Hindon will complement existing operations at IGI Airport, reflecting Govt’s vision of expanding aviation infrastructure to meet the growing demand for air travel.”Commercial operations from Hindon Bega just before Covid in October 2019 when a now defunct airline connected the airport to Pithoragarh. While smaller regional airlines have not been very successful so far in India, Hindon got stable operations when Star Air, the aviation arm of Sanjay Ghodawat group, started operating here. Star Air currently connects Hindon to Adampur, Nanded, Kishangarh, Pune and Bengaluru with its 76-seater Embraer E175 aircraft. AI Express’ 180-seater B737 is the biggest commercial airliner to operate so far from this defence enclave.“Commercial operations to and from Hindon as of now happen from sunrise to sunset. The airport can handle one flight in an hour so the six flights AI Express will have from later this month have been staggered,” said sources.Aloke Singh, AI Express MD, said, “The launch of our operations from Hindon marks another milestone in our network expansion journey. Hindon serves a vast catchment area covering Eastern and Northern geography of the Delhi NCR, besides Ghaziabad and western parts of UP. As the Indian air market grows and matures, metropolitan regions can be served by multiple airports as we see in cities like London, New York and Tokyo. The services from Hindon will complement our extensive operations from Indira Gandhi International Airport, from where we serve 18 domestic and four international destinations. As our fleet crosses the 100 aircraft mark, we continue our journey of expansion and remain dedicated to offering a seamless and affordable flying experience across India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.""","Air India Express on Saturday operated it first Kolkata-Hindon-Goa flight.

DEHRADUN: Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas , had already emptied out when disaster struck. By the time an avalanche crashed down the Mana-Ghastoli route on Friday morning, smothering everything in its path, the roads were deserted, the homes abandoned. As a result, not many heard the sound of ice fracturing, snow cascading, and the earth shuddering under its weight. They are now counting their blessings.The villagers' migration, a ritual dictated by centuries of wisdom, is more than tradition - it is survival. The Himalayas demand deference, and the people of Mana have long known when to step aside. ""We are fortunate we had shifted to lower locations; otherwise, many people could have been trapped,"" said Pitambhar Molpha , the village headman.Each Nov, as the doors of the Badrinath temple close, the residents of Mana undertake their annual migration, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape the harsh winter. They move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district. They return only when the Badrinath yatra is about to begin.The avalanche - just 500 metres from the village - was neither the first nor the last. ""Avalanches have been reported here in Feb and March before,"" Molpha said. ""At this time of year, workers are engaged in removing snow from the main routes. There is also an army camp near our village.""For those who leave, there is always the lingering question of what remains. Sandeep Aswal, who runs a tea stall - once known as the 'last tea stall of the country' and now rebranded as the 'first tea stall' - has watched tourists come and go, drawn by Mana's mystique. ""It is an unfortunate incident. Since the village is empty, we don't have any updates on whether the avalanche impacted the area. But we feel blessed that all 400 families had already moved,"" he said.","Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas, had already emptied out when disaster struck.

A division bench comprising Justice MM Sundresh and Justice Rajesh Bindal said the prosecution failed to present conclusive evidence linking Bhanmati to the crime.SC found flaws in the lower courts’ reasoning, particularly their reliance on the recovery of a “gandasi” (axe) as evidence. It said the axe was found much later than the victim’s body and that there were no fingerprints of the accused on it.“Suffice it is to state that the materials presented by the prosecution are not sufficient enough to unerringly point out the guilt on the part of the appellant alone,” SC ruled.The case dates back to December 11, 2002, when the body of a four-and-a-half-year-old boy was discovered in a village well in Kila-Jaffargarh of Jind.The boy’s father lodged an FIR next day and during the probe , Bhanmati was accused of the crime. She was convicted by the trial court, a decision later upheld by a division bench of HC comprising Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Shekhar Dhawan.Advocate Ram Naresh Yadav, who represented Bhanmati in SC, argued the evidence was inadequate. “Even assuming the recovery to be true, it alone would not be sufficient, as there is no evidence to show that it was used for committing the offence,” he contended. The prosecution had claimed Bhanmati committed the crime due to a family dispute, alleging the mother of the deceased had been beating her children.However, SC found this motive unconvincing. Even at that point of time, the appellant was a middle-aged woman and her children were major while the deceased was only 4.5 years old, the bench said.","The case dates back to December 11, 2002, when the body of a four-and-a-half- year-old boy was discovered in a village well.

.

Four years ago, I left a toxic relationship that drained me. Soon after, I met someone who unknowingly gave me everything I needed — love, care, and unwavering support. He treats me like a life partner in every way except one: he has never said “I love you” and is firmly against marriage. He fears its responsibilities and is certain he wants to remain unmarried, while I want to marry him. This has led to repeated arguments. Now, my strict desi parents want to start looking for a match but have given me a chance to speak up if there’s someone in my life. I love him deeply and can’t imagine anyone else, yet I can’t tell them about him because, while there’s love, there’s no commitment. Hoping things might change, I recently moved in with him, but I don’t know if it will. I can’t leave him, but I also don’t want to hurt my parents. I feel completely torn. What should I do?— AnonymousFinding a loving partner, especially after a difficult relationship, seems like nothing short of a blessing. But it sounds like you’re in a deeply emotional and complex situation, feeling torn between your love for your partner and your commitment to your parents. It may help to explore what exactly about marriage makes him hesitant — does he fear the responsibilities it brings or is it the institution itself that he resists? Knowing the reasons behind resistance to a particular thing helps us navigate through it better. Moreover, reflecting on your feelings about marriage will help you communicate your needs better. Think about what marriage means to you beyond family and societal expectations. Does it provide a sense of security, validation, or something deeper? You might also consider discussing whether there’s a way to create a meaningful commitment that aligns with both of your values. After all, working through and resolving this situation would need understanding and compromise from both ends. If only one of you is expected to let go, it can lead to resentment towards the other over a period of time.After my grandmother passed away in 2020, I was eager to get married and asked my parents to start looking for a girl for marriage, unsure about caste preferences. They told me my earnings weren’t good enough. Over the next few years, I worked hard, secured a decent package, and asked again — only to receive no response from family and encounter fake profiles online. Now, at 34, after all this hassle, marriage feels pointless. Why should I struggle to impress someone I don’t even know when the chances seem so slim? Instead, I wonder if I could just adopt a child later because for me, the only thing a marriage could facilitate is that I could become a father, friend and mentor. I’m confused — why do people marry, and do I need to? Please help.— AnonymousThe decision to marry or not is deeply personal even though we’re told otherwise, many times. This also means that it is completely valid to wonder if this path is right for you. Questioning the purpose of being in a marriage when it doesn’t feel like an obvious decision to make is healthy, and can help you arrive at a conclusion that aligns with your goals. It can help to ask yourself a few questions like beyond fatherhood, what aspects of companionship and partnership matter to you? Would you feel fulfilled in the long run without a life partner, or might you eventually miss the emotional intimacy that a life partner is likely to bring in? Before you conclude that marriage is not for you, I would also encourage you to reflect on how comfortable you feel in looking for a like-minded partner beyond traditional match-making methods. Lastly, if adoption feels like a meaningful path, it may help to research the legalities and emotional aspects of raising a child as a single parent in India. Take your time to define what a fulfilling life looks like for you.I’m in my 40s, married, with children, and doing well in both work and family life. For the past few years, I’ve been in constant contact with a former colleague — junior and single. We share a deep bond, consider each other soulmates and talk regularly. She’s independent, respects me and reciprocates our connection. I support her mentally and financially when I can, and I genuinely like her but I’m unsure where this is heading. Neither of us has expressed our feelings, yet this overwhelms me and leaves me with a sense of emptiness. My spouse is aware and often taunts me about it. How do I resolve this?— AnonymousIt’s natural to feel drawn to someone outside your marriage, especially when that connection feels effortless and fulfilling. Often, this is because these connections don’t carry the same responsibilities, conflicts and daily struggles unlike marriages. Similarly, a lot of times, the qualities of the other person that we admire are also the ones we see missing in our marriage. While this may or may not be true for you, I would encourage you to reflect on this. Journalling, counselling and even a conversation with your colleague on where this is headed can provide clarity. Moreover, consider the impact of continuing this dynamic on yourself, your family and even your colleague. The fact that your spouse is aware and calls it out is a sign that it is somewhere already affecting your household. Reflect on whether this relationship aligns with your values and long-term happiness. Understanding what you truly seek, without escaping into an illusion of perfection, will guide your next steps.","I left a toxic relationship that drained me.

The Supreme Court granted relief to rape convict Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh by rejecting a Public Interest Litigation that contested his numerous interim releases through parole and furlough between 2022 and 2024.The Court observed that the PIL specifically concerned a furlough granted to Ram Rahim in 2023 and questioned why it was being challenged in 2025. Additionally, the Court raised concerns about the maintainability of the PIL, questioning its basis as it was filed against an individual and lacked a clear public interest.The Court was hearing a plea by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, which accused the Haryana government of misusing its powers under Section 11 of the Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act, 2022, to grant temporary release to the Dera Sacha Sauda chief.Gurmeet Ram Rahim is serving a sentence following his conviction by a CBI court in Panchkula on Aug 25, 2017, for the rape of two women disciples, for which he received two 20-year prison terms. He is also serving a sentence in the murder case of a journalist.","Supreme Court granted relief to rape convict Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

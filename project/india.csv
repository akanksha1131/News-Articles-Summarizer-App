"India losing its sunshine to cloud cover, bad air: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-losing-its-sunshine-to-cloud-cover-bad-air-study/articleshow/124402640.cms,"Representative image

PUNE: If this year's prolonged monsoon and endless overcast skies have made it feel like the Sun has gone missing, there is data to back up the impression.In a new study by Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and India Meteorological Department (IMD), among others, scientists have found that sunshine hours across most parts of India have been steadily declining over the past three decades - a trend linked to thicker cloud cover and rising aerosol pollution.The research, published in ""Nature's Scientific Reports"" this month, examined sunshine-hour data from 20 met stations across nine regions between 1988 and 2018. It found the annual sunshine hours - the duration when sunlight is strong enough to be recorded as a sunshine hour - have declined in all regions, except northeast where a marginal seasonal ""levelling off"" was seen.BHU scientist Manoj K Srivastava told TOI: ""On average, the west coast saw sunshine hours fall by 8.6 hours per year, while the north Indian plains recorded the steepest drop at 13.1 hours a year.""""The east coast and Deccan plateau also showed declining trends of 4.9 and 3.1 hours per year, respectively. Even the central inland region showed a loss of about 4.7 hours per year.""The study said sunshine increased between Oct and May - the drier months - but declined sharply from June to Sept, coinciding with the monsoon. The scientists associated with the study attributed the long-term ""solar dimming"" to higher aerosol concentrations - tiny particles released from industrial emissions, biomass burning and vehicular pollution.""These aerosols act as condensation nuclei, creating smaller and longer-lived cloud droplets that keep skies overcast for extended periods. This year's monsoon, too, has been marked by persistently cloudy skies across much of India, especially over the west coast, central India and Deccan plateau, which saw frequent overcast conditions even on days without rain. Though the study period spans till 2018, trends remain just as relevant today, as the same haze, humidity and cloud patterns persist - if anything, more strongly than before,"" one scientist said.""Higher aerosol numbers increase the residence time of clouds in the atmosphere, reducing the hours of sunlight reaching the ground,"" Srivastava said. The scientists said the decline in sunshine hours has major implications for solar energy generation, agriculture and climate modelling. While India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing solar markets, reduced solar incidence could affect power output and long-term planning for renewable infrastructure.",Sunshine hours across most parts of India have been steadily declining over the past three decades.

Serious issues with IHFL's financial transactions: ED to Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/serious-issues-with-ihfls-financial-transactions-ed-to-supreme-court/articleshow/124402436.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The ED on Wednesday flagged serious irregularities in the financial transactions of Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL), now known as Sammaan Capital Ltd, even as an NGO told the Supreme Court that the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) had condoned a litany of corporate governance irregularities by IHFL, brushing aside market regulator Sebi's adverse reports.Notwithstanding sneering objections to the allegations made by the NGO, Citizens' Whistleblowers Forum, from senior advocate Harish Salve, who was appearing for Indiabulls, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh asked a 'responsible officer' from MCA to remain present with the original files of IHFL in court on Nov 19. ""We would like to see the original records of the ministry of corporate affairs relating to compounding of irregularities referred to by SEBI in its report. We would also like to know in which all cases you (MCA) have been so magnanimous in condoning corporate governance violations,"" the bench said.Additional solicitor general S V Raju, along with advocate A Venkatesh Rao, told SC ""there is something seriously wrong in this case."" The bench directed ED to clarify the stand taken by CBI in an affidavit that there was prima facie evidence of money laundering activities by IHFL.It also asked the ED to explain the steps taken by it pursuant to the CBI affidavit.For the NGO, Prashant Bhushan attempted to detail the allegedly surreptitious activities of IHFL in conspiracy with various realtors and banks. Salve termed the case as 'blackmail litigation' and said the petition was ""nothing but a cut-paste of another similar petition which was dismissed by the Delhi HC."" Salve said the entire loan amount advanced has been recovered, while A M Singhvi said seven agencies had investigated the cases against IHFL and given it a clean chit.Bhushan recalled that a Justice Kant-led bench had recently permitted CBI to register FIRs against seven realtors for abusing the subvention scheme to defraud homebuyers, and said Indiabulls, in criminal conspiracy with the Vatika group, has similarly defrauded flat buyers, with Sebi giving a detailed report on these and other irregularities by IHFL to MCA, which instead compounded 200 acts of misdeeds.The ED, in its probe status report, detailed the allegedly dubious deals of IHFL with Yes Bank and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation involving proceeds of crime (POC) worth Rs 5,333 crore; with Gautam Thapar-led Avantha group involving POC of Rs 307 cr; and with Americorp group that took loans worth Rs 9,480 cr from IHFL to invest in shares of Indiabulls to hike its price and earn profits worth Rs 532 crore.","The ED flagged serious irregularities in the financial transactions of Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL), now known as Sammaan Capital Ltd.

'Lack Of Trust' Opposition Slams EC Over Voter List Irregularities in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Raising questions about SIR in Bihar Congress has asked who the 30 lakh people who didn’t make it to the electoral rolls are and how many of them voted in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Congress said that as CEC had allowed applications for inclusion up to ten days before the last date of nomination, the final electoral roll must be frozen on that date, and elections be held on the basis of that list.The AICC expert group on elections and voters’ list, EAGLE, said the identity of the 30 lakh people removed was important as there were 7.7 crore registered voters in the parliamentary polls, but after SIR the number had come down to 7.42 crore.EAGLE, which comprises Ajay Maken, Digvijaya Singh, Abhishek Singhvi, Praveen Chakravarty, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Sappal and Nitin Raut, said EC had claimed that 21.5 lakh voters were added in Bihar but Form 6 was available for only 16.9 lakh, which raises the question of “where the remaining 4.6 lakh forms are, and if these voters were added without due process”.","Congress has asked who the 30 lakh people who didn’t make it to the electoral rolls are and how many of them voted in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

The case: Rolex seizure at IGI Airport



Customs order and penalties



₹1.8 lakh as redemption fine

A penalty equivalent to AED 6,250

Warehousing charges accumulated since the seizure

Poll Should customs authorities provide clearer guidelines for classifying personal vs. commercial items? Yes, clearer guidelines are needed No, current rules are sufficient

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, thereby allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while also reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive personal item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also strongly urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such broad, blanket assumptions may not stand up to thorough judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, fines, or confiscation, even if the items are personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

'Faced years of systematic humiliation, harassment'

CHANDIGARH: IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, wife of senior Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar who allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday, lodged a complaint with Chandigarh police on Wednesday night seeking an FIR against Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Singh Kapur and Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarnia, and demanded their arrest.Amneet sought an FIR under BNS Section 108 (abetment to suicide) and provisions of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. ""This is not a case of ordinary suicide but the direct result of systematic persecution of an honest officer from a Scheduled Caste community by powerful superiors,"" the IAS officer claimed in a complaint lodged at 8.55 pm on Wednesday.""Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done - even for families like ours, shattered by the cruelty of the powerful,"" her complaint said.With a heart weighed by unspeakable grief and shaken faith in justice"", the IAS officer said that her husband, an officer of ""unimpeachable integrity and extraordinary public spirit"", faced ""years of systematic humiliation, harassment, and persecution"" by senior officers, and, she alleged, particularly by DGP Kapur.TOI contacted DGP Kapur for his response, but his office was yet to respond.SP Bijarnia told TOI, ""Rohtak police neither named him (Kumar) as an accused nor summoned him for any investigation. The FIR registered by Rohtak police on extortion charges against a police officer is based on strong evidence and facts. Regarding the complaint against me, the matter is being probed by Chandigarh police, and I have full faith in their investigation as they are fully competent to conduct a fair probe. ""Amneet claimed that her husband had informed her that ""a conspiracy was being hatched under the direction of DGP Kapur to falsely frame him in a frivolous complaint"".She specifically mentions a ""false FIR"" (No. 0319/2025) registered on Oct 6 at Rohtak's Urban Estate police station against one of her husband's former staff members. She alleged it was an attempt to implicate Puran Kumar in that case. ""This systematic persecution pushed him to his final anguish,"" the complaint read.She also said before his death, her husband had attempted to contact DGP Kapur and SP Bijarnia but received no response. The DGP ""brushed aside"" his plea and the SP ""intentionally did not respond"" to his call, she said. ""From the circumstances, it is evident SP Rohtak Narendra Bijarnia was acting in concert with DGP Kapur,""she alleged.Amneet alleged that her husband had repeatedly complained of caste-based discrimination, exclusion from police premises' places of worship, and humiliation over his SC background. ""He repeatedly invoked protection of the SC/ST Act, but was ignored,"" Amneet wrote, adding that ""administrative persecution can drive a person to suicide"".""The eight-page suicide note, a document of a broken spirit, reveals the names of several officers whose relentless actions drove him to the edge... It is impossible to express what my children and I have lost - a husband, a father, a man whose only crime was honesty in service. As an officer of the law, I now place my faith in the same institutions my husband and I served,"" says the emotionally charged complaint addressed to SHO, Sector-11. The IAS officer urged police to arrest the DGP and the SP, fearing t their positions of power could enable them to tamper with evidence and influence witnesses.

Rashmirathi

The Mahagathbandhan's not so 'dignified' proposal



What does Chirag want from NDA?



Tejashwi for CM, Tejashwi for CM not







A throwback to Nitish's flips but no flops



NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for another high-stakes assembly election, the political landscape is once again abuzz - not with Nitish Kumar 's next move - but with poetry, posturing, and power plays. From poetic pleas for justice to sharp rebukes over “dignity” in seat offers, alliance partners across the spectrum are flexing muscles and testing loyalties.In the NDA camp, Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has invoked Dinkar’s Rashmirathi to press for a fair share, while in the Mahagathbandhan, Left allies are growing restless over what they deem “insulting” proposals. Amid the flurry of negotiations, one thing is clear — in Bihar’s shifting sands of coalition politics, every seat counts, and every word carries weight.Yet, beneath the poetic appeals and fiery rejections lies a deeper churn: the absence of a clear chief ministerial face, the confusion over leadership within alliances, and the persistent tug-of-war between old guards and rising heirs.Union minister and former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi struck a poetic yet pointed note as he expressed his seat-sharing expectations. Hinting that his party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), had once aspired to contest half of the state’s 243 constituencies, Manjhi said he was ready to settle for 15 seats in the spirit of coalition unity.Taking inspiration from Ramdhari Singh Dinkar’s, he invoked Lord Krishna’s appeal for justice before the Mahabharata war, writing on X, “Ho Nyay Aagar To Aadha Do” — a plea for fairness seemingly directed at the BJP.Continuing in the same poetic vein, Manjhi added that if full justice was not possible, HAM would be content with “15 villages” — a metaphor for 15 constituencies — and would not “raise arms against kin,” underscoring his commitment to the NDA alliance. The statement came shortly after BJP leaders Dharmendra Pradhan and Vinod Tawde visited his residence to deliberate on seat-sharing.After putting up quite a show in the last assembly elections, the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation did not find the proposal to contest on 19 seats ""dignified"" enough. In 2020, CPI (ML) won 12 seats of the 19 contested.This time, it demanded 40 seats initially, later bringing it down to 30, PTI reported citing a party source. The party has kept ""all its options open"" in case its demands are rejected.""CPI(ML) rejected the offer as it was not a dignified proposal, and we are going to make a fresh proposal to fight around 30 seats. We are reducing the number of seats by almost 25 per cent,"" the source said.In 2020, RJD contested 144 seats and won 75, while the Congress contested 70 seats and won 19.Meanwhile, Congress’ central election committee is set to meet today to finalize its candidates.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan has made headlines for calling out Bihar administration, ruled by ally Nitish Kumar's JDU, on rising crime levels and his recent war cry of ""Abki baari, yuva Bihari,"" as unemployment remains major poll attack agenda of the opposition this time.It had left the NDA in 2020 over disagreements with chief minister Nitish Kumar, dealing a significant blow to the JD(U), despite managing to win only one of the more than 135 seats it contested.This time, while he has explicitly ruled out any CM ambitions, his party is eyeing specific constituencies considered favorable and has requested a few assembly seats in each of the five Lok Sabha constituencies it won in 2024, PTI reported citing a party source.Whether RJD patriarch is in ""dilemma between his sons and daughters"" or not, Congress has clearly stated its stance. Tejashwi Yadav could be RJD's CM face, but not INDIA bloc's, at least not for now.""Tejashwi Yadav may be CM face for RJD but INDIA bloc's CM face will be decided collectively,"" Congress leader Udit Raj said.This came after Tejashwi posted on X, a poster which implied him as the CM face: ""When Tejashwi becomes the CM, none of our brothers and sisters in Bihar household would be unemployed.""BJP was quick to catch on to this mocking Tejashwi saying that while ""he called Rahul Gandhi PM several times but Rahul Gandhi did not call him (CM candidate).""""He is presenting himself but people of his alliance are not saying the same. He called Rahul Gandhi PM several times but Rahul Gandhi did not call him (CM candidate). Let alone the alliance, now the situation is different even within the family. Lalu Yadav is in dilemma between his sons and daughters. There is a crisis in the family,"" BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said.In the 2020 Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar led the NDA to a 125-seat majority. In August 2022, he broke with the BJP to form a government with the RJD-Congress-led Mahagathbandhan and became a key figure in the INDIA bloc.However, in January 2024, ahead of the Parliamentary polls, Kumar returned to the NDA, which now includes JD(U), BJP, Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas), Jitin Manjhi’s Hindustan Awami Morcha, and Upendra Khushwaha’s RLSP.This time, the NDA faces the INDIA bloc, led by Tejashwi Yadav, along with Congress, Left parties, Mukesh Sahani’s VIP, and newcomer Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj.Well, there's a saying in Bihar. No matter the poll outcome, the winner is always Nitish Kumar. Let's see if it holds true this time.","In Bihar, the political landscape is abuzz with poetry, posturing, and power plays.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: The Leh Bar Association on Wednesday demanded Rs 1-crore compensation each for the families of four people killed in the September 24 firing in Leh and called for an impartial judicial inquiry headed by a retired Supreme Court judge into the incident.“All four victims belonged to poor families. Three were young, and the fourth was an ex-serviceman who had fought for the country in the 1999 Kargil War. We expect the government to provide adequate compensation,” Bar president Mohammad Shafi Lassu said at a press conference in Leh.“In Ladakh’s history, this is the first such incident. The deceased belonged to underprivileged sections,” Lassu said, while seeking interim cash compensation along with a government job for one member of each of the four families.He said the Bar supports the Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance’s demand for a Supreme Court judge-led probe. “It would signal that the government stands for a healing touch,” he said.Lassu said arrests have continued since Sept 24. “Even today, two people were arrested. Yesterday also, two persons were taken into custody,” he said, adding that they have filed bail applications on their behalf.He said of the 39 people arrested on Sept 24, bail has been granted to 38 so far.“Subsequently, around 40 more people have been arrested, and we are pleading their cases in court.”Lassu said the Bar is appealing to the government to stop these arrests. “We are Indian nationalists. Despite that, one of our leaders, Sonam Wangchuk, was arrested and lodged in Jodhpur. It is painful for us. These arrests should stop now,” he said.On September 24, police and paramilitary forces allegedly opened fire on protesters after their demonstration turned violent, killing four people and injuring more than 70.The protesters were demanding Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh. The Sixth Schedule status, enshrined in the Indian Constitution, aims to protect the rights and distinct cultural identities of tribal populations, ensuring their self-governance through autonomous district councils (ADCs).After the violence, authorities in Leh imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended mobile internet, and arrested more than 60 people.The protests erupted while environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk, a member of the Leh Apex Body, was on a 35-day hunger strike at Martyrs’ Park that began on September 10 to press for restoration of “democratic rights.”After the clashes turned fatal, Wangchuk called off his fast. He was taken into custody on Sept 26 under the National Security Act.While the Ladakh administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violence, the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired SC judge. The two groups also withdrew from talks with the Union home ministry’s high-powered committee scheduled for October 6, seeking Wangchuk’s release and an impartial investigation.","Leh Bar Association demands Rs 1-crore compensation each for the families of four people killed in the September 24 firing in Leh.

The ceasefire occurred after a single tweet from the US President,” Tejashwi said.“The PM is upset at this. The hopes we had from the PM have shattered,” he added.Earlier in the day, PM Modi said that Congress should clarify who prevented India’s military response after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.“A Congress leader, who has also been Union Home Minister, has said that a country prevented India's military retaliation post-26/11 Mumbai terror attack in 2008. The party should clarify,” PM Modi said.“This weakness of Congress strengthened terrorists. The nation has the right to know who stopped India from going ahead with a military retaliation after the Mumbai terror attack,” he added.“For us, nothing is more important than the safety and security of our nation and its citizens,” Modi said, referring to Operation Sindoor launched after the Pahalgam terror attack.This comes days after former Union home minister P Chidambaram, in an interview, recounted that he was inclined towards retaliatory action against Pakistan after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks but was ultimately persuaded against it.Chidambaram said the decision-making process of the Manmohan Singh-led government was shaped by international diplomatic pressure, particularly from the United States.“It did cross my mind that we should do some act of retribution. I did discuss it with the Prime Minister and other people who mattered. The PM had discussed this matter when the attack was going on, I can surmise. And the conclusion was largely influenced by the MEA and the IFS that we should not physically react to the situation but employ diplomatic means,” he said.“The conclusion was reached amid pressure from the world that was descending upon Delhi to tell us not to start a war,” he added. Chidambaram specifically mentioned that then-US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had travelled to New Delhi to meet him and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, urging India not to retaliate militarily.","Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav accused PM Modi of agreeing to a ceasefire with Pakistan following a ""single tweet from US President Donald Trump"" Earlier in the day, PM Modi said that Congress should clarify who prevented India’s military response after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124388030,imgsize-851007,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Bail rejected to doctor who prescribed ‘killer’ syrup

BHOPAL: The first cases of children’s deaths in Madhya Pradesh after consuming cough syrup were reported on September 3, but it was only on September 16 that the administration recognised the severity of the situation and began a survey to check children’s health in Parasia block of Chhindwara district.The exercise gained pace two days later, after Nagpur hospitals alerted authorities about multiple child deaths due to renal failure. However, medicine samples were collected only after September 26, when a biopsy report from Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital revealed “acute tubular injury” in one of the deceased children.Officials said during the initial public hearings, the administration came across several similar cases of renal failure among local children. An alert on September 18 from Metropolitan Surveillance Unit, a centralised public health facility to monitor, control and prevent disease outbreaks, further strengthened suspicion, prompting intensified screening. “At that time, the exact reason was not known, but the pattern suggested a possible toxin-induced illness,” said an official.A team from the state headquarters was sent to Parasia, and biological samples were dispatched to NIV Pune, which ruled out viral infections.The Nagpur biopsy report on September 24 confirmed that the deaths were due to renal failure, though the reason for kidney damage remained uncertain. The rapid progression of symptoms indicated chemical poisoning.Joint teams from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation and MP Food and Drugs Administration collected syrup samples between September 26 and 29. Nineteen medicines used for the affected children were tested. Initial reports on October 1 and 3 found all samples of standard quality, but subsequent tests revealed that Coldrif cough syrup was substandard.Two more syrups — Respifresh TR and Relife — were also found below standards. Following confirmation from Tamil Nadu that Coldrif contained 48% diethylene glycol (DEG), a highly toxic chemical causing acute kidney failure, a state-wide ban was imposed on October 4.A district court in MP on Wednesday rejected bail to Dr Pravin Soni, the government pediatrician accused of prescribing contaminated cough syrup to children during his private practice.","The first cases of children’s deaths in Madhya Pradesh after consuming cough syrup were reported on September 3.

Supreme Court nixes government's plea for norms to make sentences victim-centric; calls it without merit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-nixes-governments-plea-for-norms-to-make-sentences-victim-centric-calls-it-without-merit/articleshow/124399958.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the central government's plea seeking victim- and society-centric guidelines for award of sentences, particularly death sentences, in place of the present system which is accused-centric and takes into consideration various mitigating factors relating to convicts.The central government also sought a directive for the introduction of a timeframe for death row convicts to file a curative petition after the dismissal of a review petition, and the filing of a mercy petition within seven days of the issuance of the death warrant. It further sought that the death sentence be executed within seven days of rejection of the mercy petition.Opposing the central government's plea, senior advocate Yug Mohit Chaudhry and Puja Sharma said that courts had passed a series of judgments on the matter and it was wrong on the part of Centre to seek additional victim-centric guidelines.The application, filed by the Union ministry of home affairs, highlighted that the directives of the court in the Shatrughan Chauhan case in 2014 were issued keeping in mind the rights of the convict and said it is high time the court redresses the grievances of victims, their families and the concerns of society at large, whose collective conscience gets shaken as a result of such horrific offences.""It is submitted that while taking care of the rights of the convicts, it is more important and the need of the hour to lay down guidelines in the interest of the victims, their families and in larger public interest, lest the convicts found to be guilty of such horrible, dreadful, cruel, abominable, ghastly, gruesome and heinous offences are permitted to play with the majesty of law and prolong the execution of the sentence awarded to them in accordance with the law,"" the application stated.Though no one appeared for the Centre to argue the case, the SC dismissed the plea, saying it was without merit.In 2014, the Supreme Court had laid down guidelines for the protection of the rights of the death row convicts and declared that long pendency in the disposal of a mercy petition is a ground to commute the death penalty to life sentence.It also said there should be a 14-day interval between intimating the rejection of the convict's mercy petition and their execution, so that the death row convict can not just seek a remedy but also mentally prepare themselves for the execution.",The Supreme Court dismissed the central government's plea seeking victim- and society-centric guidelines for award of sentences.

CHANDIGARH: The mystery over Haryana ADG Y Puran Kumar’s suicide lingered on Wednesday as the postmortem was deferred and rumours swirled around amid police’s silence on the contents of the nine-page ‘final note’ left behind by the IPS officer.Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, arrived in Chandigarh in the afternoon after cutting short her Japan trip as a member of CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation. She went to her official residence in sector 24 for a while. At 3pm, she left for the sector 11 house where Kumar allegedly shot himself with his gunman’s service revolver. From there, she headed for the mortuary in the sector 16 govt hospital where the IPS officer’s body awaits an autopsy.All this while, Amneet maintained distance from the media. When attempts were made to talk to her, she walked away with folded hands and in tears. In the hospital, she told officials present that she would “get justice at any cost”. She demanded a complete probe and told officials that she would not back down from any step to get justice, sources said.Officers said Amneet did not agree to the postmortem on Wednesday, and the autopsy, as well as last rites, will be conducted only after the couple’s elder daughter returns from the US on Oct 9.A police officer said Kumar had named at least seven serving and retired IPS officers in his final note, alleging that some seniors spoiled his ACR report and he faced unnecessary hurdles in promotion. He, however, did not name anyone specifically as the reason for his suicide, said sources, though he alleged that he was continuously harassed by officers of his own department. The note also spoke of his “stressful transfers” and “demeaning attitudes towards him” in social and professional environments.","Y Puran Kumar's wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, arrived in Chandigarh in the afternoon after cutting short her Japan trip as a member of CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation.

'Can't be held prosecution discharged burden of proof'

NEW DELHI: Thirty-five years after 21 people were sentenced to life imprisonment in a double murder case in Bihar, Supreme Court on Wednesday acquitted the accused and closed the case, cautioning courts to be careful while dealing with the offence of unlawful assembly so that innocent spectators or passive onlookers do not get convicted.SC said the prosecution had failed to prove its case and the accused were entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It said the testimonies of witnesses in the case neither corroborated one another nor were aligned with the medical records.The bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said ""The various contradictions in the form of material omissions go to the root of the matter, and in such circumstances, it cannot be held that the prosecution has discharged its burden of proof"".The incident, a clash between two groups over a land dispute, took place in Katihar district in 1988, and the accused were convicted and sentenced by the trial court in 1990. Two convicts died during the pendency of the case.The court said mere presence at the scene of crime does not ipso facto render a person a member of an unlawful assembly, unless it is established that the person shared its common object. ""A mere bystander, to whom no specific role is attributed, would not fall within the ambit of section 149 of the IPC,"" it said.""This court, as a matter of caution, has enunciated parameters to safeguard innocent spectators or passive onlookers from being convicted merely on account of their presence. This cautionary rule, however, does not dilute the doctrine of constructive liability, under which proof of an overt act by each individual is not indispensable. Where the presence of a large number of persons is established and many are implicated, prudence mandates strict adherence to this rule of caution,"" the bench said.","SC said the prosecution had failed to prove its case and the accused were entitled to the benefit of the doubt.

‘Evidence of CCTV footage seems a fictional creation’

NEW DELHI: Observing that courts cannot yield to public sentiment and external pressures and punish an accused merely on moral convictions or conjectures, the Supreme Court set aside on Wednesday the conviction of a man on death row for the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl in Chennai in 2017.It said that the accused was made a scapegoat by the police.SC said the prosecution miserably failed to prove the case and the trial court as well as Madras HC glossed over patent infirmities and loopholes in the prosecution's case and wrongly convicted the man.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta noted that the primary evidence of the so-called CCTV footage, in which the accused was allegedly captured, was not available on record and seems to be a fictional creation by the investigating officers to somehow trap the appellant.""It seems that the investigation officers were intentionally trying to screen the truth from being brought on record and washed their hands of the matter, by making the appellant, a scapegoat,"" the judgment said.Though the bench said that the offence was very horrible as a seven-year-old girl was raped and smothered, it said that there was no credible evidence against the accused and the court was left with no option but to let him off.""We cannot ignore or bypass the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that the prosecution is duty-bound to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The onus is heavier in a case based purely on circumstantial evidence. However, regrettably, the prosecution has miserably failed to do so in the instant case..."" the bench said.""While it is acknowledged that the acquittal of an individual involved in a heinous crime can lead to societal distress and cause grave anguish to the victim's family, the legal framework does not permit the courts to punish an accused person based merely on moral convictions or conjectures,"" it said.","SC said the prosecution miserably failed to prove the case and the trial court as well as Madras HC glossed over patent infirmities and loopholes in the prosecution's case.

NEW DELHI: Balancing ecological conservation with advancements in the defence and space sectors, Supreme Court on Wednesday gave the Jharkhand govt seven days to notify 314 sq kms of Saranda forest as a sanctuary but permitted extraction of high-grade iron ore and manganese from mines within the forests for use in Chandrayaan and anti-submarine warfare vessels.As a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K V Chandran proceeded to hear senior advocate Kapil Sibal pleading against contempt of court proceedings against the Jharkhand chief secretary for state govt's flip-flops over notifying the Sal tree forest as a sanctuary, the Steel Authority of India ( SAIL ) through solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court the steel major has been operating the mines for the last 70 years and the high-grade iron ore is used in Chandrayaan and defence projects.The SG sought exemption of these mines as the rules governing a sanctuary render mining activities impermissible. SAIL said these mines have been the mainstay of its production and supply to ""various national important projects like Chandrayaan and steel for anti-submarine warfare shallow watercraft INS Arnala"".Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar said the Jharkhand govt has been repeatedly doing U-turns in SC over notifying Saranda as a sanctuary and said the excuse dished out now - demarcation of the forest area - is to buy times as the state's earlier affidavit had informed the court about the specific blocks that constitute the contiguous forest.The bench said it would take no time to issue a direction to the state to notify Saranda forest as sanctuary but is giving the last opportunity for issuance of notification within a week. It ordered that existing mines would be permitted to continue their mineral extraction activities. It also said that the mining leases already granted would remain unaffected by the notification of sanctuary.",Supreme Court gives Jharkhand govt seven days to notify 314 sq kms of Saranda forest as a sanctuary.

Hazratbal Plaque Vandalism Row: BJP Demands Action; Omar Abdullah Questions Use Of Emblem At Dargah

SRINAGAR: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday accused Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah of failing to protect land and dignity of the people by sitting idle on Land Grant Rules, 2022, which has barred the renewal of the leases of hotels and other institutions, risking their eviction and government takeover.She said her party will introduce Jammu and Kashmir Land Rights and Regularisation Bill, 2025, termed “Anti-bulldozer Bill"", in the assembly session beginning on Oct 23 to undo the effects of the 2022 rules.The proposed bill, the former CM, said, aims to regularise land holdings of individuals, families, and institutions who have been in continuous possession of the land for over 30 years, thereby granting them ownership rights, preventing arbitrary evictions, and ensuring social and economic stability across the state.“Nearly 60 hotels in Gulmarg, including heritage establishments such as Nedous and Highlands Park, have received takeover notices from Gulmarg Development Authority... The CM can take many decisions without citing interference from the LG, but he is doing nothing despite enjoying an absolute majority,” she told a presser.The PDP chief said even after completing a year in office, the Omar government has not framed a policy on lease renewal and land regularisation, creating deep uncertainty that has hurt tourism, local employment, and investor confidence in Kashmir’s hospitality sector.“Despite repeated assurances to protect the land rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, no concrete policy or legal stance has been taken,” Mehbooba added.In a separate presser, J&K assembly leader of opposition and BJP functionary Sunil Sharma accused the CM of talking only about restoring statehood. “Do you want statehood to become a tool to justify the killing of innocent Kashmiris?” Sharma asked.","Mehbooba Mufti accuses Omar Abdullah of failing to protect land and dignity of the people by sitting idle on Land Grant Rules, 2022.

Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress..“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times. Still, as Dreger put it, “He’s a unicorn.” The Oilers may be anxious, but the next move and the franchise’s future, ultimately depends on when McDavid decides the time is right.","Connor McDavid is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract.

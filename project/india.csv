The people of Manipur will have more cause for disappointment,” he added.The Monsoon session is expected to see heated discussions on a range of issues, including the government’s handling of internal security and foreign relations.The opposition has demanded discussions on the Pahalgam terror attack , Operation Sindoor, and what it calls a “drift” in foreign policy, insisting that Prime Minister Modi should personally respond to these debates.Communist Party of India (CPI) MP P.

'Girl was on fire and screaming in pain'



NEW DELHI: The man, who saved the 15-year-old girl from Odisha's Puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men, recounted the harrowing 90 minutes after she knocked on his door, screaming for help, ""save me, save me. ""A 15-year-old girl, allegedly set on fire by three masked men in Odisha’s Puri district, was transferred to AIIMS New Delhi, where she remains in stable condition with 70-75%burn injuries.The class 9 dropout was walking to a relative’s home around 8.30am Saturday when she was reportedly intercepted near a river embankment, rendered unconscious by a chemical-lacedcloth, and doused with kerosene before being set ablaze.Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where Dukshishyam Senapati extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes.Recalling the harrowing moment, Senapati said that when he answered his door, he was stunned to find the girl engulfed in flames and crying in agony, as he later explained to DGP YB Khurania during the official's site visit.""It was around 8.30 am when the girl came to my house, screaming. With the help of my wife, I doused the fire and gave her water as she was very thirsty.Later, the women of my family changed her clothes,"" he said.Upon questioning, the girl informed Senapati that three unidentified men had set her ablaze. She explained being abducted by motorcycle-riding assailants whilst returning from meeting a friend.""She said she was walking back home after meeting a friend when she was picked up by three men who arrived on motorcycles. The faces of these men were half-covered, and they took her to a place near the Bhargavi riverbank. She could not tell their names. She could only say that they covered her face with a handkerchief and poured some substance before setting her on fire,"" he said.Senapati noticed that although the girl mentioned being bound during the abduction, her hands were free when she arrived. After learning her father's details, he contacted her family. The large crowd that gathered prevented further conversation with the victim.Despite searching the area, Senapati couldn't locate the perpetrators. He explained that the attackers fled after setting her alight, presumably expecting her to perish. However, the girl managed to escape and reach his house.Due to delayed ambulance response, they resorted to an auto rickshaw for hospital transport. The girl remained at his residence for approximately 90 minutes.The incident has created fear in the village, particularly among children who are now afraid to venture out alone. Senapati urged swift arrest of the culprits.","Dukshishyam Senapati saved the 15-year-old girl from Odisha's Puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men.

PM reply unlikely

NDA allies

want Sindoor debate to highlight govt achievements

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Sunday expressed its readiness to discuss all “important issues” in the monsoon session of Parliament raised by opposition parties, including Operation Sindoor and repeated claims by US President Donald Trump that he had facilitated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.At the customary floor leaders’ meeting ahead of the session beginning on Monday, opposition raised various issues, including voter rolls revision in Bihar, “lapses” leading to the Pahalgam attack and Trump’s claims.“We are very open to a discussion... These are issues of great national importance. Govt is not shying away and will never shy away, but is open to discussions within rules and conventions,” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said following the meeting chaired by Union minister J P Nadda.Sources said that there was no assurance about a discussion on the special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar, about which opposition parties have been vocal and critical of Election Commission.Centre’s “reluctance” to discuss EC’s role on the floor of the House also stems from the fact that NDA partners, including JDU, have not raised questions about the Bihar SIR after their own surveys found no irregularities.JDU’s Sanjay Kumar told reporters there were reports that people did not have any issue with the SIR.Normally, defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is deputy leader of Lok Sabha, chairs the floor leaders’ meeting, but he was reportedly unwell and skipped the meeting attended by 54 members from different parties and independent MPs.“We have noted all the points. We have requested all parties to ensure Parliament functions properly. We have to ensure coordination. It is responsibility of all to help Parliament function,” Rijiju said, adding that govt would reply appropriately whenever a discussion takes place on Trump’s ceasefire claims.Although Centre indicated its willingness to respond to Trump’s claims, it will be walking a tightrope. Govt will need to be careful in its response, considering Trump’s position, to ensure that bilateral relations, especially at a time when they are on the verge of signing a trade treaty, remain unaffected.INDIA bloc insisted PM Narendra Modi should respond on the US president’s “ceasefire” claims and the SIR in Bihar. Sources said the PM is unlikely to respond in Parliament on these issues, and the respective ministers will present govt’s point of view.Sources said even BJP’s allies want a discussion on Operation Sindoor to highlight govt’s achievements after all-party delegations visited various nations.At the meeting, Congress’s deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi demanded a discussion on “lapses” that led to Pahalgam attack, Operation Sindoor, statements by J&K LG, Chief of Defence Staff, Deputy Chief of Army Staff, and Trump’s claims. Other opposition parties also raised these issues.","Opposition raised various issues, including voter rolls revision in Bihar, “lapses” leading to the Pahalgam attack and Trump’s claims. “We are very open to a discussion...

Poll Do you believe that stricter regulations should be enforced for school bus drivers? Yes, definitely No, current regulations are sufficient





BENGALURU: A routine ride home from school turned into a heart-wrenching tragedy for the family of a seven-year-old boy, who died after falling out of a moving school bus due to the negligence of the driver in Magadi Friday evening.The victim is L Rajat, a class 2 student at SBS School in Magadi Town and a resident of Hosapalya in Janata Colony. He is the son of Lokesh and Radha, both daily wage workers from Hanur in Kollegal. Rajat was returning home along with his 10-year-old sister Dushita in the school bus when the incident occurred.Reconstructing the sequence of events, police the brother-sister get picked and dropped off every day by the school bus driven by 35-year-old R Vinod. ""Usually, around 30 children use the school bus. A woman attendant is appointed to look after the children during the journey. Rajat and Dushita board the bus first as the bus service starts near their house. During drop off, the brother-sister duo are the last ones to deboard,"" an investigating officer said.On Friday evening, all kids got dropped and the woman attendant got off a stop before that of Rajat and Dushita.""Vinod resumed the journey with Rajat and Dushita seated near the door. The door opened as it was not properly locked. Vinod asked Rajat to close the door. As Rajat moved closer to the door, he got thrown out of the vehicle and the rear tyre ran over him,"" police said.Vinod immediately took Rajat to a nearby private hospital, but the child succumbed to his injuries, police said. The police arrested Vinod for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Normally, persons accused of causing accidental deaths are arrested for causing death due to negligence, and the accused person can walk out on station bail. However, when booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the police have to produce the accused before the concerned court, which normally hands them over to judicial custody.""Vinod's responsibility was to ensure that the door was properly locked. He didn't check it. The second mistake was asking Rajat to close the door while the bus was moving.

NEW DELHI: India’s teen chess sensation Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa has once again stunned World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen , registering his second victory over the Norwegian great in the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam in Las Vegas. The 19-year-old grandmaster defeated Carlsen in the first classification game of the semi-final, forcing the five-time world champion to resign in 43 moves.Praggnanandhaa, playing with the white pieces, showcased clinical precision and tactical depth. By the 18th move, Carlsen made the bold decision to sacrifice his queen in exchange for a bishop and knight — an attempt to turn the tide — but Praggnanandhaa weathered the challenge and regained the upper hand late in the game. By move 41, the Indian GM had lined up three central pawns and forced Carlsen into a position where checkmate was inevitable, prompting the resignation.This latest triumph adds to Pragg’s growing list of wins over Carlsen. Earlier this week, he had already defeated the Norwegian in 39 moves during the group stages. That win knocked Carlsen into the losers’ bracket, where he eventually lost to Levon Aronian.Praggnanandhaa has now beaten Carlsen multiple times across formats.He first made headlines in 2022 at the Champions Chess Tour, defeating Carlsen at age 16. In 2024, he secured his maiden classical win over the Norwegian at Norway Chess.Despite Carlsen bouncing back to win their semifinal clash (3-1) through blitz tiebreakers (2-0) after splitting the two classical games, Praggnanandhaa’s performance has firmly established him as one of the most promising talents on the global stage.","Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa has once again stunned World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen.

Solar Eclipse in August 2027: Date and time



In Southern Spain, totality is expected to begin around 13:30 to 14:00 local time (CEST).

In North Africa, such as Libya and Egypt, the eclipse will peak around 14:00 to 14:30 local time (EET).

In Saudi Arabia, the eclipse will reach totality slightly later in the day, around 15:00 local time (AST).

What makes the 2027 solar eclipse so special



Earth at Aphelion: On August 2, Earth will be at its farthest point from the Sun. This makes the Sun appear slightly smaller in the sky.

Moon at Perigee: At the same time, the Moon will be at its closest distance to Earth, making it look larger than usual.

Equatorial Shadow Path: The eclipse will travel close to the equator, where the Earth's rotational speed causes the Moon’s shadow to move more slowly across the surface. This slower movement prolongs the duration of totality.

Solar Eclipse 2027 visibility



Europe



Southern Spain, including cities such as Cádiz and Málaga, will experience total darkness for over four minutes.

The eclipse will make landfall at the Strait of Gibraltar.

North Africa



Northern Morocco, particularly Tangier and Tetouan, will be directly beneath the central shadow.

Parts of Algeria and Tunisia will also be in the path.

In Benghazi, Libya, totality will last nearly five minutes.

Central Egypt, especially near Luxor, will experience more than six minutes of total darkness.

August Solar Eclipse: Historical and scientific significance



Also Read |

On August 2, 2027, a remarkable total solar eclipse will darken the skies over parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. For up to 6 minutes and 23 seconds, the Moon will completely obscure the Sun, casting a dramatic shadow over Earth in what is being called the “Great North African Eclipse.” This event will be the longest total solar eclipse visible from land between 1991 and 2114. With such an extended period of totality and broad visibility, this awe-inspiring celestial phenomenon will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for millions of people across continents, skywatchers, scientists, and photographers alike.Clear skies are expected in many parts of North Africa, especially in Libya and Egypt, which are known for dry, sunny weather in August. These favourable conditions enhance the likelihood of an unobstructed view, making the region ideal for eclipse observation, scientific research, and astronomical tourism opportunities.The total solar eclipse will occur on Monday, August 2, 2027, during the early to mid-afternoon hours, depending on your location.Exact timings may vary by a few minutes depending on the observer’s precise location along the path of totality. The full eclipse duration, from first contact (partial eclipse begins) to final contact (partial eclipse ends), will last approximately 2.5 to 3 hours, with totality lasting up to 6 minutes and 23 seconds in select areas like Luxor, Egypt.Three rare astronomical conditions will occur simultaneously to produce such a long eclipse:These combined factors will result in a total solar eclipse lasting over six minutes, significantly longer than most eclipses, which typically range from two to three minutes.The eclipse will begin over the Atlantic Ocean and move eastward across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The path of totality, which is the narrow band where the eclipse will be fully visible, will be approximately 258 to 275 kilometers wide, offering breathtaking celestial views to millions of spectators across multiple continents, including rare opportunities for scientists to study solar corona and atmospheric changes.The eclipse will exit over the Indian Ocean and continue past the Chagos Archipelago before fading.The 2027 eclipse will not be visible in many parts of the world, including:Observers in these regions may not witness any part of the eclipse or will only experience a minor partial eclipse.The upcoming 2027 eclipse is not the longest in history, but it is the most significant of this century. The longest recorded total solar eclipse occurred on June 15, 743 BC, lasting 7 minutes and 28 seconds. However, the 2027 event will be the longest visible from land between 1991 and 2114. The next similarly long eclipse will not take place until August 23, 2114.This event is significant not only because of its rare duration but also because of its wide visibility across multiple countries. Scientists, astronomers, and casual observers alike will benefit from the opportunity to study the Sun’s corona and other solar phenomena during the extended period of totality. It also offers a rare moment of unity, as millions across continents will pause to witness the same celestial spectacle. For many, this eclipse will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience—both a scientific event and a shared moment of wonder.For those living near the eclipse path, it is a truly once-in-a-century opportunity. The combination of scientific importance and natural beauty makes this a date worth marking in calendars worldwide.","On August 2, 2027, a remarkable total solar eclipse will darken the skies over parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

NEW DELHI: Holding Chanda Kochhar , former CEO of ICICI Bank , guilty of receiving bribes of Rs 64 crore through her husband from Videocon group, an appellate tribunal here in an order dated July 3 observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of Rs 300 crore to the Videocon group.“The history given by the appellants (ED) has been narrated and supported by the evidence in the light of the reference of the statements under Section 50 of the PMLA Act which are admissible and can be relied upon. The allegation made by the appellants stands because on paper ownership of NRPL is shown to be of V N Dhoot (CMD of Videocon group) but according to him also, the entire control of the company was of Deepak Kochhar (Chanda Kochhar’s husband). Thus, the allegations were made for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan to Videocon group of industries,” the tribunal said in its order.The appellate tribunal slammed the adjudicating authority that had earlier in Nov 2020 given relief to the accused in releasing the attached assets worth Rs 78 crore.“The adjudicating authority has ignored the material facts while drawing the conclusions which are coming out on the face of the record and, therefore, we cannot endorse the finding of the adjudicating authority going against the record and ignoring the relevant facts.Thus, we find substance in the allegation of the appellants for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon group and thereupon, a sum of Rs 64 crore was transferred to NRPL, a company managed by Deepak Kochhar and, in fact, he was the managing director of the said company. The factual issues narrated above clarifies that the appellants have taken up the matter to justify the attachment of the property,” the tribunal said, justifying the ED’s attachments.The tribunal noted that the sanction of a loan of Rs 300 crore by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group where Chanda Kochhar remained part of the committee was against the rules and policy of the bank. “The issue remains about the transfer of Rs 64 crore by Videocon group through its entity SEPL to NRPL day after the disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank,” it said while validating the evidence produced by the ED.

NEW DELHI: The fact-finding committee constituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) has held KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year, stating that ""illegal and unlawful activity by the university"" led to one of the deaths and that the administration's actions ""amount to criminal liability. ""Along with these findings, the committee has issued a set of strong recommendations, based on which the commission is contemplating a freeze on the university's expansion and departmental action against erring officials, among others. The UGC committee, chaired by Professor Nageshwar Rao, submitted its report on May 20, 2025, after campus visits, stakeholder interactions, and detailed analysis.The report cited the university's failure to act lawfully on sexual harassment complaints, inadequate hostel facilities, excessive student intake, and use of brute force on students as key failings contributing to the incidents.The committee's observations and findings include serious lapses in infrastructure and governance. It found that hostel facilities were ""substandard"" with ""three students put in a small room"" and female international students accommodated without cultural considerations. It also noted that complaints of sexual harassment were ignored or illegally compromised, that the administration forcibly removed Nepalese students without support, and that security personnel used physical aggression against students.The university, it said, prioritised its ""reputation of university over regulations, law of land and international relations of the country.""Observing that members of the internal complaints committee (ICC) and senior administrative personnel of the university ""are liable for criminal punishment as per law"", the report stated, ""... university's internal complaints committee (ICC) failed to take lawful action in reported sexual harassment cases. There was no transparency that protocols for investigation were followed. The girl had made complaints to the administration twice much before this tragic incident. In both the complaints, they decided to go for illegal compromise... The university has the power to punish the boy even when the first complaint was lodged. Instead of punishment, they favoured the boy by pushing forced illegal compromise with the girl. Later on, this has led to suicide. This suicide case could have been averted.""On Feb 16, Prakriti Lamsal, a third-year BTech student from Nepal, was found dead in her hostel room. The report also called for departmental action against ICC members who acted in violation of rules. ""Had KIIT University taken action to decide the reported harassment case as per law in the first case, the tragedy could have been avoided,"" the report stated.On May 2, another Nepalese undergraduate student was found dead in her hostel room at KIIT.","A fact-finding committee has held KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year.

KULLU: A woman has married two brothers in the remote trans-Giri region of Himachal Pradesh's Sirmaur district, drawing cheers from the local Hatti tribe for upholding their traditional ways.Pradeep and Kapil Negi, brothers from Shillai village, wed Sunita Chauhan of Kunhat village in a three-day ceremony that ended on July 14. The trio shared the wedding stage, danced to traditional folk music, and received blessings from village elders as hundreds of relatives and locals looked on - in a rare public affirmation of the ancient custom of polyandry.Pradeep works with Jal Shakti department. Kapil is employed in the hospitality sector overseas. Sunita is a trained technician from an industrial training institute (ITI).""This is not just a marriage - it's a moment of pride,"" said Hira Singh, a relative of the grooms. ""Our educated youth have shown the courage to embrace what many keep secret. They've set an example.""Polyandry remains a socially accepted practice among the Hatti community, which numbers about 300,000 in Sirmaur and is spread across five tehsils and 154 panchayats, including Shillai, Sangrah, Kamrau, Rajgarh, and Nohradhar.Amichand Kamal, president of Kendriya Haati Samiti said, ""Polyandry was the norm in tribal societies as it protected land holdings and avoided widowhood. A woman has more freedom-she can choose her husbands and leave them without stigma.""What made this wedding stand out wasn't the custom - but its visibility. ""Polyandry may seem primitive to outsiders, but it's legal in our context. Usually these marriages happen quietly,"" Kamal said. ""But this one was public. That makes it powerful.""The tradition was once widespread across tribal belts like Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur. But as nuclear families grew and youth migrated toward city jobs, the practice withered.""It has nearly vanished in Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur,"" said Shamsher Singh, a research scholar on folk art from Lahaul-Spiti. ""But in trans-Giri and Jaunsar-Bawar of Uttarakhand, it survives, largely because of the Mahabharata's cultural imprint.""Many Hattis believe they descend from the Kauravas or Pandavas.

NEW DELHI: On the birthday of Nishant Kumar , son of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , Rashtriya Lok Samta Party and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha sparked a political buzz by publicly suggesting it’s time for a leadership transition within the party.Taking to social media, Kushwaha, an NDA ally, extended warm wishes to Nishant and called him the ""new hope"" of Janata Dal (U). “On this happy occasion, I respectfully urge Nitish ji to acknowledge the reality that managing both the government and the party may no longer be ideal for him,” he wrote.While praising Kumar’s long administrative experience and his importance in running the state, Kushwaha appealed to him to consider handing over party responsibilities—something he claimed many in the party also believe is long overdue. “Delaying this could lead to damage that may never be repaired,” he warned.Without directly naming health or age, Kushwaha’s remarks echoed ongoing chatter about Nitish Kumar’s physical and mental capacity to continue in full leadership roles.Kushwaha added that many JDU leaders may not have the access or courage to convey such concerns directly to Nitish Kumar, which is why he felt compelled to say it openly.Interestingly, when asked about his political debut during a temple visit in Patna on Sunday, Nitish's son, Nishant Kumar, denied any plans to enter politics.

No mention of anything serious,” said the mother of three young children.Ranjeet’s father Mohan Lal said: “He was supposed to return in a month or two. We request the PM to help us. He has three small children,” Lal said.

Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where residents extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes. Police and family later took her to AIIMS Bhubaneswar.With her vitals showing slight improvement, doctors cleared her for airlift. ""Her blood pressure, which was low, improved today.

NMC again threatens action against medical colleges not paying stipend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-again-threatens-action-against-medical-colleges-not-paying-stipend/articleshow/122802244.cms,"Representative image

National Medical Commission (NMC) has yet again issued a public notice threatening to take action against medical colleges that do not pay stipends to interns and resident doctors.With no evidence of any action being taken after similar threats in 2023 and 2024, it remains to be seen whether change in chairman of the commission leads to action this time.Three months back, NMC had threatened to impose Rs 50,000 as penalty on medical colleges which save several crores of rupees every year by not paying stipend. NMC’s regulations stipulate that all medical colleges have to pay interns and resident doctors stipend equivalent to what state govt medical colleges are paying.Just three days before the latest public notice dated July 11, NMC had issued another notice shifting the responsibility of addressing grievances of medical students to medical colleges, universities and directorates of medical education of the respective states. Yet, it is now threatening to take action including imposition of financial penalties, withdrawal of course recognition and suspension of admissions.The latest notice reminded medical colleges that, in keeping with SC order of April 29, all private and deemed universities must disclose detailed information regarding tuition fees, hostel charges, caution deposits and all miscellaneous charges at pre-counselling stage. Citing another order of SC in 2022 and the commission’s own regulations, it said payment of stipend was mandatory.NMC threatened that non-compliance would attract action under Establishment of Medical Institutions, Assessment and Rating Regulations, 2023, Maintenance of Standards of Medical Education Regulations, 2023, and Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2023. It added that these measures to ensure payment of stipend and for disclosure of various kinds of fees well before counselling were “a part of NMC’s commitment to fostering fair, ethical and transparent practices in medical education across the country”.In April 2023, NMC did a survey among medical college students on stipend being paid to them. An RTI query to NMC revealed the survey showed that over 60 colleges were not paying stipend, while about 50 were paying less than Rs 5,000 a month.In Aug 2023, NMC issued “an advisory” to all colleges regarding payment of stipend. With SC cracking down on NMC regarding non-payment of stipend, in Nov 2024, the commission issued show cause notices to 198 medical colleges for failing to submit stipend payment data.NMC has written to colleges threatening “strict action” in Aug 2023, Nov 2024 and now on July 11, 2025. Yet, there is no record of any action being taken against any college for non-payment of stipend till now.",National Medical Commission (NMC) has yet again issued a public notice threatening to take action against medical colleges.

Kottayam: Is there a connection between jackfruit and detection of alcohol in one's breath? A breathalyser test at a Kerala State Road Transport Corporation depot in Pathanamthitta apparently found one.A bus driver who consumed jackfruit before joining duty failed a breathalyzer test at the Pandalam KSRTC depot on Friday. An official, who did not wish to be identified, said that another driver brought jackfruit harvests from his house to the depot and shared it with his colleagues. The driver in question consumed a good amount of the fruit, the official said.As routine, he then underwent the breathalyzer test. But to his shock, the meter rose from 0 to 10 within seconds. The driver insisted that he was not drunk and even challenged the authorities to conduct a blood test. Three other staff members also failed the test. Finally, the authorities concerned decided to put the breathalyzer itself under the scanner.An official who was assigned to conduct the breathalyzer test took the assessment with the meter showing zero. However, when he underwent the test after consuming jackfruit, the meter reading went up, showing he was drunk, said the official. The officials confirmed that jackfruit was the unlikely culprit.",A bus driver who consumed jackfruit before joining duty failed a breathalyzer test at the Pandalam KSRTC depot on Friday.

NEW DELHI: From now on, those filing bail petitions before any court will be required to disclose their criminal antecedents to enable the judge to take a holistic view of the nature of the person and consider whether he/she can pose danger to society on release from jail.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said that it would be appropriate for all high courts to amend their rules and adopt the Punjab and Haryana high court model which mandates bail applicants to disclose their criminal antecedents.The Punjab and Haryana high court rules on bail application state: ""In every application for bail presented to the high court, the petitioner shall state whether similar application has or has not been made to Supreme Court, and if made shall state the result thereof. The petitioner/applicant shall also mention whether he/she is/was involved in any other criminal case or not. If yes, particulars and decisions thereof. An application which does not contain this information shall be placed before the bench with the necessary information.""The bench said, ""We feel that every high court in the country should consider incorporating a similar provision in the respective high court rules and/or criminal side rules as it would impose an obligation on the accused to make disclosures regarding his/her involvement in any other criminal case(s) previously registered.""Asking the SC registry to send a copy of the judgment to registrars general of all high courts to enable incorporation of a rule on the lines of Punjab and Haryana HC, the bench said, ""Accounting for criminal antecedents of the accused while considering bail applications has been the subject matter of concern for courts across the country.""This direction came in a case where a magistrate was misled to grant bail to the main accused in a criminal case by making him believe that Rajasthan high court had granted bail to a co-accused. The HC had granted bail to an accused who was charged with a lesser offence in the case.

This will be Modi’s first visit to the country since President Mohamed Muizzu assumed office in Nov 2023, signalling a complete turnaround in ties since the controversial expulsion of Indian military personnel from archipelago, and also the first by any Indian PM on Maldives independence anniversary.Anti-India leader and former President Abdulla Yameen had in 2017 invited then Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif for the same event. TOI had first reported on June 2 that India and Maldives were discussing a visit to Male by Modi on their Independence Day.During Modi’s visit to UK, both sides are expected to formally sign the landmark FTAIndia and UK finalised in May. This will be Modi’s fourth visit to UK. The leaders have endorsed FTA covering trade in goods and services, as a balanced, equitable and ambitious deal that would enhance bilateral trade and generate new avenues for employment.“During the visit, Modi will hold wide ranging discussions with Starmer on the entire gamut of India-UK bilateral relations. They will also exchange views on issues of regional and global importance,” MEA said.In case of Maldives, it will also be the first visit by a head of state or govt to the country during Muizzu’s presidency. According to Male, the visit carries “profound significance” as it coincides with the Independence Day and will see inauguration of several joint projects, along with signing of agreements in a range of sectors.“PM will be the guest of honour at the 60th anniversary celebrations of Independence of Maldives. The two leaders will take stock of the progress in implementation of India-Maldives Joint Vision for a ‘Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership’, adopted during State Visit of the President of Maldives to India in Oct 2024,” said govt in its announcement.“The visit reflects the importance India attaches to its maritime neighbour, Maldives, which continues to hold a special place in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and Vision Mahasagar.

7 lakh die of sudden cardiac arrest in a year

MUMBAI: India's heart disease burden is evident not only from the spate of heart attacks among young celebrities in the past five years, but also in the over-50% rise in cardiac medication sale in the same period.Be they lipid-lowering drugs, heart-failure medications or anti-anginal treatments, cardiac medications sell more than drugs meant for any complications, including the gastro-intestinal tract, infections or diabetes.According to June report of Pharmarack, which analyses sales figures from 17 prominent Indian pharmaceutical companies representing more than half of the sector, sales of cardiac medicines rose from Rs 1,761 crore in June 2021 to Rs 2,645 crore by June 2025. There has been a consistent yearly growth rate of 10.7% in this sector, showed the report.Experts offer a slew of reasons for this rise, ranging from better awareness of heart diseases, new parameters for measuring hypertension as well as the increasing population of senior citizens. “There is no doubt that cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, but at the same time, access to care and diagnostic tools has improved,"" said Dr Ajay Mahajan, head of the cardiology department at KEM Hospital.Centre's data suggests that 63% of total deaths in the country were due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) accounting for 27%.Dr Suraj Nagre, associate professor at JJ Hospital's cardiovascular and thoracic surgery department, offers another reason: “A few years ago, the threshold for hypertension was a reading of 130-140. Medical guidelines have since changed and even readings above 120 are considered hypertensive.”While heart care until a few years back mainly meant lipid-lowering medications, the prescriptions for other drugs meant to control unstable heart rhythm or heart failure have also increased. “Cardiovascular medications are interrelated because they target different but connected pathways of disease,” said senior cardiac surgeon Dr Ramakanta Panda. “For example, anti-hypertensives lower blood pressure to reduce the strain on arteries and the heart. Lipid-lowering drugs like statins reduce cholesterol helping prevent arterial blockages. Anti-anginals improve blood flow to the heart muscle, relieving chest pain caused by narrowed arteries. These medications are often prescribed together,"" said Dr Panda.Referring to the frequent reports of cardiac arrest deaths among common people as well as celebrities and fitness enthusiasts, KEM cardiologist Dr Charan Lanjewar said underlying factors are almost always involved. “There’s a lack of data to identify a single cause in many cardiac arrest cases. The reasons are multifactorial, but lifestyle, stress, and consumption habits play a vital role,” Dr Lanjewar said.The aging population is more prone to heart conditions. Senior cardiologist Dr Akshay Mehta said, “The lifespan of the Indian population has increased and with a growing aging population, we are seeing a higher incidence of heart disease. Along with rising incidence, we also have better diagnostic tools now.”","Sales of cardiac medicines rose from Rs 1,761 crore in June 2021 to Rs 2,645 crore by June 2025.

He was 86.""My husband was suffering from pulmonary fibrosis for the past seven years. He died due to a cardiac arrest at 6.30 am,'' his wife Deepa Barot told TOI.Barot also directed the Bengali superhit, ‘Ashrita' (1990), starring Mithu Mukherjee.Barot's family lived in Tanzania, but was forced to come back to India following racial conflicts in the East African country in the 1960s. His sister, Kamal Barot, was a playback singer in Bollywood. He assisted Bollywood biggie Manoj Kumar in films such as 'Purab Aur Pachhim', 'Shor' and 'Roti Kapada Aur Makaan'.The making of the original ‘Don' is a legendary Bollywood tale. Barot's cinematographer-producer friend, Nariman Irani, was reeling under a debt of nearly Rs 12 lakh after his first film as producer, 'Zindagi Zindagi', had flopped. Barot offered to help. He was friendly with Amitabh Bachchan and Zeenat Aman having worked with them in 'Roti Kapada Aur Makaan'.They all decided to work in ‘Don' to help Irani. Tragically, Irani passed away in 1977, before Don could hit the screen. Amitabh Bachchan, who won the Best Actor Filmfare award, dedicated the award to Irani and his wife.In the 1970s, 'Don' was an unusual title for Hindi films. Barot's mentor, Manoj Kumar, had asked him with a quizzical tone if he was making some film called ``Down''! Barot explained that it was a Spanish word `Don' which actually meant `gentleman'. Kumar understood and suggested that the pacy second-half needed a song. The advice led to the birth of the chartbuster, ‘Khai ke paan Benaraswala.'Don, which celebrated platinum jubilee, was remade in Tamil as Billa (1980) with Rajinikanth as hero. A year earlier, NT Rama Rao was the lead in Yugandhar, the film's Telugu version. In Malayalam, the film was remade as Shobharaj (1986) with Mohan Lal in lead. Later director Farhan Akhtar reinterpreted the movie in Don: The Chase Begins Again (2006) and Don 2: The Chase Continues.Several Bollywood personalities such as Farhan and Kunal Kohli mourned his passing on social media. ""Saddened to learn that the director of the OG Don is no more. RIP Chandra Barot-ji. Deepest condolences to the family,'' posted Farhan.On a rainy Sunday, Barot's last rites were carried out at the Kherwadi based Hindu crematorium in Bandra (east). It was a low-key affair attended by his family members and some relatives. As the final rites took place, one could not help but recall a Barot remark he made years ago: ""I will be remembered as the man who made Don"".","Chandra Barot was best known for the blockbuster classic, Don (1978), which prompted multiple remakes in southern languages.

Videos of Maharashtra minister 'playing rummy' in House sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/videos-of-maharashtra-minister-playing-rummy-in-house-sparks-row/articleshow/122801644.cms,"Screengrab from the purported video

NASHIK/CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: Two videos purportedly showing Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate playing an online card game during an assembly session culminated Sunday in a full-blown political clash, including violence involving NCP and a Maratha outfit, as the stakes kept rising in what had started as a social media controversy.The confrontation peaked at NCP state president Sunil Tatkare's presser in Latur, where members of Chhava Sanghatna threw playing cards at him while demanding Kokate's resignation. The symbolic protest quickly descended into violence when local NCP workers allegedly assaulted the protesters after Tatkare left the venue, with one activist being injured after being struck on the head with a chair.The row began when opposition MLA Rohit Pawar of NCP (SP) posted the videos on X, claiming they showed Kokate too busy gaming to be bothered about House proceedings. The allegation gained enough traction within hours to trigger protests.In Nashik, Kokate dismissed the allegations as deliberate misrepresentation. The minister said he was attempting to monitor Lower House proceedings from the Upper House of Maharashtra's bicameral legislature when an online gaming advertisement appeared on his phone.""I tried to skip it a couple of times, but couldn't. Finally, on my third attempt, it worked,"" Kokate explained, accusing Pawar of selectively editing the footage to suit his narrative.""The MLA chose to show only the part that suited him instead of showing the complete video,"" Kokate said, dismissing the controversy as an attempt by the opposition to defame a BJP-led govt ""doing good work"".At NCP's Latur presser, Chhava Sanghatna, led by Vijaykumar Ghadge, initially submitted a memorandum to Tatkare seeking Kokate's resignation before the card-throwing protest. After the NCP state chief left the venue, local party politicians allegedly confronted the Maratha activists in a nearby room, where the situation turned violent despite police's attempts to maintain order.No arrests had been made till late Sunday, although the alleged retaliation drew sharp criticism from across the political spectrum. Ghadge-Patil condemned what he claimed was an attack by ""NCP goons"". He said Chhava Sanghatna, which he described as an organisation of ""farmers' sons"", would retaliate.NCP spokesperson Suraj Chavan defended the party workers' actions as a ""natural reaction"" to alleged attempts to humiliate party functionaries. He acknowledged Chhava Sanghatna's right to democratic protest, but suggested the card-throwing protest was out of line.Vidya Chavan of NCP (SP) termed the assault on the protesters ""horrible"", saying that questioning politicians' actions was a democratic right. She urged minister Kokate to ""speak the truth and accept his mistake"".Throughout the controversy, Kokate maintained that his detractors like Rohit Pawar had been focusing on trivial matters - ""my clothes, my cars and such things"" - rather than the govt's agricultural policies. He said the legislator would have highlighted the govt's work if he had farmers' interests in mind.The minister declared that the opposition's focus on such issues reflected its inability to find genuine governance concerns.","Two videos purportedly showing Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate playing an online card game during an assembly session.

Hundreds gather for Fauja’s final journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hundreds-gather-for-faujas-final-journey/articleshow/122801618.cms,"Hundreds gather for Fauja’s final journey

JALANDHAR: A marathon’s starting gun often got Fauja Singh going. Guns went off on Sunday too, those of Punjab police at a funeral with full state honours for the 114-year-old whose never-say-die spirit was cut short by an SUV’s fatal knock last week.Hundreds of admirers, locals and luminaries descended on Fauja’s native village of Beas near Jalandhar as sons Sukhjinder Singh and Harvinder Singh lit the pyre. The VIPs included governor Gulab Chand Kataria, chief minister Bhagwant Mann and other politicians across party lines. Fauja’s body was placed in a glass casket earlier in the day, allowing many to pay their final respects. It was later carried in a hearse to the village cremation ground where a Punjab police contingent offered a ceremonial gun salute.In a message to Harvinder, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “extraordinary” Fauja’s passing had left a void “that can never be filled”. “Fauja Singh Ji became the first centenarian to complete the marathon successfully. That he took up long-distance running at a very advanced age speaks volumes not only for his physical fitness but, more importantly, his mental strength and resilience,” Prime Minister Modi wrote in his message.Governor Kataria echoed the theme, calling Fauja a global inspiration as he recalled walking with him during an anti-drugs campaign only a few months ago.“His stamina and spirit were unmatched,” Kataria said.Mann announced that the local govt school would be renamed in Fauja’s honour and his statue installed at the village stadium and a sports college in Jalandhar. “He brought international recognition not only to Punjab but also to the Sikh community,” the chief minister said.The centenarian athlete died on July 14 after being struck by a speeding SUV as he was crossing a highway near Beas on way to a roadside eatery named after his late son, Kuldeep. Amritpal Singh Dhillon, 26, a Canada-based NRI visiting nearby Dasupur village, was later arrested on charges of culpable homicide and rash driving.","Fauja Singh's sons Sukhjinder Singh and Harvinder Singh lit the pyre.

"Police across states, UTs classify all road deaths as ‘hit-and-run’ cases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/police-across-states-uts-classify-all-road-deaths-as-hit-and-run-cases/articleshow/122801612.cms,"File photo

Road fatalities in 2022

NEW DELHI: The Punjab Police catching the driver involved in marathon runner Fauja Singh’s death case within days has kicked off a debate why police across states can’t nab absconding drivers, instead classifying these cases as “hit and run” and making no headway in them. Analysis of the NCRB data of 2022 (the latest published report) show that in 125 police districts, 100% of all deaths due to “negligence relating to road accidents” causing deaths were put under the “hit and run” category.This trend was across most of the states and UTs, including two police districts in Delhi, NCR cities of Ghaziabad and Meerut, Dehradun, Nainital, Mathura, Agra, Gwalior, Ujjain, Jodhpur, Bokaro, Jalandhar Rural and Nagpur police commissionerate, raising questions over the quality of data and reports that police put in file in case of road accidents.Traffic safety experts and former senior police officers told TOI that it’s high time govt reviews how data in road crashes and deaths are collected and their sanctity. “It’s simply not possible that all deaths due to negligent driving are hit and run cases. In almost all states it’s the junior most person officially records road accidents and writes the FIR. The mechanism to audit the data before sending to the NCRB or publishing is weak.Such reports hardly serve any purpose,” said a former senior Delhi police officer.On the most probable reason for recording most cases as hit and run, an expert said once such a case is registered and concluded weeks after the incident, police hardly carry out an investigation.He added that in several cases, both parties also reach a compromise and the victims’ kin get the compensation from govt rather than pursuing the case.The data published by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) show that nearly 85% of all 384 road deaths due to negligence (section 304A of earlier IPC) in Uttarakhand were recorded as hit and run. In the case of Uttar Pradesh, this was recorded as the reason in 16,343 road fatalities out of 20,109 death cases that police registered under earlier IPC section. Out of its 78 police districts, 47 had reported all road fatalities under hit and run.It was no different even in the case of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand where more than 55% of road deaths registered under 304A of IPC were due to negligent driving. While in MP, 15 police districts had all deaths registered under hit and run, in the case of Jharkhand there were eight such police districts. However, there were some exceptions as well. States such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal where no police district recorded all road crash deaths as hit and run cases, as per NCRB.","Punjab Police catching the driver involved in marathon runner Fauja Singh’s death case within days has kicked off a debate why police across states can’t nab absconding drivers.

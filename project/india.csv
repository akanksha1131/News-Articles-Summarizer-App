India Meteorological Department: India’s weather forecasting to face long-term impact of US move to downsize NOAA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-weather-forecasting-to-face-long-term-impact-of-us-move-to-downsize-noaa/articleshow/120422657.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India Meteorological Department ’s (IMD) concerns intensified with the American Meteorological Society (AMS) releasing a formal statement late Thursday, highlighting the Trump administration ’s plan to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research through fund cuts that will result in the closure of all its weather, climate, and ocean laboratories, as well as cooperative institutes.The NOAA presently shares data with several countries, including India, which helps improve weather forecast accuracy. Although the US govt’s proposed move may not immediately impact India, it will affect the IMD’s forecasting skill in the long run.NOAA significantly contributes to the observing system in oceans, including the Indian and Pacific Oceans, which helps IMD in weather forecasting , disaster preparedness and climatic research.Both NOAA and India’s ministry of earth sciences (MoES) have a joint oceanographic data portal, launched in 2021. The collaboration under partnership agreement between the two agencies also helps in studying the Indian Ocean’s role in monsoon and improving monsoon forecasts .Asked about the impact of the proposed move, M Ravichandran, secretary, MoES, while releasing monsoon forecast early this week, said that India’s forecasting ability would remain unaffected in the short term but there might be consequences later.“If there is a cut in manpower, we do not have any problem. There is no problem even if the model is not there. The only thing is that they are significantly contributing to the observing system, especially in the ocean, be it the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean. If that is reduced, our forecasting skill will be reduced,” he said.Noting that the clue for monsoon forecasts comes from the ocean, the secretary said, “If we do not have proper ocean observations , we will definitely not be able to have better predictability”.The AMS statement came in partnership with the National Weather Association of the US that connects approximately 1,300 members from the fields of meteorology, hydrology, emergency management and academia.","The American Meteorological Society (AMS) released a formal statement late Thursday, highlighting the Trump administration ’s plan to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research.

'Half of student visas US revoked are of Indians',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-student-visas-us-revoked-are-of-indians/articleshow/120421897.cms,"Representative Image

The US state department and Immigration & Customs Enforcement continue to aggressively target international students with visa revocations, termination of their legal status, and removal. With Indians constituting the largest cohort of international students, it isn't surprising that the majority of those impacted are from India.The American Immigration Lawyers Association collected 327 reports of visa revocations and SEVIS terminations from attorneys, students, and university employees and found that 50% of these international students were from India, followed by 14% from China.Other significant countries represented in this data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.“These reports paint aconcerning picture of the arbitrary nature of these visa revocations and terminations,” it states in its policy brief.As per an Open Doors Report for the academic year 2023-24, India sent over 3.3 lakh students to pursue higher education in the US — an increase of 23% over the previous year. China was the second leading place of origin with almost 2.8 lakh students —this was a slight decline of 4% over the previous year. Anecdotal evidence shows that the number of Indian students aspiring to study in US is dipping sharply.However, even as the crackdown on international students continues, several hundred students have filed lawsuits in US district courts challenging arbitrary termination of their legal status. Several courts have also granted ‘temporary restraining orders’, enabling students to continue their study in US.Referring to AILA’s policy brief, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh posted on X: “A press statement issued yesterday by the American Immigration Lawyers Association is cause for concern to us in India. Out of the 327 visa revocation cases of international students collected by the organisation so far, 50% are Indians. The reasons for revocation are random and unclear. There is growing fear and apprehension. Will the external affairs minister take note and raise the concern with his US counterpart?” He also tagged foreign minister S Jaishankar.“We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the American govt regarding their F-1 visa status, which happens to be the student visa. We are looking into the matter. Our embassy and consulates are in touch with the students to provide support,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at a weekly press briefing.International students on completion of their studies are allowed to gain work experience under the optional practical training program for a year — this is further extended by two years from students hailing from the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field. According to the Open Doors Report, over 97,000 students undergoing OPT post completion of their studies were from India, whereas Chinese students pursuing OPT stood at around 61,000.AILA’s policy brief points out that 50% of the impacted students were on OPT. “These individuals are unable to work immediately upon the termination of their SEVIS record. The road to reinstating status for those who have already graduated and are employed on OPT is much more difficult and murkier than those who are currently students,” it stated.The grounds on which action was taken against international students were arbitrary. In some cases international students found their SEVIS records were terminated and/or visas revoked owing to a criminal record — and they did not have a history of interaction with police and there was nothing in their record that would prompt a visa revocation.Students who encountered police for infractions are instances which most US citizens would consider a daily occurrence. These included not wearing a seatbelt, tickets for illegal parking, or speeding tickets and did not warrant visa revocation and/or SEVIS termination , states AILA.There was no uniformity in the issue of notices of SEVIS termination. There were many cases where there was a delay between the SEVIS termination and when the student was informed. This is risky because if students kept working without knowing their SEVIS was terminated, it could affect their immigration status, states AILA’s policy brief.","The US state department and Immigration & Customs Enforcement continue to aggressively target international students. 50% of these international students were from India, followed by 14% from China.

Assure accused will not go to Tihar: UK extradition authority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assure-accused-will-not-go-to-tihar-uk-extradition-authority/articleshow/120421791.cms,"Tihar Jail

NEW DELHI: The deputy chief crown prosecutor who oversees extraditions from the UK has advised India to provide sovereign guarantee that any accused being sought to be extradited to New Delhi will not be kept in Tihar Jail, or subjected to torture and inhuman treatment in prison, reports Pradeep Thakur.The advice comes after two back-to-back rejections of extradition requests by UK courts, the last one on Apr 11 of Virkiran Awasty and his wife Ritika who are wanted in India in connection with an alleged Rs 750 crore bank fraud case. On Feb 27, the UK high court had rejected alleged arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari’s extradition while also refusing India permission to appeal in UK Supreme Court against its verdict.“...The Bhandari ruling will likewise affect other cases we are conducting which involve detention in Tihar Jail, namely the (Awasty) ‘Hassad Fraud’ case...” the prosecutor said in a communication to the Indian govt.Subject to what I set out below, all these cases will inevitably fail and further legal activity on them is futile,” the deputy chief crown prosecutor wrote.The prosecutor, who is supposed to help India with its extradition requests, told the govt it has to immediately assure UK courts in writing that no accused will run afoul of Article 3 of ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights), which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners. In rejecting Bhandari’s extradition, the court had concluded “a real risk of Article 3 mistreatment in Tihar Jail and a generalised risk of torture during interrogation”.The deputy chief crown prosecutor said that pending an assurance, “there is no prospect of a successful appeal in this case”, referring to the rejection of the Awastys’ extradition plea and further prospects of rejection of an appeal before higher courts in the UK.“I have to stress in the strongest possible terms that the only prospect left to us to salvage the case against Mr and Mrs Awasty is the urgent provision of an unequivocal assurance from the GoI. This has been discussed in various and repeated advice and conferences but has so far not been forthcoming,” the deputy chief crown prosecutor said.The assurance pertains to the govt giving an undertaking that the accused “will not be detained in Tihar Jail, either on remand or if and when convicted; if they are to be detained on remand or upon conviction, then the detention conditions will comply with Article 3”.The deputy chief crown prosecutor said if govt failed to give these undertakings, it would “not pursue any appeal” not only in the Awasty case but also in others even if there was merit in filing an appeal.A senior district judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London had on April 11 discharged the case of Awasty “on the grounds that, firstly and because he could not be satisfied Awasty’s Art 3 ECHR rights would not be violated in the event he was detained in Tihar Jail”. The other reason cited by the judge was “insufficient evidence for a prima facie case and for abuse of process based on the two-year delay in submitting the case following its earlier discharge”.The Crown Prosecution Service said it was ready to appeal against the verdict but as per existing conditions, it was difficult to assure a favourable outcome.“As far as the Article 3 grounds are concerned, based on the papers and the latest correspondence we have received from the govt of India, I advise now that there is no prospect of a successful appeal in this case. Further, if that remains the case, the Crown Prosecution Service will not be able to lodge the necessary grounds of appeal to sustain the appeal and accordingly Awasty will be discharged, bringing the case to an end,” it said.",Advice comes after two back-to-back rejections of extradition requests by UK courts. Virkiran Awasty and his wife Ritika are wanted in India in connection with an alleged Rs 750 crore bank fraud case. UK high court had rejected alleged arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari’s extradition.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120421841,imgsize-188810,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-41-.jpg"

Seelampur teen murder: 'Lady Don' held as cops probe gang rivalry angle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lady-don-under-lens-as-gang-revenge-angle-emerges-in-delhi-teens-murder/articleshow/120409591.cms,"Photo: X

NEW DELHI: A 17-year-old boy named Kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east Delhi’s New Seelampur on Thursday evening, triggering tensions in the area. According to police, a local woman named Zikra, allegedly known as the 'lady don', has been detained and is being investigated in connection with the murder.Kunal’s family has alleged that Zikra, who once worked as a bouncer for jailed gangster Hashim Baba's wife Zoya, was present at the scene when he was killed.“Zikra used to roam around in the area with a pistol. An incident happened with her cousin Sahil but my son was not involved in it. Yet they killed him. They brutally stabbed him multiple times,” Kunal’s mother Parveen told news agency PTI.Zikra was reportedly living with Zoya before the latter’s arrest by Delhi Police in a drug-related case. After Zoya was jailed, Zikra was said to be forming her own gang.She was previously arrested under the Arms Act after she posted a video on social media brandishing a pistol. She is currently out on bail and had been living in a rented house close to Kunal’s residence.Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) Pushpendra Kumar said, “We have identified the accused who will be nabbed soon. Ten teams have been formed to crack the case, and they are looking at all possible angles. We have detained a few people for questioning. The case will be solved soon.”CCTV footage led the police to identify two suspects, Sahil and Rehan, in connection with the stabbing. According to sources, Zikra has been detained for questioning, although no formal arrest has been made yet.The motive behind the murder appears to be an act of revenge. Sources revealed that Kunal may have been involved in an earlier attack on Zikra’s cousin Sahil. Police had registered an attempt to murder case against some members of Kunal’s community over that previous incident.“It is suspected that Kunal was also involved in the stabbing of Sahil. Although Sahil did not die, he, along with Zikra, hatched a plan to take revenge for the attack,” said a family source.Zikra reportedly was leading a gang of 10-12 youths, several of whom are now under scrutiny in connection with Kunal’s killing. Fear has reportedly gripped the locality, with some residents allegedly fleeing the area to escape possible retaliation.Amid growing unrest, local police and the Rapid Action Force (RAF) have been deployed to maintain order. Protests have been staged by local people and members of Hindu outfits, including the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). Posters bearing slogans like ""Hindus are migrating"" and ""Please help, Yoji ji"" appeared in the area but were later removed by police.The incident has further escalated tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with both blaming each other for the breakdown of law and order in the national capital.","A 17-year-old boy named Kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east Delhi’s New Seelampur.

Saddened and surprised: Kapil Sibal

NEW DELHI: Opposition leaders have strongly criticised Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar ’s recent comments targeting the Supreme Court, accusing him of undermining the judiciary and violating constitutional norms. Dhankhar had questioned the Supreme Court’s authority under Article 142 and criticised its verdict setting timelines for presidential assent to bills, sparking sharp reactions from opposition leaders.""Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces available to judiciary 24x7. We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3). There it has to be five judges when Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 odd more,"" Dhankhar had said.Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala expressed his deep disagreement with the Vice President's position, despite acknowledging Dhankhar's experience and intellect. He said the Supreme Court’s verdict was “timely, courageous and correct,” and clarified that even high offices such as the President or Governors are not immune to constitutional checks.“In our democracy, only the Constitution of India is supreme,” Surjewala said, adding, “Judicial independence is indeed a ‘nuclear missile’—to strike down injustice, arbitrariness and misuse of power.” He argued that if the President or Governors were allowed unchecked authority, it would render elected legislatures powerless. “The Constitution would never confer such unbridled powers,” he warned.Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee launched a scathing attack, accusing the Vice President of repeatedly making derogatory remarks about the judiciary. “This is not expected from someone holding a constitutional position,” he said.Banerjee demanded Dhankhar’s resignation, stating, “He does not deserve to remain in the post of Vice President of India. He cannot attack one of the pillars of our democracy.” His remarks came in response to Dhankhar calling Article 142 a “nuclear missile against democratic forces,” while questioning the Supreme Court’s power to direct the President.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Kumar Jha urged for a more balanced and sensitive approach among all institutions of democracy. ""Whether it is the executive, legislature, judiciary, or media, there has to be a fine balance,"" he said.Jha stressed the need for constructive engagement instead of conflict. “We are in an era of politics where we need to think with sensitivity,” he said, cautioning against confrontations that could damage institutional integrity.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva slammed Dhankhar’s comments as “unethical,” asserting that they violate the principle of separation of powers.“When all three branches act within their own spheres, we must remember that the Constitution is supreme,” Siva said. He backed the Supreme Court’s ruling, which set timelines for presidential assent, as a step towards protecting legislative authority from indefinite delays. “No constitutional authority can override bills passed by elected legislatures,” he added.Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Kapil Sibal also criticised comments on the judiciary, expressing disappointment and questioning his understanding of constitutional principles. Sibal said he was “saddened and surprised” by Dhankhar’s remarks, particularly the comparison of Article 142 to a “nuclear missile.”He defended the judiciary as one of the most trusted institutions and accused the government of selectively accepting court rulings based on political convenience. Sibal clarified that Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to ensure complete justice and stressed that the President is a titular head who acts solely on the advice of the Cabinet. He warned against distorting this framework and criticised the Vice President for questioning the court’s composition in key verdicts.Responding to Union ministers who echoed Dhankhar’s concerns, Sibal said the bench size is determined by the Court itself and must be respected. He also raised concerns over attempts to undermine the judiciary’s role.","Opposition leaders have strongly criticised Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar ’s recent comments targeting the Supreme Court.

VHP demands President's rule



Cracks in INIDA bloc?

NEW DELHI: West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose on Friday visited Malda to meet the Murshidabad riot-affected victims, who had to flee the district after violent clashes occurred during the anti-Waqf law protest last week.The governor, after the visit, claimed that women told him ""they were intimidated"" and that ""miscreants came into their houses and they were physically assaulted, abusive words were used"".Assuring proactive action, Bose said he had a detailed discussion with the victims in the camp where they have been staying as a temporary arrangement.""I met the family members who are in this camp. I had a detailed discussion with them. I listened to their grievances and understood their feelings. They also informed me of their requirements. Certainly, proactive action will be taken,"" the West Bengal governor, who ignored CM Mamata Banerjee 's request to postpone the visit, told news agency ANI.According to several reports, Bose is set to visit Murshidabad on Saturday, where the violence broke out, killing three people and injuring several others.Displaced residents taking refuge at a relief camp set up on the premises of Parlalpur High School in Malda claimed they were being ""confined"" and barred from leaving the campus or contacting their relatives.Tensions reportedly rose at the camp in Baishnabnagar when police restricted journalists from entering during the visit of Bose. The move sparked protests from the displaced people, who expressed frustration over the lack of communication and transparency.""We have been confined by police here and cannot move freely,"" alleged one of the camp inmates, according to ANI.""We are not allowed to go out or interact with our relatives here. We do not know why the media is not allowed inside when the governor is here and talking to us. We want the world to know about our talks with him,"" the inmate alleged.A team from the National Commission for Women (NCW), headed by chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar, also visited the Malda relief camp. The delegation reviewed the condition of women who were affected by the violence that followed anti-Waqf law protests .Expressing shock at the situation faced by the displaced women, Rahatkar said: ""I have met and interacted with women and children here at the camp. They have shared the situations they had faced. These women and children faced a lot of problems and they were forcibly evicted. What they had gone through is beyond imagination.""NCW member Archana Majumdar, who accompanied Rahatkar, alleged that the women were molested and forcibly thrown out of their homes.""It is the duty of the state government to protect them. What are they doing? Is the TMC government planning to turn West Bengal into a second Bangladesh?"" Majumdar said, lashing out at the state administration’s handling of the crisis.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) announced plans to hold a nationwide protest on Saturday, demanding the imposition of President's rule in the state. The Hindu outfit's president Alok Kumar said that the organisation’s members and supporters will stage dharnas at district headquarters across the country to protest the unrest in Murshidabad.""We will give memoranda to the district magistrates demanding that the central government contemplate the imposition of President's rule in West Bengal ,"" Kumar told news agency PTI.Referring to a meeting between CM Mamata Banerjee and Muslim clerics, Kumar noted her remark that the Murshidabad violence was ""pre-planned.""""If it is pre-planned, did the state intelligence agencies give any prior information to her government? And if not, who is responsible for such failure?"" he asked. ""If there was any report, why were precautionary measures to prevent the violence not taken?"" Kumar added.While the Trinamool Congress (TMC) accused the BJP of doing ""politics"" instead of taking appropriate steps, its ally Congress has planned a visit to the affected areas, which might not go well with Mamata.Kalyan Banerjee on Friday attacked Union home minister Amit Shah and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of doing ""politics"" instead of taking appropriate steps.""They (BJP) have been demanding President's rule (in West Bengal) since 2019. This is their routine demand. We do not give this demand any importance. The matter (Bengal violence) is going on in the High Court. The High Court is satisfied with the steps taken by us. The situation was definitely bad, but it has improved due to the steps taken by the state government and the state government also took the help of central paramilitary forces. All forces worked together and peace has been restored,"" Banerjee told ANI on the Murshidabad Violence.He further stated that all forces had worked together, and peace had been restored in the city.""Everything is normal in Murshidabad district... BJP is trying to do politics. Amit Shah is also engaging in politics instead of taking the necessary steps...They hatched a plan to indulge in riots,"" he added.Meanwhile, a delegation of the Congress, led by its West Bengal unit president Subhankar Sarkar, will visit riot-affected Shamsherganj in Murshidabad district on Saturday and review the situation there.During the visit to Shamsherganj around 2 PM, Sarkar will be accompanied by Malda Dakshin MP Isha Khan Choudhury, AICC observer Amba Prasad and other party leaders, he said.""We will go to the riot-hit areas of Shamsherganj and those around it tomorrow. We also have plans to visit other areas where there was violence,"" the Congress party official told PTI.","West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose on Friday visited Malda to meet the Murshidabad riot-affected victims.

DGCA orders probe into Air India Express captain Armaan's death at Delhi Airport

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered a thorough investigation into the death of Air India Express First Officer Armaan's death who had collapsed after safely landing a Srinagar-Delhi flight last Wednesday. In his order, DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai has said that the probe team will take into account factors like the deceased pilot's medical history; whether any protocol needs to be devised for crew with such medical conditions and the time taken at Delhi Airport in providing the pilot the required care and the quality of the same.The probe panel comprising of Vishal Yadav, DGCA's deputy director air safety as investigator-in-charge, and Group Captain Murtaza, DMS (CA) subject matter expert as a member, has been asked to submit its report ""preferably"" within six months.Kidwai has asked the team to examine these points, among any other that the investigation throws up: ""Whether the crew reported about sickness to air traffic control (ATC) while in air and if so, whether ATC initiated action appropriately; check the medical history of the deceased crew; whether due precaution was taken during rostering of such crew who has flying restriction due to medical reasons.""""(Whether) any specific medical checks are required for such pilots to undergo before undertaking the flights; whether remaining onboard crew took action when crew reported feeling unwell; time taken in taking him to the medical centre at the airport/civil hospital; check the level of preparedness of the medical centre at the airport in handling such emergencies,' the probe panel has been asked to examine these areas too and also ""examine the existing guidelines / circulars in this regard and suggest changes if needed.""First officer Armaan, 35, had suffered a ""sudden cardiac arrest"" while operating flight IX-1153 from Srinagar to Delhi on April 9, 2025. After safely landing in Delhi, he went to the aircraft lavatory where he vomited. He collapsed in the forward galley and was taken to the airport medical centre by cabin crew and ground staff. He was then taken to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj but could not be saved.Armaan, who went by his first name only, had joined Air India Express in 2023 from SpiceJet. He had flown for less than 12 hours in the last seven days, it is learnt.Following his death, the Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) had said in a statement there’s an urgent need to put in place transparent regulations that prioritise rest for pilots, safety and humane scheduling practices. The association, which represents over 800 pilots of various Indian carriers, has stressed the need for having comprehensive mental health support systems within airline organisations and not merely as checkboxes but as active, accessible, and stigma-free services. ALPA says the untimely death of Captain Armaan’s death raises troubling questions about pilot welfare, mental health, and working conditions in the Indian aviation industry.While not linking Armaan’s tragic death to fatigue, several pilots say they have for a long time been pleading for less strenuous working conditions in India. After a significant delay, slightly less strenuous flight duty time limitations (FDTL) rules — that govern key issues like how much a pilot can fly with what rest periods and limits on night flying — are set to be enforced from this summer.“Many pilots have lost their lives suddenly in last few years, especially post Covid, and we have been fighting for a more humane FDTL. We just hope nothing else delays implementation of the new rules, something which we have seen in the past. Well rested and not stressed pilots are key to safe flights,” said many senior pilots.",DGCA orders probe into Air India Express captain Armaan's death at Delhi Airport.

E-notices will be issued for non-compliance, and continued failure to pay may lead to FASTag suspension along with other VAHAN-related penalties, the statement warned.The ministry reiterated that this tech-driven upgrade is being piloted only at select toll plazas for now and is not a blanket nationwide rollout.","The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) dismissed reports suggesting that a satellite-based tolling system would be rolled out nationwide from 1 May 2025.

Poll What do you think about PM Modi's approach to international partnerships? Aiming to attract investment and technology. Focus on strengthening global ties and innovation.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he had a conversation with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , revisiting topics from their earlier in-person meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. The two leaders spoke about bolstering collaboration between India and the United States in the areas of technology and innovation.“Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year,” PM Modi posted on social media platform X. “We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,” he added.The call comes amid growing interest from Musk’s companies - particularly Tesla and Starlink - in entering the Indian market. Tesla has been in talks with Indian officials over setting up a manufacturing base in the country. Meanwhile, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio in March had announced a pact with Musk's SpaceX to bring Starlink satellite internet services in India. Telecom tycoon Sunil Bharti Mittal's Bharti Airtel has also signed a similar partnership deal with SpaceX.PM Modi and Musk had previously met in February during PM’s two-day state visit to the US, where both sides expressed optimism about future cooperation in emerging sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, and space.During the meeting, the PM had presented books to Elon Musk’s three children. He had gifted them The Crescent Moon by Rabindranath Tagore, The Great RK Narayan Collection, and Panchatantra by Pandit Vishnu Sharma. He later shared photos that show the kids reading the books.PM Modi had shared a post on social media addressed to Elon Musk where he wrote, “Had a very good meeting with Elon Musk in Washington DC. We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation. I talked about India’s efforts towards reform and furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.”The PM Modi-Musk call comes at a crucial juncture when permission for Starlink is stuck for security clearance. It also comes against the backdrop of ongoing negotiations for a proposed bilateral trade agreement between New Delhi and Washington.The two sides have aimed at finalising the first phase of the pact by fall (September-October) this year.Meanwhile, the government has already granted license to Startlink rivals Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite Communications for about one-and-a-half years for providing satellite internet services.However, these companies are yet to start their operation as the government has so far not finalised spectrum allocation rules.Starlink is considered to be a disruptor in this segment as it operates the world's biggest constellation of over 6,750 satellites whereas Eutelsat OneWeb has little over 600 satellites and Jio's satellite partners operate nearly 70.",PM Narendra Modi said he had a conversation with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

'Haven’t taken anybody’s name': Baba Ramdev defends 'sharbat jihad' remark amid Rooh Afza row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/havent-taken-anybodys-name-baba-ramdev-defends-sharbat-jihad-remark-amid-rooh-afza-row/articleshow/120403981.cms,"Baba Ramdev (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Friday defended his controversial "" sharbat jihad "" remark, saying he did not name any specific brand or community, even as criticism mounted over what was criticised as a communal statement allegedly aimed at the popular drink Rooh Afza .“I haven’t taken anybody’s name, but the Rooh Afza people took ‘sharbat jihad’ on themselves… this means they are doing this ‘jihad’,” Ramdev said.“If they are dedicated to Islam and are building masjids and madrasas, then they should be happy. However, the Sanatanis should understand… If someone has a problem with this, then let it be,"" he added.The controversy started around Baba Ramdev's statement earlier this week which was blasted by Congress leader Digvijaya Singh , who on Tuesday approached the TT Nagar police station in Bhopal demanding the registration of an FIR against Ramdev for allegedly promoting religious hatred and hurting communal sentiments.In his complaint, Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh, invoked sections 196(1)(a) and 299 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023, along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act. He alleged that Ramdev, while promoting Patanjali 's Gulab Sharbat, indirectly targeted Rooh Afza by implying that proceeds from its sale were used to fund madrasas and mosques — terming it “sharbat jihad.”Singh flagged a video purportedly shared from Ramdev’s official X account, claiming it was aimed at inciting communal sentiments to boost sales of Patanjali Ayurved's products. “This statement of Ramdev is hurtful, full of animosity, and intended to provoke religious sentiments,” Singh said. “Calling the sale of Rooh Afza ‘sharbat jihad’ is not just defamatory, but unconstitutional.”He had further alleged that Ramdev built a massive business empire by using religion and nationalism to promote his products, many of which, Singh claimed, have either failed to meet quality standards or have been banned by courts. “The entire country knows Ramdev was pointing at the Hamdard company, even though he didn’t name it directly,” Singh said. “Opposing a sharbat just because the owner is Muslim is hate speech, plain and simple.”Singh stated that if police fail to act within a week, he would approach the court seeking legal recourse. “I have demanded that an FIR be registered under the existing laws,” he said. Additional deputy commissioner of police Rashmi Agrawal confirmed that Singh’s complaint had been received. “We are probing the complaint and will take action as per the findings,” she said.","Baba Ramdev defends his controversial "" sharbat jihad "" remark.

NEW DELHI: Govt will earn from the ropeway project connecting Sonprayag, Gaurikund and Kedarnath without any investment as Adani Enterprises has quoted a share of around 42% of the revenue with NHLML, the agency implementing such projects across the country. Considering that the nearly 13 km rope-way is expected to get a large number of pilgrims as it promises to reduce travel time to barely 36 minutes from 8-9 hours, three out of the four bidders had offered revenue sharing with the agency.The National Highway Logistics Management Ltd (NHLML) had earlier cancelled bids twice and after making several improvements, fresh bids were invited. Recently, the Cabinet had given its approval for the Rs 4,081 crore project to be implemented on public private partnership (PPP) mode.The ropeway will have the capacity to transport 18,000 persons per day or around 32 lakh per year. The Kedarnath temple is usually open for six months. The project will be completed in six years and the successful bidder will have the right to operate, maintain and collect the fare for 35 years.The Sonprayag-Kedarnath ropeway will be based on Tri-cable Detachable Gondola (3S) technology and each gandola can accommodate 36 passengers.Last year around 23 lakh pilgrims visited Kedarnath shrine.Officials said that the financial bids for the 12.4 km Govindghat-Ghangaria-Hemkund Sahib ropeway project would be opened next week. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 2,730 crore and it will have the capacity to transport 11,000 passengers per day.","Govt will earn from the ropeway project connecting Sonprayag, Gaurikund and Kedarnath.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday hit out at the central government, asserting that the state would never bow to the authority of New Delhi. Reaffirming the state’s independent political stance, Stalin said ""Tamil Nadu will never yield to Delhi's administration "".“Union Minister Amit Shah says they will form a government here in 2026. I challenge him - Tamil Nadu will never yield to Delhi’s rule. That may work elsewhere through party poaching and raids, but not here. This formula won’t work in Tamil Nadu,” Stalin declared at a rally in Tiruvallur.He also questioned Union home minister Amit Shah on key issues affecting the state, including the Neet examination and language imposition. “Can Amit Shah guarantee an exemption from Neet? Can he promise that Hindi will not be imposed? Has the Centre provided special funds to Tamil Nadu? Can he assure that delimitation won’t reduce our parliamentary seats?” Stalin asked.Responding to recent controversial remarks by Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who called the Tamil Nadu government “dishonest” and its people “uncivilised,” Stalin said such attempts to divide the state through political rhetoric would fail. “Even the Prime Minister in Odisha made disparaging remarks about Tamilians. These tactics won’t work here. Tamil Nadu cannot be divided through politics,” he said.Earlier this week, Stalin had intensified his campaign for greater autonomy for Tamil Nadu, following repeated clashes between the DMK government and Governor RN Ravi over pending legislation. On April 15, he moved a resolution in the state assembly to form a high-level committee tasked with recommending ways to enhance the state’s powers and reclaim its rights.The committee, headed by former Supreme Court Justice Kurian Joseph, will include retired IAS officer Ashok Vardhan Shetty and scholar Mu Nagarajan.

Under the new process, candidates are likely to receive copies of OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) answer sheets, with SSC maintaining the records for future reference. SC asked the SSC to advertise for the exam by May 31, 2025, and complete recruitment by Dec 31, 2025.Sources said this time round, candidates may receive copies of answer sheets or OMR sheets after the exam. Provisional answer keys and final answer keys would be published, so that candidates can check them before the results are announced, maintaining transparency in the examination process.Learning from the current recruitment-related issues, SSC is trying to make the fresh recruitment procedure smooth to prevent complications. Sources confirmed that after the apex court order, SSC officials began reviewing draft rules to make minor modifications.""All major revisions were made in the draft copy that the SSC created in 2022, where minor modifications may be made as required,"" an official of the school education department said.Taking lessons from the previous examination, SSC is now prioritising the development of a more transparent and secure system for evaluating and preserving the answer sheets.

heard

saw

Growing up, I never heard a single swear word or indecent expression at home. The harshest one I remember was the rare reprimand, “Don’t be stupid”, from our mother which would send my sisters and me into tears for hours.In those days, decency was a non-negotiable virtue, and profanity, even when uttered by fringe voices, remained contained in the shadows, by a world untouched by social media's omnipresence. Public meetings with foul-mouthed speakers were forbidden territory.But today, the dam has burst.Words, once abandoned and found only rarely in Harold Robinson novels, are now flung around like stones in the street. The once-hushed four-letter words now find their way into our films and homes, seeping into innocent ears. College corridors ring with sexually explicit banter, and the virtual world overflows with vulgarity masquerading as stand-up comedy or free speech.Even amidst this, a recent political speech shocked the conscience of many. Delivered by a senior leader holding high office, it was a cocktail of crudeness—misogynistic, irreverent, and peppered with deliberate obscenity.Yes, free speech is the bedrock of a thriving democracy. But when profanity is dressed up as freedom, when it targets some genders, communities and denigrates symbols held sacred, it ceases to be expression and becomes aggression.It is at such junctures that the wisdom of Thiruvalluvar shines with piercing clarity.In the chapter titled “The Power of Speech”, he writes:Valluvar places this couplet in the section meant for ministers who advise kings, wield power, and influence the masses. Why? Because words, in the hands of the powerful, are like fire in the hands of a sorcerer—they can illuminate or incinerate.The—the Book of Wealth in—is often considered a manual on governance. Scholars further divide it into guidelines for kings, ministers, and frameworks for good governance. The fact that speech is highlighted in the ministerial section is no coincidence. Valluvar saw what many modern minds often overlook: governance isn't just about policies, it's about poise.Science is increasingly acknowledging the power of language on human perceptions. A study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison subjected participants to mismatched visuals and audio. When they were shown an image of a tiger but told it was a bear, their brains believed what theyrather than what they. The takeaway? Language doesn’t just describe reality; it shapes it.imagine the influence of a public speech. Every word carries a weight far heavier than the breath that bore it. It moulds opinions, cements prejudices, or inspires action. A speech cannot be separated from the speaker; words are but a larger picture of one’s inner self.Let every speaker ask himself or herself a question before stepping onto the stage:“Would I say these words in front of my daughter or granddaughter?” If that falters, the script must change.In an era that prizes volume over value, it is all the more vital that we return to the wisdom of restraint, prescribed by Valluvar.Let us choose our words with care. For they are not just sounds.They are seeds.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120404555,imgsize-76494,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/120404555.jpg"

The survey was completed in 2018, but the report remained under wraps for years.Another commission, led by Jayaprakash Hegde, revised the report using data from Kantharaj commission.Although CM Siddaramaiah seems inclined to implement the report, opposition from some of his ministers has proved a hurdle. Those opposed to the report fault the methodology, pointing to allegedly inflated data pertaining to marginal sub-castes within the Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities and lower representation of the dominant sub-castes.Some have complained that no enumerator visited their houses in past decade. These charges have been fuelled by allegations of enumerators admitting the exercise was riddled with challenges because of inadequate publicity and public awareness.Urban enumeration was particularly problematic as they purportedly couldn't enter gated communities or high-rise apartment complexes where people from some dominant caste groups reside.""We were asked to survey large areas in a short time. In cities like Bengaluru, we would be turned away from flats, with residents unwilling to disclose caste details,"" said an enumerator who worked at Rajajinagar.A field officer from Davanagere shared similar concerns. ""We were asked to record caste details based on sub-sect & not religion. Many entries had to be completed manually, and there was confusion about caste classification as people gave evasive answers. Some communities were unsure how to describe themselves. This was because there was no awareness about the exercise and why it was being conducted.""SK Murthy, a public policy researcher from Mysuru, said the govt should release the raw data and explain the methodology used for the survey. ""Transparency is key. If there are errors, let these be debated in the open. Independent data auditors should be brought in as there is still scope for making corrections,"" he said.Siddaramaiah declared recently that 95% of report was accurate. ""Without examining it, one should not dismiss it as unscientific.""The govt might set up a panel to re-examine the urban data. ""We are open to suggestions. Our aim is not to divide but to deliver welfare based on evidence,"" said a senior official in the chief minister's office.State BJP president BY Vijayendra said the Congress govt may have ""wasted over Rs 150 crore"" on an exercise whose credibility had been called into question by its own ministers. ""Many communities, including Jains and backwards classes, are contradicting the numbers shown in the report. BJP has repeatedly stated this survey was not carried out properly.CM Siddaramaiah contested reports of dissent within his cabinet over the caste survey report. ""It was discussed in cabinet yesterday. The data was incomplete, so next discussion is scheduled for May 2.

Headley was interrogated by NIA in the US just once in 2010.An officer privy to the case developments said an NIA team is probing Rana to gather undisclosed details of the 26/11 conspiracy - including the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds Hafiz Saeed, Zakir ur Rehman Lakhvi, Abdur Rehman, Ilyas Kashmiri and ISI officers Major Samir Ali and Major Iqbal etc, besides a contact in Dubai - that don't figure in the US department of justice's case records. NIA will take a call ""as and when needed"" on whether it should seek fresh access to Headley to confront him with any additional information revealed by Rana, an officer told TOI. It will be interesting to see how the US will view such a request.Sources said Rana, who had cited multiple health concerns in pleas before US courts to stall his extradition, is being subjected to medical examination every 48 hours in NIA custody. A source said Rana has been cooperating with the investigation, but brings up his ailments from time to time.Meanwhile, former home secretary G K Pillai, who was in office when Headley was questioned in the US by NIA, told TOI that Headley was Rana's prime link to the 26/11 conspiracy and would regularly update the latter on the Pakistani handlers' terror plans and reconnaissance tips. Headley had first informed Rana in 2006 that he was tasked by LeT to conduct surveillance of 26/11 targets. Rana, a deserter from Pakistan Army, was included in the terror plot by Headley, in consultation with his LeT handlers.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the conviction of seven villagers from Punjab's Nawanshahr for attempting to swindle land by forging the will of a soldier who vanished during World War 2, reports Ajay Sura.Harbans Singh , a native of Sheikhupur Bagh village, disappeared after 1943, prompting his wife Joginder Kaur to have him officially declared dead to claim his benefits as a legal heir. Decades later, the group of villagers falsely claimed Harbans had lived with one of them and passed away leaving a will, aiming to claim his property.As they failed to prove the presence of the soldier, HC upheld their conviction and three-year term awarded by the trial court. ""If it is proved that a person has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he was alive, then the burden of proof that he is still alive would rest upon the person who affirms the factum of his living,"" Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu said in his April 7 order.HC directed the seven, who were out on bail, to surrender before a Nawanshahr court within six weeks and undergo the remaining part of their sentence. Joginder, on whose complainant the FIR was filed in 1996, died during court proceedings, as did some of the accused.Joginder married Harbans in 1941, and he joined the Army about a year later. She never saw or heard from him after 1943. Harbans owned over 50 kanal (approximately 6.2 acres) of land. With no kids and advanced in age, she lived with one Bawa Singh, who supported her.""The offence is serious, inasmuch as, the petitioners committed forgery with a soldier who left his wife, house, and property to serve in WW2. Taking advantage of his absence, petitioners opened a fake bank account in the name of Harbans Singh, manufactured a forged will dated April 7, 1992, and thereafter, procured a false entry of his death. Thus, in the opinion of this court, petitioners do not deserve any leniency on the quantum of sentence,"" HC held while dismissing a plea by the seven against their conviction.According to the prosecution, the seven villagers forged a bank passbook of Joginder's husband, entered a false death record, concocted a will through impersonation, and manipulated revenue officials to fraudulently transfer land ownership. They were sentenced by the lower court in July 2010 and their conviction was later upheld by a sessions court. They later appealed in HC.","Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the conviction of seven villagers for attempting to swindle land.

Vasectomy failure does not imply medical negligence: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vasectomy-failure-does-not-imply-medical-negligence-hc/articleshow/120417485.cms,"Representative Image

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC overturned the compensation awarded to a couple who conceived a child after a failed vasectomy, reports Ajay Sura. HC said this was ""not due to medical negligence "" but because the couple did not exercise ""due care and caution"". While passing the order, judge Nidhi Gupta referred to a SC verdict, saying a sterilised woman can become pregnant due to natural causes but could opt for termination of pregnancy.The pleadings in the case took a dramatic turn with the husband comparing his restraint to that of Lord Ram, claiming he showed ""great tolerance"" by not abandoning his wife, invoking Sita's 'Agni Pariksha.' To this, HC referred to the couple's medical reports and said the girl born due to failed vasectomy was their daughter, so there was no cause for social stigma.The state had approached HC arguing that the couple ignored the post-surgery precautions advised by doctors.","Punjab and Haryana HC overturned the compensation awarded to a couple who conceived a child after a failed vasectomy.

800-page chargesheet filed against 'insurance mafia',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/800-page-chargesheet-filed-against-insurance-mafia/articleshow/120417484.cms,"MEERUT: Three months after a an insurance scam worth hundreds of crores was unearthed in Sambhal , police have filed an 800-page chargesheet against 11 accused - residents of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand. The group - dubbed the "" insurance mafia "" - allegedly created fraudulent life insurance policies involving the dying and even those already dead to siphon off money from reputed companies such as ICICI Prudential, PNB MetLife, Bajaj Allianz and SBI Life Insurance.TOI was the first to expose the scam and had then reported extensively on the reach, pattern and players involved in the multi-state fraud.The investigation, led by Sambhal SP Krishna Kumar Vishnoi, ASP Anukriti Sharma, and circle officer Deepak Kumar, came after a tip-off that revealed a 26-member syndicate operating across many states. These individuals were subsequently arrested in connection with several FIRs lodged against them.""The 800-page chargesheet, filed on Thursday, has every detail of the evidence collected from Jan 17 when an SUV was intercepted in Sambhal and unexplained cash in large quantity along with PAN cards, debit cards, etc, were found in it. That led to unearthing of the scam, spread across 12 states. As of now, we've named 11 accused, including Omkareshwar Mishra (Varanasi); Surajpal, Shahrukh Khan from Sambhal; and Shivendra Kumar from Bihar, in the chargesheet. Since it is an ongoing investigation, there are many others who are on the run or under the radar. Their names will be included in supplementary chargesheets,"" ASP Sharma said on Friday.The gang operated through a sophisticated and unethical scheme primarily targeting poor, terminally-ill people. These seriously sick men and women would be falsely presented as healthy to secure life insurance policies. Since they were often close to death, the gang paid the premiums and reaped full insurance benefits soon after their demise and disappeared.The criminals also managed to create backdated insurance policies for those who had already died. They then claimed and split the payout among themselves.""In certain cases, they offered the deceased's family a small share of the claim money. In others, the family concerned was left completely unaware and uncompensated,"" revealed ASP Sharma.Till now, 14 FIRs have been filed in police stations in Sambhal as well as in neighbouring districts such as Badaun, Moradabad and Amroha.","Police have filed an 800-page chargesheet against 11 accused - residents of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand.

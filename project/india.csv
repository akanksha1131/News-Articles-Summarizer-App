SC questions TN move to use temple funds for marriage halls' construction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-tn-move-to-use-temple-funds-for-marriage-halls-construction/articleshow/123933142.cms,"NEW DELHI: Questioning Tamil Nadu govt's decision to use surplus funds of temples to build marriage halls, Supreme Court on Tuesday said the assets and premises of religious place should not be used for construction of such halls where vulgar dance and songs might be played.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that it would not only be dance and music but people would even seek serving of liquor and there will be no control on such activity if it is allowed. The court turned down the plea to stay Madras high court order which had stayed the state govt decision, virtually restraining the state authority not to use temple funds. The court made it clear that spending of even a penny would amount to contempt.HC had quashed the govt orders allowing use of surplus funds belonging to five temples at different locations in Tamil Nadu. The state thereafter moved the apex court against the order of HC.Allaying the apprehension of the court that the temple premises would be misused, the state govt submitted that the construction of marriage halls was for public purpose and added that marrying in temple premises was very normal in the state.Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Jaideep Gupta said marriage in temples is always performed as per religious ritual without music and dance and sanctity of the religious place would not be violated.The bench, however, asked them why funds should not be used in setting up charitable educational institutions or hospitals.

MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

NEW DELHI: Even his opponents have acknowledged PM's oratorical skills. But what makes him so effective, as evident in his success in turning elections around to BJP's advantage, is also his use of humour as a lance.Deploying witty one-liners and playful jabs, rooted in common idioms and everyday experiences, he often has the audience in stitches, and the targets squirming.His associates recall that as Gujarat chief minister, Modi would riff on the immortal dialogue from Sholay and mock Congress for their ""cynical politics"" of luring voters by making promises which they never meant to keep.

CBSE issues notice on minimum requirements to appear in board examinations: Check details here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/cbse-issues-notice-on-minimum-requirements-to-appear-in-board-examinations-check-details-here/articleshow/123900628.cms,"Two-year structure is now binding

Mandatory attendance

Attendance will be closely tracked, and schools are required to maintain daily registers.

Condonation of up to 25% is allowed only under extreme circumstances, such as medical emergencies, bereavements, or national-level participation in sports and cultural events — and only if backed by valid documentation.

Students with poor attendance and no valid justification will be treated as ineligible, regardless of whether they are enrolled as regular candidates.

Internal assessment cannot be skipped

Internal assessment is conducted over two years and covers periodic tests, projects, and classroom participation.

Students who do not attend school regularly will automatically miss these assessments.

Without internal assessment records, CBSE will not declare results, and such students will be placed in the “Essential Repeat” category even if they appeared for theory exams.

Restrictions on additional subjects

Class X students can opt for two additional subjects beyond the compulsory five.

Class XII students can take one additional subject only.

These subjects, too, must be studied for the entire two-year programme.

Private candidates and repeaters

Students who previously opted for additional subjects but were placed in Compartment or Essential Repeat categories can reappear as private candidates.

However, students who have not followed the prescribed two-year study and attendance requirements are not eligible to offer additional subjects as private candidates.

Why this notice is significant

“Dummy candidates” who enroll without attending regular classes,

Schools that offer unapproved subjects without adequate facilities, and

Students who attempt to bypass the internal assessment framework.

The bigger picture

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a sweeping directive tightening the eligibility norms for students appearing in the Class 10 and 12 board examinations. The new notice makes it explicitly clear that no student will be allowed to write the exams without fulfilling strict academic performance and minimum attendance requirements, marking one of the board’s most stringent and far-reaching measures in recent years.The CBSE, under the Ministry of Education, emphasized that while the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) functions under the open and distance learning model, CBSE operates strictly through the face-to-face schooling framework. The latest guidelines are designed to ensure accountability, discipline, and proper implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.CBSE has formally declared that Class X and Class XII will be treated as two-year programmes. This means Class IX and Class X together constitute a complete course for the Class 10 exam, while Class XI and XII together form the foundation for the Class 12 exam.Any subject taken in board classes must have been studied for two consecutive years.Students attempting to take shortcuts, such as enrolling late or skipping foundation classes, will be disqualified.The board has made it explicit that students must have at least 75% attendance to be eligible for board exams.As per NEP-2020, internal assessments are no longer an optional add-on but a core, continuous evaluation mechanism.CBSE has also outlined strict rules for additional subjects:Further, the board has warned affiliated schools against offering subjects without approval. If a school lacks qualified teachers, laboratories, or CBSE’s formal permission, students will not be permitted to register for such subjects as main or additional papers.The notice clarifies the rules for repeat candidates:This announcement marks a decisive shift towards discipline and accountability within CBSE schools. It directly targets:By linking exam eligibility with two-year classroom learning, compulsory attendance, and continuous internal assessment, CBSE is enforcing a 360-degree compliance regime.The reforms are in line with NEP-2020, which stresses holistic, year-round evaluation over rote, exam-centric learning. For students, this means that showing up in school and participating in classroom learning is as important as performing in final board exams.For schools, it signals zero tolerance against unauthorized subject offerings and poor record-keeping.

UAE national day 2025: Cultural significance, inclusivity, and economic impact





Key cultural and social themes of this year’s celebrations include:

Unity and national pride among Emirati citizens.

Inclusion and participation of the UAE’s large expatriate community, invited to take part in public festivities.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet confirmed the status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances.

Kash Patel to be fired for Charlie Kirk probe blunders?

FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel. ""Any suggestion that I was brought in to replace anyone in leadership at the FBI or spin my appointment into a sign of division, is simply false - I am honored to serve the FBI and Department of Justice as we work together to keep our nation safe,"" he said.Meanwhile in a separate but related development Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with.”","Andrew Bailey will be sworn in as co-deputy director of the FBI today.

Daylight Saving Time: Change ends sooner than usual; when will the clocks fall back?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daylight-saving-time-change-ends-sooner-than-usual-when-will-the-clocks-fall-back/articleshow/123863573.cms,".





Daylight saving time (DST) will end sooner than usual this year on Sunday, November 2, 2025, at 2:00 am local time.With it, Americans will have an extra hour of sleep, and also earlier sunsets in many regions. This year’s change is a day earlier than last year and is the second-earliest possible date for the shift since daylight saving time falls on the first Saturday in November, the earliest possible date is November 1.Experts often remind people to use the extra hour to reset sleep schedules, check smoke detector batteries, and prepare for the shorter days ahead, making the shift a small but useful reminder to prioritize health and safety.Daylight saving time, observed from March to November, was introduced to make better use of daylight. In spring, clocks are moved forward to extend evening daylight, while in autumn, clocks are set back to give more light in the mornings.Under current federal rules set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. Next year, clocks will move forward again on Sunday, March 8, 2026.Most US states follow DST, but not all. Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe the change, citing limited benefit due to their climates. The Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, does observe DST to maintain consistent time across its territory. Five US territories, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, also do not follow DST.For many Americans, shifting the clocks requires changes to daily routines. Longer daylight in spring is generally seen as a benefit, while the fall shift brings darker mornings and earlier sunsets, disrupting commutes, outdoor plans, and schedules.","This year's change is a day earlier than last year and is the second-earliest possible date for the shift.

NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of his two-day tour of the North-East last week, PM Narendra Modi appears to be preparing for another tour of the region. He is likely to visit Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh later this month, his back-to-back trips, which hardly featured on the travel plans of his predecessors, being another instance that demonstrates his relentless travel zeal, which he has shown since his days as an RSS pracharak, has not dimmed with age or changes in role.These excursions have provided opportunities for him to disseminate his messages, expedite the implementation of schemes, and gather feedback.On Wednesday, he will mark his 75th birthday in MP, launching welfare schemes, in keeping with his plank of inclusive development.Modi's journeys have been an integral part of his politics. In 1990, he helped organise the Somnath-Ayodhya Rath Yatra, igniting pride amongst Hindus that laid the foundations for BJP to emerge at the national level.The Ekta Yatra (1991-92), which he led along with former BJP chief MM Joshi, and which culminated in hoisting the national flag at Srinagar's Lal Chowk, symbolised defiance of terrorism.As Gujarat CM, Modi's Gujarat Gaurav Yatra (2002) restored hope after a devastating earthquake, while the Swarnim Gujarat Yatra (2010) celebrated the state's progress. ""Each journey was a bridge to the people, rooted in their aspirations,"" said BJP national media head Anil Baluni.""From his days as an RSS pracharak to his role as India's PM, Modi's travels have always been about more than speeches. They are about meeting people where they are, listening to their dreams, and turning their stories into national pride,"" the BJP functionary said.The effort has been supplemented by his monthly radio address, ' Mann Ki Baat ', an innovation that he has skillfully used to weave individual feats into his larger message of Viksit Bharat.Whether celebrating a tribal woman reviving Santhali handlooms in Odisha or cheering at Pulwama's first night cricket match, the PM has been actively involved in celebrating such achievements.The Covid pandemic saw him utilise addresses and app-based outreach to transform a public health crisis into a mass movement, fostering unity.His words during security crises, like ""ghar mein ghus ke marenge"", have been the vehicles of signaling collective resolve and rally spirits during crises. He stood in solidarity with K Sivan and other Isro scientists when the Chandrayaan-2 mission failed, and has been playing the understanding patriarch-cum-counsellor to anxiety-filled students during his 'Pariksha Pe Charcha'.","PM Narendra Modi appears to be preparing for another tour of the North-East.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh called on the armed forces to move beyond traditional notions of warfare and remain prepared for ""invisible challenges"" such as information, ideological, ecological, and biological warfare.His remarks came at the Combined Commanders’ Conference 2025 in Kolkata on September 16, according to a Ministry of Defence press release.Emphasising the rapidly shifting global order, regional instability, and emerging security threats, Singh said constant reassessment of the world’s changes was critical for India’s security. He underlined that the “nature of warfare is continuously evolving,” with recent global conflicts highlighting the need for a “technology-friendly” military.“Wars of today are so sudden and unpredictable that it is extremely difficult to foretell its duration. It can be two months, a year, or even five years. We need to be prepared. We need to ensure that our surge capacity remains sufficient,” the Defence minister said, according to news agency ANI.Terming India’s defence posture an amalgamation of offensive and defensive capabilities, Singh urged commanders to proactively shape strategies and “strive to build the Sudarshan Chakra as envisioned by PM Modi.”A committee has been formed to examine the project and prepare a “realistic action plan,” he said, suggesting a five-year medium-term plan and a ten-year long-term plan to make the vision a reality.He also called for adopting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of “JAI (Jointness, Aatmanirbharta and Innovation)” to drive modernisation, operational readiness, technological superiority, and credible deterrence.Stressing the importance of partnerships, Singh batted for deeper engagement with industry and academia to develop future-ready technologies. He reaffirmed PM Modi’s vision to expand the private sector’s role in building a robust defence innovation ecosystem and making India’s domestic industry “the biggest & best in the world.”Equally vital, he said, was synergy among the Armed Forces and civil agencies. Calling jointness “essential” to confront future challenges, Singh pointed to initiatives such as the creation of Tri-Service Logistics Nodes and a Tri-Service Logistic Management Application to enhance integration.Highlighting India’s growing self-reliance, Singh said: “Operation Sindoor has demonstrated that Strength, Strategy and Self-reliance are the three pillars that will give India the power it needs in the 21st century. Today, we have the capability to face any challenge with the help of indigenous platforms and systems coupled with the indomitable courage of our soldiers. This is the real strength of Aatmanirbhar Bharat .”Reiterating that self-reliance is “not a slogan, but a necessity,” Singh argued that defence indigenisation under Aatmanirbhar Bharat is fueling economic growth, generating jobs, and boosting capacities of shipyards, aerospace clusters, and defence corridors.He announced his approval of the Defence Procurement Manual 2025 to streamline acquisitions, while noting that the Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 is also being revised to “simplify the processes, reduce delays, and provide operational strength to the forces quickly.”The conference was attended by Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, DRDO Chairman Dr Samir V Kamat, and other senior officials.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh calls on armed forces to move beyond traditional notions of warfare.

Its last meeting with LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) on May 27 yielded a domicile policy but no progress since.Kargil Autonomous Hill Development Council chairman M Jaffar Akhoon urged Wangchuk to call off his strike.“Whatever we are to achieve, it has to come from govt, be it statehood, Sixth Schedule, or any other benefit. These issues will be decided at the talks. If you go on a hunger strike before dialogue even begins, it will not be a good move,” Akhoon said.BJP functionaries also appealed for an end to the fast, warning that “outside activists with radical views” had joined the protest. The party also blamed LAB’s internal rifts for stalled talks, alleging Chhewang was sidelined.Wangchuk has linked his protest to Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) elections due in Oct — calling it a test of BJP’s credibility. “In the previous elections, the party listed Sixth Schedule for Ladakh as its first priority in its manifesto. But now, after five years, they want to bury that point,” he had said.BJP swept the 2020 LAHDC-Leh polls, winning 15 of 26 seats. The council was created in 1995 under then PM PV Narasimha Rao, with a parallel body for Kargil set up in 2003 by then J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.","Former MP Thupstan Chhewang will head a Buddhist delegation in talks with Union govt on Ladakh’s demand for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.

Political tempers rise in Kashmir over highway closure; netas allege conspiracy to choke Valley’s economy as fruit-landed trucks stranded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-tempers-rise-in-kashmir-over-highway-closure-netas-allege-conspiracy-to-choke-valleys-economy-as-fruit-landed-trucks-stranded/articleshow/123928245.cms,"SRINAGAR: As Jammu-Srinagar national highway, a lifeline for Kashmir, has remained closed to heavy traffic for the past 20 days, leaving thousands of fruit-laden trucks stranded, both the Centre and the Omar Abdullah govt have come under fire from political parties in J&K.Although the highway was partially reopened on Tuesday, with authorities permitting one-way traffic from Jammu to Srinagar, videos of distressed truckers stranded on the roads have sparked fury in Kashmir Valley. Some politicians alleged the prolonged NH closure in the peak fruit harvest season was part of a conspiracy to hit Kashmir’s economy.PDP’s Iltija Mufti met LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday and sought his intervention to expedite the highway repair work. She also appealed for an interim package for fruit growers.While PDP and some other parties blamed Omar govt for the crisis that fruit growers in the Valley are facing due to the NH closure, the CM had on Monday expressed displeasure with NHAI’s failure to restore the road in 20 days.A cornered Omar has held several meetings since Monday, seeking a solution to the crisis. At his initiative, Union minister for road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari convened a meeting on Tuesday to review the restoration of the highway.“The meeting deliberated on immediate steps required to fully restore NH-44 for the urgent movement of fruit-laden trucks and uninterrupted supply of essentials,” said the CM, who joined through virtual mode.The highway had suffered major damage in several stretches, particularly in Udhampur, after heavy rains on Aug 26-27, which triggered flash floods and landslides. The restoration work is still ongoing.On Tuesday, authorities permitted traffic movement from Jammu to Srinagar, while trucks carrying essential commodities were allowed from Udhampur to Kashmir Valley, bringing some relief to people facing shortage of essentials. However, no vehicle movement from Srinagar towards Jammu was allowed.This prompted Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of governing NC to allege it was a deliberate attack on Kashmir’s economy. Horticulture and agriculture contributed 75% to Kashmir’s GDP, and allowing fruits worth crores to rot in stranded trucks was intended at making the Valley’s economy dysfunctional, he alleged.Awami Ittehad Party, too, alleged that Kashmir’s economy was being deliberately choked, and staged a protest.Peoples Conference chief and Handwara MLA Sajad Lone urged Omar to travel to Delhi and ensure expeditious clearance of the highway.CPM legislator M Y Tarigami and Congress J&K president Tariq Hamid Karra blamed the Centre for the crisis. Karra described the widening of Jammu-Srinagar highway as a “failed project”, alleging that the Union govt’s approach of blasting the mountains to widen the roads lacked scientific basis and was responsible for the widespread destruction in the Himalayan states, with nature taking its revenge.Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Arun Gupta, too, wrote to Gadkari, urging that concrete steps be taken to make the highway fully operational at the earliest.","Jammu-Srinagar national highway has remained closed to heavy traffic for the past 20 days, leaving thousands of fruit-laden trucks stranded.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday asked states, which have enacted anti-conversion legislations and most of which are governed by BJP, to file their responses to pleas challenging stringent provisions in those laws criminalising inter-faith marriages. The laws seek to prohibit conversion through threat, allurement, deceit or influence. At the same time, SC put the onus on individuals to prove their marital ties haven't been forged through deceit.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K V Vinod Chandran asked the states which have enacted the anti-conversion laws, also known as 'Freedom of Religion Acts', to respond to the allegations levelled by petitioners, including Teesta Setalvad-led Citizens for Justice and Peace , People's Union for Civil Liberties, women's wing of Communist Party of India - National Federation of Indian Women and Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind.The states which have enacted anti-conversion laws include UP, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Odisha, HP, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Arunachal Pradesh.Responding to the plea by petitioners for staying the laws, the bench said it will consider freezing them after the states file their responses. It asked the states to file their response in four weeks and posted the matter for hearing after six weeks.Senior advocate C U Singh, appearing for CJP, said the petitioner has sought permission to amend the petition to challenge the changes made in the anti-conversion law of Uttar Pradesh, which now provide for a minimum punishment of 20 years incarceration on conviction under the law. He said getting bail under such stringent laws would be very difficult. The bench permitted the petitioner to amend the petition.Senior advocate Indira Jaising sought transfer of a petition, which is pending in Madhya Pradesh high court challenging the state's anti-conversion law, to Supreme Court. Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj said all petitions pending in HCs could be transferred to SC for adjudication to avoid multiplicity of proceedings on the same issue and for a comprehensive ruling.The court ordered the de-tagging of advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay's plea seeking ban on conversion.

SC slams Maharashtra poll panel for ‘inaction and incompetence',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-slams-maharashtra-poll-panel-for-inaction-and-incompetence/articleshow/123931253.cms,"NEW DELHI: Extending the Sept 30 deadline for completion of the Maharashtra local body elections by four months to Jan 31 next year, Supreme Court on Tuesday upbraided the state election commission (SEC) for its inability to complete the delimitation process and requisition adequate number of EVMs and poll staff.Though it acceded to the SEC's request for extension of deadline for completion of elections to zilla parishads, panchayat samities and municipalities, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said four months were given to you by the court on May 6, and the SEC is coming with a bunch of excuses 10 days after the expiry of deadline seeking more time.The SEC said it has completed the delimitation exercise in the zilla parishads and panchayat samilities and the process is ongoing for municipalities. It said that it has around 60,000 EVMs and would require 50,000 more from the Election Commission. The coming festive season and board examinations in March next year would make it difficult to requisition adequate poll staff and returning officers, it said.When it said it would also require the voter list of the last assembly election from EC, the bench came down heavily on it and said, ""You (SEC) did not know these are the requirements? Are local body elections being held for the first time in Maharashtra? All these show your inaction and incompetence.""The bench asked the Maharashtra govt to provide necessary polling staff and returning officers to the SEC by Nov end and ordered the SEC to complete the elections by Jan 31.""No further extension of time would be given,"" the bench said and asked the SEC to file periodic compliance reports about requisition of EVMs, voter list and poll staff.On May 6, a bench led by Justice Kant allowed the elections based on OBC reservations applicable to constituencies as applicable prior to July 2010 as the recommendations of the Banthia Commission had not been fully crystallised by the state.Elections had not been held in many local bodies for years because of SC's Aug 2022 status quo order on petitions challenging a state ordinance, which had provided for 27% OBC reservation in local bodies based on recommendation of the Banthia Commission.","Supreme Court extends deadline for completion of Maharashtra local body elections by four months to Jan 31 next year.

Can’t penalise retired employee for ‘misconduct’ without proper inquiry: HC bench,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-penalise-retired-employee-for-misconduct-without-proper-inquiry-hc-bench/articleshow/123928203.cms,"JAMMU: A division bench of J&K high court has quashed a govt order that directed the recovery of honorarium from the pension of a retired police officer, stating disciplinary proceedings cannot be extended beyond retirement unless backed by due process and proof of loss.A bench of Justice Sanjeev Kumar and Justice Sanjay Parihar made the ruling while hearing a petition from Sudershan Mehta, a retired deputy superintendent of police, who said he was being penalised for serving as joint secretary of Jammu & Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) while in service.The court said a retired person cannot be subjected to departmental proceedings for misconduct committed during service unless specific charges of negligence or fraud causing loss are established in proper inquiry. It added the govt order is clearly in violation of principles of natural justice and cannot be sustained.Senior additional advocate general Monika Kohli said Mehta had violated service conduct rules by accepting a remunerated post in JKCA between 2003 and 2016 without prior approval.Kohli cited Article 168-A of J&K Civil Service Regulations, which allowed recovery from pension for losses caused by an employee.An inquiry officer had concluded Mehta had received a monthly honorarium of Rs 12,000 in addition to his govt salary, following which the home department had ordered the recovery of the amount from his pension in Nov 2022.Mehta's counsel, Parveen Kapahi, said no charge of financial loss had been framed against him, making the recovery untenable.Dismissing the govt order, the court further said about 51 other senior officers had also held posts in sports associations without prior sanction, but no similar action was taken against them.",A bench of Justice Sanjeev Kumar and Justice Sanjay Parihar made the ruling while hearing a petition from Sudershan Mehta.

""Subjecting political parties to the POSH Act would open a Pandora's box and become a tool for blackmail,"" it said.Appearing for petitioner Yogamaya G, senior advocate Shobha Gupta told a CJI Gavai-led bench that though many women are active members of political parties, only CPM has set up an internal complaint committee (ICC) with external members. This leaves women in political parties remediless against sexual harassment.Demanding that the law must apply in equal rigour to registered parties which owe allegiance to the Constitution that mandates protection of dignity of women, including safe work atmosphere, the petitioner alleged that AAP lacks transparency about its committee while BJP and Congress have admitted to inadequate ICC structure.But, the bench asked, ""How do you equate political parties as workplace? When a person joins a political party, it is not employment. It is not a job as they join political parties on their own volition and on non-remuneration basis.

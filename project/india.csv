Invited by Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman, this trip will be PM Modi’s third to the Kingdom after earlier visits in 2016 and 2019. It comes as part of the ongoing high-level diplomatic engagements between the two nations, following the Crown Prince’s own state visit to New Delhi for the G20 Summit in September 2023.PM Modi and the Crown Prince will co-chair the second meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council during the visit. According to Indian Ambassador Suhel Ajaz Khan, a large number of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) are expected to be signed, with key discussions centred on strengthening economic ties, bolstering defence cooperation and addressing regional political challenges.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Jeddah, India and Saudi Arabia are set to sign at least six MoUs on Tuesday, with talks ongoing to finalize more. Key agreements are expected in space, energy, health, science, culture, and advanced technology, news agency PTI reported quoting sources. PM Modi will also discuss the Hajj quota for Indian pilgrims with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Sources said over a dozen MoUs are under discussion, with efforts underway to conclude additional deals in trade, investment, and defence.""Jeddah is a very, very significant city in terms of connectivity between India and Saudi Arabia because for centuries, Jeddah was the port for the trade between the two countries, and it is also a gateway to Mecca.

City 'love crime victim' was actually lone witness in a murder case: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/city-love-crime-victim-was-actually-lone-witness-in-a-murder-case-cops/articleshow/120501637.cms,"Committed crime to 'prove himself', says hired killer

NEW DELHI: What had initially appeared to be a case of a 'spurned lover's rage' turned out to be a calculated murder-for-hire plot . Twenty-year-old Sayra Parveen was shot dead on April 14 in east Delhi's GTB Enclave, not over jealousy as her 'boyfriend' Rizwan (20) first claimed when he was arrested, but because she was a key witness in a murder case, say cops. Delhi Police has now arrested two more men who allegedly masterminded the conspiracy to silence her. The accused were identified as Kishan Kumar (39) and Firoj Khan alias Aman (22).The case came to light on April 14 when Parveen was found murdered. She had gone to meet Rizwan, whom she befriended through social media. Police nabbed Rizwan from Karnal in Haryana based on CCTV footage that showed the duo together before the murder.DCP (Shahdara) Prashant Priya Gautam stated that Rizwan initially misled investigators by claiming he killed Parveen out of jealousy, alleging she was with someone else. However, during sustained interrogation, Rizwan confessed that he was actually hired by Kishan and Firoj to kill Parveen.The inquiry revealed that Parveen was a key witness in the murder case of Rahul, which occurred four months ago. ""The incident took place when Parveen was harassed and assaulted by a group of local boys in Nand Nagri. Rahul, who was passing by, intervened to help her. The confrontation turned violent and ended in Rahul's killing. Parveen was made a witness in the murder case,"" police said.According to a police source, Kishan, Rahul's uncle, and Firoj, a friend of the deceased, harboured resentment towards Parveen. They blamed her for Rahul's death, believing that if she wasn't involved in the altercation, Rahul wouldn't have intervened and been killed. Additionally, they feared that Parveen's friendship with some of the suspects would weaken the case, as she might turn hostile in court. This led them to plan her killing.The accused hired Rizwan to befriend Parveen through social media. They met twice. On April 14, Rizwan found the opportunity and executed the plan.The duo paid Rizwan Rs 15,000 and gave him a pistol to kill Parveen, promising Rs 1 lakh more. Rizwan, 'aspiring to be a gangster', confessed to the crime to prove himself. Kishan and Firoj were arrested. The weapon used in the crime and cash were recovered, along with mobile phones.","Sayra Parveen, 20, was shot dead on April 14 in east Delhi's GTB Enclave.

After a thrilling night 1, WrestleMania 2 featured several high-octane matchups, including the highly anticipated headlining match, Cody Rhodes vs. John Cena , as the WWE veteran challenged Rhodes for his championship he held for a year. The night was filled with action and astonishing drama, with 63,226 in attendance as announced by Stone Cold Steve Austin. Here are the results and highlights of WrestleMania Night 2 on April 20.WrestleMania Sunday kicked off with a wild Triple Threat Match between IYO SKY, Rhea Ripley, and Bianca Belair. From the opening bell, it was nonstop chaos. Belair and Ripley initially clashed while SKY inserted herself with fast-paced offense. The crowd was red hot as each woman delivered huge moments, including Ripley’s headbutts, Belair’s signature power moves, and SKY’s high-flying attacks. Multiple near-falls kept fans on edge, and the energy built to a wild finish. After surviving a KOD, SKY landed her Over the Moonsault on Belair just in time, scoring the pin to retain the Women’s World Championship in a show-stealer.Drew McIntyre and Damian Priest went to war in a brutal Sin City Street Fight. McIntyre came out swinging before Priest battled back with weapons and hard shots outside the ring. Both men dished out punishment using chairs, steps, and tables. The chaos peaked when Priest sent McIntyre through a table with a Razor’s Edge. However, the Scottish Warrior survived and hit a DDT on the steel steps. In the final moments, Priest tried walking the ropes, but McIntyre launched him through two tables. One last Claymore, smashing Priest’s head into a wedged chair, sealed the win for McIntyre.Dominik Mysterio kicked things off with a lucha mask mishap. Once the bell rang, chaos erupted in the squared circle. Bron Breakker bulldozed through everyone, but Penta’s aerial offense kept him in the fight. Balor, Penta, and Mysterio all had their moments, with wild sequences and near falls. Carlito tried to interfere, but Breakker sent him crashing through a table. In the final stretch, Balor hit Coup de Grace on Breakker, only for Mysterio to fly in with a Frog Splash to steal the pin. In a wild and unpredictable match, Dominik walked out victorious.Randy Orton made his entrance to a thunderous roar at Allegiant Stadium. Celebrating his 20th WrestleMania, Orton vowed to deliver another RKO moment, this time against a surprise opponent, TNA World Champion Joe Hendry. The match was quick and energetic. Hendry showed off strength and charisma, even landing a fallaway slam and a kip-up. But as he celebrated, Orton struck with a sudden, picture-perfect RKO to seal the victory.AJ Styles and Logan Paul battled in a fast-paced, back-and-forth showdown. Styles came out aggressive, but Paul held his own with big moves like the Lionsault and Buckshot Lariat. Both men traded near-falls and signature finishers. Styles nearly stole it after countering Paul’s own version of the Styles Clash. In the end, interference almost tipped the scales, but Styles rejected help. Just as he tried the Phenomenal Forearm, Paul dodged and nailed him with the loaded fist before hitting the Paul-verizer for the controversial win.Becky Lynch and Liv Morgan finally clashed after nearly a year. Morgan played mind games early. Raquel Rodriguez and Morgan dominated Lyra Valkyria for most of the match, isolating her from Lynch. After a hot tag, Lynch exploded with strikes, suplexes, and a near submission before chaos broke loose. Valkyria hit a tornado DDT on Rodriguez at the ringside, and Morgan nearly stole the win with Ob-Liv-ion. But in the end, Lynch countered with a Manhandle Slam to seal the victory.John Cena's final WrestleMania was a wild ride. He battled Cody Rhodes in a grueling match filled with close calls, counters, and chaos. Rhodes kicked out of multiple AAs, and even a referee bump led to more drama. Travis Scott got involved, only to be taken out by Rhodes. When it looked like Rhodes had the upper hand, Cena delivered a low blow and leveled him with the championship belt. The ref counted three. With that, Cena made history to claim his seventeenth World Championship.Also Read: WrestleMania 41 Main Event Results: John Cena becomes the WWE World Champion for the 17th time, the Time is Now!","WrestleMania 2 featured several high-octane matchups, including the highly anticipated headlining match, Cody Rhodes vs. John Cena.

NEW DELHI: In a shocking twist to the death of former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, Bengaluru Police have detained his wife, Pallavi, after she allegedly threw chilli powder in his face and stabbed him to death in their HSR Layout residence.Their daughter, Kriti, has also been detained for questioning as investigators dig deeper into what appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.The development comes following a formal complaint filed by the deceased officer’s son, who alleged that both women had a role in the killing.According to police sources, the 68-year-old retired IPS officer was killed following a heated argument with Pallavi, who reportedly lost control and attacked him with a knife after blinding him with chilli powder, reported PTI.The murder is said to have occurred on the ground floor of their three-storeyed home on Sunday, where Prakash was found lying in a pool of blood.What makes the case more chilling is what followed: PTI sources say Pallavi made a video call to a friend immediately after the incident and declared, “I have killed the monster.”Prakash's son Kartikesh has come forward with a damning accusation that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for a week, and that his sister Kriti pressured him to return home just two days before his death.“Due to these threats, my father had gone to stay at his sister’s house,” Kartikesh said in his police complaint. “My younger sister Kriti went there and brought him back against his will.”According to the complaint, the fatal incident came to light around 5 pm on Sunday when a neighbor alerted Kartikesh while he was at the Karnataka Golf Association. “I rushed home and found police and others already there. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found near his body,” he said, adding that his father was taken to St John’s Hospital.“My mother Pallavi and sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect they are involved in his murder,” he added, urging police to take legal action.Investigators believe the murder was the result of long-standing tensions in the family, including a property dispute over land in Dandeli, Karnataka. Sources said the couple had frequent confrontations, and Pallavi had even visited the HSR Layout police station months ago to file a complaint. When her grievance wasn't taken seriously, she allegedly staged a dharna outside the police station.Pallavi is also reportedly undergoing treatment for schizophrenia and has been on medication, police sources revealed.Om Prakash, a 1981-batch IPS officer from Champaran, Bihar, had an illustrious career in the Karnataka police force. He held a Master’s degree in Geology and rose through the ranks to serve as Director General and Inspector General of Police from March 1, 2015, until his retirement in March 2017.He began his service in Ballari district as Additional Superintendent of Police and held key roles in Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, the Lokayukta, and the Fire and Emergency Services.The case has sparked massive interest in Karnataka and beyond, with police sources earlier confirming the use of a weapon and visible signs of physical assault. An autopsy report is awaited, and further investigation is underway.","Former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, 68, was found dead in his home on Sunday.

The missed visit



Canonisations that inspired a nation



A papacy marked by both unity and discord



NEW DELHI: Pope Francis and India shared a deep yet distant relationship of spiritual milestones, gestures of recognition of cardinals, and an unfulfilled dream—a papal visit that never came to pass.The visit that was most likely to be held this year- the Jubilee Year - could not materialize as the Pope passed away on Easter Monday at the age of 88.His departure attracted condolence from leaders across political ideologies with Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalling his meeting him. ""I fondly recall my meetings with him and was greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development. His affection for the people of India will always be cherished. May his soul find eternal peace in God’s embrace,"" he said.Despite his long-standing desire to visit India, Pope Francis never made the journey. Hopes were high that his visit would align with PM Modi’s trip to the Vatican, but the plan ultimately didn’t materialize. Still, his efforts to strengthen ties with India’s Catholic community never waned.Just months before his passing, Francis elevated Indian priest George Jacob Koovakad to the rank of Cardinal—a significant moment that underscored his recognition of the country’s vibrant Catholic presence. The 51-year-old from Kerala’s Archdiocese of Changanassery became the sixth Indian cardinal, appointed during a grand consistory at St Peter’s Basilica on December 7, 2024. Koovakad, a key Vatican figure responsible for coordinating the Pope’s international travels since 2020, also serves as the Prefect of the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue.PM Modi and senior church leaders welcomed the announcement with pride, with Union minister George Kurian leading a delegation to witness the historic ceremony in Rome.Pope Francis's tenure saw several landmark canonisations that brought joy to the Indian faithful. In 2014, he elevated Fr Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Sister Euphrasia Eluvathingal—both from Kerala—to sainthood. This was followed in 2019 by the canonisation of Mariam Thresia, another Kerala-born nun, adding to the growing list of Indian saints .Perhaps most notably, in 2022, Pope Francis canonised Devasahayam Pillai, an 18th-century Hindu convert to Christianity from Tamil Nadu. He became the first Indian layperson to be declared a saint, an event celebrated by both the Catholic Church and the wider Indian Christian community.However, Pope Francis’s papacy also faced challenges within the Indian Church, particularly surrounding the contentious issue of liturgical uniformity in the Syro-Malabar Church. A Vatican-endorsed directive—known as the ""50:50 formula""—required priests to face the altar for the bulk of the Holy Mass, diverging from the tradition in some dioceses of facing the congregation throughout.The directive sparked ongoing protests in the Ernakulam–Angamaly Archdiocese, with a strong section of priests and laity refusing to adopt the change. The dispute led to the resignation of Cardinal George Alencherry as the Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church in 2023. He was succeeded by Bishop Raphael Thattil, as the Church continued grappling with internal divisions.","Despite his long-standing desire to visit India, Pope Francis never made the journey.

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday, while addressing members of the Indian diaspora in Boston, alleged that Election Commission is ""compromised"" and claimed there is ""something very wrong with the system.""Citing the example of the Maharashtra assembly elections , former Congress president said, ""More people voted in Maharashtra than the total number of people in Maharashtra, and this is a fact... the Election Commission gave us a figure in the evening around 5:30pm, and in two hours around 7:30pm, 65 lakh voters had voted, which is physically impossible.""""It's very clear to us that the Election Commission is compromised, there is something very wrong with the system."" he added.This is not the first time Gandhi threw allegation on EC. Gandhi, along with many other opposition leaders had questioned the credibility of poll body repeatedly.Earlier, the sources in the Election Commission had told ANI news agency that the allegations of manipulated electoral rolls were unfounded. They mentioned that during the recent Special Summary Revision (SSR) published in January 2025, there were very few appeals or corrections sought under Sections 22 to 24 of the Representation of People Act.The SSR is a routine process to update electoral rolls, ensuring the inclusion of new voters and removal of duplicates or deceased individuals. According to officials, only 89 appeals were filed in Maharashtra, despite the presence of over 13.8 million Booth Level Agents (BLAs) across the country. With such low contestation, sources said the final electoral rolls must be considered undisputed.During his speech, Rahul Gandhi also spoke about India-US relations , expressing optimism about continued cooperation between the two nations.""We have a partnership with the US, and hopefully we will continue to work together,"" he said.He also thanked members of the diaspora for supporting the Congress party abroad. ""You believe, you listen to other people, and you respect them. This is what runs in the Congress party and in our family....

"After 9 months of wait, India’s 1st Aadhaar recipient gets Ladki dues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-9-months-of-wait-indias-1st-aadhaar-recipient-gets-ladki-dues/articleshow/120501511.cms,"‘I will use Ladki dues of 9 months to pay son’s fees & for other expenses’

Pune: Ranjana Sonawane ’s happiness knew no bounds on Monday when she received a demand draft for Rs 13,500 as a Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana beneficiary after Nandurbar’s collector Mitali Sethi intervened.Ranjana from Tembhli village in Shahada tehsil of Nandurbar district in Maharashtra was the first recepient of Aadhaar in 2010. But she was deprived of the Ladki Bahin benefits as her card was linked to someone else’s bank account in Mumbai where the monthly welfare benefit was deposited for the last nine months.A TOI report on April 18 highlighted Ranjana’s plight where she made futile efforts to rectify the error.After receiving the demand draft, Ranjana told TOI, “I waited for so long and made several rounds of govt offices and banks for the benefits. The administration acted promptly after the media report. I will use the amount for my son’s college fees, and other family expenses,” she said.Sethi, who had told TOI that she would look into Ranjana’s case, coordinated with the bank’s officials in Mumbai for delinking the fraudulent account.She said: “We initiated the recovery process from the account where her benefits were being transferred. The bank gave us a demand draft on Monday. It was handed over to Ranjana by Shahada tehsildar Deepak Girase.”Sethi also supervised the opening of a new post office savings account for Ranjana on Saturday for the Ladki Bahin benefits transfer.Girase said, “We have handed over the DD to the recipient and will check for any more fraudulent accounts like hers.”The bank will complete its investigation into the account where Ranjana’s Ladki Bahin amount of Rs 1,500 was being transferred since July 2024 when the Mahayuti govt in Maharashtra launched it before the Nov 2024 assembly election.Vivek Walvi, Nandurbar district’s women and child development officer, said, “We ensured that Ranjana got the entire amount from July. Her new account in the post office has been linked to her Aadhaar and the April amount will flow to this account.”Both Girase and Walvi will also check the entire list of beneficiaries and monitor others’ complaints.Sethi said Rajana’s case may not be the only one among the state’s 2.5 crore Ladki Bahin beneficiaries. She has set up a dedicated helpline for Nandurbar district to assist others facing similar issues. Complaints can be registered on the state grievance redressal portal or on 02564210047.The collector said she will look into Rajana’s gas subsidy too which has the same Aadhaar linked problem. “An investigation will be carried out into how such fraudulent accounts are created, and action will be taken against those involved,” she added.",Ranjana Sonawane from Tembhli village in Shahada tehsil of Nandurbar district in Maharashtra was the first recepient of Aadhaar in 2010.

In many cases, they couldn't get it in time leading to complications and even death.While the intensity of the drug crisis may have waned with the end of the pandemic, doctors say, the struggle to manage fungal infections continues due to the scarcity of antifungal drugs and growing resistance against the existing ones.A first-of-its-kind report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that if steps are not taken to increase the pool of antifungal medications soon, the shortage may lead to a public health crisis .""Invasive fungal infections threaten the lives of the most vulnerable, but countries lack the treatments needed to save lives,"" said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance ad interim.He said, ""Not only is the pipeline of new antifungal drugs and diagnostics insufficient, but there is also a void in fungal testing in low- and middle-income countries, even in district hospitals. This diagnostic gap means the cause of people's suffering remains unknown, making it difficult to get them right treatments.""Dr Rajesh Chawla, a critical care specialist at Delhi's Indraprastha Apollo hospital said even now they keep getting patients with serious fungal infections and it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage them because in many cases the fungi causing the infection are found to be resistant to existing drugs.","A first-of-its-kind report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that if steps are not taken to increase the pool of antifungal medications soon, the shortage may lead to a public health crisis.

Novo Nordisk to phase out its largest insulin brand in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/novo-nordisk-to-phase-out-its-largest-insulin-brand-in-india/articleshow/120501423.cms,"In a move which could shake up the diabetes market, Novo Nordisk is discontinuing the country’s largest selling insulin, Human Mixtard, among other older insulin brands in India. Human Mixtard alone is a Rs 800 crore brand for Novo Nordisk in India, despite it being under price control. Besides Human Mixtard, the phase-out could impact its top brands in the Rs 5,000 crore insulin market including Actrapid, Insulatard, Insulin Detemir and Levemir and Xultophy — marketed mostly in the format of pre-filled disposable pen and cartridges (Penfill and FlexPen).The company recently informed its marketing partner, Abbott India that the products would be discontinued once the current stocks are exhausted, documents accessed by TOI said. This could take about six months.The decision is in line with the global strategy of the Danish company to prioritise newer, patented blockbuster diabetes and weight loss therapies including Ozempic and Wegovy , due to their higher profitability, sources said. Also, it seems to be potentially in line with its plans to introduce these therapies in the Indian market this year.As part of its global strategy, earlier generation insulin products will be discontinued globally in a gradual manner. An email sent on April 17 to the company went unanswered.However, the company plans to continue selling Human Mixtard, Actrapid and Insulatard, in vials — which can be delivered to patients through injections. This may limit the access further as insulin delivery from pen devices is preferred by a huge majority of diabetics over vials injected with syringes, due to its accuracy, ease of dosing, and reduced stigma, a survey said earlier.","Human Mixtard alone is a Rs 800 crore brand for Novo Nordisk in India, despite it being under price control.

Kidney failure

is a chronic problem’

NEW DELHI: Dialysis has emerged as the most sought-after treatment under Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana. In the past six years since the central health scheme was launched, data shows more than 64 lakh patients have undergone the procedure.Tamil Nadu has carried out 7.3 lakh dialysis cycles, according to latest data uploaded by National Health Authority, implementing agency for AB-PMJAY, on its website. Madhya Pradesh is next at 5.4 lakh, followed by Uttar Pradesh (5L) and Gujarat (3.4L).Dialysis is provided free of cost to people under the scheme that offers an annual cover of Rs 5L a family for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation. Senior citizens are eligible for the scheme irrespective of their economic status.Every year, about 2.2 lakh new patients of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) get added in India resulting in additional demand for 3.4 crore dialysis every year. The cost of dialysis varies, with a typical per-session cost ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000.“Kidney failure is a chronic problem and patients suffering from the condition require undergoing dialysis twice weekly for survival. That’s why the number of this procedure is so high,” Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder director of Ujala Cygnus group of hospitals said. He added that diabetes is a leading cause of kidney failure and preventing or delaying its onset could help reduce risk of chronic kidney disease and, therefore, the need for dialysis.“We also need to boost infrastructure and design policy to increase kidney transplants which can help such patients avoid dialysis,” Dr Bajaj added.The health ministry also runs ‘Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Program’ (PMNDP) to make dialysis services available for free to the poor. Apart from dialysis, NHA data shows AB-PMJAY is utilised by the beneficiaries for procedures such as cataract removal, angioplasty, and caesarean deliveries.","Tamil Nadu has carried out 7.3 lakh dialysis cycles, according to latest data.

He was convicted two weeks ago.Although Bidre-Gore's body parts were never found, a Panvel sessions court held that their absence was not an ""absolute ground to exonerate the offenders"". It, however, said the case also did not fall in the rarest of rare category to warrant death penalty, as sought by the prosecution.Additional sessions judge K G Paldewar also came down heavily on Navi Mumbai police for not taking prompt action and said the entire police machinery stood behind Kurundkar. It directed the police chief to initiate action against two officers over probe lapses.Two aides-driver Kundan Bhandari and friend Mahesh Phalnikar -who were convicted for helping Kurundkar dispose of the body were given 7 years in prison each.The court held that the time spent by Kurundkar, who was arrested in Dec 2017, as well as of Bhandari and Phalnikar since their arrest in Feb 2018 will be set off against their sentences.The judge said police officers Anil Survase and Kondiram Popere's lapses in investigation were ""intentional omission"" and should not be ""exonerated"". Bidre-Gore's brother had filed a missing person complaint in July 2016, but an FIR was lodged only in Jan 2017 and Kurundkar arrested that Dec. ""It is painful that a lady police officer was brutally murdered and her torso and parts of body were in a creek. Despite that, police did not step into action to take cognisance of this crime promptly though sufficient evidence was before them,"" the court said.Holding that circumstantial evidence in the case was sufficient, the judge noted that it was established that Kurundkar wanted to get rid of Bidre-Gore, with whom he was having an extramarital affair , as she was repeatedly demanding that he marry her. ""Thus, the homicidal death as well as the motive of the crime are established. The circumstances against the accused pointing towards his guilt are sufficient to establish the offence of murder even in the absence of the dead body."" The prosecution had said Kurundkar had killed Bidre-Gore with the help of three others at his house in Bhayander, chopped her body into pieces, kept the parts in a refrigerator, and threw them into the Bhayander creek.Defence lawyer Vishal Bhanushali said an appeal against Kurundkar's sentence will be filed in Bombay HC. Special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat said the state may file an appeal against the time spent in jail being counted as part of Kurundkar's sentence. Bidre-Gore's husband Raju Gore said he will approach the high court to demand a probe by an independent agency against the police officers who allegedly shielded Kurundkar.Kurundkar had received the President's medal for meritorious service on Republic Day in 2017, months after the crime. While convicting him on April 5, court questioned how he had cleared the screening process for the award despite being under scrutiny.It had earlier acquitted the fourth accused in the case, Dnyandeo alias Raju Patil , the nephew of former cabinet minister Eknath Khadse, for lack of evidence.(With inputs from agencies)","Abhay Kurundkar (52) was on Monday sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering assistant police inspector Ashwini Bidre-Gore, chopping up her body and disposing of it in 2016.

Elderly travel up to 44 kilometres to get hospitalised: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elderly-travel-up-to-44-kilometres-to-get-hospitalised-study/articleshow/120499755.cms,"Ai generated image

NEW DELHI: An elderly person in India must commute up to 15 km to avail out-patient services, and almost 44 km for in-patient care requiring hospitalisation, claims a new study published in The Lancet Regional Health– Southeast Asia.Researchers analysed data of nearly 32,000 older adults, aged 60 and above, collected during the first wave of the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India (LASI) in 2017-2018 and found there was a significant urban-rural disparity also with the urban older adults availing out-patient facilities within 10 km of reach, while the distance was nearly 30 km for their rural counterparts.According to the Lancet study, rates of availing both out-patient and in-patient services were found to be high — 73% and 40%, respectively — when a facility was within 10 km of reach. However, with an increase in commute distance, a commensurate decline in the use of out-patient services was found — 17% utilisation of facilities for 11-30 km distance, and 10% for 30 km and above, respectively, it adds.A longer commute and far-away facility is a barrier for receiving timely, essential healthcare for people in this age group, often seen grappling with multiple long-term, debilitating conditions requiring continuous care, the research team said.They wrote, “Older adults, on an average, travelled a distance of nine miles (14.5 kilometres) to seek outpatient services and 27 miles (43.6 kilometres) for inpatient care respectively.”State-wise, Tripura, Manipur and Kerala, had the highest in-patient and outpatient visits within 10 km — over 80%, 75% and 59% of older adults availed in-patient services, respectively, while 88%, 78% and 84% availed out-patient ones, respectively.The authors attributed Kerala’s high rates to “easy access and better availability of infrastructure”. In Manipur and Tripura, it may be because people rely on nearby facilities during emergency in-patient situations, they said. Hilly states such as Nagaland, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh could pose geographical challenges as 0%, 17% and about 5%of older adults in these areas made in-patient visits within 10 km, the study found. Further, in northeastern states, such as Mizoram and Nagaland, a higher percentage of older adults were found to travel more than 60 km to access in-patient and out-patient services, indicating a poor and limited access to nearby facilities.Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh showed a moderate proximity of 11-60 km for older adults accessing out-patient care, but a higher share of in-patient visits at distances beyond 30 km.","Researchers analysed data of nearly 32,000 older adults, aged 60 and above.

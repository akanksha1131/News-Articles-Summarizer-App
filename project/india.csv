What's on the agenda?



Why PM Modi's visit matters?



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kananaskis, Canada, on Tuesday to attend the 51st G7 Summit. This is PM Modi's first visit to Canada in ten years. The discussions with world leaders at the summit will focus on major global topics like energy security, technology and innovation.PM Modi reached Canada from Cyprus. He is on a three-nation tour and was invited to the summit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The G7 meeting, scheduled for June 16-17, is the sixth consecutive time PM Modi is participating in the summit.During his 23-hour stay, PM Modi will speak at the G7 Outreach Session on Tuesday. He will also hold several bilateral meetings, including with Canadian PM Carney, before leaving for Croatia on Tuesday evening.The ministry of external affairs had earlier said, ""At the Summit, the Prime Minister will exchange views with leaders of G-7 countries, other invited outreach countries and Heads of International Organisations on crucial global issues, including energy security, technology and innovation, particularly the AI-energy nexus and Quantum-related issues.""The summit comes a little over a month after India's Operation Sindoor , which targeted terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The operation followed the April 22 Pahalgam attacks.Also read: The Group of Seven (G7): What it is and what it does Canadian PM Carney’s invitation to PM Modi is being seen as an indication that Canada’s new government wants to improve relations with India. Ties between the two countries had worsened after the killing of pro-Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023.In October last year, India withdrew its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Canada linked them to the Nijjar case. India also expelled Canadian diplomats. India had said the Justin Trudeau government was letting pro-Khalistani groups operate from Canada.Carney became prime minister in March this year after Trudeau stepped down. He is an economist and entered politics recently.After Trudeau’s exit, India said it hoped to rebuild relations with Canada based on ""mutual trust and sensitivity.""In recent months, security officials from both countries resumed contact. There have also been talks about appointing new high commissioners.The ministry of external affairs said last week that India sees the upcoming meeting between PM Modi and Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit as a chance to exchange views and “explore pathways” to reset ties.During PM Modi’s previous visit to Canada in 2015, the two countries upgraded their relationship to a strategic partnership.Canada has a large Indian diaspora. About 4.5 per cent of Canada’s population is of Indian origin, including around 1.8 million people of Indian descent. The Sikh population is around 770,000. Additionally, nearly 1 million Non-Resident Indians (NRI) live in Canada as students, skilled professionals, or temporary workers.Indian students have been the largest group of international students in Canada. In 2022, they made up 41 per cent of the international student population. However, Canada’s recent immigration policies have affected both Indian students’ prospects and the finances of Canadian universities.","PM Narendra Modi arrived in Kananaskis, Canada, on Tuesday to attend the 51st G7 Summit.

In the NFL, something strong is developing. One of the best quarterbacks in the league has gotten a firm warning from a top defender. The words were uttered with great conviction and determination, not in rage. Having met this quarterback many times previously, the player is aware of the difficulty in stopping him. Maxx Crosby is now prepared to go all out as a new season approaches. Fans across the nation have noticed the alert. What, though, was uttered and who said it? Let's examine it.On June 13, 2025, Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby appeared on Johnny Manziel's podcast. During the interview, Maxx Crosby reflected on facing Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.The two face off twice every year in the AFC West division.Maxx Crosby, who joined the NFL in 2019, said, “I love playing them… Me and Pat have had a very healthy rivalry for years now.” But then he added, “I’m trying to literally kill him every play.”His words shocked many but also showed how serious and competitive he is.

Why it matters

This is no longer a proxy conflict. Israel has directly struck inside Iran, and Iran has retaliated with direct missile fire on Israeli population centers. The scale, speed, and ferocity of the strikes mark a dangerous new phase with no clear off-ramp - and Iran’s regime is facing pressure on all fronts: militarily, economically, diplomatically and domestically.

It’s the worst direct confrontation between Iran and Israel in history. The war could spiral into a broader Middle East conflagration, upend global oil markets, and collapse already-stalled nuclear diplomacy.

Energy implications: Crude oil surged 13% on Friday - the biggest intraday gain since Russia invaded Ukraine. While oil briefly hit $78 per barrel, experts warn prices could soar past $100 if Iran disrupts the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of global oil flows.

The big picture

Iran now faces a triad of perilous choices

Escalate - risking full-scale war with Israel and possible US involvement. Contain the conflict - aiming for limited, sustained strikes while avoiding American red lines. Negotiate - possibly with US mediation - to halt the fighting and restore nuclear talks, though trust is virtually nonexistent.

Between the lines

Zoom in

Its economy is ravaged by years of sanctions.

Inflation hovers around 40%.

Blackouts and gas shortages are becoming the norm.

And the rial continues to plummet, stoking anger in a young, restless population.

Israel vs Iran

The ultimate test for Khamenei

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader and political survivor for over three decades, is now confronting what may be the defining crisis of his rule.

In a sign of how far Israel was willing to push, a US official told the Associated Press that President Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei.

Since taking power in 1989 after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Khamenei has survived sanctions, internal unrest, and international isolation.

But the current conflict with Israel is different: it directly challenges not only the regional influence he has carefully built but also the internal balance of power in Tehran. The stakes are now existential.

At 86, Khamenei’s advanced age has already fueled speculation about succession, a process clouded by secrecy and rival factions within the regime. “Khamenei is at the twilight of his rule, at the age 86, and already much of the daily command of the regime is not up to him but to various factions who are vying for the future,” said Arash Azizi, senior fellow at Boston University. “This process was already underway and the current war only accelerates it,” he told AFP.

And with Israel not ruling out future attempts on his life, the supreme leader’s next moves will shape not just Iran’s response, but the future of the system he’s spent a lifetime defending.

What they’re saying

“Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video. “Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you.”

Trump said Sunday: “We will have PEACE, soon… But sometimes they have to fight it out.”

“This is for the sake of our children and grandchildren,” said Yoram Suki, whose apartment was destroyed in Petah Tikva.

Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi: “Once these Israeli] attacks come to a stop, we will naturally reciprocate.”

Iran has thousands of ballistic missiles so I think Iranian leaders will use most of those missiles and kill a few thousand of Americans before they engage in a surrender. Iran’s hope was a peaceful resolution. The Americans didn’t want to have it, they wanted war and I think that’s what they’re going to get. Fouad Izadi, an academic at Tehran University , told Bloomberg

What to watch

What’s next

Israel is pushing hard to rally Western support to destroy Iran’s nuclear capacity. But analysts say Israel would need US military assistance to breach Iran’s deepest, most protected sites.

The US role remains murky: President Donald Trump has both urged de-escalation and praised Israel’s offensive. He’s also confirmed vetoing an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei, calling it a red line.

Iran’s Gulf-Arab neighbors-countries it’s reconnected with over the past two years-are alarmed by Israel’s moves and want no part in the conflict, say senior regional officials. While Iran has the missile capability to hit oil facilities and infrastructure across the region, it’s not likely to risk damaging those newly rebuilt ties. It understands that these neighbors fear getting caught in the crossfire and are pressing Trump to cool things down.

The G7 summit in Canada is now dominated by discussions on how to prevent further escalation. “This issue will be very high on the agenda,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Reality check





Iran unleashed a wave of over 100 missiles on Israeli cities early Monday, killing five and injuring more than 100 - striking Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Petah Tikva. The attack followed Israel’s surprise air campaign that bombarded Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, killing at least 224 people - many of them civilians - and decimating the upper ranks of the Revolutionary Guard.The tit-for-tat marks the fourth straight day of open warfare between the regional archrivals and shows no signs of de-escalation.Each carries enormous risks for Iran’s clerical leadership. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei must weigh strategic retaliation against the very real prospect of regime collapse or American firepower.The Israeli strikes have been more devastating and targeted than many in Tehran expected.Israel claims it has killed high-ranking commanders and destroyed key uranium enrichment facilities. The shock of the attacks has set off panic among Tehran residents, particularly in the north, where middle-class Iranians are fleeing to rural areas or Caspian towns.“We just don’t know where to go or what to do,’’ said Parisa, a gym owner in northern Tehran. “The highways are locked. People are saying something bad is going to happen in Tehran tonight.”As per a Bloomberg report, Iran’s domestic situation is fragile:Just days before the Israeli strikes, anti-government protests were already flaring over water shortages and job losses.Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it employed a “new method” in Monday’s missile barrage that overwhelmed Israeli air defenses, including the Iron Dome, allowing strikes to penetrate deeper than before. The damage was visible: residential buildings collapsed, fires erupted, and even the US Embassy in Tel Aviv sustained minor damage.If Iran escalates further - for example, by activating Hezbollah in Lebanon or shutting the Strait of Hormuz - it could trigger US military involvement, upending Trump’s desire to stay out.A senior US official confirmed that Trump was aware of the Israeli strike plan in advance but refused to participate, preferring to maintain the ability to mediate a ceasefire.While Iran can likely sustain limited strikes on Israel for weeks, it is constrained. It cannot match Israel’s precision airpower or resupply at the pace that Israel can - especially with US backing.A prolonged war would deepen its economic pain, risk regime legitimacy, and possibly spur a new wave of protests.(With inputs from agencies)","Iran now faces a triad of perilous choices: Escalate - risking full-scale war with Israel and possible US involvement.

In the background is the Kyrenia mountain range, painted with the flags of Turkiye and the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

NEW DELHI: With Israel and Iran teetering on the brink of a full-blown war, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said resolving issues through dialogue and restoring stability was the cry of humanity. Speaking alongside Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides in Nicosia, Modi reiterated his message that this isn't the era of war.Modi's visit to Cyprus - the first by an Indian PM in 23 years - saw the two sides discussing efforts to scale up cooperation in defence, security and connectivity with focus on IMEEC, with the PM strongly backing sovereignty and territorial integrity of the eastern Mediterranean country that is not recognised by Turkiye, a Pakistan ally.""We both have expressed concern about the ongoing conflicts in West Asia and Europe. Their negative impact is not limited to that region alone. We both believe that this is not the era of war,"" Modi said after his talks with the Cypriot president.Modi thanked Cyprus for its continued support to India's fight against cross-border terrorism and announced a new mechanism for real-time information exchange to counter terrorism, drug and arms smuggling.The president reiterated Cyprus's strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, backing India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.In a show of solidarity with Cyprus, Modi visited the Green Line - a UN-controlled buffer zone that separates Northern Cyprus, an area occupied by Turkish forces in 1974, from the Republic of Cyprus - along with Christodoulides. This is significant in the context of Turkiye's continued support to Pakistan that saw Ankara helping Islamabad militarily during the recent India-Pakistan conflict. Turkish President Recep Erdogan himself later said Turkiye would continue to stand by Pakistan, though ""good times and bad"".Modi also reiterated India's traditional support for Cyprus's unity and for a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus Question based on UN Security Council resolutions and international law.

NHL Trade Rumors: JJ Peterka emerges as potential trade piece in Buffalo Sabres’ offseason plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-jj-peterka-emerges-as-potential-trade-piece-in-buffalo-sabres-offseason-plans/articleshow/121884950.cms,"The Buffalo Sabres are reportedly considering trading winger JJ Peterka despite his breakout season (Image via AP)

NHL insider says Sabres are now listening to trade offers for JJ Peterka

General manager Kevyn Adams isn’t rushing but can’t ignore the market





The Buffalo Sabres are heading into one of the most critical offseasons in recent memory, and winger JJ Peterka has suddenly found himself at the center of trade speculation. After missing the playoffs yet again, the Sabres are under immense pressure to reshape the roster—and Peterka could be one of the first major moves.The 22-year-old German forward had a breakout 2024–25 season, posting 27 goals and 41 assists across 77 games. His performance has drawn attention around the league, especially with Buffalo reportedly exploring trade offers in what could become a sign-and-trade deal.According to respected NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, the Sabres are “listening to trade offers for JJ Peterka.” While this doesn’t confirm a deal is imminent, it shows the team is at least open to the idea of moving on from one of its most productive young players.Peterka is a restricted free agent, meaning the Sabres still hold considerable control over his future. However, if contract negotiations stall, a trade could quickly become the preferred option—especially if it brings back key assets to help Buffalo finally return to playoff contention.Sabres GM Kevyn Adams has reportedly pushed back against the idea that Peterka is actively being shopped, but the interest from other teams is real.With Buffalo finishing 36-39-7 and near the bottom of the Atlantic Division, it’s clear a more aggressive roster overhaul is on the table.Peterka’s high upside makes him a valuable trade chip, and if the right offer comes in, Adams may have no choice but to consider it. A sign-and-trade could give the Sabres both cap flexibility and a meaningful return in players or picks.For now, it’s just talk—but in an offseason where Buffalo needs bold moves, JJ Peterka’s name won’t be disappearing from trade rumors anytime soon. Whether he stays or goes may set the tone for the Sabres’ rebuild and playoff hopes in 2026.Also Read: Shocking Hockey Canada sexual assault trial ends as judge’s verdict on disgraced NHL stars looms on July 24","The Buffalo Sabres are reportedly considering trading winger JJ Peterka.

With prices topping $3,000, fans question if loyalty is being priced out of the Stanley Cup Finals experience





The Florida Panthers are on the verge of making history, but for many fans, the cost of witnessing a potential back-to-back Stanley Cup victory in person is nothing short of shocking. As the team prepares to host the Edmonton Oilers in a decisive Game 6 at Amerant Bank Arena, a wave of backlash is building over the sky-high ticket prices for the marquee matchup.According to a post by Five Reasons Sports on X (formerly Twitter), ticket prices for Game 6 are starting at a staggering $944 and climbing well beyond $3,000 for premium seating. While upper-level seats remain just under the $1,000 mark, fans are finding it difficult to justify the hefty price tags. The caption on the viral post summed up the sentiment: “It’s a bit pricy to watch the Panthers win another Stanley Cup…”Many fans are choosing to support their team from home or bars rather than shell out thousands. One user echoed this frustration, writing, “I saw that this morning and decided I’ll be watching from home or at a bar.” Another added sarcastically, “Bruh what? Is Messi playing or something?”—highlighting the disbelief over the pricing for a hockey game.One Oilers fan shared, “Flying down from Vancouver with row 1 club seats. Weren’t cheap,” while another seemed resigned to both the financial hit and a loss, writing, “Well, all those ppl are going to be disappointed.”""Husband: we could get $5k for our 2 seats and pay for next year if we sell them Me: ARE YOU INSANE?

Dr. Ron Taylor died Monday at age 87 in Toronto after a lengthy illness







Ron Taylor, a two-time World Series champion and one of the key relievers behind the New York Mets’ unforgettable 1969 title run, passed away on Monday at the age of 87 after a prolonged illness. Known for his poise under pressure and dedication to excellence, Taylor’s contributions extended far beyond the mound.During his 11-year MLB career, Taylor wore the jerseys of five different teams—Cleveland, St. Louis, Houston, New York, and San Diego. It was with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1964 that he first experienced championship glory. But his most iconic moment came in 1969 with the ""Miracle Mets.""Taylor was a steady presence in the Mets’ bullpen from 1967 to 1971, posting a 3.04 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, and securing 50 saves over 269 games. In the 1969 season, his performance peaked. He led the team with 59 appearances, recording 13 saves and a 2.72 ERA. One of his defining moments came in Game 2 of the World Series against the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles. With two runners on base, Taylor coolly retired Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson, sealing a critical 2-1 win for New York.“Ron was the only guy on our staff with postseason experience,” teammate Art Shamsky reflected in a statement issued by the Mets.“He had won a championship with the Cardinals in 1964 and brought a winning mentality. We don’t win the title without Ron Taylor.”After his retirement from baseball, Taylor chose a path rarely taken by professional athletes. He returned to Canada and enrolled in medical school at the University of Toronto, earning his degree in 1977. By 1979, he found his way back into baseball—this time as the Toronto Blue Jays’ team physician, a position he held for more than three decades.Taylor’s legacy was celebrated with his induction into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. He later became part of two more World Series-winning teams as a physician during the Blue Jays’ back-to-back titles in 1992 and 1993.Ron Taylor’s life was a rare blend of athletic excellence and medical service—a legacy that leaves a lasting mark both on and off the field.Also Read: MLB reveals first All-Star vote results with Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani dominating early fan support","Ron Taylor, a two-time World Series champion, died Monday at the age of 87.

With the 2025 MLB All-Star Game set for July 15 at Atlanta’s Truist Park, the excitement is already heating up—and it’s New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge and Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani who are stealing the spotlight. According to the first update from Phase 1 of the All-Star voting released on Monday, both players are leading their respective leagues with massive vote counts.Aaron Judge, who has been in red-hot form this season, leads all of Major League Baseball with 1,568,527 votes. If his top position holds until June 26, when Phase 1 concludes at 12 p.m. ET, he’ll become the first back-to-back overall vote leader since Alex Rodriguez achieved the feat in 2007 and 2008. Close behind is Ohtani, who sits atop the National League with 1,398,771 votes. With just under a month left, the gap is tight, and a last-minute surge could tip the balance.“The leading vote-getters for the American and National League when Phase 1 finishes will automatically get starting spots in the All-Star lineups, bypassing the next round of voting,” MLB confirmed.Shohei Ohtani isn’t alone in the million-vote club.He’s joined by Dodgers teammates Freddie Freeman and Will Smith, as well as the Cubs’ Pete Crow-Armstrong and the Mets’ Francisco Lindor.

NBA Trade Rumors: NBA insider spilled beans on how Kevin Durant’s trade outlook shifts after Desmond Bane joins Orlando Magic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-trade-rumors-nba-insider-spilled-beans-on-how-kevin-durants-trade-outlook-shifts-after-desmond-bane-joins-orlando-magic/articleshow/121888262.cms,"Kevin Durant.

Desmond Bane’s blockbuster trade could reshape Kevin Durant’s market value

Desmond Bane's shocking trade to the Orlando Magic has caused ripple effects far beyond the Eastern Conference playoff picture. According to league insiders, the deal not only enhances Orlando's firepower but also shifts the perception of trade value across the league, particularly for highly talked-about stars like Kevin Durant. As teams gauge the market, comparisons to Bane’s trade package are forcing executives to reevaluate how much it will actually take to acquire a player of Durant’s caliber.After the Magic landed Desmond Bane in exchange for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, and four first-round draft picks— plus a pick swap— front offices around the league started taking notice. Though Bane has never made an All-Star team, the return Memphis got for him was massive. One executive told ESPN, “Everyone has to throw their prior precedents and baselines out.”The source made it clear that recent deals, including the one that sent five first-rounders to Brooklyn for Mikal Bridges, shouldn’t be used as a template for valuing Kevin Durant. “Those deals don't mean Durant is worth 12 firsts now,” the executive added. The point being: while Bane’s value is high, Durant’s situation is far more complex.Durant, 36, is certainly one of the most skilled scorers in NBA history. However, age, injury concerns, and a massive contract complicate his trade value. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Durant is open to a contract extension with three teams— the Houston Rockets, Miami Heat, and San Antonio Spurs. Despite that short list, the Minnesota Timberwolves continue to be linked to him by league insiders.Any potential package going to Phoenix isn’t expected to top what Memphis got for Bane. That reality could shape how Phoenix approaches the situation and whether Durant is moved at all this summer.Meanwhile, Orlando's acquisition of Bane signals a serious shift in ambition. “Over his five years in the NBA, Desmond has distinguished himself as one of the elite guards in our league,” said Magic president Jeff Weltman. “We look forward to his shooting, IQ, and wide-ranging skill set.”Bane, who averaged 19.2 points per game while shooting 39% from three this season, is exactly the kind of player Orlando lacked. The Magic ranked last in the NBA in both three-point shooting percentage and makes per game, a major flaw for a playoff team looking to contend.Also Read: Orlando Magic make major jersey number change for Desmond Bane after blockbuster trade with Memphis Grizzlies While the Magic get sharper, the Durant saga raises several questions.

Why Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner needs a clean NHL break



A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner







The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.Read more: Trade news: Blackhawks send Victor Söderström to Bruins for Ryan Mast and a draft pick According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey.

They have also been spotted hosting parties for their close friends on their yacht.While Gisele Bündchen is seemingly enjoying her new life, it seems like Tom Brady is struggling in his personal life when it comes to dating.Recently, according to Radar Online, a source has revealed that, ""When he is on dates, he just talks about himself and how miserable he is, and women are saying he's not worth the hassle…That is never attractive to the opposite sex. It means he's got too much baggage to attempt another meaningful relationship, or even a fun fling.""Ever since Tom Brady announced his divorce from Gisele Bündchen, he has not been able to get into a serious relationship with any of the women he has been linked to. While there were strong rumours of a relationship brewing between Tom Brady and Irina Shayk, things fizzled out pretty quickly.Similarly, there were rumours of reality TV star and famous socialite and entrepreneur, Kim Kardashian and Tom Brady, but again, nothing worked out between the two.For now, Gisele Bündchen is enjoying her relaxing and laid back life while Tom Brady is focusing on parenting and work.Also Read: ""He whines about his ex"": Insiders reveal what’s holding Tom Brady back from moving on after his failed marriage with Gisele Bündchen","Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen went their separate ways in 2022.

The Pittsburgh Penguins have made a seismic decision about one of their biggest stars. Evgeni Malkin, the face of the franchise alongside Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang, appears to be nearing the end of his Penguins journey. Insider reports suggest that Malkin will not be offered a contract extension after the 2025–26 NHL season.This news breaks just a few years after the Penguins opted to retain their “Big 3” with multi-year deals. Malkin’s current four-year contract, signed in 2022, will expire at the end of next season. With no extension on the horizon, all signs point to a final curtain in Pittsburgh for the 37-year-old forward.The latest NHL trade rumor has fans and analysts buzzing. If Malkin chooses to continue his career after his contract ends, he will likely do so in a different jersey. According to trusted reports from team insiders, the Penguins do not plan to re-sign him, setting the stage for either a surprise trade or a free-agent departure.Though no trade has been confirmed, speculation continues to mount about whether the team could move Malkin before his contract ends, especially if the playoff picture remains out of reach.For many in Pittsburgh, the idea of Malkin, known fondly as “Geno,” leaving the franchise is hard to imagine. But with limited options left, retirement or relocation may soon become a reality.Evgeni Malkin’s legendary run with the Pittsburgh Penguins is undoubtedly winding down. The Russian center has played over 1,200 games for the team, collecting more than 1,300 points and becoming a central figure in three Stanley Cup wins.

A growing sense of fear and panic has taken hold across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Israel continues to vow further military strikes. Amid threats of new airstrikes, many Iranians are fleeing major cities in search of safety, with traffic jams clogging roads leading north toward the Caspian Sea.On Monday, the Israeli military issued a chilling warning, urging residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately.""""In the coming hours, the Israeli military will operate in the area, as it has in recent days throughout Tehran, to strike military infrastructure of the Iranian regime,"" the post read.A resident of Saadat Abad, an affluent neighbourhood in north Tehran that has reportedly been struck in recent days, described a night filled with explosions. ""Some were so powerful that the building shook,"" the resident told CNN anonymously, citing safety concerns. They described a chaotic scene as smoke poured into nearby buildings, and families rushed to the ground floors, struggling to calm frightened children.Iran's capital is ill-prepared for aerial conflict. Unlike Israeli cities equipped with modern bomb shelters, Tehran must rely on improvised options, basements, tunnels, and shelters dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.""There weren't any shelters built in Tehran,"" said Mehdi Chamran, chairman of Tehran's city council. ""People went into basements. The metro could be used in an extreme crisis, but we would need to shut the system down.""Despite the looming threat, much of daily life continues. Grocery store shelves remain stocked, and events go ahead as planned. But long lines for fuel have become common, with gas rationed and capped at 25 litres per customer. Some ATMs are limiting cash withdrawals, residents say, adding to the tension.Cities beyond the capital are also showing signs of distress. In Shiraz, in south-central Iran, residents are lining up for gasoline and stockpiling essentials like water and diapers. Images show cars loaded with families and supplies heading toward rural areas.Nighttime in Tehran, however, tells a different story. Streets fall eerily quiet, many shops remain shuttered, and those who haven't left are increasingly reluctant to go to work.The situation follows a series of Israeli strikes on Iranian military infrastructure, including nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan, which have heightened international concerns.","Israel issues chilling warning, urges residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately"" Residents describe chaotic scene as smoke poured into nearby buildings.

Yashasvi Jaiswal : Young blood, big dreams

Shubman Gill: A captain with a point to prove

A defining series for India’s next batting order





As India gear up for their five-Test tour of England beginning June 20 at Headingley, all eyes will be on the next generation of Indian batters. With stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli no longer in the Test setup, the spotlight shifts to KL Rahul Yashasvi Jaiswal , and newly-appointed skipper Shubman Gill—each bearing different responsibilities and career arcs as they look to anchor India’s top order in alien conditions.At 33, KL Rahul is the most experienced batter in the squad. With 955 runs from 13 Tests against England, including three centuries, Rahul’s quality is undeniable—but so is his inconsistency.His 149 at The Oval in 2018 remains iconic, crafted when India were tottering at 121/5. Yet, in the same series, Rahul aggregated only 152 runs in his remaining nine innings. The pattern repeated in the 2021 tour, where his majestic 129 at Lord’s helped India to a famous win, only to be followed by single-digit scores thereafter.Rahul averages 34.11 in English conditions and has often struggled to convert promising starts. With the experience of over a decade behind him, this series could define whether Rahul finally sheds his tag of ""flashes of brilliance"" and matures into India’s dependable pillar in the middle order.In contrast stands 23-year-old Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has stormed into Test cricket with a blend of fearlessness and flair.He enters this tour as India’s highest scorer in the previous Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the team’s new senior opener.Jaiswal’s home Test average of 60.61 across 10 matches is stunning, but this tour will be his biggest challenge yet. His away average (44.18) is respectable, though the swinging Dukes ball, early movement, and long spells from England’s seamers will ask questions he’s never faced before.With no Virat or Rohit to turn to for guidance, Jaiswal must lead India’s charge from the top with composure and intent. His hunger and recent form make him a key player to watch.Shubman Gill takes on the toughest job in cricket which is leading India in a Test series in England, while still evolving as a player himself. His overall Test average at home is an impressive 42.03, but it drops significantly overseas (29.50), and his record in England is particularly underwhelming: just 88 runs in three matches at an average of 14.66.Now, with captaincy adding weight to his already high expectations, the question isn’t just about runs, it’s about temperament. Gill will be judged not only on how he bats but how he leads a team missing its most iconic modern-day batters. Former teammate Cheteshwar Pujara has expressed faith in Gill’s ability to rise to the occasion. For now, belief will have to carry him until the runs come.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? India’s tour of England in 2025 will be the first full Test series without either Kohli or Rohit since 2011. The burden of scoring and leadership is now shared between a veteran seeking consistency (Rahul), a young gun on the rise (Jaiswal), and a captain still forging his identity (Gill).Their performances may well shape not only the outcome of this series, but also set the tone for India's fortunes in the ongoing World Test Championship cycle.","KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill will lead India in five-Test series against England. India's last Test series in England was in 2011, when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma were still in the side. The five-match series begins on June 20 at Headingley. India have won the last three Tests against England, but have lost the last two.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121878261,imgsize-978993,width-400,resizemode-4/121878261.jpg"

Trump will also leave the summit on Monday night, as he wants to focus on developments between Israel and Iran.""Iran should have signed the 'deal' I told them to sign. What a shame, and a waste of human life,"" Trump wrote. ""Simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""According to CNN, a government official at the G7 summit in the Canadian Rockies said that A White House official said president Donald Trump’s call for Iranians to “immediately evacuate Tehran” highlights the urgent need for Iran to enter diplomatic talks, as its ongoing conflict with Israel shows no sign of easing. He said that Trump was receiving regular updates from secretary of state Marco Rubio and other senior officials. Earlier on Monday, Vice president JD Vance, joint chiefs of staff chairman Dan Caine, and several top aides were seen assembling at the White House.Trump's comments came hours after an Israeli airstrike reportedly hit Iran's state broadcaster headquarters.

The summit, hosted by Canada and focused on global economic issues, was largely overtaken by the fallout from Israel’s recent major military strike on Iran.Earlier in the day, Trump said a diplomatic deal with Iran to end the conflict could happen soon after he leaves the G7 summit. “I think Iran is basically at the negotiating table and wants to make a deal.

What did Stephen Curry's dad say about his retirement?

Dell Curry and Stephen





Fans of Stephen Curry have spent countless sleepless nights over the topic of his retirement. While he hasn't announced his retirement yet, it’s evident that he is contemplating his post-NBA career options. He is still under contract with the Golden State Warriors through the 2026-27 season and may even think about extending it.However, Stephen’s father, Dell Curry, recently addressed the topic of his retirement. In a conversation with DJ Siddiqi, Dell talked about his own experience of nearing retirement and suggested that for Stephen, the decision will likely come down to whether he still has the motivation to keep pace with the demanding preparation that is crucial for the NBA.“I think it’ll come down to—not necessarily his skill, or what he can do in a game in the season,” Curry said. “I think it’s a matter of, can he go through the rigours of preparing himself to play in an NBA season? I know when I retired, that was a big factor.""""I just didn’t feel like I had the energy, the effort to work and train throughout the summer. So I wouldn’t short myself, my teammates or the fans and give my all during that season.I think that’s what it’ll come down to.”But Dell also confirmed that he doesn’t see a retirement announcement coming from Stephen anytime soon. “He still loves the game,” Curry said. “He’s a competitive guy. He wants to win another title, so we’re not even close to that window yet. But when the time comes, I think he’ll make the right decision.”","Stephen Curry is still under contract with the Golden State Warriors through the 2026-27 season.

A nickname born out of early dominance on the ice

Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT





Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Walter Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne Gretzky's famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Fatty liver: Symptoms and warning signs seen during the night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/fatty-liver-symptoms-and-warning-signs-seen-during-the-night/articleshow/121859810.cms,"What is Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?







Sleep disturbances and insomnia

Signs that all is not well with your liver

Abdominal discomfort intensifying at night



Loss of appetite during evening meals



Other symptoms of fatty liver that you must be careful:



Increased brain fog and mental fatigue



Persistent fatigue and weakness



Swelling in the legs and feet



Itchy skin



Unexplained weight loss



Yellowing of the skin or eyes (Jaundice)



Fatty liver disease, particularly Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), is a growing health concern, affecting an estimated 30.2% of the world's population. Prevalence varies by region, with rates above 40% in the Americas and Southeast Asia.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH).Often termed the ""silent epidemic,"" NAFLD can progress to more severe conditions like cirrhosis soon, if left unchecked. While many symptoms manifest during the day, certain warning signs become more pronounced at night.Recognizing these nocturnal symptoms is crucial for early detection and management.Individuals with fatty liver disease often report difficulty falling or staying asleep . The discomfort from liver inflammation or the body's struggle to process toxins can lead to restless nights. Moreover, the liver's reduced ability to store and release glycogen can cause blood sugar imbalances, further disrupting sleep patterns.A common symptom of fatty liver disease is discomfort in the upper right abdomen. This sensation can worsen at night, making it hard to get a good night's sleep. People may feel a sense of fullness or pressure, which can be quite concerning.Though not typically a symptom seen during night time, a decrease in appetite, particularly at night, may signify fatty liver disease. Individuals may find they have less interest in food, especially during dinner, which could eventually lead to weight loss and nutritional problems.As fatty liver disease progresses, the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream can affect brain function. This may lead to symptoms like confusion, poor memory, or trouble focusing on any task, commonly referred to as ""brain fog.""Fatigue is a hallmark of fatty liver disease. However, when the liver's detoxification processes are compromised, individuals may experience overwhelming tiredness during the night. This isn't just typical tiredness; it's an overpowering fatigue that can interfere with daily life.While swelling can occur at any time, it may become more noticeable at night. Fluid retention due to liver dysfunction can lead to swelling in the legs and feet, causing discomfort and affecting sleep quality.Fatty liver disease can cause itchy skin, especially if liver damage affects bile flow. When bile salts build up under the skin, it can cause irritation and itching, even if there is no visible rash.Unexplained weight loss can be an early indicator of fatty liver disease. The liver's involvement in various metabolic processes, including the regulation of body weight, can be disrupted, leading to unintended weight loss.In more advanced stages of fatty liver disease, jaundice can develop. This condition causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow due to elevated levels of bilirubin, a waste product from red blood cells. Jaundice is a serious sign and should be checked by a doctor immediately.While adopting a healthy lifestyle – which consists of a balanced diet, regular exercise, checking alcohol consumption and smoking, and having adequate sleep – can significantly elevate liver health, if you experience any of the above symptoms, especially during the night, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. Early detection through blood tests and imaging can help manage and potentially reverse the effects of fatty liver disease. Consult a doctor if you see such symptoms. It is important that you ensure a healthy well-being of your liver as it becomes one of the most vital organs of survival as the age increases, but also loses immunity without proper care.","Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) affects an estimated 30.2% of the world's population.

Renowned for her alleged ability to predict future events, Baba Vanga is a prominent Bulgarian mystic and healer, born on October 3, 1911, in Strumica, located in the Salonica vilayet (which was part of the Ottoman Empire at the time), with the full name Vangeliya Pandeva Gushterova. Baba Vanga, the blind Bulgarian mystic often referred to as the ""Nostradamus of the Balkans,"" has garnered significant attention since the start of the year due to her mysterious and often unsettling prophecies.

She passed away at the age of 86 in 1996 and is considered one of the most famous mystics of the 20th century. Some of her predictions are believed to be remarkably precise, while others remain vague and open to interpretation.

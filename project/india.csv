NEW DELHI: Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk met farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Saturday at the Khanauri border protest site, where farmers are demonstrating for their demands.Dallewal, aged 70, has been on an indefinite hunger strike at the Khanauri border since November 26.Wangchuk said his visit was to convey ""good wishes and warm support on behalf of the people of Ladakh."" He mentioned that Dallewal was too weak to speak much due to his prolonged fasting, and the purpose of the meeting was to show solidarity rather than have an extended discussion.Wangchuk urged people to support the farmers, saying, ""The food we eat is produced by the farmers.""Dallewal's hunger strike has continued for 33 days.Meanwhile, Supreme Court on Saturday gave the Punjab government time until December 31 to convince farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal, who has been on a hunger strike for over a month, to move to a hospital.Farmers are protesting to demand a legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) and other issues. Under the banners of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, they have been stationed at the Shambhu and Khanauri border points between Punjab and Haryana since February 13 this year.Earlier attempts by a group of 101 farmers to march to Delhi on foot were stopped by Haryana security forces between December 6 and 14.",Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk met farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Saturday at the Khanauri border protest site.

NEW DELHI: In life, he always seemed, rather charmingly, a little out of place when surrounded by the trappings of high office. Some, therefore, may have found it slightly ironic that the last journey of Manmohan Singh, who had once told his security official that he preferred a Maruti hatchback to a sleek BMW, was choreographed as per the ceremonial demands of a state funeral . But state funerals are mandated for ex-PMs.But even ex-PMs are a matter of politics. The state funeral happened with Congress and BJP still locked in a bad-tempered debate over a memorial site. Singh, whose baptism in politics was pretty rough and got rougher during his second stint as PM, wouldn't probably have been too surprised at this, had he had an inkling.Under a grey sky on a wintry morning, the cortege left the AICC office for the cremation site, with heavy bandobast all the way. This being a state funeral, armed forces had their part to play. There was a military band, and ceremonial marching. The CDS and the three service chiefs were present.At the AICC office, where it all began on Saturday, Congress members gathered in force to bid goodbye to one of the party's most consequential PMs. Singh's family members, wife Gursharan Kaur and daughters Upinder, Daman and Amrit were received by party president Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi . Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present, along with party CMs, brass and workers.The cortege left for Delhi's oldest and largest crematorium,Nigambodh Ghat , after the singing of the national anthem at the AICC office. The pace was, as it always is on such occasions, stately, keeping in mind mourners walking alongside. There was a profusion of flowers. Some mourners were silent, others respectfully vocal. The latter joining in with the chanting of two, oft-heard memorialising slogans reserved for notable, departed politicians: ""Amar rahe"" and ""Jab tak suraj, chand rahega, tab tak tera naam rahega"". Congress was front and centre at Nigambodh, as was to be expected.Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, party chief ministers Siddaramaiah, Revanth Reddy and Sukhwinder Sukhu, and other senior functionaries were at the gate of Nigambodh Ghat when the casket, draped in the Tricolour, was taken in. Laying of wreaths began once the casket was put on a raised platform.The long list of dignitaries present included, aside from Singh's family members, PM Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, the three Gandhis, Rajnath Singh, other NDA govt members, presiding officers of the LS and RS, Congress functionaries, Delhi CM and LG, and armed forces chiefs. Foreign countries were represented by Bhutan's king and a Mauritius minister.There was no noticeable interaction between BJP and Congress functionaries. But obviously unlike on X, where Saturday morning saw another bout between the parties, it was all dignified.The last rites began with Sikh priests reciting verses from Gurbani. Singh's daughter, historian Upinder Singh, lit the pyre, other family members beside her.Not too long after, the state funeral was over. But politics, of course, wasn't. A slogan raised from the crowd - 'MMS ko Bharat Ratna do' - was a reminder, if anyone needed reminding.","State funerals are mandated for ex-PMs. Congress was front and centre at Nigambodh, as was to be expected.

Don't act as spokesperson of farm protesters: Supreme Court to Punjab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-act-as-spokesperson-of-farm-protesters-supreme-court-to-punjab/articleshow/116753250.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Saturday warned of constitutional consequences as Punjab govt expressed ""helplessness"" in hospitalising a ""protester besieged"" fast-on-to-death farmer representative Jagjit Singh Dallewal at Shambhu border and feared that using force to implement SC orders could lead to ""collateral damages"".Advocate general of Punjab Gurminder Singh told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Sudhanshu Dhulia that the farmer representative is surrounded by thousands of protesters who have welded tractors together to form a fortress to prevent authorities from either shifting Dallewal, who is also reluctant, to a hospital or reaching him medical aid.The bench asked, ""Who has allowed such a situation to develop at the border? Who is responsible for controlling law and order? How can a gathering of farmers prevent a reputed farmer representative , whose health is deteriorating, from getting hospitalised? Dallewal could continue his fast in hospital under medical supervision and this court has assured that it will help solve the issues raised by the farmers.""Punjab AG said, ""The situation arose as the farmers were stopped from marching to Delhi at the Shambhu border. Centre could now intervene and assure them about change in MSP law which alone can defuse the situation. Using the force would surely result in collateral damage. To save one life, we cannot lose more lives. We are helpless.""This statement of Bhagwant Singh Mann-led AAP govt drew sharp rebuke from the bench, which said, ""Do you (AG) want SC to record that state govt is helpless in dealing with a law and order situation? Do you understand the constitutional consequences of a state's helplessness? Do not put words in our mouth and say implementation of the court's order would require use of force and result in casualties. Your officers know what is to be done.""Warning the AAP govt not to act as the spokesperson of protesters, the bench said, ""Dallewal appears to be under peer pressure. Those protesters who do not want him to be hospitalised, lack bona fide. Have you ever seen a group of protesters who want their representative to die? Govt is unfortunately speaking the language of the protesters. We are not accepting any pre-condition (of change of law in MSP). We have constituted a high-level committee which would examine the issues and make recommendations. We would then do our best to resolve the issue."" The court asked whether Punjab govt needed logistical assistance from Centre to deal with the situation.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said ""Centre's intervention could allow the situation to deteriorate further. Delay in hospitalising Dallewal would allow more and more farmers to gather at the protest site and situation would worsen,"" he said, adding Punjab govt should act swiftly and maturely.The apex court bench agreed with SG and told Punjab chief secretary and DGP that it does not want their lengthy affidavits explaining the difficulties they faced in defusing the situation.

This is a disgrace, and the DMK government must take responsibility,” he said, slamming law minister S Regupathy for defending the state’s actions.Annamalai also lambasted the police for their role in mishandling the case and demanded the removal of the Chennai police commissioner or the deputy commissioner involved. Declaring an end to public protests that often result in arrests, he urged BJP cadres to stage demonstrations at their homes.The BJP chief further announced plans to observe a 48-day fast and visit the six Arupadai Veedu (Lord Muruga’s six abodes) to “complain to Murugan” about the state’s deteriorating governance.“This kind of dirty politics leaves no room for respect or healthy debate.

NEW DELHI: When Manmohan Singh 's daughter Upinder Singh lit the pyre of the former PM , she was following the Sikh tradition of not allowing differentiation on gender lines in who leads rituals linked to cremation. Members of the Sikh community point out that their women have for long carried out rituals on the passing of their parents.The visuals of Upinder Singh performing the rites will still be seen as yet another challenge to well-entrenched patriarchal norms, especially in the north, to exclude women from important religious rituals and encourage a trend which saw former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee being cremated in 2018 by his foster daughter Namita Kaul Bhattacharya.Earlier, in June 2014, former minister from BJP Gopinath Munde was cremated by his daughter Pankaja Munde.Approached for his comment, a Sikh community activist said Upinder Singh's act of leading the rituals only reaffirms the importance of putting the male and female child on the same footing and challenges discriminatory attitudes that stem from patriarchy and not religion. Singh's cremation was carried out in keeping with Sikh traditions amid chanting of hymns. A stoic Upinder Singh was a picture of dignity as she kept her composure while lighting the pyre surrounded by family members including her mother Gursharan Kaur, sisters Daman Singh and Amrit Singh and other family members. Singh's grandchildren too were said to have been present during the rituals.While Upinder Singh is a historian, Singh's second child Daman Singh is a writer known for her book ""Strictly Personal: Manmohan and Gursharan"" that came out in 2014.

The BJP, in turn, slammed Rahul’s comments as a “new low in India’s politics.”Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul, also criticised the deviation from tradition, arguing that Singh deserved a memorial to honour his contributions.

Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation department director Swantantra Kumar Singh has already written to senior officials in Indore, Bhopal and Dhar to prepare for it. A dozen GPS-enabled trucks are ready to move the waste.On Dec 3, Madhya Pradesh HC set a deadline of four weeks to shift the hazardous waste, stored so far at the abandoned Union Carbide factory in Bhopal, to Pithampur waste disposal facility. ""Are you waiting for another tragedy?"" HC asked authorities, rapping them for the long delay.The Union Carbide waste will be disposed of in two stages - incineration and landfill. Once the trucks reach Pithampur Industrial Waste Management Pvt Ltd facility near Tarpura village, trial incineration of 35.6 MT waste will be carried out to understand how long it takes for the waste to be burnt safely, a source told TOI. Three feed rates - 135kg/hr, 80kg/hr and 270kg/hr - will be tried out. The rest of the toxic waste will be incinerated after establishing the optimum feed rate for incineration.Sources told TOI that a 'red corridor' may be created for safe transport of waste.""We can shift the waste any time, once the packing is complete and security assessment is made. It depends, most probably at night,"" Swantantra Kumar Singh told TOI. Sources told TOI that the trucks were likely to begin moving around 4.30am on Sunday.In 2015, 10MT waste was moved to Pithampur facility for at least seven trial runs, the last of which cleared environmental parameters. This paved the way for the current disposal plan. ""We will move the entire waste from Union Carbide factory in one go. We are trying to send all the containers in a single row ensuring maximum safety precautions,"" Singh said.The Pithampur facility has been asked to install a separate electric meter arrangement to run pollution control devices. If any of the devices stops functioning, the system will stop electric supply and will not come back on line until the device is restored. The process will be monitored via CCTV from MP pollution control board control room in Bhopal.", 337 tonnes of toxic waste left over from 1984 gas tragedy will be taken 225km away to Pithampur.

MHA clarification







'Govt couldn't allocate even 1,000 yards': Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: A war of words erupted between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday over the cremation of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Delhi's Nigambodh Ghat. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called the central government's decision to conduct the cremation at Nigambodh Ghat instead of a desginated memorial site a ""grave insult"" to the former PM. Meanwhile, the BJP called Rahul's comments a ""new low in politics of India"".In a post on X, Rahul Gandhi said, “The great son of Mother India and the first Prime Minister of the Sikh community, Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji, has been totally insulted by the present government by performing his last rites at Nigambodh Ghat.”Rahul also wrote about Singh’s legacy, describing him as a leader whose policies elevated India to an economic superpower and provided critical support to the underprivileged.Highlighting what he termed as a deviation from tradition, the Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said, “Till date, respecting the dignity of all former Prime Ministers, their last rites were performed at authorised burial sites so that every person could have the last darshan and pay homage without any inconvenience. Dr. Manmohan Singh deserves our highest respect and a memorial. The government should have shown respect to this great son of the country and his proud community.”Congress MP from Wayanad Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also backed Rahul, and said that the government should have looked ""beyond politics"" on the matter. She alleged that she saw Dr. Singh's family ""struggling for a place"" at the funeral site.""The government should have thought beyond politics and narrow-mindedness in this matter. This morning, I felt this when I saw Dr. Manmohan Singh ji's family members struggling for a place at the funeral site, trying to find a place in the crowd, and the general public getting troubled due to lack of space and paying tribute from the road outside,"" she said.The BJP swiftly responded to Rahul Gandhi, calling the Congress leader's post ""shameful"" and ""unfortunate."" BJP MP Sambit Patra, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the party's belief in ""dignity in death."" Patra further added that after the passing of the former Prime Minister, the Cabinet had sent a letter to the Congress and Singh's family, expressing the government's intent to build a memorial in his honour.""This is a new low in politics of India, thanks to the Congress party . Due to the Congres party - we are here to have a press conference on the day when the last rites of the former prime minister were done... BJP believes that there has to be dignity in death. The kind of politics Congress is doing, especially Rahul Gandhi - who has tweeted about the cremation is shameful,"" the BJP MP said.""We in a cabinet meeting after the demise of the former PM Manmohan Singh - decided that since he was the PM and had a big stature - the cabinet wrote a letter to Congress and Dr Singh's family - where the cabinet said that we should build a memorial in his name so that the country and the world remember him for his positive works,"" he added.In the letter, Patra said that governemnt had informed the grand old party and Dr Singh's family that there is procedure that needs to be followed while building a memorial but ""cremation is a process that can't wait"".""There is a procedure to build a memorial but cremation is a process that can't wait... It was a direct communication that our party had extended. But, after that, the kind of politics Congress did, it shouldn't have been done on the day of grief,"" he said.Earlier, BJP national spokesperson CR Kesavan had also lashed out at the grand old party alleging that it was ""unsuccessfully trying to politicise the demise of Dr Manmohan Singh"".Rahul Gandhi's attack comes a day after the ministry of home affairs clarified the government's stance on establishing a memorial for the ex-PM at his final resting place and said that Union minister Amit Shah, after the Cabinet meet, told Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge that the government would allocate space for the memorial.The MHA, in a statement, said the cremation and other formalities can proceed because a Trust has to be formed and space has to be allocated for the memorial.""The government received a request to allocate space for a memorial for former Prime Minister Late Dr Manmohan Singh, from the Congress Party president,"" a statement released by MHA read.""Immediately after the Cabinet meeting, Amit Shah communicated to Congress president Shri Kharge and the family of Late Dr Manmohan Singh that the government will allocate space for the memorial. In the meanwhile cremation and other formalities can happen because a trust has to be formed and space has to be allocated to it,"" it added.The government's response came hours after, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took a swipe at the BJP-led central government, calling its decision to conduct the last rites of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Nigambodh Ghat ""a deliberate insult"" to India's first Sikh PM.Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also expressed shock over the decision to cremate Singh at Nigambodh Ghat, stating, “The BJP government could not provide even 1,000 yards of land for the last rites and burial of Dr. Manmohan Singh, who belonged to the Sikh community and was renowned all over the world.”Singh, who served as Prime Minister for a decade and is remembered for his economic reforms and steady leadership during global financial crises, passed away on Thursday night at AIIMS, Delhi. He was cremated on Saturday with full state honours.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called the central government's decision to conduct the cremation at Nigambodh Ghat instead of a desginated memorial site a ""grave insult"" to the former PM.

Coal block allocation scam case against Manmohan Singh to abate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coal-block-allocation-scam-case-against-manmohan-singh-to-abate/articleshow/116752365.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former PM Manmohan Singh 's desire to clear his name of a small blot, being summoned by a Delhi court as an accused in an alleged irregular coal block allocation case, remained unfulfilled. It would have helped him maintain his widely perceived squeaky clean antecedents.Shortly after Supreme Court cancelled the irregular allotment of coal blocks during UPA govt led by Singh and directed trial court to proceed with the trial in several such cases under Prevention of Corruption Act , a Delhi court had in March 2015 summoned the ex-PM as an accused in the alleged irregular allotment of Talabira-II coal block to Hindalco.Singh rushed to SC challenging the summoning order, fearing the ignominy of standing as an accused before the trial court. An SC bench led by V Gopala Gowda on April 1, 2015 stayed the summoning order much to the relief of the ex-PM and admitted his petition, which meant it required a detailed hearing of the plea.The trial court had issued summons to Singh despite CBI filing a closure report in the alleged irregular allotment of Talabira-II coal block to Hindalco. The trial judge had said that closure of the case by CBI was unwarranted as there was prima facie evidence to summon Singh, who held the charge of coal ministry at the relevant time, and industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and others as accused.Though SC had stayed the summoning order against Singh, a bench led by Justice Madan Lokur refused to stay the summoning of former minister of state for coal, Santosh Bagrodia, and said his petition would be heard along with that of Singh's on Sept 2, 2015.Alarmed by SC's decision to expedite hearing on Singh's appeal, senior advocate Kapil Sibal requested then CJI H L Dattu for an urgent clarification - that Singh's petition should not be categorised as a coal scam related case as the main thrust of his challenge was to the constitutional validity of Section 13(1)(d)(iii) of PC Act.CJI Dattu agreed with Sibal and ordered de-tagging of Singh's petition from Bagrodia's appeal.The CJI Dattu-led bench said Singh's petition would be listed forbearing only when his counsel seeks out of turn hearing on completion of pleadings - filing of response by CBI and Centre and a rejoinder by the ex-PM. Much after his retirement, Justice Dattu had confided with TOI that he could not entertain the eventuality of a ""very clean ex-PM"" facing trial as an accused in a case that had its genesis in his party's political decisions.The petition would now be disposed of as infructuous as the petitioner has passed away.","Former PM Manmohan Singh was summoned by a Delhi court as an accused in an alleged irregular coal block allocation case.

Capital tribute for Manmohan Singh's last journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/capital-tribute-for-manmohan-singhs-last-journey/articleshow/116751726.cms,"NEW DELHI: Whether it was the Gandhi family , the Congress worker, the man on the street, or the woman in the metro, Delhi stood up in applause and mourning on Saturday to say a final goodbye to Manmohan Singh , the self-effacing former PM who touched as many hearts with his dignity as lives with his economic policies.At the AICC headquarters and along the hearse's route to Nigambodh Ghat , the unusually grey winter morning reflected the solemn mood on the street as thousands gathered to pay respects, the chorus of ""Manmohan Singh amar rahein"" and ""jab tak suraj chand rahega, Manmohan Singh tera naam rahega"" by Congress workers ringing out as a steady beat in a somber procession. The Congress workers also sought Bharat Ratna , India's highest civilian honour, for Singh.If Firaq Gorakhpuri's words - ""ab aksar chup chup se rahe hain, yun hi kab lab khole hain/pehle firaq ko dekha hota ab to bahut kum bolen hain"" - capture the essence of Singh, the stately tribute from the common citizen was a fitting one. Across ages and backgrounds, people from different walks of life and politicians across the spectrum of Right, Left and Centre turned up for Singh's final journey. It was a rare unifying thread in the politically polarised capital of today.The Gandhi family, led by Sonia - who formed a partnership with Singh as UPA chairperson during his two terms as PM from 2004-14 - was the first to offer wreaths at AICC's Akbar Road headquarters, where Singh's remains were brought at 9.12am from his residence on Motilal Nehru Road and laid in state at the main hall, enclosed in a glass casket and draped by the Tricolour.Singh's family - wife Gursharan Kaur and daughters Upinder Singh, Daman Kaur and Amrit Kaur - was there. In a black overcoat, with a black hair band, Sonia was accompanied by son Rahul, who was in his usual half-sleeve white T-shirt and trousers, and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The trio had arrived at the AICC headquarters around 8.50am and waited.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and senior members like P Chidambaram, Salman Khurshid, Ashok Gehlot, Pawan Bansal and Ajay Maken were among those who came to pay respects. Senior leadership and functionaries alike, many came with their families as a mark of respect to Singh.Sonia, Rahul, Priyanka and senior Congress functionaries stood like a family beside Gursharan and the daughters throughout the funeral. Rahul sat next to Singh's family members in an Army truck that pulled the cortege from Akbar Road to Nigambodh Ghat, where priests and family members recited hymns from the Gurbani and chants of ""Satnam Waheguru"" filled the air.Singh's last rites were performed with full state honours that were accompanied by a 21-gun salute. The funeral pyre was lit by his eldest daughter Upinder. Singh (92) passed away on the night of Dec 26. Before Singh's remains were consigned to flames, security forces also performed a three-rifle volley and buglers played 'Last Post' as a mark of honour. Personnel from the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as Delhi Police had participated in the procession, marching in formation.""Ghazab ke insaan the. Itni saadgi aur insaniyat politicians mein kum milti hai (He was an exceptional man blessed with simplicity and humanity that one rarely sees in politicians),"" said Subhash, who had come from Anand Parbat at 6.20am to bid farewell to Singh. ""He was a professor, not a politician and he remained one,"" said Aradhana, who had come from south Delhi for the ""leader"" who she had always admired. For many others who waited patiently, outside Singh's house, at the AICC headquarters and near Nigambodh Ghat to catch a final glimpse of him, this was a presence they had to mark, as much for the architect of India's liberalisation as the convergence of traits he personified - intellect, humility and unlimited grace.","Gandhi family led by Sonia was the first to offer wreaths at AICC's Akbar Road headquarters.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday demanded that govt “put on hold” the India-US trade deal in view of the decision of the United States Supreme Court invalidating the reciprocal tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and “renegotiate” the terms of the deal.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi accused PM Modi of being “compromised”, alleging that his (Modi’s) “betrayal” in the trade deal now stands exposed. “He can’t renegotiate. He will surrender again.” In an X post, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote: “Clueless foreign policy or one-sided surrender? Why did the Modi govt not wait for the US SC judgment on tariffs before rushing to fall into a trap deal, which extracted huge concessions from India?” Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said there was a provision in the ‘Framework of Interim Agreement’ that in case of one country modifying the terms, the other country can also do that.Referring to Trump’s statement after the SC decision the trade agreement still holds, Ramesh said Modi must say in clear terms the ‘Framework of Interim Agreement’ cannot be implemented under current circumstances. Party general secretary Randeep Surjewala asked if Modi govt will now declare in “national interest” it will buy cheaper Russian and Iranian crude oil.",Congress MP Rahul Gandhi accused PM Modi of being “compromised” Gandhi alleges that his (Modi’s) “betrayal” in the trade deal now stands exposed. “He can’t renegotiate.

"‘Journalism is first draft of history, Wikipedia second’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/journalism-is-first-draft-of-history-wikipedia-second/articleshow/128662426.cms,"For centuries, humanity has found itself caught between the promise of tomorrow and its perils when talking about the future. Socrates died a worried man because he thought writing will kill the quest for knowledge. It’s the same now with AI. How do you see this?

Broadly speaking, internet has made information a ‘commodity’. Do you think AI will make intelligence a commodity?

.

Wiki powered a huge number of Google search answers and is now emerging as a source layer for AI. Are LLMs both a threat and an opportunity to Wiki’s future?

■

You’re making the case really for human moderation of information.

Do you think that is where eventually the biggest problem with AI-curated information will lie, a wall that it cannot breach?

Like Google search in the past, AI companies have a frenemy relationship with news media — New York Times has sued OpenAI, for example. If AI systems increasingly cite original sources, should they be required to link back and share revenue or traffic?

.

How do we solve that?

Wikipedia has had this debate between deletionists and inclusionists. Which side are you on?

Tell us about your India community and volunteer group. There’s a perception or misperception, you tell us, that India pages are not as rigorous.

When people say, ‘Wikipedia is broken because it’s biased’, how do you react to that? And what’s your take on an AI-first competitor like Grokipedia?

How important is tone neutrality for credibility?

■

You launched WikiTribune to address neutrality in public discourse. Why did you not continue?

AI is fast changing the way information is created and shared, but speed and scale don’t necessarily mean credibility. Jimmy Wales , who co-founded Wikipedia — harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to upend traditional encyclopaedias like Britannica and become the internet’s default reference point — now finds it at the centre of a new debate on trust, including attacks from Elon Musk over alleged bias. Speaking to Rohit Saran and Saikat Dasgupta on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, Wales reflects on the opportunities and risks AI presents, why neutrality is non-negotiable, and why trust is more important than ever■ John Philip Sousa (one of US’s most celebrated composers) believed people wouldn’t sing anymore when music began to be recorded. Chess, as a game, is more popular than ever before, even though the best chess player in the world is no longer human. It hasn’t stopped people from saying, ‘Oh, but we really enjoy playing chess!’ About AI, since the technology is so new, and so accessible, I don’t know. You ask a computer a question and it can answer, that’s incredible. But we also know it’s flawed. And then, there is this wild conjecture that it’s going to destroy all jobs, or no one will need to work anymore because we’re going to become vastly wealthy. Probably the answer, as ever, is somewhere in the middle.AI is obviously going to have a huge impact. What it will be is so hard to predict right now.■ All I can say is that right now, when we look at large language models — and I use them a lot, I’m a programmer, but not a very good one because I enjoy making things — it’s incredibly helpful and very fun. But it also makes things up and hallucinates. What I’m most interested in right now is, are there ways we can use this technology to support the community? Are there things that I can do pretty well? A lot of Wikipedia discussions are really long. You can get AI to summarise it. But here’s a key point, I want to read the original. It’s very useful. Another example would be you load up the Wikipedia article and all the sources and ask if there’s anything in the sources that should be on Wikipedia, but isn’t, or is there anything that’s not supported by sources. I did this and I think it is potentially useful for the community. Then say I want to write about a Bollywood movie that’s not globally famous in Wikipedia and I want to just get some basic facts about it. But I can’t read Hindi. Maybe the AI could help me a bit.We’re really about that human element, the human curated knowledge, the judgement. That machine translation might be a grammatical translation, but if you think about the cultural context of the reader, what they need to understand, what they are likely to know and what you need to explain to them, that goes beyond just the text. My example is, who’s the most famous cricket player? Today, it could be Virat Kohli in India. But if you’re writing for a global audience, you need to add a little text to explain who he is and put it in context. Machine translation can’t do that. But a human can.■ So, Gary Marcus is an AI researcher who has become known as kind of an AI sceptic, although I would say he’s not really an AI sceptic, but thinks that large language models have already hit a sort of wall — that we’re not seeing improvement on a lot of key issues like hallucinations. He thinks there needs to be some more fundamental breakthroughs. For some time, scaling seemed to make all the difference. But there are other experts of equal fame who disagree with them. Just watching that, I think, maybe we’re going to have a little bit of a break for a few years until there’s more breakthroughs where it’s like ‘okay, we’ve got this amazing tool but maybe we’re not that close to the next steps’.■ I think we’re going to have a big fight on copyrights. It’s going to be across legislatures and courts, rethinking how copyright law is structured. My concern is, we want to be careful about overreach. One of the classic principles of copyright law has always been that you can’t copyright facts. Some scientific publishers may be very excited to be able to say, you can’t use the facts unless you pay. And that’s a disaster. We don’t want to go there. That damages Wikipedia and our ability to say that on this date, this happened. Here’s the sources, and it’s five different newspapers. Also, newspapers don’t want to go there. One of the bigger, deeper issues is that local journalism has been wrecked. And that happened long before AI. For society, that’s a huge problem. I’m from Huntsville, Alabama, which is not a huge city, but it’s not tiny — 250,000 people. When I was a kid, I was a paper boy. I rode my bike and threw the papers (into houses). As a Wikipedian, the value of this is if I want to write about the history of Huntsville or the 1978 mayoral election, I’ve got a lot of good content to work with. But if I want to write about the most recent election? Very thin content. Because there’s just one afternoon paper now that’s published three times a week and from 100 miles away. And that means the first draft of history, which is journalism, isn’t being written. So, the second draft of history, which is Wikipedia, becomes much harder.■ I wish I had the answer to that. In some cases, maybe AI can help, if there’s some way to make it possible for one or two journalists to do more in a useful way that could be good. The changes in the information ecosystem have a lot of positives, obviously, but also some negatives. So go ahead and test.■ It has helped strengthen Wikipedia that we have this active, intellectual dialogue. I always say that I’m an eventualist, which is, we’ll probably get it wrong a lot but we’ll get it right eventually. The health of the Wikipedia community is important for us. Is the community having active discussions, having fun, behaving well? Are we doing things in a thoughtful way? I’m very comfortable with the debates as long as they don’t just become angry screaming matches.■ I find the Indian Wikipedia community to be very similar to everywhere in the world. A lot of nerds, not necessarily professionals in this field. There’s this guy in the global community with the nickname Hurricane Hank, who is a weather expert but not a professional meteorologist. The community has more men than women, unfortunately. That’s always something that we talk about. We want to improve that around the world. This is my third trip to India in a month and a half. On one of the trips, I was in Kerala, and I met with the local Wikipedia group. Among them was a couple, both Wikipedia editors, who brought their kids. On the second part of your question, I’ve not heard that about India pages. I do think it would be likely for the smaller language versions of Wikipedia. Obviously, those pages are typically going to be shorter and less filled in and less rigorous because there are fewer people doing it.■ See, Wikipedia is a source of knowledge, and sources are transparent things. One of the things that Elon (Musk) said is that Wikipedia just reflects mainstream propaganda. And I’m like, that’s really weird. Wikipedia reflects what reliable sources say. We cannot take one strange side, and say, ‘uh, we’re going to fight against all of scientific wisdom’, right? But we should reflect a debate if it’s a legitimate debate. Do we have biases? Well, of course, we’re human beings. So, we have to be really careful about that. Being neutral is one of the core values in the community. There’s no dispute about that. But do we always get it right? Maybe not. An old saying that I love is if you ask a fish about water, the fish will say, ‘What water?’ They live in it. They have no idea about it. And so oftentimes our biases are just there because we don’t know.Amartya Sen makes a comment in the introduction of his book, ‘10 Indians, 12 opinions’. That’s actually all humans — 10 humans, 12 opinions. Tone neutrality is very important for Wikipedia and for newspapers as well. I live in London and read two papers, Guardian and Telegraph. Guardian is a sort of centre left, Telegraph centre right. Both quality newspapers. I have an electric car, not a Tesla. I love electric cars and so I read a lot about them. If you cut out the headlines from those two papers, I can probably filter the information 90% accurately, because Guardian loves electric cars and Telegraph hates them. But because of this tone, I also trust both of them less because it feels like they are both campaigning. That’s a problem because it can reduce trust, not just with people who disagree, but even with people who agree with the tone.■ Tribune was an experiment to see if there was a way for journalists and community members to collaborate. What journalists can do, like you have come here in the middle of Delhi to chat with me, or go and report on something, or attend a press conference, or talk to a politician, that’s almost impossible to do as a volunteer. So, we explored some good collaborations. And then we would look at traffic stats every day. We had one story that had a really clickbait headline that I didn’t like. To make this into a commercial success, we needed more clickbait headlines. I didn’t want to do that. That’s how I realised the problem is not with journalism but that model, the broader ecosystem. The newspapers always love a good, juicy headline. There’s nothing wrong with that. But if algorithms are feeding people content to keep them around as long as possible, then that encourages more of the same kind of behaviour and so on. So it kind of changed my focus and was like, ok, good experiment.","Jimmy Wales co-founded Wikipedia, the internet’s default reference point.

Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

NEW DELHI: With nine of the 12 states covered in Phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) having published their final electoral roll - including six on Saturday - their combined electorate is down 7.9% to 19.7 crore, as compared to 21.4 crore at the time of announcement of SIR exercise on October 27, 2025.Over 1.7 crore electors have been struck off the electoral rolls of the nine states/UTs - Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar Islands - on account of SIR. While the final electoral rolls of Gujarat, Puducherry and Lakshadweep were published earlier, those for Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar were published on Saturday.Interestingly, the range of net decline in electors at the end of SIR varies from a steep 16.9% in Andaman & Nicobar and 13.4% in Gujarat to just 0.3% in Lakshadweep and 3.2% in Kerala. While four of the nine states/UTs recorded net deletions above the 7.9% overall average, it was the opposite in five states/UTs.Three states - West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu - are yet to publish their final electoral roll as part of SIR phase 2.While Tamil Nadu's roll will be out on Feb 23, the timeline for West Bengal is Feb 28 and for UP, April 10.Among the six states where SIR stands concluded, Gujarat saw the highest net decline in its electorate since the start of SIR, at around 68 lakh or 13.4%. Chhattisgarh's electorate shrunk by 11.8% and Goa's by 10.7%. The remaining three states saw a modest decline: with Kerala's final electorate down by 3.2%, Madhya Pradesh's by 5.9% and Rajasthan's by 5.7%.Among the UTs, only Andaman and Nicobar saw a sharp net decline of 16.9% in its electors. Puducherry electorate was 7.6% less than what it was on Oct 27, 2025; the decline in Lakshadweep was just over 0.3%.While Phase 1 of SIR completed last year was exclusive to Bihar, Assam witnessed only a special summary revision. Another 22 states and UTs are yet to conduct SIR. EC recently indicated that it may start the next phase of SIR in April.","Nine of the 12 states covered in Phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) have published their final electoral roll.

""Don't Want To Be Dependent On US Or China…"" Macron On AI Innovation

Human capital development critical to realise AI's potential

: The AI Impact Summit concluded here with the adoption of the New Delhi Declaration marking the success of the push by India and other countries in the Global South to frame artificial intelligence as a shared global good rather than an exclusive technological advantage of the rich and developed.Endorsed by 86 countries and two organisations, the declaration sets out a shared global vision for what it calls ""collaborative, trusted, resilient and efficient"" artificial intelligence, whose potential can be realised ""only when its benefits are shared by humanity"" and cautioning that ""the choices that we make today will shape the AI-enabled world that future generations will inherit"".Signatories span the AI powerhouses of the US and China as well as other technology leaders such as Netherlands, South Korea and the EU.Significantly, Pakistan does not figure in the list.Taiwan, the leading semiconductor manufacturer, appeared to have been left out because of sensitivities of China, which has blocked its presence on international fora.Rooted in the principle of ""Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya"" - welfare and happiness for all - a theme PM Modi articulated in his inaugural address on Thursday, the declaration places equity and access at the centre of AI governance, and commits participants to ""foster shared understanding, while respecting national sovereignty, on how AI could be made to serve humanity"".For many developing countries, this emphasis addresses long-standing concerns about technology rules being shaped without their participation.The declaration is organised around seven action pillars, or chakras, covering democratising AI resources; economic growth and social good; secure and trusted AI; AI for science; access for social empowerment; human capital development; and resilient, efficient and innovative AI systems. Together, they aim to translate broad principles into coordinated global action.Several voluntary commitments were announced to support this effort. Among them is the Global AI Impact Commons, described as ""a practical platform to encourage and enable the adoption, replication, and scale-up of successful AI use cases across regions"".The idea is to allow countries to share proven applications in areas such as public services, development and governance, reducing duplication and accelerating impact.Trust and safety form another core strand, with the declaration stressing that ""advancing secure, trustworthy and robust AI is foundational to building trust and maximising societal and economic benefits"". To support this, it takes note of the Trusted AI Commons - a voluntary repository of tools, benchmarks and best practices aimed at helping govts and developers build reliable AI systems across different legal, cultural contexts.With concern for democratisation of AI being one of the drivers of the declaration, it, predictably, emphasises that ""removing structural barriers to and increasing availability of AI research infrastructure can promote the use of AI in scientific research and development across countries"".An international network of AI-for-science institutions is expected to link researchers globally and accelerate AI-driven discovery. Human capital development is highlighted as critical to realising AI's potential.The declaration underlines that ""realising the full promise of AI requires equipping individuals with relevant skills"", backing this with voluntary guiding principles for reskilling and a workforce development playbook.","The New Delhi Declaration marks the success of the push by India and other countries in the Global South to frame artificial intelligence as a shared global good.

'Won’t Spare A Single Infiltrator': Amit Shah’s Poll Promise In Assam, Slams Cong Over Infiltration

GUWAHATI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused the opposition of turning infiltrators into a vote bank and said if BJP returns to power in Assam in the upcoming assembly elections, infiltrators will be removed from the electoral rolls and deported from the country within five years.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi possesses the “courage, determination, and firm resolve to free the country from infiltrators”.“The support of the state govt is essential to remove infiltrators, which would never be possible if the opposition party comes to power,” he said.He further said the Election Commission is conducting the Summary Revision (SIR) to help identify infiltrators, but “the Leader of the Opposition has launched an agitation against it.” Shah said, “The country will certainly be freed from infiltrators. Under our govt, the country is becoming free from Naxalism, and in the same way, Assam and the entire nation will also become free from infiltrators.”Shah was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Assam Police 10th Battalion headquarters at Kachutoli near the city on the land that was freed from encroachers in 2024.“During the rule of the opposition party’s govt, infiltrators had encroached upon 174 bighas of land, which has now been freed from their possession by the present chief minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, and today’s programme is being held on that very land,” he said.“At the very place from where security challenges had once emerged, the 10th Battalion of the Assam Police — which will eliminate those challenges — is now being established,” he said.He added that the land occupied by infiltrators had posed a major threat to Guwahati, Assam, and the entire country and the “presence of these infiltrators was a serious challenge to the development of Assam.”Shah said,“During the tenure of the previous govt, infiltrators had entered the region and pushed Assam’s demographic situation to a dangerous level.The opposition party bears direct responsibility for several areas of Assam — such as Dhubri, Barpeta, Morigaon, Darrang, Bongaigaon, and Nagaon — becoming infiltrator-dominated.”He highlighted that chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has freed nearly 1.45 lakh bighas of land from infiltrators and provided govt jobs to more than 1.4 lakh people in Assam without corruption and issued a firm pledge, “If our govt is formed again in the next five years, we will identify and deport every infiltrator from the country.”Shah alleged that infiltrators had become a vote bank for the opposition and declared, “Once our party’s govt is formed, within the next five years we will remove infiltrators not only from the electoral rolls but also from the country.”Accusing the opposition of endangering Assam’s identity, Shah said, “By allowing infiltrators to enter, the opposition party handed over Assam’s fertile land to them, which harmed the identity of the Assamese community and also put its cultural heritage at risk.”","Shah was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Assam Police 10th Battalion headquarters at Kachutoli near the city on the land that was freed from encroachers in 2024.

The government of India did probably 90% of what it had to do,” Subrahmanyam said at an event organised by the All India Management Association.“Land is state, labour is state, electricity is state, water supply is state, roads are state,” he said.“Differences in state-level governance now determine growth outcomes. States that push reforms move ahead, while others risk falling behind,” added Subrahmanyam.He said India’s demographic profile gives it a significant opportunity. “India is in for good times… demography is behind us, our capabilities are behind us and there is wind in our sails,” however, he said becoming a developed nation will require sustained high growth.At the event, Vianai Systems founder Vishal Sikka said India must build its own AI stack and not become dependent on systems it does not understand or control.","The next big wave of reforms must come from the states if India wants to become a developed nation by 2047, says Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam. “Most of the action in India is now at the state level.

GURGAON: Eleven Class 10 students missed their CBSE board maths paper on Tuesday after their school in Sector 9 failed to get them admit cards following a dispute over affiliation, sparking nightlong protests by parents and a police complaint.Parents alleged that Educrest International School kept delaying the admit cards despite taking full fees in advance, leaving families panicked and students uncertain about whether they would be allowed to write the remaining papers.

Why Was Basic Mathematics Introduced?

Standard vs Basic: Where Did the Difference Blur?

Allegations of Tricky and Out-of-Syllabus Questions

The Viral Reaction: Effort vs Expectation

Competency-Based Reform and the Trust Question

Trust in a High-Stakes System

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 Mathematics examination this year has triggered intense debate across classrooms, staff rooms and social media timelines. While the Standard paper has largely been described as direct and NCERT-based, students who opted for Basic Mathematics have voiced deep dissatisfaction, with many claiming that the paper did not match its declared level.For over 20 lakh students who appear for the Class 10 board examinations annually, even a single paper can influence subject choices, confidence and future pathways. Within hours of the exam, complaints flooded social media platforms. Parents of average and below-average learners expressed concern that students who consciously chose Basic Mathematics to avoid academic pressure were instead pushed to the edge.CBSE introduced Basic and Standard Mathematics in 2020 to create a structured academic choice. Students not planning to pursue Mathematics in Class 11 were given the option of Basic — designed to reduce stress and avoid advanced theoretical depth.However, this year’s controversy has reopened the debate on whether that distinction was clearly reflected.Neera Sharma, PGT Mathematics at GSKV Khajoori Khas, Delhi, emphasised the intent behind the policy: “Basic Mathematics was introduced to reduce stress for students who do not intend to pursue Mathematics in higher classes. If the framing becomes layered and analytical beyond expectation, the distinction between Basic and Standard begins to blur.”Echoing similar concerns, Sanjay Sharma, TGT Mathematics at Raghubar Dayal Jan Kalyan Government Co-Education Senior Secondary School, Bhajanpura, Delhi, said: “If a student opts for Basic, the expectation is that questions will be direct and simple. When the framing becomes tricky, students feel the level is not matching the label.”For many educators, the issue is not whether the questions were technically within syllabus, but whether the cognitive demand matched the purpose of the Basic category.Teachers analysing both papers observed that the Standard paper remained largely aligned with direct NCERT practice.Sanjay Sharma explained: “The Standard paper was direct from NCERT and of easy level. Theorem-based questions were simple — the theorem was given and students had to apply it directly. But in the Basic paper, questions were more tricky and lengthy.”He pointed specifically to Section E: “In Standard, case study questions were straightforward. In Basic, they required extra interpretation. Question number 38 from Trigonometry was easy in Standard but quite tough in Basic.”He also noted variation across sets: “Set 3 was tough because the MCQs required proper method and full calculation. Sets 1 and 2 were comparatively manageable. Since Mathematics was the first paper, anxiety was already high.”Detailed reactions also came from Government Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (GSKV), Khajoori Khas, Delhi.Anshu Singh, TGT Mathematics at GSKV Khajoori Khas, said: “There were no direct questions. Many were tricky and confusing. The geometry questions did not clearly match the examples students practised from NCERT.”She highlighted Questions 21, 31, 32 (both parts), 36 and 38 as particularly unexpected for Basic level.Neetu, TGT Mathematics at the same school, observed: “The case study questions demanded deeper analysis. For Basic students, the framing was not as straightforward as it should have been.”Neera Sharma, reiterated her concerns while analysing the geometry section: “Some of the geometry questions, including the shaded region in Question 34, were not expected at Basic level. Students were not prepared for that kind of presentation.”According to her, even though CBSE has not declared the question out-of-syllabus, the structure of Question 34 — based on a shaded region — surprised many students, especially since related practice exercises had reportedly been reduced in classroom focus.The debate intensified after a video of a Class 10 student who opted for Basic Mathematics went viral. The student expressed emotional distress, stating she had prepared rigorously from multiple guidebooks in less than two months — including the NCERT textbook, RD Sharma, RS Aggarwal, Together with Mathematics, Oswaal and Educart question banks.Her core concern was not lack of preparation but mismatch. She felt the questions did not resemble the direct formats she had repeatedly practised. Instead, the paper required interpretation, application and layered thinking.For many Basic students, preparation often revolves around mastering familiar patterns. When those patterns shift towards competency-based framing, the emotional impact can be significant.CBSE has gradually increased the proportion of competency-based questions to test conceptual clarity rather than rote memorisation. From a reform perspective, this shift is intentional.However, the controversy highlights a delicate balance. If Basic students perceive the paper as comparable in complexity to Standard, the credibility of differentiation is questioned.Neera Sharma offered a broader reflection: “Difficulty alone does not make a paper unfair. But expectations matter. If the level does not appear consistent with what students were told to expect, confidence is affected.”At the same time, educators remain divided. Some maintain the paper was within syllabus and conceptually sound. Others argue that framing and accessibility are just as important as syllabus coverage.Ultimately, this debate goes beyond one paper.• Who audits whether question papers truly match declared difficulty levels?• If Basic begins to resemble Standard in cognitive demand, does the distinction lose meaning?• In a high-stakes examination system, can even one unclear paper influence academic confidence and stream choices?Sanjay Sharma, said: “Even one tricky or unexpected paper can shake a student’s confidence, especially when they chose Basic expecting simpler questions. Labels mean nothing if the content does not match the promise.”Labels carry responsibility. If “Basic” promises reduced complexity, it must consistently reflect that promise in design and framing.As the board examinations continue, the larger issue remains — in a system impacting over 20 lakh students annually, clarity of intent, transparency in assessment and alignment between policy and practice are not optional. They are essential to maintaining trust.","CBSE introduced Basic and Standard Mathematics in 2020 to create a structured academic choice.

BENGALURU: Haunted by morbid thoughts of who would take care of his wife upon his death, a former Isro staffer, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning, contemplated ending his life by suicide, but panicked and aborted the plan.Police officers probing the case said Nageshwar Rao, who retired as a team leader, is under treatment for unstated psychological issues. The incident took place in a senior living community in Bengaluru's Whitefield area, a first such case in many years.According to preliminary investigations, Rao used a bath towel to smother Sandhya Shri, 63, while she was preparing lunch in the kitchen around 10.15am in The Virtuoso in Bommenahalli. Rao has been arrested on charges of murder.The couple from Andhra Pradesh purchased the flat three years ago. Their only daughter is settled in the US. Informed by police, the daughter is flying to Bengaluru, sources said.""After the woman collapsed, Rao sat near her body for 20 minutes. He called a neighbour, asking him to come home immediately as he had killed his wife. The neighbour thought it was a joke. When Rao repeatedly said it, the neighbour rushed in,"" police said.Seeing Sandhya motionless on the floor, the neighbour called a doctor in the apartment. Since many senior citizens live in the apartment, an ambulance and a doctor are deployed round the clock.""The doctor examined Sandhya and declared her dead. Then, the doctor called police,"" an investigating officer said.When police entered the flat, Rao was sitting on the sofa and readily confessed to the incident. ""Yes, I killed her. I may not live more than 3-4 years from now. Who'll look after her after my death? We don't have close relatives in Bengaluru,"" he said.However, when a senior police officer questioned him about the motive, Rao answered the query with a blank stare.The incident has jolted police and geriatric caregivers.

‘Chasing shadow in room of mirrors’: Why Delhi Police can’t crack the school bomb threat puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/chasing-shadow-in-room-of-mirrors-why-bomb-hoax-probes-hit-dead-end/articleshow/128571891.cms,"Blame It On Ironclad Privacy Of Swiss Servers, Geopolitical Opacity Of Foreign Domains, VPN Shields

AI Impact Summit, Supreme Court on CAA, India-France Ties & More





NEW DELHI: After some south Delhi schools received bomb hoaxes earlier this month, a technical probe led police to a virtual private network (VPN) service in Bangladesh. Days later, a spate of similar threats in northwest Delhi led them to a US-based VPN, while hoaxes reported in west Delhi schools a few months ago involved a Singapore-based VPN. However, even as police were busy writing to these networks to gather user details, they were flooded with more hoaxes.So, why is the law enforcement seemingly helpless in curbing this menace?When a threatening email lands in the inbox of a school in the city, the tactical response in the form of blaring sirens, evacuation of students and deployment of sniffer dogs and cops on the campuses is loud and swift.However, in tech dens of the police cyber cell, the reaction is quieter and the fightback uphill and borderline demoralising. For Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.Despite a string of such high-profile scares stretching into early 2026, the perpetrators remain digital ghosts. The inability to crack these cases isn't due to a lack of manpower, but owing to unsurmountable technical hurdles: the ironclad privacy of Swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains and multi-layered shields of VPNs.When investigators attempt to ‘ping' the origin of a threat, they aren't led to a desktop in Delhi, but to a server in a jurisdiction like Panama or the Seychelles. Using VPN chains — routing a connection through multiple encrypted tunnels — the perpetrator ensures that the IP address visible to Delhi Police is a dummy.""The hoaxers hide their actual location in Delhi or elsewhere behind a series of encrypted ‘tunnels'. The IP address that police see may belong to a server in Austria, Singapore or Netherlands. To us, it is like chasing a shadow in a room full of mirrors; every time we think we have a lead, the trail bounces to another country,"" said a cyber cell investigator.To get a real IP, police must request logs from a VPN provider. However, most premium services used by these actors operate on a strict no-log policy, meaning they do not store records of who use their services at a specific time. Simply put, there's no data to be handed over to the cops. So, the trail doesn't just go cold, it ceases to exist in the physical world.This wall of anonymity is reinforced by the choice of platform. In several high-profile waves of bomb threats, including the massive surge in hoaxes in May 2024 and the recent cases this month, the senders utilised Switzerland-based ProtonMail. Known for its militant commitment to privacy, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption, which even it can't bypass, and does not require a phone number or personal details to create an account. From an investigative standpoint, this is a nightmare.Because the service is protected by Swiss privacy laws, Delhi Police can't issue a standard search warrant. It must navigate the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty — a diplomatic marathon that requires proving ‘double criminality' (that the act is a crime in both India and Switzerland). Even then, the most police may receive is basic metadata — like the time of the creation of an account — which is rarely enough to identify a sophisticated user who had signed up using a masked identity.The ‘Russian angle' adds a final layer of complexity. Many hoax emails carry an ‘.ru' suffix, often from services like mail.ru. Investigators frequently find that these domains are used as a tactical smokescreen.By the time a request for information moves through the bureaucratic channels of Interpol, the specific account is usually deleted and the logs are overwritten.Occasionally, police do catch a break — usually when a ‘copycat' or a student makes a fundamental error in operational security, such as forgetting to turn on the VPN or using a personal recovery email. In late 2024, a student in Delhi was apprehended after sending a threat to his own school to avoid taking an an exam. He had forgotten to turn on his VPN, leaving his home IP address exposed.However, for the professional operators who target dozens of schools simultaneously, the global digital architecture is their greatest ally. The sheer volume of schools targeted — sometimes over 100 in a single morning — suggests a level of planning that involves scraping school databases from the dark web or using automated crawlers.So, as long as this infrastructure allows for perfect anonymity, all Delhi Police can do is operate within a reactive loop: evacuate students, search bags and declare hoaxes, while those behind the screen remain digital phantoms.","Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.

Within ten minutes, she received a WhatsApp message and the sender identified himself as Douglas. He said that he was originally from New Zealand and was a doctor. He said that his wife and parents had passed away and he had a five-year-old daughter, Maya. He further said that his mother was a South Indian. During the WhatsApp chat, he told her that his life had become very difficult, the United Nations had sent him to the war-torn area of Yemen on a three-month contract.He said that he was a gynecologist and was performing emergency caesarean sections there.One day, he said that Maya and many other children were admitted to the hospital after food poisoning from a birthday cake. He said that many children died in it, but his daughter Maya was alive and the doctors have said that she will have to undergo two surgeries and for that he needs money urgently.

NEW DELHI: A special POCSO court in Prayagraj on Saturday directed the police to register an FIR against Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati and his disciple Swami Mukundanand Giri in connection with allegations of sexual exploitation.ADJ (POCSO Act) Vinod Kumar Chaurasia ordered the FIR registration and a detailed investigation into the matter. The case will be registered at Jhunsi police station following the court’s directions. The application under Section 173(4) was filed by Shakumbhari Peethadhishwar Ashutosh Brahmachari Maharaj, seeking strict action, news agency ANI reported.Reacting to the court order seer said, “Yes, it is appropriate. Only when a case is registered will the subsequent process of investigation and recording of testimony be completed. Only then will the truth of the false case filed against us come before everyone, and those responsible for doing this can be punished. Therefore, it is necessary. We would only say that the court should proceed with this at a faster pace without taking too much time, as many people are watching this matter.Testimony should be recorded and a decision taken as soon as possible. What is wrong will remain wrong, and the false case that has been filed will ultimately be proven false.”The move comes amid a backdrop of controversy surrounding Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati. Last month, the seer claimed he was prevented from taking a ritual dip at the Sangam during the Magh Mela in Prayagraj, leading him to stage an 11-day sit-in protest. Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, he said, “When I sat there for 11 days, no official asked me to take a dip. Now it is too late. I will go to the Magh Mela next year and take a respectful bath. ”The seer had also urged Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state and declare the cow as ‘Rajya Mata’, calling it a measure of the government’s commitment as a “Hindu sympathiser.”The controversy traces back to January 18, when Swami Avimukteshwaranand, travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam for Mauni Amavasya, was asked by officials to dismount and proceed on foot due to heavy crowds. The Mela administration alleged that his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge, causing crowd management issues.Following the incident, the seer protested outside the Shankaracharya camp, demanding an apology and a dignified escort for the ritual bath. The administration also issued a notice questioning his use of the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth, citing a civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court.The row triggered political and administrative reactions. Prashant Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner in the Uttar Pradesh GST department, resigned citing moral reasons and Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri also stepped down, highlighting concerns over the alleged insult to the seer. The Congress party announced a campaign against the perceived insult, demanding that the state governor take suo motu cognisance.","POCSO court in Prayagraj orders police to register an FIR against Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati and his disciple Swami Mukundanand Giri.

'BJP's reign of terror is ongoing in MP': Congress reacts to the protest

NEW DELHI: A clash broke out on Saturday between Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party workers during a protest by the BJP against a “shirtless” demonstration by Indian Youth Congress (IYC) members at the India AI Impact Summit.According to the video circulating on social media, the confrontation saw stone-pelting, prompting police intervention to control the situation and ensure public safety.Deputy Commissioner of Police Krishna Lalchandani said that the clash occurred near the Congress office, where the BJP protest was underway.“There were two parties involved. One party was protesting. The protest was near the Congress office. The area had been barricaded, and proper police arrangements had been ensured. Suddenly, some rumour-mongering occurred, and some stones were thrown. Then, the other side also threw stones. Some people were injured... It's too early to say who threw the first stone,” Lalchandani added.The incident follows a “shirtless” protest staged by Youth Congress workers on Friday inside the Bharat Mandapam, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of compromising the country’s interests during the AI summit.During the demonstration, protesters removed their shirts and raised slogans, drawing attention to what they described as a political and national concern.Patiala House Court on Saturday rejected bail applications for four arrested Youth Congress workers, Krishna Hari, Kundan Yadav, Ajay Kumar, and Narasimha Yadav and sent them to police custody for five days. Police said that the custody was needed to investigate a potential larger conspiracy, including the funding and planning of the protest. Three policemen were reportedly injured during the confrontation.Delhi Police officials said that the protesters had registered online to obtain QR codes to enter the venue and initially planned to use black umbrellas with printed stickers to convey their message.“However, they later felt that the black umbrellas might draw the attention of the security personnel manning the gates, so they changed their plan and got the printed stickers placed on T-shirts instead,” a police source said.The accused reportedly engaged in a scuffle with security personnel and police staff during the protest. Investigators are also examining if the demonstration was part of a wider conspiracy linked to similar protests in Nepal.The lawyer for the accused argued that the protest was a form of political dissent and that the workers were being targeted because of their party affiliation. “Political dissent shouldn’t be crushed like this. The accused are educated office bearers exercising their right to protest peacefully,” the lawyer said.The Congress party reacting to the incident, blamed the state BJP leadership for the violence.In a post on X, the party wrote, “The BJP's reign of terror is ongoing in Madhya Pradesh. BJP goons have stormed into the state Congress office. There, these goons engaged in scuffles with Congress workers and caused widespread vandalism. All this thuggery was carried out under the patronage of the BJP government. Here, the government itself is tearing the law to shreds.

Why Congress can’t afford friction in Puducherry

Puducherry, the Union territory nestled within Tamil Nadu, will head to the polls in April alongside the state. But a growing rift between the Congress and its ally, the DMK — which governs Tamil Nadu on its own despite their alliance — now threatens to spill into Puducherry just months before the crucial assembly elections.At the heart of the conflict is the Congress’ demand for a share of power in Tamil Nadu if the DMK-led bloc wins again, along with a larger number of seats to contest than in 2021. Puducherry, given its geographical and cultural closeness to Tamil Nadu, is also emerging as a stage for this simmering rift.Manickam Tagore, a close confidant of former Congress president and current Lok Sabha leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has been at the forefront of the party’s push for greater “respect” from the DMK in Tamil Nadu. Now, he is extending that demand for “respect” in Puducherry as well.How practical is Tagore's demand? Can he — or the Congress — compel the DMK to concede? How likely is it that the DMK would give in? And with elections approaching, can the alliance afford internal strains? Let’s take a closer look.The politics in Puducherry, a former French colony, has been dominated by the Congress. Three other parties have also formed governments here—DMK, AIADMK, and the All India NR Congress—but none have ever enjoyed the level of dominance that the Congress did.That dominance is evident in the numbers: of Puducherry’s 10 chief ministers, seven have hailed from the Congress.The UT's lone Lok Sabha seat has also mirrored this political success. The constituency, also called Puducherry, has been contested in 15 general elections since 1967 and has been won by the grand old party — either directly or through its factions — 11 times.This legacy perhaps explains why the Congress sees Puducherry as politically significant. Given its long-standing dominance and the stakes of a potential defeat, the Congress would be keen to reclaim its supremacy here.Against the backdrop of political tensions in Tamil Nadu, the first signs of a possible spillover to Puducherry emerged on February 6. That day, Tagore posted on social media, citing electoral data to argue that the Congress — and not the DMK — should lead their alliance in Puducherry.“Will the party with 8% of the votes lead the coalition? No, the party with 26% of the votes will lead. Why should the Congress party be talked down to in the coalition?” he asked.The data he referred to was from the 2014 general elections. He did not explain why he chose figures from more than a decade ago, particularly from a parliamentary election rather than an assembly contest. In that election, the Congress finished second in the Puducherry Lok Sabha constituency, while the DMK came fourth. The Congress candidate, V Narayanasamy, who became chief minister two years later and held the post for over four years, secured 26.35% of the vote, whereas DMK’s AMH Nazeem received 8.19% and came fourth.A visit to Puducherry by the DMK’s election in-charge and Lok Sabha MP, S Jagathrakshakan, appears to have triggered the current episode. During the trip, he did not meet Congress leaders, and this “snub,” coupled with the ongoing friction in Tamil Nadu, seems to have sparked Tagore's outburst.But beyond the immediate provocation, the larger question is whether his assertion is merely rhetorical posturing or grounded in electoral reality.Despite Tagore’s assertive stance, the ground reality appears far less encouraging - if not outright alarming -for the Congress in Puducherry, where it was once the dominant political force. While the DMK remains the undisputed leader of the alliance in Tamil Nadu, the Congress now finds itself on comparatively weaker footing in Puducherry. Although it won the Puducherry seat in the two most recent general elections, its performance in the 2021 assembly polls was far less impressive. The Congress secured just two of the 14 seats it contested — a steep drop from the 15 it had won out of 21 during a successful campaign five years earlier.In contrast, the DMK, which contested 13 assembly constituencies under the seat-sharing arrangement, won six of them — securing the post of the leader of opposition in the assembly. The DMK, which is currently headed by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, had managed just two of the nine seats it contested in 2016.Tagore’s remarks could, therefore, be read either as election-season posturing or as a calculated attempt to pressure the DMK — in Puducherry or even in Tamil Nadu.The DMK remains a significant political player in Puducherry, while the Congress has been largely marginal in Tamil Nadu — last heading a government there in 1967 and last holding the leader of opposition post in 1996.The Dravidian major’s categorical refusal to share power in the southern state — a stance reiterated by Stalin himself — presents a major challenge for the Congress, leaving it to try and assert itself in Puducherry, where its historical influence still exists and where the party held power as recently as 2021.However, the Congress’ leverage — or lack thereof — in Tamil Nadu is already evident. The state Congress unit has urged the party’s national president, Mallikarjun Kharge, to take action against Tagore for his criticisms of the DMK, which itself has also called for action against the Virudhunagar MP.Whether the DMK exercises this leverage in Puducherry too or concedes ground to the Congress to maintain alliance cohesion ahead of the elections would shape not only the immediate electoral battle with the UT’s ruling NDA coalition, but also the longer-term balance of power between the two allies.With much at stake, the Congress can hardly risk tensions in Puducherry, especially on the eve of elections. With governments in only three states — Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana — the Congress can ill afford fresh tensions within the alliance. A victory in Puducherry would provide a much-needed additional governing foothold and strengthen its hand within INDIA, the national opposition bloc it leads. Tensions within the opposition coalition have been simmering after a series of electoral setbacks following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, in which they succeeded in reducing the BJP below the majority mark for the first time since 2014.For now, the Congress appears to be adopting a wait-and-watch approach. Whether this strategy bolsters its position or strains a key alliance ahead of the elections will soon be revealed.","Puducherry, the Union territory nestled within Tamil Nadu, will head to the polls in April alongside the state. A growing rift between the Congress and its ally, the DMK, now threatens to spill into Puduc Cherry. At the heart of the conflict is the Congress’ demand for a share of power in Tamil Nadu if DMK-led bloc wins again.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128645774,imgsize-72152,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design.jpg"

'Still battling trauma'

A Pocso court in UP's Banda sentenced to death Friday a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade, some as young as three, and selling videos and photographs of their torture on the dark web to customers across 47 countries.Additional district judge PK Mishra said convicts Ram Bhawan (50) and Durgawati (47) inflicted such physical and psychological trauma on the survivors - some required hospitalisation for injuries to their genitals and a few developed squint eyes - that their crimes deserved to be categorised as ""rarest of rare"".""The sheer scale of this victimisation across multiple districts, combined with the extreme moral turpitude of the convicts, marks this as a crime of such an exceptional and heinous nature that it leaves no room for reformation, necessitating the ultimate judicial deterrent to meet the ends of justice,"" says the order. The court directed the UP govt to pay Rs 10 lakh in compensation to each of the 33 victims.Ram Bhawan, who worked in the UP jalkal (waterworks) department, and Durgawati would lure children by offering them access to online video games, money and gifts. They remained active in Banda and Chitrakoot from 2010 till 2020, when Interpol got CBI involved in an inquiry on child sexual abuse content on the dark web.CBI registered an FIR on Oct 31 that year after the trail led to Ram Bhawan and Durgawati.The agency had filed a chargesheet documenting their crimes on Feb 10, 2021.Special public prosecutor Kamal Singh Gautam said the case had an overwhelming amount of evidence of what the children were subjected to.""The survivors are still suffering the psychological trauma caused by the predators"", Gautam said.CBI had medical experts from AIIMS Delhi to examine 25 of the children who suffered severe injuries at the hands of the convicts. The prosecution relied on their reports, digital evidence and the testimonies of the children to build their case and seek capital punishment to those accused in the case.Additional district judge Mishra convicted the couple of offences ranging from aggravated penetrative sexual assault and using children for pornographic purposes to abetment and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections.","A Pocso court in UP's Banda sentenced to death a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade.

"For some Gujarat groups, parental consent for marriage written in ‘constitution’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-some-gujarat-groups-parental-consent-for-marriage-written-in-constitution/articleshow/128631922.cms,"A Patidar community meeting last month in Mehsana. Leader of a Patidar group said they want strict laws against ‘sham marriages’

'Violate ban, face boycott'

Notice

'Parents should have say'

'Love marriage no crime'

Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law, but ‘or - ders’ to that effect are al - ready in force in parts of Gujarat, where some villages and communities have come out with detailed ‘codes’ intended to govern how their members marry.The amendments proposed in the state assembly on Friday reflect de - mands and actions being pushed on the ground, with scattered village reso - lutions hardening into communitylevel ‘constitutions’ — resolutions and declarations that threaten couples who marry for love with boycott, ostracism, and exclusion from public life.From gram sabhas in Kheda district to caste organisations of Patidars and Thakors, the consen - sus driving such declarations is that marriage without parental consent threatens tradition, destabilises so - cial order and endangers women.The gram sabha in Nand village in Mahudha taluka recently passed a res - olution imposing total social boycott on couples who marry despite opposi - tion from their families. Such couples are barred from community facilities, religious gatherings and social func - tions. The resolution also caps wed - ding and funeral expenses, prohibits DJs and “objectionable songs”, and imposes fines for violations.Bharat Solanki, the village sar - panch, said rising cases of marriage disputes had led to the decision. “We are a village of 5,000, mostly Thakors and Darbars. There have been sagotra (intra-clan) marriages, which are not permissible. When a couple elopes, it puts parents in an embarrassing po - sition. As these incidents have been rising, we decided to declare a ban on such marriages. Violate the ban, and you face boycott. ”The rules, Solanki insisted, spare no one. All communities in the vil - lage — including OBC and SC fami - lies, which form a minority — are required to comply. “The rules are for everyone. We are not targeting one single group. Violators pay Rs 21,000 fine and are excluded from village gatherings,” he said.Similar ‘rules’ are surfacing else - where, signalling a broader social churn. Village elders argue that couples who elope — their union is known locally as ‘bhagedu lagan’ — disrupt social harmony and bring dishonour to their families.Geni Thakor, Congress MP from Banaskantha who spearheaded the Thakor community’s campaign against such unions, said “the deci - sion was taken because (they) kept seeing fraudulent marriages"".“A girl marrying outside her com - munity weakens its social fabric. There have been instances where women are deceived by men, subject - ed to abuse and, in some cases, driven to suicide. Our aim is to protect our daughters,” said Thakor, who also cit - ed demographic factors, saying “the Patidar sex ratio is collapsing”.Following the proposed amend -ments, Thakor said she “was the first to raise the issue of ‘bhagedu lagan’ when the ‘love jihad’ bill (Gujarat Free - dom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021) was tabled in the assembly”. She insisted that “99% of love marriages fail and bring misery to the girl”. Asked about the basis for her claim, she said, “I have found this in villages; it might not be the case in big cities.”Among Patidars, opposition to such self-choice marriages has simmered for years. Lalji Patel, who heads the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), said the movement crystallised around paren tal anguish.“During Covid, parents came to us, begging us to rescue daughters trapped in sham marriages,” Patel said. “That is why we initiated these measures.” He said the SPG has been demand - ing that the legal age of marriage for women be raised from 18 to 21 even as he acknowledged that the Constitution allows adults to marry by choice. “But society matters. Parents are every - thing. They should have a say.”One pamphlet distributed by the Patidar Sena in Mehsana went beyond parental consent to call for sweeping changes, including par - ents’ signatures on marriage regis - tration for those aged 30 or younger. It also wanted court marriages to be restricted to the bride’s local juris - diction, 40 to be the minimum age of witnesses, and couples who marry by choice after 30 to deposit Rs 10 lakh in their parents’ accounts and forfeit any claim to family property.“These demands are born from the pain parents have gone through,” said Satish Patel, leader of the Mehsana Patidar Sena. Asked about the proposed rules, he said they were “not fully satisfied” as they also wanted “only blood relatives of girls to be signatories in the marriage registration as that ensures both parents and relatives bear full accountability for every such union”.Community leaders backing these demands insist they are not against people choosing whom they want to marry, but against secrecy and deception. “If a couple wants to marry and the parents agree, we have no objection,"" Lalji Patel said. “But parents must be involved. They’re the ones who will always shield their daughters.” He, too, said the latest proposal falls short of their demands.“The govt speaks of merely ‘informing’ parents, as though a notification is sufficient. We have demanded that parents’ consent be made mandatory.”Legal experts warn that such meas - ures strike at the core of constitu - tional freedoms but those who fall foul of such diktats say that they have to face serious difficulties in their day-to-day lives.A Dalit man from northern Gujarat who married a woman from the Darbar community in 2015 — Darbars are placed higher in the social hierarchy—said they have had to change their residence at least 50 times and stay off social media to avoid being traced. Both hold postgraduate de - grees but cannot find stable work.“We’ve not been able to work at one place. We are dependent on daily wages even though we both hold PG degrees,” the man said. “We took up jobs with NGOs, but my wife’s family members or relatives traced me there during fieldwork.”Kaushik Parmar, a lawyer from Mehsana who works with intercaste couples, slammed the proposed changes in the marriage registration rules, saying that “love marriage is not the enemy of society; it is the right of a free citizen”. “Every attempt to curb it weakens the Constitution and strengthens caste hierarchies. If we truly want a progressive, equal, and just society, we must see love marriage not as a crime but as an instrument of social change. These rules amount to the murder of democracy,” he said.",Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday said the United Nations joint statement India signed was not a ""negotiated document"" that condemned Israel's West Bank expansion.The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting that laid out a broader vision for deeper two-way ties, pitched for a sovereign and viable Palestine state living side-by-side with Israel.The meeting had also stressed the need for conducting international relations based on the UN charter.""The statement referred to was not a negotiated document.

The statement comes ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit to Israel next week, during which he's also likely to address the Israeli Parliament.""We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel's unlawful presence in the West Bank,"" the statement said.

1 in 7 stroke patients in India under 45 years: National Registry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-7-stroke-patients-in-india-under-45-years-national-registry/articleshow/128631939.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years. Nearly two in five reach hospital more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Three months later, more than half either die or suffer significant disability.These findings come from India’s largest hospital-based stroke registry analysis, published in ‘International Journal of Stroke’. The study was led by Prashant Mathur of ICMR–National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR), Bengaluru, along with investigators of the National Stroke Registry Programme.The analysis reviewed 34,792 stroke cases recorded across 30 hospitals between 2020 and 2022, providing one of the most detailed national snapshots of stroke patterns, treatment gaps and outcomes.The mean age of patients was 59.4 years, but 13.8% were under 45, underlining the growing burden of stroke among younger Indians. Nearly 63.4% were men and 72.1% came from rural areas, reflecting disparities in awareness, prevention and access to timely care.Hypertension was present in 74.5% of patients, making it the dominant risk factor. Diabetes affected 27.3%, smokeless tobacco use 28.5%, tobacco smoking 22.6% and alcohol use 20.2%.The study also noted gender differences — women had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes, while men reported greater tobacco and alcohol use.The time taken to get treatment remained the biggest hurdle, according to the analysis. Only 20% reached hospital within the crucial 4.5-hour window for emergency stroke treatment. In contrast, 37.8% reached hospital after 24 hours. As a result, just 4.6% of ischemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis and 0.7% underwent mechanical thrombectomy, it said. Delayed arrival, imaging delays and non-availability of medicines were key reasons for missing treatment.Ischemic strokes accounted for 60% of cases, while intracerebral haemorrhage made up 34.2%.Dr Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at AIIMS Delhi, said the numbers reinforced a basic message. “Patients must reach the hospital within three hours. Immediate brain imaging is essential, and, if eligible, thrombolysis should be given without delay. Time is brain — every minute lost means neurons lost, leading to disability and long-term dependence. It is vital that people recognise stroke symptoms and seek emergency care early,” she said.Outcomes remain stark as in-hospital mortality was 13.9%, but by three months, nearly 28% had died, indicating that many patients passed away after discharge. In total, more than half had a poor outcome, defined as death or significant disability. Women were more likely than men to have a disability at follow-up, suggesting possible gaps in rehabilitation and post-discharge care. Recurrent stroke within three months occurred in 1.1% of patients.The authors said stronger control of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco cessation, faster referral systems and better access to acute stroke care — particularly in rural India — were critical. Without improvements in prevention and rapid response, stroke would continue to strike early and leave families coping with avoidable disability.","One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years.

Among the first to be killed were 13-year-old Wamiq Farooq and 17-year-old Tufail Mattoo, whose deaths became rallying points for widespread demonstrations. Sharma said Omar had justified the killings of Wamiq and Tufail, claiming they were part of a “rebellion” against the then govt led by him.The LoP then invoked July 13, 1931, when 22 people were shot dead by the forces of Maharaja Hari Singh outside Srinagar jail during protests against Dogra rule. The date is widely commemorated in Kashmir as ‘Martyrs’ Day’.Those killed in 1931 were remembered as ‘martyrs’ by NC, while Wamiq, Tufail and others killed in 2010 were charged with rebellion, Sharma said, adding “we need to reflect on this”.He accused NC of exploiting “Kashmiri sentiments” after failing to deliver on economic commitments, including promises of jobs and 200 units free electricity, and alleged that govt had outsourced 24000 jobs to an unknown company. “BJP will come on roads against such clandestine recruitments,” he said.NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar dismissed the allegations. “It is BJP that has failed to deliver on its promise of restoring statehood,” he said. Referring to July 13, 1931, Dar said the day symbolised Kashmiri resistance against monarchy and the assertion of Kashmir’s identity. “BJP is trying to build a fake narrative around it. They are trying the same with the events of 2010 to arouse sentiments in Kashmir in their favour,” he said.","Opposition leader of opposition in the J&K assembly, Sunil Sharma, launched a political attack on Omar Abdullah govt.

BHIWANDI: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi appeared before a court here on Saturday in connection with a criminal defamation case stemming from remarks made during the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign.Sources said Gandhi’s personal appearance was largely procedural and necessitated by the recent demise of his former surety, Shivraj Patil Chakurkar, who had stood guarantee for his bail.With the earlier surety holder passing away last month, fresh surety formalities were required to be completed before the court.The case dates back to a public rally in Sonale village in Bhiwandi taluka during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where Gandhi allegedly stated that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) was responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.Following the speech, RSS office-bearer Rajesh Kunte filed a private complaint under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code, accusing Gandhi of defaming the organisation.Advocate Narayan Iyer, representing Gandhi, said the appearance was mandated due to the submission of a new surety. “Gandhi was required to be present as a new surety has been furnished following the demise of his earlier surety. The hearing was primarily procedural,” Iyer told TOI.On Gandhi’s behalf, Maharashtra Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal was presented as the new surety before the court.Iyer said that after Sapkal’s surety was submitted, Gandhi signed the bond.Iyer added that the matter has reached an advanced stage. “The chief examination and cross-examination of the complainant, Rajesh Kunte, have been concluded. The trial is progressing,” he said.In view of Gandhi’s visit, Thane Police had deployed additional personnel around the court premises to manage crowds and ensure law and order.",The case dates back to a public rally in Sonale village in Bhiwandi taluka during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

Ajit Pawar Dead In Baramati Plane Crash During Emergency Landing, Maharashtra In Political Shock

NEW DELHI: NCP (SP) general secretary Rohit Pawar on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the resignation of civil aviation minister K Ram Mohan Naidu until the inquiry into the January 28 plane crash that killed former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is completed. He also demanded an independent and transparent probe into the incident.In his letter to the PM Modi, a copy of which was marked to Union home minister Amit Shah, Rohit Pawar raised concerns about the air charter company VSR, which owned the ill-fated Learjet 45 aircraft and alleged possible links that need independent scrutiny, according to news agency PTI.“Serious questions have been raised about the company VSR and its links with Rammohan Naidu's party (TDP). These links must be investigated by an independent and competent authority, preferably in collaboration with international agencies,” Pawar said in the letter.Seeking the minister’s resignation, he wrote, “You have always shown respect for Ajit Dada and his contribution to the country. In this context, I request that Rammohan Naidu be asked to resign from his post until the investigation is completed. This is necessary to ensure there is no influence or interference in examining whether the DGCA was compromised in any manner in relation to VSR.”Addressing a press conference, Rohit Pawar alleged that the circumstances surrounding the crash warrant deeper examination and suggested that the possibility of conspiracy must be explored.“If we talk about conspiracies, there can be two types of conspiracies: political and commercial. We want to find out which one it is. Another thing is that if someone is supporting or protecting the VSR company, which is responsible for it, that could also be a conspiracy. So many powerful people are behind this company. DGCA officials are behind it,” he said.Calling for direct intervention by senior national leaders, he added, “But if this investigation needs to be brought to justice, only the most powerful people in India, like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, can bring justice to Ajit Dada, because the rest of the people involved are also powerful. I request them to personally address this investigation. I'm going to send a letter addressed to PM Modi via email today. .. The Aviation Minister must resign. This is our demand.”Rohit Pawar also raised doubts about technical aspects of the crash, including the aircraft’s black box and possible causes of the fire.“We had expressed doubts about the black box. When the accident happened, there was not just one blast, there were many blasts... VSR, the company that operates the flight, has a lot of issues. They are mechanical, maintenance issues. There is an area where bags are kept, additional petrol cans were kept there, and that's what caused the fire, so this needs to be investigated,” he said.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed near Baramati airport in Pune district while attempting to land. The Nationalist Congress Party (SP), along with Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress leaders, have raised questions over the incident and suggested possible foul play.","Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed near Baramati airport in Pune district.

What causes recurrent miscarriage?



How to recognise the signs of pregnancy loss

Recurrent miscarriages can be deeply distressing for couples trying to conceive, often leaving them searching for answers and hope. “While many couples experience the emotional pain of repeated pregnancy loss, the underlying cause is not the same in every case. Recurrent miscarriages can result from a variety of factors, and treatment must be tailored to the specific cause,” says Dr Sreevani Kotha, Director and Head, 9M Fertility by Ankura Hospital.She further adds that recurrent pregnancy loss is when a woman experiences two or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks of gestation.There can be several reasons for recurrent miscarriage , and the underlying cause is not the same in every case. One of the most common causes is an abnormal number of chromosomes in the developing fetus. When this occurs, the body recognizes that the pregnancy is not developing normally and may terminate it spontaneously. “Although chromosomal abnormalities are more frequently associated with advanced maternal age, they can also occur in younger women,” says Dr Sreevani.In some cases, the uterus may not be conducive to healthy implantation. Structural abnormalities, including fibroids and polyps, can be responsible in such situations. Endocrine problems such as thyroid disorders and diabetes can also lead to spontaneous pregnancy loss. “In a specific autoimmune condition called antiphospholipid syndrome, the body produces antibodies that increase the risk of blood clot formation. This can interfere with the placenta and affect the developing pregnancy,” Dr Sreevani adds, citing another cause.Apart from the above medical issues, environmental factors can also have a significant impact on pregnancy. Smoking, alcohol consumption, excess body weight, and high levels of stress are known to contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss. “In modern times, the effect of environmental factors on pregnancy has increased multifold. These factors don’t just influence recurrent pregnancy loss but also affect the overall fertility rates,” explains Dr Sreevani Signs such as vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain or cramping, persistent back pain, passage of tissue, or a sudden decrease in pregnancy symptoms may indicate a possible pregnancy loss and require immediate medical consultation. Women experiencing dizziness or weakness should also seek prompt evaluation.“Treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss depends on identifying and addressing the underlying cause. A thorough assessment is carried out with an individualized approach, which may include blood tests for hormonal and autoimmune disorders, genetic testing, and imaging studies such as ultrasound to evaluate the uterus,” says Dr Sreevani.Management may include correcting uterine abnormalities through surgery, treating hormonal imbalances, managing chronic medical conditions, or using medications in cases of autoimmune disorders. Lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and managing stress are equally important. “In selected individual cases where conventional measures are not sufficient, advanced assisted reproductive treatments may prove helpful for couples in achieving a successful pregnancy,” assures Dr Sreevani. Recurrent pregnancy loss can be emotionally distressing, but it is not uncommon. Modern medical science has evolved multifold, and scenarios that appeared difficult a decade ago can often be effectively managed today. By staying aware and seeking timely care, couples can attain positive outcomes,” concludes Dr Sreevani.","Recurrent pregnancy loss is when a woman experiences two or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks of gestation.

AR Rahman Admits Awards Once Weighed Him Down, Calls Reinvention More Important Than Legacy

NEW DELHI: Music composer A R Rahman on Friday agreed before Supreme Court to give credit to Ustad N Faiyazuddin Dagar and Ustad N Zahiruddin Dagar, popular as Junior Dagar Bandhu, in his song ‘Vera Raja Veera’ during the pendency of a suit by an heir of the Dagars accusing him of copyright infringement.Appearing for Rahman, senior advocate A M Singhvi told a three-judge bench led by CJI Surya Kant that the composer had always respected tradition and taken the spirit behind the court’s suggestion at the last hearing. Singhvi said Rahman would insert a new credit line for the song to be displayed every time it was played on OTT or online channels.The line reads: “Composition inspired by Dagarvani Tradition Dhrupad, first recorded as Shiva Stuti by Late Ustad N Faiyazuddin Dagar and Late Ustad N Zahiruddin Dagar”. Singhvi said the insertion would take four weeks to take effect on all mediums. The bench granted five weeks for the same.Delhi HC’s Justice Pratibha Singh had asked the credit line ‘Composition based on a Dagarvani Tradition Dhrupad’ be replaced with ‘Composition based on Shiva Stuti by Late Ustad Faiyazuddin Dagar and Late Ustad Zahiruddin Dagar’. This interim direction was set aside by an HC division bench on an appeal filed by Rahman.It was challenged in SC by Ustad Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar.A week back, the bench advised Rahman to acknowledge contributions of legendary Jr Dagar Bandhu’s contribution to the Dhrupad tradition of classical music.Ustad Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar had filed a suit seeking to bar Rahman from using ‘Shiva Stuti’ and said he still held copyright over the composition by his father and his uncle.Disposing of the appeal, the bench said all contentions of parties would be kept open during the trial of the suit pending before the HC single-judge bench and clarified it had expressed no opinion on the merits of any issue raised in the suit.",A R Rahman agrees before Supreme Court to give credit to Ustad N Faiyazuddin Dagar in his song ‘Vera Raja Veera’ Rahman will insert a new credit line for the song to be displayed every time it was played on OTT or online channels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128636068,imgsize-373757,width-400,resizemode-4/article-46.jpg"
Scrap dealer returns gold junked during cleaning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scrap-dealer-returns-gold-junked-during-cleaning/articleshow/128636087.cms,"From scrap to rightful owner

GURGAON: Haji Akhtar Khan picked honesty over a windfall. And the Sharmas got their Diwali gift, six months late.Khan, a scrap dealer in Faridabad, returned to the family nearly 100 gram of gold jewellery worth about Rs 15 lakh that had been accidentally sold off with household trash before Diwali.The family of Ashok Sharma, an electrician, realised the ornaments had gone missing while preparing for Lakshmi puja in Oct last year. The jewellery, mostly bangles and earrings, were kept in a small box and placed inside a sack at home before the family left for Kumbh Mela in Jan. It was an effort to keep the valuables safe from theft. During routine pre-Diwali cleaning, however, the sack was mistakenly thrown out and sold as scrap.The trash went to Khan (60).Khan has been running a scrap business since 1992 on Agra Canal Road.Suspecting the baby had been inadvertently thrown out with the bathwater, Sharma visited Khan two to three times over the following months to inquire if he had found anything but returned empty handed.Recalling what had happened, Khan said Sharma had come to his shop about two months before Diwali to sell some scrap. “He came in his own vehicle during house cleaning and sold off the scrap,” Khan said.When the family came back roughly two months later, Khan said he did not store CCTV footage from his shop that old. “Had they approached within 20 to 30 days of the scrap being sold, we could have checked the cameras. By the time they approached us, we had deleted the footage,” he added.The turning point came earlier this week when Khan, while sifting through scrap at his shop, noticed a plastic packet. “Someone might have kept it there thinking it was brass. But I had my suspicion,” he said.Khan got the packet checked by a jeweller. “He confirmed it was gold — 22 carat — about 100 gram. I was sure it belonged to Sharma ji and no one else. So, it had to be returned. We earn through hard work and cannot keep someone else’s property. My family also agreed with me.” The scrap dealer took the jewellery to a police station to ensure a proper handover.","Ashok Sharma, an electrician, realised the ornaments had gone missing while preparing for Lakshmi puja in Oct last year.

‘Mahanagar stn was part of Metro plan but dropped later’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahanagar-stn-was-part-of-metro-plan-but-dropped-later/articleshow/128622676.cms,"Lucknow: Did you know that the Mahanagar area of the city was part of the Metro route in the original alignment plan, but was dropped later? A comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report tabled in the state Assembly on Friday revealed that Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.The CAG report states that in Dec 2013, the central govt had granted pre-approval for Phase-1A of the Lucknow Metro . The DPR, an MOU between the Centre and UP govt, the finance contract with the European investment bank (EIB), and the project agreement with EIB all specified the construction of 22 stations along the 23-km corridor.According to the DPR, Mahanagar station was projected to get the third-highest passenger footfall in 2015 and the second highest by 2020. A source in the Lucknow Municipal Corporation said the area has two separate wards (Mahanagar and Vivekananda Puri) with over one lakh population.However, the audit found that the executing company -- UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) -- built only 21 stations, dropping Mahanagar from the alignment. No evidence was produced to show that any proposal for its exclusion was placed before the central or state govts nor any approval was obtained, the report says.The CAG noted that bypassing the sanctioned DPR violated multiple binding documents — DPR, MoU, finance contract, and the project agreement — and deprived the Mahanagar area of a key Metro facility despite projected high ridership.In Sept 2024, the state govt claimed that the change was not concealed, stating that the ministry of housing and urban affairs had notified the alignment with 21 stations after examining it against the original DPR.The CAG found state govt response unconvincing, noting that while the UPMRC informed MoHUA about other major alterations — such as changing the proposed elevated station at Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport to an underground one — it failed to disclose the removal of Mahanagar station. The audit stressed that any deviation from the approved DPR required a separate, explicit approval from the GoI along with justification, which was neither sought nor granted.Reacting to the CAG report, the UPMRC told TOI that station locations were optimised by dropping Mahanagar. It was appropriate to have both stations 'IT Chauraha' and 'Badshah Nagar' closer to Mahanagar. Usually 1km distance has been maintained between each station.","Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.

Members of the diaspora told TOI that many families back home are grappling with grief following recent anti-regime protests and the deaths of loved ones, leading to a marked shift in how the holy month is being observed.

It is an act of defiance to show the regime that killing protesters has not silenced dissent but inspired more to stand up peacefully. ”He added that videos shared by his relatives show families clapping and singing at grave sites. “Earlier, families would wear black and mourn. Now, many are suppressing visible sorrow and choosing symbolic gestures of resistance. Through that act, they are challenging the regime,” he said.TOI independently verified the claims and came across several such videos in which families appeared to be singing and clapping near the graves of relatives who allegedly died during the unrest.Bahaar Ghorbani, another Iranian living in India, claimed that nearly 40,000 people, including women and children, were killed during the protests. “In recent years, more people have been openly eating during fasting hours as a mark of dissent. Authorities no longer strictly act against those not observing the fast. This time, the mood is even more intense because of the mass killings. Ramadan feels different,” she said.Helma, an Iranian based in Hyderabad, pointed to economic hardship as another reason behind the subdued atmosphere. “Many people cannot afford basic food items. There is also anxiety over a possible war with the US, which people fear would worsen the situation. In such circumstances, people are struggling to focus on religious observances,” she added.In Dec last year, demonstrations broke out across several cities in Iran amid widespread unrest directed at the govt and mounting economic distress. The upheaval was described by observers as the most significant challenge to the establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The subsequent security crackdown involved the use of live ammunition against protesters.Rights groups and activists have alleged that the violence led to tens of thousands of deaths, describing it as among the deadliest episodes in the country’s modern history.","As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran.

Following the threat, the MLA's security has been enhanced. The development comes close on the heels of a separate case in which Akot BJP city president Harish Tawari was allegedly threatened through Signal messaging app.According to police, Tawari first received a message on Feb 12 asking him to arrange Rs2 crore by collecting it from Akot BJP MLA Prakash Bharsakale. Based on Tawari's complaint, a case has been registered with the cyber police station in Akola. Investigators have treated the message as a serious extortion threat and launched a probe.MLA Sajid Khan Pathan allegedly received a phone call demanding ₹10 crore. Police sources said the call was received on Feb 17 at around 3pm, and the caller allegedly warned the MLA to pay the amount within two days or face severe consequences.Investigators have traced the origin of the call to California, US.Following the threat, Pathan's security has been tightened and four armed police personnel have been deployed for his protection. After the call, the MLA met Akola superintendent of police Archit Chandak and other senior officers and formally lodged a complaint.Police said Lonkar is a native of Nevri Budruk village in Akot taluka of Akola district. The fact that a BJP city office-bearer and a Congress MLA were allegedly targeted by the same network has caused serious concern within the Akola police establishment.Who is Shubham Lonkar?According to police records, Lonkar had earlier claimed responsibility for the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, and later for the firing incident outside the residence of filmmaker Rohit Shetty.Lonkar had earlier been arrested by Akola police, who seized three pistols and live cartridges from his possession. Investigators believe he was in contact with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his younger brother Anmol Bishnoi.Police said Lonkar was a key operator in a weapons-trafficking racket. In the same case, Akot police had also arrested three persons who allegedly procured firearms through him.Investigators further said Lonkar had been living in Pune's Warje area for some time before going absconding. He was later arrested from Pune and subsequently released on bail.Police also claim to possess call recordings of conversations between Lonkar and Lawrence Bishnoi.

Defeated candidates are allegedly going door-to-door, asking residents to return cash and gifts they distributed during the campaign.What began as quiet requests has, in many places, escalated into heated confrontations. Some videos showing some of the defeated candidates or their relatives asking for refunds have gone viral on social media, fuelling public outrage.Reports of clashes between candidates and residents have surfaced from Medchal Malkajgiri, Khammam, Suryapet, Peddapalli, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Jagtial and Nizamabad districts. In several instances, residents said they never demanded the money or gifts given voluntarily, and it was not correct for these to be returned.On the eve of the Feb 10 polling, candidates in some municipalities and wards allegedly distributed cash between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000 for each vote. Pressure cookers and sarees were allegedly given to women voters. After losing, some candidates — across party lines as well as independents — began suspecting certain colonies had not supported them.One viral clip shows a man and a woman, linked to a prominent party, carrying sarees away. When probed, the woman is heard saying if they got one vote, the opposition got four. In another video, a woman, believed to be a candidate, is seen pressuring a voter to promise that she had voted for her. After the assurance, the woman marked the voter’s name on a list.In Medchal Malkajgiri district, acandidate allegedly visited households soon after counting day, seeking repayment. In Yellampet municipality near Hyderabad, the husband of a defeated independent candidate allegedly asked residents either to return the money or “swear” that they had voted for his wife.HYDERABADDespite the videos going viral on social media, State Election Commission officials said no formal complaints had been received, adding they had not seen the videos.","Defeated candidates are allegedly going door-to-door, asking residents to return cash and gifts they distributed during the campaign.

Cong now wants MVA's sole winnable Rajya Sabha seat for itself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-now-wants-mvas-sole-winnable-rajya-sabha-seat-for-itself/articleshow/128631833.cms,"Congress Party Flag

Mumbai: A tussle is brewing within the MVA over the selection of a candidate for the lone Rajya Sabha seat which the alliance can win in the upcoming RS polls. While Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut had revealed that NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar was keen on contesting, Aaditya Thackeray claimed the seat for the UBT Sena. Now the Congress has said that either one Rajya Sabha or MLC seat should come to it.""Since we have the second highest number of MLAs in the alliance, the Congress should get either a Rajya Sabha or MLC seat,"" said Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe on Friday.Sanjay Raut struck a conciliatory note on Friday, saying three parties in the alliance will sit together and take a decision on the candidate. ""We have enough numbers for one Rajya Sabha seat. The three parties will sit down and decide who is the best candidate for the interests and identity of Maharashtra. The decision will be taken unanimously,"" Raut said. The election is slated for March 16.When asked about NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar's possible candidature since his term is ending, Raut said, ""Sharad Pawar is a big leader of this country."" He added, ""Each party feels it is an important constituent and will seek opportunities.But finally, there is consensus.""Raut said it was important to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha. ""We need to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha who will raise issues in the interest of Maharashtra,"" he said.The question of a joint candidate within the MVA assumes significance in view of the speculation on talks of a merger between the NCP (SP), which is part of the MVA, and the NCP led by the late Ajit Pawar which is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance. The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs. The Sena (UBT) has the highest number at 20, followed by the Congress with 16 and the NCP (SP) with 10.","The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs.

An additional district and sessions court in Manjeri town of Kerala’s Malappuram district on Friday sentenced five men to life imprisonment for beating a 42-year-old person to death in Mankada village in a 2016 moral policing case.The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict. The court had held the five men guilty under IPC sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with dangerous weapon) and 449 (house trespass to commit an offence punishable with death).The convicts were identified as Nayakath Abdul Nassar (46), his brother Sharafudheen (39), P Suhail (40), P Abdul Ghafoor (60) and P Zakkeer Hussain (49), all natives of Koottil, near Mankada. In addition to life sentence, the two brothers and Ghafoor were awarded rigorous imprisonment of five years and 11 months and a fine of Rs 15,000 each.The other two accused, who were also found guilty of destruction of evidence, were handed additional seven years and 11 months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 20,000 each. All sentences will run concurrently. Three other accused — C Shafeeq (40), M Parambath Mansoor (40), and A Abdul Naser (41) — were acquitted due to lack of evidence.According to the prosecution, the accused forcibly broke open the door of a house where the sister-inlaw of P Zakkeer Hussain lived alone, in the early hours of June 28, 2016, alleging that the victim, Nazeer Hussain, had visited at an odd hour. The accused beat up Hussain brutally with sticks for around two hours, leaving him unconscious. The court noted the accused did not even give water to the victim, nor allowed to be taken to hospital, showing a cruel and inhuman attitude.Special public prosecutor P G Mathew said the visuals retrieved from the phones of two of the accused, who had recorded the brutal assault, turned crucial in their conviction.","The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict.

Setback to BJP as its rebel elected Bhiwandi mayor of Cong-led front,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/setback-to-bjp-as-its-rebel-elected-bhiwandi-mayor-of-cong-led-front/articleshow/128631729.cms,"Bhiwandi: In a setback to the BJP, its rebel corporator Narayan Chaudhary who broke away from the party along with five other corporators and aligned with the Congress-led 'Bhiwandi Secular Front' was on Friday elected mayor of the Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation (BNMC).Contesting as mayoral candidate of the front, which included Congress with its 30 corporators and NCP (SP) with 12, Chaudhary got 48 votes in a House of 90 effectively reduced on Friday to 89 with one corporator abstaining. The BJP's nominee Sneha Mehul Patil got 16 votes, while Vilas Patil of the Konark Vikas Aghadi (KVA) polled 25 votes.Congress' Tariq Momin was elected deputy mayor; he got 43 votes.Maharashtra BJP president Ravindra Chavan said action would be taken against Chaudhary and the other corporators who had allegedly defied the party whip in the mayoral polls.In the Jan 15 civic elections, the Congress had emerged as the single largest party with 30 seats, followed by BJP (22), Shiv Sena (12), NCP-SP (12), SP (6), KVA (4), Bhiwandi Vikas Aghadi (3) and one independent. The Shiv Sena did not go with the BJP for the mayoral election.While the BJP initially announced that Chaudhary would be its mayoral candidate, it later replaced him with Sneha Patil, resulting in Chaudhary's rebellion and his joining hands with Cong-NCP (SP), who agreed to field him as the mayoral candidate of the 'secular front.' Interestingly, while the 'Bhiwandi Secular Front' secured 48 votes in the mayoral contest, with six of BJP's rebel corporators including Chaudhary voting for it, the Congress won the deputy mayor's post with 43 votes.The dispute between BJP and the Shinde Sena also worked in favour of the Congress-led front in the deputy mayor's election as the presence of three candidates worked to the Congress' advantage.",Narayan Chaudhary was elected mayor of the Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation.

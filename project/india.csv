No case of cheating made out in

Odisha coal scam

: Court

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Wednesday acquitted six accused, including a former coal secretary and two other public servants, in an alleged coal scam case related to allocation of blocks in Odisha, reports Vineet Upadhyay.Special judge Sanjay Bansal acquitted former coal secretary Harish Chandra Gupta , former joint secretary in ministry of coal K S Kropha, and former director in the coal allocation section of the ministry K C Samria, noting accused public servants cannot be held accountable when Navbharat Power Pvt Ltd , the company which got the coal block, followed proper processes and was eligible.When the application (by NPPL) has been found to be complete and the applicant has been found to be an eligible applicant, and allocation was recommended to a company which had recommendation from MoP (ministry of power) and state govt of Odisha, the accused public servants cannot be held accountable for any offence. For any lapse on their part, the accused public servants may be administratively liable but are certainly not criminally liable, in the facts and circumstances of the present case,"" the court concluded.The court, taking note that the company received various permissions from different authorities and made substantial progress in the development of the coal block as well as completion of its power project, said that these factors showed that the organisation was a competent company and allocation of the coal block to it was not a wrong decision.The court noted that no case of cheating was made out as no one was induced as the ""application has been found to be complete, when the applicant company NPPL has been found to be an eligible company, and when no misrepresentations were made by the company, no question arises for the existence of any conspiracy. It is held that the prosecution has failed to prove any conspiracy.""It also acquitted NPPL, the name of which later changed to Brahmani Thermal Power Private Limited (BTPPL), its then chairman P Trivikrama Prasad, and then managing director (MD) Y Harish Chandra Prasad. It acquitted all six accused of the charges, including IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating), and sections under the Prevention of Corruption Act .The case relates to the said company obtaining coal blocks in Odisha's Rampia, Dipside of Rampia, and Mandakini between 2006 and 2008 by allegedly misrepresenting its financial strength, net worth and land holdings.An FIR was registered under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act along with relevant provisions of IPC in Sept 2012 on a reference made by Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).","A Delhi court Wednesday acquitted six accused, including a former coal secretary and two other public servants, in an alleged coal scam case.

Despite Telangana notice, Dosanjh singing songs with twisted lyrics: Complainant

CHANDIGARH: No songs mentioning alcohol, drugs or violence. And no ""twisted words"" to bypass this directive, says an 'advisory' issued to singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh by the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights ( CCPCR ) ahead of his concert in the city this Saturday.The notice comes less than a month after Telangana government clamped similar restrictions on the singer before his Dil-Luminati India tour gig in Hyderabad.Dosanjh, scheduled to perform at Exhibition Ground in Chandigarh's Sector 34, will be liable for penal action if the order is not complied with, the commission's chairperson Shipra Bansal said.Songs that refer or allude to alcohol, drugs and violence affect children of impressionable age, the panel said.The concert organisers are required to ensure that those below 25 years - the legal drinking age in Chandigarh - are not served alcohol. Any violation is punishable under Juvenile Justice Act and other relevant laws, the notice mentions. ""Other than the organiser and singer, the UT administration has been marked in a copy of the advisory,"" Bansal said, adding that ""it is also the responsibility of parents to make kids understand"".Bansal said singer Karan Aujla had received a similar notice for his Dec 7 show.The CCPCR advisory also cited a WHO report that highlights the perils of being exposed to high decibels. Even adults should not be exposed to sound levels above 140db. For children, the optimum is 120 db, the notice states. ""It is advisable not to invite children on the stage during the live show where peak sound pressure level is above 120db, which is harmful for children.""In Hyderabad, Diljit Dosanjh tweaked the lyrics of his songs, replacing mention of alcohol with another word. He also faced protests by right-wing organisations in Indore for reciting couplets from Rahat Indori's poem, 'Kisi Ke Baap Ka Hindustan Thodi Hai', which was often heard during the anti-CAA agitation.Both Telangana govt's notice and CCPCR advisory to Aujla and Dosanjh were issued following complaints by Pandit Rao Dharennavar, assistant professor at Chandigarh's Post-Graduate Govt College. ""Even after the notice by Telangana's child and women department for not performing such songs, Dosanjh has been singing those songs with twisted lyrics on the stage, which youngsters sing along with him that too in the original form. In the concert, children aged below 13 years are allowed to enter,"" Dharennavar said.The Sector 41 resident said he would also file a complaint against rapper A P Dhillon's scheduled Dec 21 show, specifically his song 'Old Money' that allegedly promotes violence.","Songs that refer or allude to alcohol, drugs and violence affect children of impressionable age, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights says.

"Village answers trunk calls, saves jumbos",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/village-answers-trunk-calls-saves-jumbos/articleshow/116269817.cms,"Villagers in Assam's Jorhat district rescued four wild elephants, including a calf, trapped in a pond.

DIBRUGARH: A trunk call is loaded with meaning - could be an admonitory don't-mess-with-me, or an SOS. Village headman Hem Chandra Borah froze mid-step around 6.10pm Wednesday as a piercing cry shattered the quiet at Khamjongia in Assam's Jorhat district - a sound both alien and sorrowful. There was no mistaking it: the elephants were in trouble.Four wild elephants, including a calf, had strayed from their herd and found themselves trapped in a large, deep pond. The animals thrashed, their efforts to climb slippery slopes thwarted at every turn. With each failed attempt, their trumpeting grew more desperate, and the calf's distress struck a particularly harrowing chord.""When we rushed to the site, we found the elephants struggling to climb out. The forest officials suggested waiting for an excavator, but we knew time was critical. Especially for the calf, which was visibly exhausted, waiting wasn't an option,"" Borah said.Determined to save the animals, the villagers quickly gathered tools such as hoes, shovels, and spades. Men, women, and even children worked tirelessly to dig a makeshift path along the pond's edge, forming a slope the elephants could use to escape.Hour by hour, inch by inch, the slope took shape. The calf, shivering and drained, watched from the water's edge as if sensing the monumental effort being made for its life. By 10.15pm, the young calf scrambled up the slope. The remaining elephants, one after another, followed.""It was a moment of pure joy when they finally walked free,"" said Ujjal Baruah, a resident who participated in the rescue. ""Though the elephants were limping, we were relieved to see them without major injuries. If we hadn't acted quickly, the calf might not have survived the night.""When the last giant heaved itself onto solid ground, an almost reverent silence fell over the crowd. The elephants, their mud-slicked bodies glistening in the pale light, lingered for a moment as if acknowledging their rescuers. Then, with slow, deliberate steps, they vanished into the dark embrace of the forest.","Villagers in Assam's Jorhat district rescued four wild elephants, including a calf, trapped in a pond.

"CCS clears two big-ticket arms deals worth Rs 21,100 crore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-two-big-ticket-arms-deals-worth-rs-21100-crore/articleshow/116269771.cms,"India strengthens its defence with a Rs 21,100cr investment in 100 K-9 Vajra artillery guns and 12 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets.

NEW DELHI: In a move that will add some much-needed firepower to the armed forces, two major defence deals for 100 more K-9 Vajra artillery guns and 12 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets , collectively worth Rs 21,100 crore, have been cleared by the cabinet committee on security.The CCS on Thursday gave the final nod for the Rs 7,600 crore contract for 100 K-9 Vajra self-propelled tracked gun systems to add to the 100 such 155mm guns already inducted through the joint venture between L&T and South Korean Hanwha Defence, top sources told TOI.The Rs 13,500 crore deal for the 12 Sukhois, which will be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) under licence from Russia, along with associated equipment and spares, in turn, was given the green signal by the CCS last week.“The deal for the 12 Sukhois was inked by the defence ministry (MoD) with HAL on Thursday. While the Sukhois will be manufactured by the Nashik division of the HAL and have an indigenous content (IC) of 62.6%, the additional K-9 guns will have around 60% IC ,” an official said.The Army has deployed some of the first 100 K-9 Vajra guns, which were originally procured for deserts at a cost of Rs 4,366 crore, in eastern Ladakh after equipping them with “winterised kits” for the high-altitude area amid the military confrontation with China.“With a strike range of 28-38 km, the 100 new guns will come with the winterised kits to ensure their batteries, oil, lubricants and other systems do not freeze in sub-zero temperatures. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has reinforced the need for long-range, high-volume firepower,” another source said.The additional 12 Sukhois, in turn, will replace the ones that have crashed over the years. The IAF currently has 259 twin-engine Sukhois, the bulk of them produced by HAL under licence from Russia for over $12 billion, which constitute around 50% of its combat fleet.Amid the continuing delay in induction of the indigenous single-engine Tejas Mark-1A fighters, the IAF is grappling with just 30 squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle the twin threat from China and Pakistan.Though the 36 omni-role Rafale fighters, inducted under the Rs 59,000 crore deal with France in Sept 2016, have added some punch to IAF’s combat capabilities, the major depletion in fighter squadrons is a big concern for the defence establishment.Towards this end, the defence ministry in Sept had also inked the over Rs 26,000 crore contract with HAL for the procurement of 240 AL-31FP aeroengines to sustain the operational capabilities of Sukhois. The aeroengines will be manufactured by the Koraput Division of HAL, with the defence PSU sourcing some components from Russia.There is also the major indigenous upgrade plan to make 84 Sukhois much more lethal with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years.This Rs 63,000 crore project, which will ensure the new `Super Sukhois’ are close to fifth-generation fighters in terms of stealth and capabilities, will also soon head for the final clearance by the CCS, as was earlier reported by TOI.At present, 40 Sukhoi fighters have also been modified to carry the air-to-ground precision-strike BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose range has been extended from 290 to 450-km, to constitute a decidedly deadly weapons package.","Two major defence deals for 100 more K-9 Vajra artillery guns and 12 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets have been cleared by the cabinet committee on security.

What Swachh ranking won't tell you about Indore's air quality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-swachh-ranking-wont-tell-you-about-indores-air-quality/articleshow/116269741.cms,"Indore

The irony is hard to miss. Indore, which has worn the crown of India's 'cleanest city' in government's Swachh rankings for seven straight years, has been struggling to clean up its air. The largest city in Madhya Pradesh has seen a 21% rise in levels of the pollutant PM10 between 2017-18 and 2023-24, according to recently released govt data.Indore figured among 31 'non-attainment' cities - where air quality had deteriorated since the 2017-18 base year - in a list of 130 that are monitored under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which aims to reduce PM10 levels in these urban centres by up to 40% by 2025-26.While the list of 'non-attainment' cities includes places such as Navi Mumbai and Vizag, which also ranked high in the 2023 Swachh ratings, Indore's name stands out. It sees itself as a model city and has acquired an international reputation of sorts for cleaning up its act on sanitation and waste management, which form the basis of Swachh rankings. The city has been topping the Swachh Bharat surveys since 2016, but that's also roughly the period that NCAP has examined to find a deterioration in the city's air.It's not hard to see why the city's air quality has been slipping. As the major commercial and industrial hub of the region, Indore has urbanised rapidly. A 2019 paper - Air Pollution Knowledge Assessments for 20 Indian Cities - published in Urban Climate found that the built-up area in Indore and its neighbourhood had grown about nine-fold between 1975 and 2014, the highest among the 20 cities the study looked at and more than double the average increase (4.2-fold) seen across these cities.Indore has more than 3,000 micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) units. Over 500 real estate projects are under construction in the district, according to Credai. Revenue from property registrations in the city jumped to Rs 1,339 crore, up 7.2%, between April and Oct 2024 compared with the corresponding period last year, according to official data.The city is also a major transport hub. Three national highways pass through Indore - NH 52 (part of the old Agra-Mumbai road), NH 47 (Nagpur-Bamanbore in Gujarat) and NH 347BG (within MP). Besides, two major state highways, SH 27 and SH 31, run close to the city. Indore itself has more than 20 lakh vehicles. Per the Regional Transport Office, around 8,000 two-wheelers and 2,500-3,000 cars are registered every month in the city.""Traffic management has failed to keep pace with the rate of new vehicles hitting the roads. There are substantial emissions from congested traffic, including from vehicle tyres, which are particularly harmful,"" says city-based environmentalist O P Joshi.Not surprisingly, the major contributor to Indore's pollution is the road dust kicked up by traffic movement. Vehicular emissions come second. Per a source-apportionment study by Clean Air Catalyst, a flagship programme launched by the US Agency for International Development and a global partnership of organisations led by World Resources Institute, road dust contributes nearly three-fourths of the city's coarse particulate matter (PM10), with transportation, industries, construction and household cooking making up most of the rest.Road dust also leads in the share of fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) at 55%, followed by transportation, industries and household cooking.This isn't very bad news for city authorities. Dust management is the low-hanging fruit among pollution-mitigation measures and doesn't involve harsh actions impacting people and livelihoods. ""Road dust gets resuspended in the air due to vehicular movement and wind. Continued optimal cleaning of roads would help minimise its impact,"" says Prakash Doraiswamy, senior scientist at Clean Air Catalyst and director of air quality at WRI.Overall, too, Indore's location lends it certain natural advantages.""Unlike the bowl-shaped Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) where calm winds and low temperatures lead to an accumulation of pollutants, Indore is a much windier place with an average wind speed of around 11kmph, which blows away a lot of pollution. Also, unlike the alluvial soil in IGP, the black soil in central India kicks up less dust,"" says Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board's air laboratory division.""Pristine air quality remains one of our focus areas. We are advocating large-scale plantation and utilising machinery to sweep roads to minimise dust. To curtail vehicular emissions, we are augmenting our public transport fleet with electric and CNG vehicles,"" says Indore divisional commissioner Deepak Singh.If implemented well, these measures should make a dent in the city's PM levels. However, to bring pollution down to India's safe standards - 60 μg/m3 annually for PM10 and 40 μg/m3 for PM2.5 - Indore will have to do much more. A good place to begin would be data. The city recently increased the number of its air pollution monitors to seven. However, an analysis by Urban Emissions shows that the agglomeration of Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Mhow and Pitampura needs a minimum of 26 monitors for particulate matter alone.Only through granular data can Indore zero in on zones of high pollution to reach the level of sanitation in the air that the city seems to have achieved on the ground.",Indore has worn the crown of India's 'cleanest city' in government's Swachh rankings for seven straight years. The largest city in Madhya Pradesh has seen a 21% rise in levels of the pollutant PM10 between 2017-18 and 2023-24.

Atul, 34, left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video alleging harassment from his wife and in-laws amid a contentious legal battle over divorce and child custody in a Jaunpur family court in UP.Also read: Judge laughed when estranged wife told Bengaluru techie Atul to commit suicide Responding to the allegations, Nikita's paternal uncle Sushil Singhania said in Jaunpur: ""Neither I nor any family member was present at the scene. The claims made in the video will be addressed by Nikita shortly."" He said the family had no contact with Atul in the past three years and expressed trust in the judiciary. ""We are not guilty, and we trust the court to deliver a fair judgment.""A complaint filed by Atul's brother Bikas Kumar accused Nikita and her family of demanding Rs 3 crore to withdraw police cases and Rs 30 lakh to grant visitation rights for Atul to see his four-year-old son.In the video, Atul is seen wearing a board around his neck that read ""Justice is Due"". Nikita's lawyer Vinod Srivastava defended the court's handling of the divorce and child custody case, stating that judicial officer Rita Kaushik acted within legal bounds. The civil court of Jaunpur ruled on the matter in July 2024, setting specific alimony for the couple's son.Also read: 'Justice is due': Two sides in Bengaluru techie death Nikita had filed an FIR on April 24, 2022, at Jaunpur Kotwali, accusing Atul, his parents Anju Devi and Pawan Modi, and younger brother Bikas ofdowry harassment and violations under the Dowry Prohibition Act.The FIR alleged that after their marriage on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi, Atul's family demanded a dowry of Rs 10 lakh. It also claimed that on Aug 16, 2019, Atul's parents again demanded Rs 10 lakh, leading to Nikita's father's sudden death the next day.On May 17, 2021, Nikita accused Atul of assaulting her and her mother before returning to her parental home.In his suicide note, Atul refuted the allegations, stating that he and Nikita met through a matrimonial site and that she lived with her in-laws in Bihar's Samastipur for only two days before moving to Bengaluru. He also denied any link between the dowry demand and her father's death, asserting that he had long been ill and was treated at AIIMS Delhi before passing away in a local hospital.Meanwhile, in a late-night development, the residence of Nikita in Khoya Mandi area of Jaunpur was found locked late Wednesday night.Neighbours informed reporters that the family might have fled fearing action by the Bengaluru police.Earlier in the evening, Nikita's brother and mother were reportedly seen at the house but refrained from speaking to journalists.","Atul, 34, left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video alleging harassment from his wife and in-laws.

When I go to attend international conferences where there is a discussion on road accidents, I try to hide my face.”Gadkari’s admission came during the Question Hour, where he also stressed the need for significant changes in human behavior, societal attitudes, and respect for the rule of law to improve road safety. Sharing a personal anecdote, the minister recounted a major accident involving him and his family several years ago, which required prolonged hospitalization.“By the grace of God, I and my family were saved. So I have my personal experience of accidents,” he said.Highlighting key factors contributing to road mishaps, Gadkari pointed to improper parking of trucks and lack of lane discipline as major issues. He noted that many accidents are caused by trucks parked haphazardly on roads. To address safety concerns, he announced directives for adopting international standards in bus body design, including equipping buses with hammers near windows for emergency escapes during accidents.The minister painted a grim picture of road safety in India, revealing that road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.Among states, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of fatalities, with over 23,000 deaths accounting for 13.7% of total road accident deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu (18,000 deaths, or 10.6%), Maharashtra (15,000 deaths, or 9%), and Madhya Pradesh (13,000 deaths, or 8%).In terms of cities, Delhi led the tally with over 1,400 deaths, followed by Bengaluru (915 deaths) and Jaipur (850 deaths).","Road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.

Man flies down from Kuwait to kill daughter's molester,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-flies-down-from-kuwait-to-kill-daughters-molester/articleshow/116265436.cms,"Representative image

TIRUPATI: An enraged father flew down from Kuwait and murdered a man, who allegedly molested his 12-year-old daughter. He released a selfie video from Kuwait on Thursday confessing to the murder.The alleged killer, who works as a labourer in Kuwait, came down to his native village near Obulavaripalli of Annamayya district in Andhra Pradesh and allegedly stabbed his daughter's molester with a knife on Dec 7, killing him on the spot. He later flew back to Kuwait.In the video, the man said that both his wife and he work in Kuwait. They had left their minor daughter with his sister-in-law and her husband. He alleged that while everything was fine in the beginning, recently his sister-in-law's father-in-law molested his daughter.""When my daughter resisted, he tried to gag her but somehow she managed to raise an alarm and my wife's sister rushed to the room and saved her,"" the NRI said in the video. Although the family allegedly threatened the girl and tried to hush up the matter, the girl shared her ordeal with her mother during a recent visit.""My wife and I first decided not to take the law into our own hands,"" he added in the video. ""I asked my wife to go to police station and she lodged a complaint. Police summoned the molester and my wife's sister and merely reprimanded them without taking action,"" he alleged.""When my wife once again went to the police station and complained about the man and his family, the police did not react and instead threatened to file a case against my wife,"" he claimed. He said he wanted to fight legally against the accused, but police inaction forced him to take the law into his hands. In the video he expressed a willingness to surrender.Police sub-inspector P Mahesh refuted the allegation and stated that no complaint was lodged by the girl's mother. ""The girl's mother and her sister have family disputes,"" the officer claimed. ""There is a criminal conspiracy behind the murder and apart from the girl's father, his other family are also involved in the murder. We will soon bring to light all the facts.""The SI alleged that the girl's father was trying to mislead people by releasing the video. ""If he intended to surrender, why did he return to Kuwait?"" he asked.","The alleged killer, who works as a labourer in Kuwait, came down to his native village near Obulavaripalli of Annamayya district in Andhra Pradesh.

VARANASI/BENGALURU: A Bengaluru police team reached UP's Jaunpur Thursday looking for the Singhania family accused of abetting the suicide of Subhash Atul , a senior AI executive at a leading automobile firm. But police met with little success as their houses were locked and phones switched off.Jaunpur Kotwali inspector Mithilesh Kumar Mishra said Atul's mother-in-law Nisha and her son Anurag had left their house on a motorbike Wednesday night. When some reporters camping there asked where they were going, Anurag replied his mother was unwell.According to neighbours, the Singhania family had moved in two months ago. Police have launched a manhunt and pasted a notice on the entrance of the house, asking residents to appear before the IO .""We are in constant touch with local police, and they are working with us to trace the suspects,"" DCP Shivakumar Gunare of Bengaluru police said.Atul, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday amid a prolonged legal battle involving divorce, child custody, and a Rs 3.3 crore demand from his estranged wife Nikita Singhania. According to the FIR filed by Atul's brother Bikas, his estranged wife and her family allegedly demanded Rs 3 crore to drop police cases and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to see his four-year-old son. Bengaluru police registered a case against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.His lawyer Dinesh Mishra said Thursday Atul was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000 and the family court in Jaunpur had ordered him in July to pay Rs 40,000 a month as maintenance for his son, which he might have found burdensome.Atul left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video detailing alleged harassment by Nikita and his in-laws, and accused the family court judge of bias. However, his lawyer Mishra said the orders passed by the court were in accordance with the law.""The court did not mandate any compensation for his wife, as she was earning a sufficient income in Delhi. Atul might have found the Rs 40,000 payment steep. He had the option to challenge the order by appealing to higher courts, including HC,"" Mishra said.According to the lawyer, Atul never demonstrated violent behaviour or mood swings while appearing before family court. ""I suspect his wife and others might have demanded more money from him, forcing him to think they were blackmailing or extorting him."" Atul and Nikita met through a matrimonial site and got married on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi.

He has toured CRPF forward operating bases on more than one occasion, to keep the morale of counter-Naxal forces high and get a first-hand feel of how they secure the area around a camp, while facilitating an administration and development push in adjoining villages.On Sunday he will honour the Chhattisgarh police by awarding it the 'President's Colour' at the Police Parade Ground in Raipur.

He was subsequently arrested and booked under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt using dangerous weapons, and endangering public safety.The police, in court, stressed the need to determine if the accused intended to commit the crime and whether a conspiracy was involved. They also highlighted the necessity to investigate More’s qualifications, including his training to operate electric buses and whether he was under the influence of narcotics.Opposing the remand plea, More’s lawyer, Samadhan Sulane, argued that the accident could have resulted from a ""technical fault"" in the bus and emphasized the administration’s responsibility to ensure the vehicle’s roadworthiness.According to police, More had no prior experience driving electric vehicles and had undergone only a ten-day training before starting to operate BEST’s electric buses from December 1.Initial interrogation revealed More was mentally alert, and primary medical reports indicated he was not under the influence of alcohol.The ill-fated 12-metre-long bus, manufactured by Hyderabad-based Olectra Greentech, is under examination by forensic experts and transport officers to rule out mechanical failure as a cause of the accident.The injured are receiving treatment at various municipal hospitals, with some in critical condition. Meanwhile, BEST has formed a committee led by Chief Manager (Transport) Ramesh Madavi to probe the incident.BEST officials reported that the bus’s speed accelerated uncontrollably during the accident. The vehicle was removed from the scene early Tuesday and taken to the Kurla depot for further inspection.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis expressed sorrow over the tragedy, announcing Rs 5 lakh compensation for the deceased's kin and coverage of medical expenses for the injured by BMC and BEST. ""We stand with the families of those who lost their lives in this unfortunate incident.

NEW DELHI: While putting a freeze on the spate of lawsuits for reclamation of temples allegedly converted to mosques during the Mughal era while it hears the validity of the Places of Worship Act , 1991, Supreme Court said on Thursday, ""The primary issue which arises for consideration is Sections 3 and 4 of the 1991 Act, their contours as well as their width and expanse. As the matter is sub judice before the court, we deem it appropriate to direct that though fresh suits (raising mosque-temple disputes) can be filed, no suit will be registered and proceedings undertaken (by trial courts) till further orders of the SC."" ""Further, we also direct that in pending suits, trial courts will not pass any effective and final order, including orders for survey, till the next date of hearing,"" the bench said in its omnibus status quo order.The ruling, which was at odds with the refusal last year of a bench led by then CJI D Y Chandrachud to impose a prohibition on suits, drew vociferous opposition from senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi, Maninder Singh, Vijay Hansaria and Vikas Singh, who said the court could not pass such a blanket order without hearing the Hindu parties. Advocate Sai Deepak said for implementation of the 1991 Act, surveys were mandatory to determine the religious character of disputed structures on Aug 15, 1947.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said: ""When suits between two parties were pending in different trial courts, was it judicially permissible for a third unrelated party (Muslim organisations and petitioners) to come before the SC and seek a stay on those proceedings?"" There are 18 suits pending before various trial courts raising reclamation of temple demand for 11 mosques. SC brushed aside the objections and asked when the core issue regarding Places of Worship Act was pending consideration before the highest court, would it not be proper for trial courts to hold their hands? ""When the matter is pending in SC, will it be just and fair for any other court to deal with the subject matter and examine it? We are examining both the validity and ambit of the Act,"" it said. Justice Viswanathan gave a glimpse of court's mind on the conflicting stands of the two sides when he said, ""There is a larger question. The suits which are pending must be stayed as Section 3 of the 1991 Act is to be adjudicated by the SC.""""One view is that Section 3 is an effective manifestation or the reiteration of already embedded constitutional principles, so much so that even without the Act, if a suit were to be objected on the ground of plain constitutional principles, it is subject to interim orders from the court. Since the issue is pending in SC, civil courts cannot run a race with the SC. It is as simple as this."" SC had issued notice to the Centre on advocate-petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay's 2020 petition on March 12, 2021 and onJamiat Ulama-i-Hind 's petition on Sept 9, 2022. On Thursday, it found the Union govt had not filed its response till date. The CJI Khanna-led bench told the SG that Centre must file a response to the cross-petitions in four weeks. It appointed three nodal counsel - Ejaz Maqbool, Kanu Agarwal and Vishnu Shankar Jain - to coordinate and compile responses of both sides and the Centre.""The Centre's reply must come on record. We require your response, and we cannot hear these petitions without the Union govt's stand. The questions framed by the SC on Oct 12, 2022 will give you a fair idea to frame your response,"" the bench said. The matter was posted for hearing on Feb 17, 2025.PILs by the Hindu side have questioned the validity of the 1991 Act on grounds that Parliament did not have the competence to apply the law retrospectively and freeze status of religious structure as existing on Aug 15, 1947 when mosques were constructed over thousands of razed temples. The Muslim side argued history could not be changed through court orders and sought strict implementation of the Act, which had carved out an exception for the suits pending on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute.A five-judge bench on Nov 9, 2019 had awarded the disputed site for construction of Ram temple, but had ruled that the 1991 Act was an ""affirmation of solemn duty which was cast upon the state to preserve and protect the equality of faiths as an essential constitutional value, a norm which has the status of being a basic feature of the Constitution. In preserving the character of places of public worship, Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the future"".

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has held that mere allegation of harassment cannot be a ground to slap a charge for abetment to commit suicide if it is not established that the accused instigated or pushed the deceased to take the fatal step.The observations came from a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and P B Varale while delivering a verdict on an appeal challenging a Gujarat HC order refusing to discharge a woman's husband and her in-laws for allegedly harassing her and driving her to suicide. The observations gain significance in the wake of the recent suicide of 34-year-old techie Atul Subhash, who alleged harassment at the hands of his estranged wife and her family.""...The prosecution must demonstrate an active or direct action by the accused that led the deceased to take his/her own life. The element of mens rea cannot simply be presumed or inferred; it must be evident and explicitly discernible. Without this, the foundational requirement for establishing abetment under the law is not satisfied, underscoring the necessity of a deliberate and conspicuous intent to provoke or contribute to the act of suicide,"" said the bench.The court said that to secure a conviction under Section 306, it is necessary to establish a clear mens rea to instigate or push the deceased to commit suicide, which requires a specific act, omission, creation of circumstances, or words that would incite or provoke another person to take his/her own life.""The act of abetment must be explicitly demonstrated through actions or behaviours of the accused that directly contributed to the victim's decision to take his/her own life. Harassment, in itself, does not suffice unless it is accompanied by deliberate acts of incitement or facilitation.""...The court examines whether the accused's conduct, including provoking, urging, or tarnishing the victim's self-esteem, created an unbearable situation. If the accused's actions were intended only to harass or express anger, they might not meet the threshold for abatement or investigation,"" it said.","The observations came from a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and P B Varale.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash’s mother-in-law and brother-in-law, who have been named by Atul’s brother in the FIR, have reportedly fled their residence in Uttar Pradesh's Jaunpur district.Nisha Singhania and her son, Anurag alias Piyush Singhania, left their home in Jaunpur’s Khowa Mandi area on a motorcycle around 1 am on Thursday and have not returned, a police official told PTI.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Police confirmed on Thursday that they had not received any official communication from Karnataka authorities regarding the case.“We are yet to receive any official communication from the Bengaluru Police over this case,” Jaunpur Superintendent of Police Ajaypal Sharma said. He added that police deployment in the area remains routine, with no special orders regarding the accused.Inspector Mithilesh Mishra, in charge of the Kotwali police station, confirmed that no directives had been issued to arrest Nisha Singhania, prevent her from leaving her home, or place her under house arrest.Subhash, 34, cited alleged harassment by his estranged wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family as the reason behind his suicide in his 24-page suicide note and video.Subhash’s brother, Bikas Kumar, filed an FIR naming Subhash’s wife Nikita, her mother Nisha, her brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania. The charges include abetment to suicide and joint criminal liability.According to the complaint, the accused demanded Rs 3 crore to settle ongoing legal cases and an additional Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to Subhash’s four-year-old son. The FIR alleges years of harassment and exploitation by Nikita and her family, which Bikas claims pushed Subhash to take his own life.Subhash left behind a chilling 24-page suicide note detailing the relentless harassment he faced. He accused his wife and in-laws of false legal accusations and described bias in the family court in Jaunpur, alleging that bribes were taken in the judge’s presence. The note said, “Justice is Due,” and included a request that his ashes not be immersed until justice was served.","Nisha Singhania and her son, Anurag alias Piyush Singhania, left their home in Jaunpur’s Khowa Mandi area on a motorcycle around 1 am on Thursday.

RANCHI: Jharkhand high court has stayed the implementation of a law brought by the JMM-led govt in its previous term, requiring private companies operating in the state to reserve 75% of jobs for local candidates .A division bench of Chief Justice M S Ramchandra Rao and Justice Deepak Roushan issued the order Wednesday on a petition by Jharkhand Small Scale Industries Association (JSSIA), challenging the reservation clauses in the Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates in Private Sector Act, 2021.Last year, Punjab and Haryana HC quashed a 2020 law that sought to reserve 75% of jobs in private companies with gross pay of up to Rs 30,000 a month for natives of Haryana.JMM said the Hemant Soren govt would appeal the stay in a higher court.The Act specifies that 75% of vacancies in private companies must be reserved for candidates with domicile certificates from Jharkhand.JSSIA argued that the legislation violates constitutional principles guaranteeing equality in employment by distinguishing between citizens living in the state and outside. The counsel for JSSIA contended that the state govt could not direct private companies to employ only a certain category of people.The bench ordered the state govt to file its response and scheduled the next hearing for March 20.Legislator and JMM chief whip Mathura Prasad Mahto said, ""This was part of the Hemant Soren govt's plan to boost employment among locals. I don't want to comment on what the court said, but we will challenge it, if needed.""Congress MLA and minister Shilpi Neha Tirkey said people needed to acknowledge ""the good intentions of the govt behind bringing this law"".",Jharkhand high court stays implementation of a law brought by the JMM-led govt in its previous term.

BJP & allies back ONOE bills, say vital to cut costs, synchronise vibrant democracy

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at streamlining India's electoral process, the Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the ""one nation, one election"" bills, with plans to introduce these during the current session of Parliament.The decision to clear two bills marks a significant step towards synchronising polls for Lok Sabha, state legislative assemblies and local bodies as part of a plan to unburden the executive from the weight of periodic elections and improve decision-making across all tiers of governance.The cabinet nod is to draft legislations to hold simultaneous polls to Lok Sabha and state assemblies. But whether it will turn into the stride to restore the simultaneous elections, which remained in vogue until the Lok Sabha elections and assembly polls were decoupled between 1967 and 1971, remains to be seen.The proposal has been under discussion for years as the idea was to revert to the pre-1967 state when one election was conducted. A panel led by former president Ram Nath Kovind had found that in Maharashtra, almost six months of a particular year were spent in poll-related matters due to multiple elections.While the first bill, which aims at holding simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and state assemblies, will need to be approved by Parliament, the one for local bodies will need the endorsement of at least half the states.BJP and its allies voiced strong support for proposed legislations on the ' one nation one election ' plan, drafted after extensive consultations with political parties and experts and a high-level panel studying electoral processes in seven countries.BJP described the legislations as essential for synchronising India's vibrant democracy with effective cost management and ensuring policy continuity. JD(U) has backed the bill, with party chief Nitish Kumar firmly in support of simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and assemblies.""The proposed bill will strengthen the country's democracy and is set to be instrumental in making India a developed nation,"" BJP's chief spokesperson and Lok Sabha MP Anil Baluni said. He added the bill was drafted with inputs from independent constitutional and legal bodies and did not infringe upon the basic structure of the Constitution. JD(U) working president Sanjay Jha said, ""Our party welcomes this. We communicated our support to the committee, where I was part of the delegation. Nitish Kumar has consistently advocated simultaneous elections. The constant election cycle disrupts public and developmental work.""Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan endorsed the move and highlighted its benefits, especially in fostering development.In Sept, the Cabinet had endorsed the proposal for simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha, assemblies, urban bodies and panchayats within a 100-day window, based on the recommendations of the Ram Nath Kovind committee.During the consultation, 32 political parties supported the concept, while 15 opposed it. Among national parties, Congress, AAP, BSP and CPM were against it, while BJP and NPP favoured it. Notable state parties opposing it included AIUDF, Trinamool Congress, AIMIM, CPI, DMK, SP. Supporting state parties included AIADMK, All Jharkhand Students Union, AGP, BJD, LJP (R), and Shiv SenaJD(U), SAD . Several parties did not respond, including BRS, NCP, RJD, TDP and YSRCP.The committee had reviewed election systems in countries like South Africa, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines. On Wednesday, former President Kovind stressed the need for a consensus and said, ""This initiative transcends political interests for the welfare of the nation. Economists suggest that implementing one nation one election could increase the country's GDP by 1-1.5%.""","BJP & allies back ONOE bills, say vital to cut costs, synchronise vibrant democracy.

NEW DELHI: Does shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' inside a mosque hurt religious sentiments of Muslims? Supreme Court on Friday will hear a petition challenging a Karnataka HC decision which quashed criminal proceedings against miscreants who raised the slogan inside a mosque on the ground that it did not hurt religious sentiments.A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta will hear the petition by Haydhar Ali, filed through advocate Javedur Rehman, who has challenged the HC's Sept 13 verdict quashing the entire criminal proceedings before a Puttur court in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka even before the police completed its investigation.It was alleged that on Sept 24, 2023, some miscreants entered the Badriya Juma Masjid at Aithoor village and started shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans, followed by threats that Muslims would not be allowed to live in peace. The petitioner had lodged a complaint with police leading to the arrest of two persons, who were later granted bail.HC had stayed the proceedings before the trial court on Nov 29 last year on the plea of the accused seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings and granted the relief on Sep 13 this year. The petitioner said HC erred in quashing the proceedings as the investigation had not been completed by police for the full range of evidence to come before the court. It said trespass was a defined criminal offence.Raising of the 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans inside a mosque could be categorised as statements likely to cause communal trouble, which too is a defined offence as per the country's laws, it added.""The fact that such an incident took place inside a mosque, coupled with the threat to the lives of Muslims, HC should have allowed police to complete the investigation into the matter without first passing an interim order,"" the petitioner said.","Supreme Court will hear a petition challenging a Karnataka HC decision which quashed criminal proceedings against miscreants who raised the slogan inside a mosque.

'Invitation to Patkar our main objection': BJP

'Never experienced anything like this': Medha Patkar

NEW DELHI: Objecting to the presence of social activist Medha Patkar , BJP MPs, including former Union minister Parshottam Rupala, stormed out of a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday, prompting the committee head to end the session.Some of the BJP MPs called Patkar an ""anti-national,"" and one wondered if the ""prime minister of Pakistan"" could also be called at such a meeting. She has long been accused by the ruling party of ""working against the country's development interests in the name of public and environmental causes.""The Standing Committee on Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, headed by Congress' Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka, had invited Patkar to present her views on the implementation and effectiveness of the land acquisition law enacted by Parliament when the Congress-led UPA government was in power in 2013.Defending his decide to invite Patkar, Ulaka told news agency PTI that as a standard practice, parliamentary panels hear civil society members and other stakeholders on various issues.He added, ""We wanted to hear their views on the land acquisition law. We wanted an opinion from everyone, but they (BJP) didn't allow it.""On his decision to cancel the session, the Congress parliamentarian stated that this was done as there was a lack of quorum.""As per rule, a quorum of 10 members is required. When the BJP MPs walked out, there was no quorum, and the meeting ended,"" Ulaka explained.A BJP member said their primary objection was to calling Patkar, who was the face of the 'Narmada Bachao Andolan' protest against a determined push by the Gujarat government, headed by the then-chief minister Narendra Modi, to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.The Gujarat government finally prevailed, and Modi, who later took over as prime minister in 2014, has often spoken about the efforts to stall the project since its foundation was laid in the 1960s.According to a source, those invited before the panel included officials from the environment and forest ministry. Activists, including Patkar and actor Prakash Raj - he is a vocal BJP critic - were also asked to appear before the committee.When the meeting started, opposition members were of the opinion that Patkar should be heard. However, the saffron party did not agree.Asked about the incident, Patkar replied she was invited to appear before the panel, and while she and others were waiting, they saw some MPs leave.Later, they were informed that the meeting had ended, she added, and noted that she has appeared before parliamentary committees earlier as well.""I have never experienced anything like this before. It is important to talk about the land acquisition law,"" Patkar said.","BJP MPs stormed out of a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday, prompting the committee head to end the session.

"'Affordable, accessible and approachable': Amit Shah unveils new criminal laws; a major reform for justice in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/affordable-accessible-and-approachable-amit-shah-unveils-new-criminal-laws-a-major-reform-for-justice-in-india/articleshow/122195385.cms,"File Image

NEW DELHI: Stating that the new criminal laws shall be regarded as the biggest reform since Independence, home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said they will shift the people’s mindset from “what will happen if I file an FIR’ to a strong belief that ‘filing an FIR will lead to prompt justice”.Addressing the programme ‘A Golden Year of Trust in the Justice System’ here to mark the successful completion of one year of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA), Shah said new laws introduced by the Narendra Modi will not only make the judicial process “affordable, accessible and approachable” but also “simple, consistent and transparent”.“There can be no greater reform than making the justice system - which protects the rights of the people - transparent, citizen-centric, and time-bound,” Shah said during the event also attended by Delhi LG V K Saxena and chief minister Rekha Gupta.The home minister said the new criminal laws will be fully implemented across the country in nearly three years, while sharing that 23 states and Union territories have already completed 100% capacity building.He complimented Delhi for doing the best, among all states/UTs, to implement the laws expeditiously.Shah, who until now has taken 160 meetings on the new laws, shared that notifications have already been issued for e-Sakshya (electronic evidence) and e-Summons (electronic summons) in 11 states and Union territories (UTs). Nyaya Shruti (electronic court records) has been notified in six states/UTs, and community service as punishment in a dozen states/UTs, he added.In the past year, nearly 14.8 lakh police personnel, 42,000 prison staff, over 19,000 judicial officers, and more than 11,000 public prosecutors were trained in provisions of the new laws.“A golden era of governance based on social, economic, and political justice is about to begin,” Shah said and added that “after the full implementation of these laws, justice in the country will be delivered all the way up to the Supreme Court starting from filing of the FIR, within three years. He explained that BNS, BNSS and BSA lay down strict timelines for the three key pillars responsible for delivering justice to citizens—the police, prosecution, and judiciary.Mentioning the smart use of technology for accurate and speedy criminal justice, the home minister expressed confidence that offenders will be left with no opportunity to escape punishment by availing the benefit of doubt. He said this will raise the conviction rate and make the Indian criminal justice system one of the most modern in the world.Shah said that while the purpose of the old laws was to extend British rule and protect their property, the new laws are focused on protecting the life, property, and all constitutionally guaranteed rights of Indian citizens, with the goal being justice and not punishment.The home minister said the new laws add a separate chapter on crimes against children and women. For the first time, terrorism and organised crime have been defined and provision made for stringent punishment, he underlined.","The home minister said the new criminal laws will be fully implemented across the country in nearly three years. 23 states and Union territories have already completed 100% capacity building. Nearly 14.8 lakh police personnel, 42,000 prison staff, over 19,000 judicial officers, and more than 11,000 public prosecutors were trained in provisions of the new laws.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122195667,imgsize-35686,width-400,resizemode-4/122195667.jpg"

"‘In principle’ nod for J&K hydro power project, dam construction to harness Chenab’s potential",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nod-to-divert-forest-land-for-jk-hydel-unit/articleshow/122193994.cms,"NEW DELHI: Acting on the urgency to speed up projects of strategic significance, an environment ministry panel has given “in-principle” approval for diversion of over 847 hectares of reserved forest and ‘jungle-jhari’ land for construction of the ambitious 1,856-MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project in Ramban district of Jammu & Kashmir. Certain key green provisions were set aside for the purpose, keeping in view national interests.Though the final approval will be subject to grant of environment clearance for the project by the UT govt, the move shows the intent to swiftly take up the dam’s construction for leveraging Chenab river’s potential following suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).The Sawalkot hydroelectric project (HEP) is a major hydropower initiative, intended to harness the potential of the Chenab — one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum whose waters currently flow unchecked to Pakistan despite India’s right to use it for non-consumptive purposes, including hydro-power generation.Minutes of the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee meeting, made public this week, show that while giving its approval on June 24, it took note of the Union home ministry’s June 12 plea arguing that conducting cumulative impact assessment (CIA) and carrying capacity studies (CCS) on the Chenab before giving clearance at this juncture “may risk exposure of sensitive hydrological data, which could be exploited by the downstream neighbouring country”.A day before the home ministry’s note to the advisory committee, the power ministry too on June 11 sought granting exemption from CIA and CCS for the Sawalkot HEP for facilitating its expeditious implementation. It argued how conducting CIA and CCS - prerequisite for grant of ‘in-principle’ approval - may leak sensitive hydrological and environmental data, thereby compromising national interests.Earlier, the UT government submitted a similar reply, saying the river Chenab is falling in the Indus Water Treaty and therefore the data of the studies cannot be published due to security reasons.The CIA of a river basin would reflect the cumulative impact of commissioned/ upcoming hydro-power projects on environmental flow, bio-diversity, muck disposal sites and traffic flow in the region etc. whereas the CCS is important to plan optimal number of power projects in a basin.As per the “in-principle” approval of the advisory committee, the forest diversion for the Sawalkot HEP will take place in Udhampur, Reasi and Ramban districts subject to certain specific conditions including dam safety plan, soil and moisture conservation, and the green nod from the UT government.","An environment ministry panel has given “in-principle” approval for diversion of over 847 hectares of reserved forest and ‘jungle-jhari’ land for construction of the ambitious 1,856-MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project in Ramban district of Jammu & Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Boosting his chances of securing premature release, Delhi high court Tuesday noted ""demonstrable indicators of reformation"" in Santosh Kumar Singh , convicted in the 1996 rape and murder case of DU law student Priyadarshini Mattoo.Deciding a batch of petitions by murder convicts, including Singh, challenging the rejection of their plea for remission, HC asked the Sentence Review Board (SRB) to consider their applications afresh in next four months.Justice Sanjeev Narula outlined ""an element of reformation"" in Singh and underlined that the nature of the original crime cannot, by itself, be the sole ground for denying premature release.Specifically, in Singh's case, the high court disapproved of SRB's comments that his conduct in jail is not necessarily a barometer of what he may do outside prison.""In the present batch of cases, despite a prima facie reformative conduct and intent exhibited by the convicts, correlation to such material considerations is conspicuously absent,"" the court observed, faulting the SRB for rejecting the plea by Singh and others only due to the gravity, cruelty and perversity of the crime, and the objections raised by police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The court found the argument that jail behaviour wasn't an indicator of a person's reformation ""deeply problematic"".""While the heinousness of the offence and the views of investigating agencies are undoubtedly relevant, they cannot operate to the exclusion of other equally material considerations such as post-conviction conduct, demonstrated reform, educational and vocational achievements, and institutional assessment through placement in open prisons,"" the court noted.It pointed out that SRB made ""no effort"" to evaluate the petitioner's ""demonstrable reformative progress, including advanced educational qualifications, documented good conduct and participation in rehabilitation programmes.""Justice Narula also highlighted that Singh was at present lodged in an open prison, which entitles him to exit the prison complex daily between 8am and 8pm for gainful employment as a legal consultant.""As noted above, the placement in such a prison category is a reflection of the positive reformative conduct of the convict. This is a critical indicator of reform which the SRB has failed to even acknowledge, let alone evaluate,"" it observed.In an 82-page verdict, HC detected little indication the SRB ""undertook any nuanced or individualised assessment of the petitioners' present psychological stability and emotional rehabilitation, behavioural disposition, institutional conduct or potential for reintegration. The apparent lack of depth in these foundational reports undermines the deliberative exercise that SRB is expected to undertake. ""The court gave SRB three months to convene its next meeting to consider the plea of Singh and two other convicts.""In doing so, SRB shall ensure due application of mind to each case and make a reasoned decision within a period of four months from the date of this judgment,"" the high court specified, laying down in detail what each official involved in the process must do as per guidelines of the jail manual.It ordered the superintendent of the prison housing the convict to prepare a revised note with a clear recommendation and reflect the official's opinion about the prisoner's conduct, mental and physical health, participation in reformative activities and overall suitability for premature release.Next, a senior police officer of appropriate rank shall prepare a report assessing the convict's conduct, antecedents, present risk profile and community impact in a balanced and evidence-based manner.It further directed that the deputy commissioner of police/superintendent of police concerned must furnish a report as required under relevant rules. Where any objection to premature release is raised, it must be supported by cogent reasons, including any credible threat perception or risk of recidivism.""Mere reiteration of the gravity of the original offence shall not suffice,"" the high court said, adding that inputs from the district probation officer shall also be submitted afresh.""It must be a detailed and individualised inquiry into the desirability of the prisoner's release, addressing, on the basis of relevant material, the convict's family and social background, reintegration prospects, community acceptance and any demonstrated reformation of character or attitude,"" the court noted.It further laid down guidelines for SRB while considering remission pleas of convicts.

ITR: Your Financial Passport

(The author, Surabhi Marwah is Tax Partner, EY India. Ammu Sadanandhan, Director- Tax, EY India and Ojaswita Pathak, Tax Professional, EY India also contributed to the article.)

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26: As the timeline for filing Income-tax Returns (ITR) approaches (September 15th for this FY, after extension), individuals, particularly those whose income falls below the taxable threshold, as well as Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) who do not earn any income in India, often wonder whether they are required to file a tax return in India. The truth is, filing your return plays a crucial role in various aspects of your financial and legal life.A common misconception is - “If I don’t owe any tax, why should I file a tax return?” Let’s clarify a fundamental point – the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) requires individuals to file tax returns if their gross total income exceeds the basic exemption limit. For Financial Year (FY) 2024-25, the threshold under the old tax regime is INR 2.5 lakhs for individuals below 60 years of age (INR 3 lakhs for resident individuals aged between 60 and 80 years, and INR 5 lakhs for resident individuals aged above 80 years), and it is INR 3 lakhs under the new/concessional tax regime. This means that individuals whose income is not taxable on account of claiming the rebate are also required to file tax returns. However, this is just the starting point. There are many other situations where you must file an ITR even if you do not owe any tax or your income is below the exemption limit. This has been further explained below.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: How can taxpayers switch between old and new income tax regimes? Explained For example, Mr. A, earned INR 2.4 lakhs in FY 2024–25, primarily from pension and fixed deposits in the bank.Despite being below the exemption limit, his bank deducted INR 6,000 as TDS on interest from fixed deposits. Filing an ITR is his only way to claim a refund of this deducted tax.One key reason to file your ITR, even if you have no taxable income, is the ability to carry forward capital losses for future tax benefits. It is however imperative to note that carry forward of losses from house property are not allowed under the new tax regime.Imagine you incurred a loss from sale of shares during FY 2024-25. If you do not file your ITR on time, those losses cannot be carried forward to offset future capital gains. Filing your return ensures these losses are offset with future capital gains, making a bad investment year potentially work in your favour later.Another crucial reason to file returns, even with low or no income, is the requirement for foreign asset disclosure for individuals qualifying as Resident and Ordinarily Residents (ROR) in India Such individuals must report their overseas assets under Schedule FA of the ITR forms. Foreign assets such as bank accounts, financial interests, ESOPs allotted under the employer’s overseas stock incentive scheme, immovable property are to be reported regardless of the income levels. Failure to do so can lead to penalties under the Black Money Act, 2015 and, even prosecution in some cases.Also Read | ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: What is the benefit of pre-filled ITR forms on the income tax portal? Top points For example, Mr. A and his spouse are joint owners of a foreign property. In this case, both must report the asset in their respective ITRs. This joint ownership requires careful attention to ensure compliance, as failure to report can attract scrutiny from tax authorities.In recent years, global information sharing has increased under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). ROR receiving foreign remittances or holding foreign assets must ensure compliance with tax regulations. Skipping the filing of ITR to avoid FA reporting is not only risky but can also be questioned. Tax authorities are now equipped with automatic exchange of information mechanisms that provide them with insights into foreign transactions/ foreign assets, leading to notices and requests for information. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to file their ITRs accurately and on time to avoid penalties and ensure compliance.The Act specifies various criteria for mandatory tax return filing. Here are some of the scenarios that require individuals to file ITR, irrespective of their income levels:If you meet any of these criteria, even if your income is below the exemption limit, you are required to file your return.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted? Explained In today’s world, ITRs have become essential documents beyond tax compliance. Financial institutions, embassies, and even landlords view your return as a testament to your credibility.If you plan to apply for a visa, especially to countries like the US, UK, Schengen nations, or Canada, you will often need to submit ITRs for the past 2-3 FYs. Not having an ITR could lead to delays or denials. Similarly, loan applications, whether for a home or car, are often assessed based on the income reported in ITRs, even if your bank statements look good.For example, Priya, a freelancer, earned INR 2 lakhs in FY 2024-25. She did not file an ITR, thinking it was not necessary. Later, while applying for a Schengen visa, her application was delayed because she could not submit ITRs from the last two FYs, something consulates often expect, even without taxable income.Also Read | Income Tax Return: What is Form 16? Top things taxpayers should check in this document before filing ITR In conclusion, filing an ITR is more than just a tax obligation; it is a way to establish your financial presence, ensure transparency, claim rightful refunds, and meet compliance requirements in an interconnected world. Whether you are a pensioner with TDS, salaried individual with foreign shares received under an overseas ESOP plan, a student with overseas accounts, or a homemaker planning international travel, your tax return can speak volumes when other documents cannot. Hence, it is essential that you evaluate your situation holistically to determine whether there is a requirement to file a tax return or not.","A common misconception is - “If I don’t owe any tax, why should I file a tax return?” The truth is, filing your return plays a crucial role in various aspects of your financial and legal life. One key reason to file your ITR, even if you have no taxable income, is the ability to carry forward capital losses for future tax benefits. Filing your return ensures these losses are offset with future capital gains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122176804,imgsize-52098,width-400,resizemode-4/122176804.jpg"

MOHALI: Trouble mounted for dismissed Punjab police DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu as in a fresh development, the vigilance bureau registered a case against him and his mother Sukhwant Kaur for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.The action stems from a wider probe linked to the controversial interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi recorded while he was in custody of Punjab police.According to vigilance officials, DSP Gursher Singh earned approximately Rs 26 lakh over three years, but investigations revealed that he spent around Rs 2.59 crore in the same period — an amount nearly 10 times his official income.The case was registered by the flying squad of Mohali, and multiple raids are underway to apprehend him. However, sources in vigilance bureau suspect that Gursher has fled abroad.This new case adds another layer to legal troubles of the former police officer, who was dismissed from service in Oct 2024 after being booked for fraud, forgery, and corruption. His pre-arrest bail plea was rejected in January this year by a local court, after which he went untraceable.Gursher, known as an ""encounter specialist"" during his tenure with Mohali Police, is facing serious allegations of extortion, land fraud, and abuse of official position.He is accused of buying disputed land parcels at throwaway prices and selling them at inflated rates, as well as filing false complaints through proxies to extort money from victims.One such victim approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, which subsequently ordered the registration of an FIR against him. The case includes charges under Sections 419, 465, 467, 468, and 471 of the IPC, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gursher is alleged to have played a key role in facilitating televised interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi at the CIA staff office in Kharar. At the time, Gursher was serving as DSP (investigation), Mohali, and was frequently stationed at CIA office in Kharar.The interview caused a political and public uproar, prompting intervention from the high court, which led to his dismissal from service and suspension of seven other police officials. The vigilance bureau has intensified its manhunt for Gursher and is expected to widen its probe into his financial transactions, real estate dealings, and possible overseas links.","DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu and his mother Sukhwant Kaur are accused of possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

On the hottest day in Wimbledon 's history, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare at the hands of 38-year-old Fabio Fognini. It was also a day of numerous seeds falling and history being created by British players.Temperatures at the All England Club topped 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit), surpassing the previous record of 29.3 Celsius set in 2001.Amid such conditions, Spain's Alcaraz had to dig deep for a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win over Italy's retiring Fognini in a gruelling clash that lasted four hours and 37 minutes on Centre Court.It was only the first time since Roger Federer narrowly beat Alejandro Falla in 2010 that a defending champion had been taken to a fifth set in the Wimbledon first round.During the match, the 22-year-old Alcaraz rushed to help a spectator who had collapsed in the stands, handing over a bottle of water as medics came to the woman's aid.At the end of the match, Alcaraz pointed to Fognini in appreciation of the Italian's effort. Fognini later revealed his son Federico, an Alcaraz fan, was banned from speaking to the five-time major champion - leaving the youngster angry. To make up for it, Fognini asked Alcaraz for his shirt after the match as a gift for his son.Top women's seed Aryna Sabalenka used ice packs to stay cool during her 6-1, 7-5 win over Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine on Court One.The 27-year-old Belarusian, a three-time Grand Slam champion, has experienced tough three-set defeats in this year's Australian Open and French Open finals.Despite her success, she has never advanced beyond the Wimbledon semi-finals and missed last year's tournament due to a shoulder injury.“I felt really great. I'm super grateful to be healthy, ready to compete, and to have gotten through the first round,” Sabalenka said. Next, she will face Czech player Marie Bouzkova, ranked 48th in the world.As for Branstine, a professional model who funds her tennis by posing for the camera, it was a challenging day out in the sun as well. She needed six hair ties, hairspray for the bun and it still wasn't enough. Absence of a scrunchie didn't help either.Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur was visibly upset and tears streamed down her face as she withdrew from her first-round match against Viktoriya Tomova.The Tunisian player was behind 7-6 (7/5), 2-0 when she decided to withdraw against the Bulgarian, who is ranked 111th in the world.Meanwhile, Daniil Medvedev, a former US Open champion and a semi-finalist at Wimbledon for the past two years, experienced a meltdown during his match against France's Benjamin Bonzi.Bonzi won 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2 after three hours and seven minutes. An angry Medvedev smashed his racket against his chair at the conclusion of the match.In other results, Holger Rune lost after squandering a two-set lead, falling to Chile’s Nicolas Jarry. Former finalist Matteo Berrettini was also knocked out, and Stefanos Tsitsipas retired due to injury.Additionally, former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko was defeated by Britain’s Sonay Kartal in three sets, 7-5, 2-6, 6-2.In all, 10 seeds fell on the opening day - seven among men (Medvedev, Rune, Berrettini, Tsitsipas, Tallon Griekspoor, Alexei Popyrin, Francisco Cerundolo) and three among women (Paula Badosa, Ostapenko, McCartney Kessler)For British tennis, it had already been a record-breaking Wimbledon before the gates even opened at SW19. Twenty-three British players entered the singles draws - the highest since 1984. And not since 1976 have there been 14 Britons in action on Day 1 of Wimbledon.By the time day one concluded, well semi-concluded due to the 11pm curfew, seven (Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Cameron Norrie, Billy Harris, Arthur Fery and Oliver Tarvet) had progressed to the second round - the most in a single day in the Open Era. The list includes Tarvet and Fery, ranked 733 and 461 in the world, respectively. The 21-year-old Tarvet pocketed £99,000 for his first round win, except he can't make more than £7,290 a year due to the financial rules.“But I’m not here for the money,” he said after joking he'd hire a private jet to fly to the US where he's a college student. “I’m here just for the experience and to stamp my mark on the ATP circuit. And I think I’ve done a good job so far.”American No. 1 Taylor Fritz expressed frustration, saying, “I couldn’t do anything,” after making a dramatic comeback on No. 1 Court on Monday night.In his first-round match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, Fritz led in points and committed fewer errors after two sets. However, he found himself two sets down, losing two tiebreaks to the Frenchman, who has one of the biggest serves in the sport—larger than Fritz’s.Despite the odds, Fritz fought back to win the next two sets, including a dramatic fourth-set tiebreak. Trailing 5-1 and two points from defeat, he rallied to win. Jubilantly, he pumped his chest toward his box, yelled “let’s f—ing go,” and sat down, riding the momentum toward what he believed would be a victorious finis. Or so he thought.However, after a lengthy discussion with a tournament official, play was halted due to Wimbledon’s curfew, set at 11pm local time — even though it was only 10:18 pm when the match was paused. “Then don’t ask me,” Fritz said as he packed up his rackets and sat back in his chair, telling his box he “couldn’t do anything.”The All England Club confirmed that the match was suspended because of the curfew, which was 42 minutes away at the time. Remarkably, the previous four sets between Fritz and Perricard lasted 44, 48, 33, and 45 minutes, respectively, meaning only one of those sets could have been completed within the remaining time.","Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare at the hands of Fabio Fognini.

70% dip in Indians caught trying to enter US illegally in Jan-May 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-dip-in-indians-caught-trying-to-enter-us-illegally-in-jan-may-2025/articleshow/122191308.cms,"Anticipating Trump's return, many syndicates paused ops from late 2024

AHMEDABAD: The number of Indians caught crossing illegally into the US in the first five months of 2025 fell a whopping 70% over the same span last year following Donald Trump's return as President and his take-no-prisoners immigration policies. The number fell from 34,535 in Jan-May 2024 - when President Joe Biden was in office - to 10,382 in the same period of 2025.Yet, the fact that 10,382 Indians risked life and limb to sneak in even as the route becomes more perilous indicates the desperation to chase the American dream remains just as fierce. The count included at least 30 unaccompanied minors, many from Gujarat. The numbers have been released by US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP).The sharp drop coincides with the Trump administration's renewed crackdown on illegal immigration, which allegedly disrupted long-standing smuggling networks that cater to hopeful migrants from Gujarat.US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) data shows a dramatic reversal in border encounters, with daily arrests of Indians dropping to around 69 from 230. Many of these syndicates paused their operations from late 2024, anticipating Trump's return.""The moment it became clear Trump would likely win again, routes started drying up,"" a source connected to a Gujarat-based human smuggling ring told TOI. ""People still want to go, but smugglers have either scaled back or raised costs, and the fear of stricter deportation is real. ""The broader impact is also visible in USCBP's overall data, which show the number of illegal immigrants (across all nationalities) apprehended dropped sharply over the same five-month period of 2025. Such arrests fell from 81,492 in Jan to 28,617 in Feb, 29,021 in March, 29,218 in April, and 29,502 in May.Yet for many Indians, especially from Gujarat, the dream of a better life across the border remains irresistible, and often fatal. On May 9, a boat carrying illegal migrants capsized near Del Mar, California, killing 14-year-old Prince and 10-year-old Mahi.Their parents, Brijesh and Sangita Patel, survived the wreck with grievous injuries. The deaths are not isolated. At least nine people from Gujarat are confirmed to have died while trying to cross the US border since Jan 2025.Of the at least 30 unaccompanied minors caught this year, agents said some were probably abandoned by adult companions during the perilous journey. In some cases, smugglers encouraged families to separate in hopes that minors would be treated more leniently under US immigration rules.According to officials, Gujarat continues to be one of the main sources of such illegal migration. ""Over the past decade, networks of agents have established overland routes through Central America,"" an official said.","The number fell from 34,535 in Jan-May 2024 - when President Joe Biden was in office - to 10,382 in the same period of 2025.

BENGALURU: Central Administrative Tribunal Tuesday quashed the suspension order of senior IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash and held Royal Challengers Bengaluru responsible for the ""unexpected congregation"" outside Chinnaswamy Stadium, which led to the death of 11 fans on June 4.CM Siddaramaiah said there's scope for appealing against the order, indicating the government would pursue legal options.Also read: Bengaluru stampede: Tribunal says police not 'Aladdin ka Chirag'; blames RCB for chaos Following the stampede and public outcry, state govt had on June 5 suspended Vikash (inspector general & additional commissioner of police, west, Bengaluru City) and four other officials, including Bengaluru (City) police commissioner B Dayananda.CAT, a quasi-judicial body that redresses officers' grievances, said govt passed the suspension order in ""a mechanical manner"" and added that police personnel were only human and not 'bhagwan' or 'magicians'The tribunal observed that due to RCB inviting people through social media posts, ""3 to 5 lakh people"" gathered outside the stadium, which has a capacity of 35,000. Prima facie, it appeared RCB was responsible for the gathering of lakhs of people without seeking permission or consent from police.

NEW DELHI: In a disturbing detail that has emerged from the gangrape case at South Calcutta Law College, police said CCTV footage confirmed that one of the accused, Zaib Ahmed, left the crime scene briefly to buy an inhaler for the victim. He went to a medical store to buy inhaler after she pleaded for relief from breathlessness during the alleged assault.According to investigators, the footage from a nearby medical shop showed Zaib purchasing the inhaler at the victim's request, following her deteriorating condition inside the security guard’s room where the assault took place on the evening of June 25.“The victim said she had begged for medical help after falling ill during the torture. The accused denied taking her to a hospital but did get her an inhaler from a pharmacy. She felt better temporarily, but the torture continued,” a senior officer told news agency PTI.The pharmacy owner told police that Zaib attempted to split the payment, partly in cash and partly through UPI, but eventually paid the full amount online. Investigators have documented the transaction and matched it with the time of the assault.Meanwhile, medical reports have revealed fresh nail scratch marks on the body of the prime accused, Monojit Mishra, indicating the victim put up resistance during the attack. “Such injuries are consistent with a struggle,” a police source told PTI.The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has uncovered that Monojit contacted the college's vice principal, Dr Nayna Chatterji, the morning after the incident. The two have since been questioned regarding their conversation.Investigators are also questioning 16 individuals, mostly students, seen in the college premises via CCTV footage after class hours on June 25. Six were interrogated on Tuesday.Kolkata police commissioner Manoj Verma confirmed that digital, circumstantial, and medical evidence gathered so far aligns with the victim’s official complaint. “The matter is extremely sensitive.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday told the US that it reserves the right to respond and defend itself against terrorism as well as pre-empt and deter any further cross-border attacks from Pakistan, days after President Donald Trump effusively praised Pakistan army chief Asim Munir while hosting him at the White House.In a 20-minute telephonic conversation with US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth, defence minister Rajnath Singh also made it clear that India's actions were ""measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and focused"" on disabling terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and POK when it launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, sources told TOI. While India believes Pakistan has become a safe haven for terrorists as internationally banned terrorists enjoy immunity there, Trump had praised both Munir as well as PM Modi as ""two very smart people"" for ending May 7-10 hostilities.Also read: Rajnath Singh speaks to US defence secretary Pete Hegseth; reviews defence ties, thanks US for anti-terror support Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir has continued with his rant against India, reaffirming Pakistan's commitment to providing support to the Kashmiri people for their ""legitimate struggle"".Singh, on his part, told Hegseth that India appreciates the unwavering support extended by the US for its fight against terrorism.""On defence cooperation, the two agreed to further build upon the momentum of this critical and mutually beneficial partnership across all its pillars such as interoperability, integration of defence industrial supply chains, logistics sharing, increased joint military exercises and cooperation with other like-minded partners,"" an official said.Also read: Quad meeting: Pahalgam terror attack was economic warfare, says Jaishankar; rules out yielding to nuclear blackmail Singh asked Hegseth to ensure faster deliveries of the long-delayed General Electric GE-F404 engines for the indigenous Tejas-Mark 1A fighters as well as the early conclusion of the agreement to jointly produce the more powerful GE-F414 engines in India.The defence minister also pushed for the delivery of the six Apache heavy-duty attack helicopters that the Indian Army had ordered in a Rs 5,691 crore deal in Feb 2020 but is yet to get.""The six Apaches will now be delivered before this year ends,"" another official said.

NEW DELHI: India will exercise its right to defend its citizens from terrorism , and it expects Quad partners to understand and appreciate that, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his Quad counterparts in Washington. Going into the Quad foreign ministers' meeting - ahead of the summit that India will host later this year - the minister drew attention to the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack, saying the world must display zero tolerance.""Victims and perpetrators must never be equated. And India has every right to defend its people against terrorism, and we will exercise that right. We expect our Quad partners to understand and appreciate that,"" the minister said in his opening remarks.Victims and perpetrators must never be equated, EAM Jaishankar said while speaking alongside American secretary of state Marco Rubio and his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Penny Wong and Takeshi Iwaya, respectively.Jaishankar's comments about India's expectations from Quad partners on the issue of terror are significant in the light of recent remarks by US President Donald Trump that seemed to draw an equivalence between India and Pakistan.Also, while Quad countries individually condemned the attack, India would have ideally liked them to do so in a joint statement.Earlier, in a conversation with US magazine Newsweek, the minister bluntly said India would not let the West's fear of a nuclear conflagration constrain its response to future Pakistan-backed terror attacks. ""We are very clear there will be no impunity for terrorists, that we will not deal with them any longer as proxies and spare the govt which supports and finances and, in many ways, motivates them. We will not allow nuclear blackmail to prevent us from responding,"" he said.""We've also heard this for too long... therefore the other guys will come and do horrible things, but you must not do anything because it gets the world worried. Now, we are not going to fall for that. If he is going to come and do things, we are going to go there and hit the people who did this. So no yielding to nuclear blackmail, no impunity to terrorists, no more free pass that they are proxies. And we will do what we have to do to defend our people,"" Jaishankar said. Speaking about Quad, the minister said it was committed to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. ""To that end, our endeavours are devoted to promoting a rules-based international order. It is essential that nations of the Indo-Pacific have the freedom of choice, so essential to make right decisions on development and security,"" he said.Even as India and others deny that Quad is a security alliance, both Beijing and Moscow see the grouping's primary objective as containment of China. In his remarks, The EAM highlighted progress in Quad initiatives, including in the maritime domain, logistics, education and political coordination. ""India plans to host the next Quad summit. We have some proposals on how to make that productive. I am sure, so do our partners,"" he added.","India will exercise its right to defend its citizens from terrorism, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told Quad counterparts in Washington.

NEW DELHI: A Hyundai Creta was stolen in New Delhi within just 60 seconds early in the morning. Yes, in under a minute, a group of people arrived in a car, hacked the vehicle’s security system, and stole it.On Instagram, a user named Rishabh Chauhan shared CCTV footage dated June 21, showing how his car—parked outside his home in Safdarjung Enclave—was stolen. He also warned others against buying the Hyundai Creta.In the video, a car is seen approaching from another direction and parking beside Chauhan's vehicle. One person exits, breaks the driver-side window, and then leaves. A few minutes later, the same car returns and parks next to the Creta again. This time, a different person wearing a mask steps out, hacks into the vehicle’s security system, and successfully unlocks the car.Chauhan also shared a screenshot of an email confirming that an investigation is underway by the police.In his caption, he wrote, ""Hi, my Hyundai Creta was stolen in 60 seconds on June 21, 2025. As seen in this video from my CCTV, the Creta is no longer safe when parked outside. Its security system appears to have been hacked or leaked and can be bypassed in under a minute.Anyone considering buying a Creta—beware, it can be stolen at any time. @hyundaiindia, the Hyundai team really needs to upgrade their safety software.

"CEC: Vote should be where you live, not ‘native’ place",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-vote-should-be-where-you-live-not-native-place/articleshow/122191668.cms,"NEW DELHI: The special intensive revision of electoral roll in Bihar and eventually, rest of country, will not only exclude persons added as electors after 2003-04, on grounds of non-submission of documents to prove their Indian citizenship but also outmigrants who have avoided being registered as electors in the constituency where they are ordinarily resident, only to retain their vote in their “native” place and state or where they own a house.Confirming this, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI, “As per Representation of the People Act (R P Act), you are entitled to vote only in the assembly constituency where you are an ordinary resident. For example, if you ordinarily reside in Delhi but own a house in Patna, your vote should be registered in Delhi, not in Patna”.According to Section 19 of the R P Act, 1950, every person who is not less than 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in a constituency shall be entitled to be registered in the electoral roll of that constituency. Section 20 goes on to explain the meaning of ‘ordinarily resident’, saying that a person shall not be deemed to be ordinarily resident on the ground only that he owns or is in possession of a dwelling house therein. It adds that a person absenting himself temporarily from his place of ordinary residence shall not, by reason thereof, cease to be ordinarily resident therein.It is a well-known practice in many states where outmigration is high, for instance, Bihar and UP, for migrants to retain their vote in their native village or town where their house or land is located, rather than shift their vote to a far-off place or state, say Maharashtra or Delhi, despite having ordinarily resident for long enough, by virtue of working there of having relocated there due to family member/s staying or working there.“Some of these migrants have been living away from their native places or where they own a house for years, but travel back during an election to vote in their home constituency. In fact, some political parties even pay for their travel to their native place to secure votes,” said an EC functionary.SIR in Bihar is aimed at putting an end to this trend, which is a violation of the laid down law. “An elector must choose the MLA or MP of the constituency where he is ordinarily resident and which is where he lives and works,” explained the functionary.","The special intensive revision of electoral roll in Bihar and eventually, rest of country, will not only exclude persons added as electors after 2003-04.

NEW DELHI: The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Tuesday observed that, prima facie, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) appeared to be responsible for the stampede that took place in Bengaluru on June 4. The tribunal observed that the police cannot be expected to make all necessary arrangements within just 12 hours, noting that they do not possess ""magical powers like Aladdin's lamp.""The tribunal criticised the IPL franchise for announcing their victory celebrations without police clearance, triggering a crowd surge that killed 11 people and injured dozens more outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium.""Prima facie it appears that the RCB (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) is responsible for the gathering of about three to five lakh people. The RCB did not take the appropriate permission or consent from the Police. Suddenly, they posted on social media platforms and as a result of aforesaid information the public were gathered.

Vikash had challenged the June 5 order, which also named then Bengaluru Police Commissioner B Dayananda and DCP Shekar H Tekkannavar.The Bengaluru bench delivered its verdict on Tuesday. Chief minister Siddaramaiah responded, saying that the government has the option to appeal the CAT ruling.The suspension of Vikash and other senior officers by the Karnataka government came under intense scrutiny after reports suggested that RCB and event organisers bypassed standard protocols. The government had claimed that while RCB CEO had sent an intimation to the Police Commissioner on June 3, no formal approval was granted.The Karnataka government has also issued new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for managing crowds at events and mass gatherings. According to the SOPs released by the Office of the Director General and Inspector General of Police, “Police responses must prioritise life safety, protection of rights, prevention of property damage, and de-escalation of potential conflicts.”The guidelines recognise that “modern gatherings are often spontaneous and influenced by social media, necessitating adaptive strategies.” They stress the importance of “early planning, coordination with stakeholders, and minimal use of force” as essential principles for effective crowd management.The SOPs cover all types of public events, from festivals and rallies to sports celebrations, providing a strategic framework to ensure public safety while maintaining law and order. Pre-event preparation includes “conducting behavioural and spatial analysis” to identify risks and bottlenecks, along with rigorous venue safety audits. Notably, venues that fail to meet safety standards, including capacity limits and evacuation plans, “must not be approved for high-footfall events. ”In wake of the Bengaluru stampede, a criminal case was registered against RCB officials, the KSCA, and DNA Entertainment. Several event organisers were arrested but later granted interim bail.Meanwhile, the Karnataka high court continues to hear a suo motu case into the tragedy. The court is also examining compensation pledges made to victims’ families, with the next hearing scheduled for July 1.","The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Tuesday observed that, prima facie, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) appeared to be responsible for the stampede.

Is there a vaccine link?

Cardiologists divided

Public urged not to ignore warning signs

NEW DELHI: A wave of sudden cardiac deaths in Karnataka, especially among young people, has jolted the state government into action, with chief minister Siddaramaiah announcing a 10-day deadline for an expert panel to submit its findings. In the past month alone, at least 20 people in Hassan district have reportedly died of heart attacks, many without prior symptoms or pre-existing conditions.Leading the probe is Dr KS Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, who is working in coordination with the Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS) to identify patterns, possible causes, and preventive measures.“Fourteen of the deceased died at home without seeking medical help. Nine were under 30,” said Dr Rajanna B, director of HIMS, confirming that the deaths occurred between May 28 and June 28, 2025.With many cases too old for post-mortems, investigators are depending on local doctors, family testimonies, and patient records. The deaths have sparked concern across the state, with Jayadeva hospitals in Bengaluru and Mysuru reporting a 20% rise in emergency cardiac OPD visits.In a statement on Tuesday, CM Siddaramaiah did not rule out the possibility that Covid-19 vaccines may have contributed to some of the deaths. “We cannot ignore that the hasty approval and distribution of the vaccine could also be a factor, as global studies have hinted at links to cardiac issues,” he said. He added that the same expert committee had been asked in February to study post-vaccination effects and young adult deaths statewide.“Before BJP criticizes us, they should ask their conscience,” Siddaramaiah remarked, accusing opposition leaders of politicizing a public health concern.The medical fraternity appears split on the issue. While the Mysuru chapter of the Cardiological Society of India (CSI) has launched a separate two-year study into rising cardiac cases among youth, led by Dr Shashirekha and Dr Veena Nanjappa, senior cardiologist and MP Dr CN Manjunath downplayed the trend as new.“This is not a sudden phenomenon,” said Dr Manjunath, who cited a 2013–2018 study of 5,000 heart attack patients aged 20–45. “We found 50% were smokers, and nearly 20% had diabetes or high BP. But worryingly, 25% had no conventional risk factors. We need to examine food safety and pesticide exposure too.”While the debate continues, the government is urging citizens not to delay seeking help. “Anyone with chest pain or breathing issues must go to the nearest health centre immediately,” said Siddaramaiah. He cited state-run health programs like Hridaya Jyothi and Gruha Arogya as part of efforts to monitor and respond to rising cardiac risk.The expert committee’s report is expected by July 10.","A wave of sudden cardiac deaths in Karnataka has jolted the state government into action.

Five Takeaways

Isro Engineers

Space Station

For Isro, benefits and learnings from the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station (ISS) will far outweigh the cost it has had to incur in sending Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux).The Rs 548 crore spent on the mission is a fraction of what India would have otherwise needed to spend on replicating the same training, exposure and systems-level experience, Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI, in his first exclusive interview about the multinational commercial mission.Speaking from Houston, Narayanan said that the learning outcomes — spanning astronaut training (for two astronauts), mission operations, and hardware-software-human interface — cannot be measured purely in monetary terms.“For a country of 140 crore people, what we’ve spent is only marginal,,” Narayanan said. For that, he said: “We’ve gained access to infrastructure and experience that would otherwise require thousands of crores.” If one looks at the per capita cost on the Indian population, it adds up to around Rs 4 per head.Narayanan, dismissing observations that Ax-4 is “just a commercial mission”, said discussions on such strategic missions must be rooted in long-term capability building rather than short-term financial arithmetic.“For a programme like Gaganyaan , which spans Rs 20,000 crore including follow-on missions, these early investments are necessary. Training, confidence, exposure, systems understanding — these are foundational,” he said.He added that maturity in public discourse is essential. “People must recognise that not all benefits can be quantified. But they can certainly be measured in preparedness and capability,” he said.Narayanan identified five key areas where Ax-4 will directly strengthen India’s human spaceflight capabilities: Training exposure, confidence building, operational experience, systems-and-process understanding, and cross-disciplinary learning.“Our astronauts trained in world-class facilities simulating space conditions, including microgravity and life-support systems. Each hour of training they’ve undergone would cost crores if we were to replicate the infrastructure ourselves,” he said.He added that interacting with seasoned astronauts — including those who have flown to space multiple times or performed several spacewalks — helped boost the confidence of Indian crew members and mission teams.Astronauts — Shux and his backup Group Captain Prashant Nair — learnt how to function in space as a team, handle real-time challenges, and carry out experiments. He said working on and observing the mission to ISS has given India insights into module design, layout, onboard systems, and processes that will feed into future Gaganyaan and space station designs.“We will, of course, have our own design and technology, but all this experience will help us develop those better,” he said.Narayanan, who is leading efforts to ensure astronaut safety, said he has himself gained from observing operations in Houston. “From data handling to high-level system safety discussions, our understanding of the end-to-end process has grown. This cannot be acquired by simulation or literature review alone,” he said.He added that the experience is equally valuable for backroom mission teams and decision-makers, who will now have real-world references to draw upon while preparing for Gaganyaan. TOI had reported last week about some specifics the Isro team is learning back in Houston, where mission control for Ax-4 is.India plans to build its own space station after the Gaganyaan crewed flights. Narayanan said direct exposure to the ISS environment will inform the design, configuration, and operational planning of the proposed Indian facility.“We had only studied the ISS on paper. Now we are seeing it in action. We may not adopt the same model, but this will help us make informed design choices,” he said.","Isro chairman V Narayanan tells TOI about the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station.

SC takes 30 years to implement its own judgment on SC/ST quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-takes-30-years-to-implement-its-own-judgment-on-sc/st-quota/articleshow/122193918.cms,"NEW DELHI: More than 30 years after it mandated a 200-point-roster system for earmarking posts for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates in direct recruitments, the Supreme Court has now identified staff posts reserved for SC and ST candidates but provided no quota for OBC candidates.The judgment in R K Sabharwal case was delivered by a five-judge bench on Feb 10, 1995, during the tenure of 26th CJI A M Ahmadi, but it will be implemented now during the tenure of 52nd CJI in Justice B R Gavai, the second Dalit to head judiciary after Justice K G Balakrishnan.CJI Gavai told TOI, “The judgement in Sabharwal case recommended implementation of 200-point roster system for identification of posts for the SC and ST candidates in each category of posts. The identification process is completed and from now onwards vacancies against each reserved post would be filled from the candidates belonging to that category of backward class candidates.”Asked about non-inclusion of OBC quota in direct recruitments, the CJI said, ""I have asked the SC Registry to initiate steps for amendment of the relevant Rules for inclusion of reservation for OBC candidates."" After the Indra Sawhney judgment of 1992, a 27% quota in government jobs was introduced for candidates belonging to OBC communities, but the SC had capped the cumulative reservations at 50% of vacancies.For the 200-point roster system, the SC has enumerated 1280 posts, majority of which comprise junior court attendants (600 posts) and junior court assistants (437). Of the total 1,280 posts, 191 has been earmarked for SC candidates and 93 for STs while the rest 996 posts would be for general category.Since the judgment is of Feb 1995, and the central government circular is of July 1997, it is but natural that there would have been a huge backlog in filling the posts as per the roster system that intends to effectuate 15% and 7.5% quota for SCs and STs respectively.CJI Gavai said, “The backlogs will be gradually filled. This would mean sometimes the reservations in direct recruitments would cross the cumulative 22.5% mark.”In the Sabharwal judgment, a five-judge SC bench led by Justice Kuldip Singh had said, “The only way to assure equality of opportunity to the Backward Classes and the general category is to permit the roster to operate till the time the respective appointees/ promotees occupy the posts meant for them in the roster... As and when there is a vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post the same must be filled from amongst the category to which the post belonged in the roster. ”“The cadre-strength is always measured by the number of posts comprising the cadre… Once the total cadre has full representation of the SCs/STs and Backward Classes in accordance with the reservation policy then the vacancies arising thereafter in the cadre are to be filled from amongst the category of persons to whom the respective vacancies belong,” it had said.","The Supreme Court has identified staff posts reserved for SC and ST candidates.

Double booster shot for India's blue-water combat capabilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/navys-blue-water-capabilities-get-a-double-boost/articleshow/122193775.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a double booster shot for the country’s blue-water combat capabilities on Tuesday, the last Indian warship to be constructed abroad was commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia, while an indigenous stealth frigate was delivered to the Navy by Mazagon Docks (MDSL).Both the 3,900-tonne frigate INS Tamal and the 6,670-tonne frigate built by MDSL, which will be commissioned as INS Udaygiri next month, are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km.“Both the multi-mission frigates, which have enhanced stealth features to reduce detection by enemy radars, pack a deadly punch augmented by their network-centric warfare capabilities,” a senior officer told TOI.For air defence, Udaygiri is equipped with the Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70-km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles. INS Tamal, in turn, has the Russian Shtil vertical launched anti-aircraft missiles with an enhanced range of over 50-km, among other weapons like rockets, guns and torpedoes.Speaking at the commissioning of INS Tamal at the Yantar shipyard in Kaliningrad, Western Naval Command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay Jasjit Singh said, “I am confident the warship will prove its mettle as a force multiplier in our operational architecture towards safeguarding national maritime interests and promoting maritime security.”Overall, the 140-warship Navy now has another 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage. This naval expansion is crucial to tackle the maritime collusiveness between Pakistan and China, which is making major strategic inroads into the Indian Ocean Region with the world’s largest naval force of 370 warships.Udaygiri is the second of the seven multi-role frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDSL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the other five are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.Interestingly, Udaygiri is the 100ship designed and delivered by the Navy’s inhouse Warship Design Bureau. INS Tamal, in turn, is the 51ship produced under the India-Russia strategic collaboration over the last 65 years.It was in Oct 2018 that India had inked the agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two INS Tushil (commissioned last Dec) and INS Tamal to be imported for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two, Triput and Tavasya, in turn, are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore. These four new warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted from 2003-2004 onwards. All these frigates can also carry Kamov-31 early-warning and Kamov-28 multirole helicopters.",The last Indian warship to be constructed abroad was commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia.

"9 of 10 workers stuck in low-competency jobs, suggests report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/9-of-10-workers-stuck-in-low-competency-jobs-suggests-report/articleshow/122193400.cms,"NEW DELHI: Over 50% of India's graduates are employed in roles meant for lower skill levels, underscoring a deep mismatch between education and job opportunities. And what's of even greater concern, despite greater access to higher education, a staggering 88% of India's workforce remains engaged in low-competency occupations, a report by Institute for Competitiveness, India's affiliate of Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School, has said.The crisis is compounded by regional disparities - states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh lag on high-skill job shares, while UTs and states, such as Chandigarh, Puducherry, Goa, and Kerala lead in better utilisation of skilled professionals.The report, ""Skills for the Future: Transforming India's Workforce Landscape"", used Periodic Labour Force Survey data from 2017-18 to 2023-24. It found only 8.25% of graduates (Educational Skill Level 3) are in roles matching their qualifications, while more than half work lower-skill jobs. As much as 88% of the workforce is engaged in low-skill (Skill Level 1 and 2) jobs, such as street vending, domestic work, and manual operations, even as enrolment in education and vocational training has risen.The ""Mismatch Table"" in the report, released by Jayant Chaudhary, minister of skill development and entrepreneurship, revealed that over 50% of graduates are employed in roles like clerks, machine operators, and sales workers (Skill Level 2).While 38.23% of graduates are in Skill Level 4 jobs, 28.12% of postgraduates are in mid-skill occupations, pointing to underutilised talent. It also noted many underqualified cases - workers lacking formal education for higher-skill jobs - were likely compensated by informal training or Technical and Vocational Education and Training .These patterns expose structural inefficiencies in labour market. And they are reflected in wage trends. Skill Level 1 workers earn minimum wages. Those at Skill Level 2 have seen 5-6% annual wage growth, while Skill Level 3 and 4 professionals saw 8-12% growth, reinforcing the need to move more workers into high-competency roles. Delhi, Puducherry, and Goa have seen modest increases in mid- and high-skill job shares.The report also highlights some positive trends. Delhi, Puducherry, and Goa have seen modest increases in mid- and high-skill job shares. Primary education enrollment is near-universal. The Gross Enrolment Ratio for higher secondary is 57.56%, and the secondary-to-higher secondary transition rate was 78.41% in 2021–22. TVET has enabled some underqualified individuals to enter higher-skill roles through practical learning and informal upskilling.To address the mismatch, the report proposes a multi-pronged policy framework: institutionalising a disaggregated Skill Gap Analysis Survey, creating a central Skill Data Repository, and updating the National Classification of Occupations (NCO). It also recommends aligning training programmes with industrial clusters, integrating TVET with general education, and incentivising firms to prioritise PMKVY-certified workers. These steps are seen as key to building a workforce fit for a digital, green, globally competitive economy and realising India’s vision by 2047.","Despite greater access to higher education, a staggering 88% of India's workforce remains engaged in low-competency occupations.

Jindal in his complaint, which TOI reported first on Tuesday, had alleged that he and an assistant engineer were assaulted in presence of local SDM and others, and had to be hospitalised.The ""brutal assault"" was condemned by Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari “It’s deeply disturbing that such an assault occurred in the presence of SDM concerned and police officials...Failure of the local administration to intervene and protect NHAI officers or provide immediate medical assistance to them further compound the gravity of this incident,” Gadkari wrote to HP CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.Seeking strong action against all perpetrators, Gadkari has sought “fixing responsibility of the administrative and police officials concerned for their inaction”.He cautioned that “continued inaction” may prompt the ministry to “reassess ongoing and future projects”.“I spoke with Union minister Nitin Gadkari this morning.

As minister Rana was also on site, Jindal briefed him on the incident and told him that the collapsed building was 30 metres from the highway’s ‘right of way’ (ROW), and any damage occurring outside ROW falls under state govt’s jurisdiction.He alleged that the minister then abused him in the presence of the SDM and local residents, called the two NHAI officials to a nearby room and started hitting Jindal on the head with a water pitcher.

"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insuring-dying-dead-50-firms-finmin-meet-with-senior-cops/articleshow/122193252.cms,"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds

MEERUT: Six months after a multi-crore insurance scam surfaced in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal district, senior officials from the Union finance ministry, insurance regulatory bodies, over 50 insurance companies, and investigative agencies met in Sambhal to plug critical policy gaps and improve coordination. At the conclave hosted by the UP Police, officials proposed systemic reforms to combat insurance fraud, including changes to Section 45, enhanced data sharing, and stricter scrutiny of investigation processes.The scam, first reported by TOI, involved policies being taken out in the names of terminally ill or deceased individuals across more than 12 states. ""The findings uncovered during the probe prompted the need for a national-level dialogue on fraud prevention. The idea came from the case details we encountered over the past six months,” said Anukriti Sharma, additional SP of Sambhal and lead investigator.The investigation revealed that the network did not stop at forgery. In some cases, operatives allegedly resorted to murder to access insurance payouts. Four such deaths, initially reported as accidents, were later linked directly to the scam. In one case, a paralysed man was killed in Sambhal for a policy worth Rs 95 lakh.In another, a man was murdered in Amroha to claim Rs 2.7 crore. These killings highlighted the organised nature of the racket and its readiness to escalate from document fraud to homicide.Sambhal SP Krishna Bishnoi said the conclave concluded with a range of key suggestions. “We discussed better coordination among insurers, the need to relook Section 45, investor protection, standardisation of investigation procedures, and stronger communication between police and insurance firms,” he told TOI. He added that participants also suggested introducing new legislation tailored to insurance fraud, setting standards for investigation companies, and building structured channels for information-sharing between stakeholders.The scale of the fraud brought Section 45 of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015, into sharp focus. The clause bars insurers from questioning a policy on any ground—including misstatement or fraud—after three years from the date of issuance, revival or commencement, whichever is earlier. Officials said this clause has often been misused to push fraudulent claims.At the conclave, Meena Kumari, Executive Director of IRDAI, pointed out that insurers need to maintain up-to-date policies and procedures at both the underwriting stage and the claims stage, with an appropriate feedback loop. Many companies appear to be missing early signs of fraud because the systems don’t talk to each other,” she said. “Preventing fraud is essential, but equal attention must be paid to ensuring no genuine claim is denied. ” She called for smarter use of data and faster detection tools that don’t delay payouts to honest claimants.Mandakini Balodhi, director (insurance), the finance ministry, said the bigger challenge was the restoration of public trust. “Insurance is a tool of financial inclusion, and social security schemes allow us to serve the most vulnerable. Fraud and abuse in the insurance ecosystem hit these highly vulnerable segments and need to be arrested by concerted efforts of all present in the ecosystem, insurance and outside. ” She added that repeated frauds risk damaging faith in welfare programmes designed for the most vulnerable.Venkat Changavalli, who leads the Insurance Information Bureau, said fraudsters were exploiting the gaps between companies. “We see the same scam patterns being missed because insurers aren’t sharing data fast enough,” he said. “We’re working on systems to flag suspicious claims in real time, but that only works if insurers respond quickly and consistently.”TOI’s investigation revealed that the scam, estimated to be worth over Rs 500 crore, extended into government-backed schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Mukhyamantri Sadak Durghatna Bima Yojana. Operatives used fake death certificates, tampered Aadhaar data, and backdated policies to make fraudulent claims. The investigation exposed links between insurance agents, hospital staff, bank officials, ASHA workers, civic employees, and elected representatives.In Jan, UP Police intercepted an SUV in Sambhal carrying cash, forged PAN cards, Aadhaar details, and fake documents. That bust triggered a wider investigation and culminated in a May case by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Police later filed an 800-page chargesheet naming operatives from UP, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Police have so far registered 17 FIRs in Sambhal, Moradabad, Badaun and Amroha, arrested 52 people, and recorded three surrenders.","Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds.

The Road Ahead

Ten years ago, we embarked on a bold journey into uncharted territory with great conviction. While decades were spent doubting the ability of Indians to use technology, we changed this approach and trusted the ability of Indians to use technology.While decades were spent thinking that use of technology will deepen the gap between the haves and the have-nots, we changed this mindset and used technology to eliminate the gap between the haves and the have-nots.When the intent is right, innovation empowers the less empowered. When the approach is inclusive, technology brings change in the lives of those on the margins. This belief laid the foundation for Digital India : a mission to democratise access, build inclusive digital infrastructure, and opportunities for all.In 2014, internet penetration was limited, digital literacy was low, and online access to govt services was scarce. Many doubted whether a country as vast and diverse as India could truly go digital. Today, that question has been answered not just in data and dashboards, but in the lives of 140 crore Indians. From how we govern, to how we learn, transact and build, Digital India is everywhere.In 2014, India had around 25 crore internet connections.Today, that number has grown to over 97 crore. Over 42 lakh km of optical fibre cable equivalent to 11 times the distance between Earth and the Moon now connects even the most remote villages.India's 5G rollout is among the fastest in the world, with 4.8 lakh base stations installed in just two years. High-speed internet now reaches urban hubs and forward military posts alike including Galwan, Siachen and Ladakh.India Stack, which is our digital backbone, has enabled platforms like UPI, which now handles 100+ billion transactions a year. Around half of all real-time digital transactions happen in India.Through Direct Benefit Transfer, over Rs 44 lakh crore has been transferred directly to citizens, cutting out middlemen and saving Rs 3.5 lakh crore in leakages. Schemes like Svamitva have issued 2.4 crore+ property cards and mapped 6.4 lakh villages, ending years of land-related uncertainty.India's digital economy is empowering MSMEs and small entrepreneurs like never before. ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) is a revolutionary platform which opens a new window of opportunity by providing a seamless connection between huge market of buyers and sellers.GeM (Govt E-Marketplace) enables the common man to sell goods and services to all arms of govt. This not only empowers the common man with a huge market but also saves money for the govt.ONDC recently crossed 200 million transactions, with the last 100 million in just six months. From Banarasi weavers to bamboo artisans in Nagaland, sellers are now reaching customers nationwide, without middlemen or digital monopolies.GeM has also crossed Rs 1 lakh crore GMV in 50 days, with 22 lakh sellers including 1.8 lakh+ women-led MSMEs, who have fulfilled orders worth Rs 46,000 crore.India's Digital Public Infrastructure - from Aadhaar , CoWIN, DigiLocker and FASTag to PM-WANI and One Nation One Subscription - is now studied and adopted globally.CoWIN enabled the world's largest vaccination drive, issuing 220 crore QR-verifiable certificates. DigiLocker, with 54 crore users, hosts 775 crore+ documents, securely and seamlessly.Through our G20 presidency, India launched the Global DPI Repository and a $25 million Social Impact Fund, helping nations across Africa and South Asia adopt inclusive digital ecosystems.India now ranks among the top three startup ecosystems in the world, with over 1.8 lakh startups. But this is more than a startup movement, it is a tech renaissance.India is doing extremely well when it comes to AI skill penetration and AI talent concentration among our youth.

NEW DELHI: The Cabinet Tuesday approved the Rs 1-lakh crore Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme, aimed at generating more than 3.5 crore jobs in the organised sector.Announced in July 2024, the scheme is meant to counter criticism over inadequate jobs being created in the economy at a time when there is a rising number of job seekers in the market. The decision comes ahead of assembly elections in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scheme was finalised after detailed deliberation with industry leaders and other stakeholders.The scheme has two elements, one targeted at first-time employees who earn up to Rs 1 lakh a month and are members of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation. The Centre will pay up to Rs 15,000 each to around 1.9 crore employees. Govt hopes these jobs will be created by Aug 2027.The Rs 15,000 payment to first-time employees will be split into two instalments, with the second payment to be made after 12 months directly into their bank accounts.The second part is targeted at encouraging manufacturing companies to hire more.

For the manufacturing sector, the incentives will be extended to the third and fourth year as well.""Establishments which are registered with the EPFO will be required to hire at least two additional employees (for employers with less than 50 employees) or five additional employees (for employers with 50 or more employees) on a sustained basis for at least six months,"" an official statement said.The scheme may benefit several of the new entrants coming up with new facilities, especially in electronics, semiconductors and the automobiles space.""ELI is a significant step towards boosting employment and formalising India's workforce.

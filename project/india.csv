Flight data downloaded: AAIB to issue preliminary report on Ajit Pawar’s Baramati plane crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flight-data-downloaded-aaib-to-issue-preliminary-report-on-ajit-pawars-baramati-plane-crash/articleshow/128589301.cms,"NEW DELHI: Data from the Digital Flight Data Recorder of Ajit Pawar's crashed Learjet 45 near Baramati has been successfully downloaded at the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s Flight Recorder Laboratory, the ministry of civil aviation said on Thursday, adding that a preliminary report into the January 28 accident will be issued within 30 days in line with ICAO norms and that all investigative actions are being taken with full transparency and professional integrity.Maharashtra Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and four others were killed in the crash.The ministry said the AAIB’s probe is technical and evidence based. It involves systematic examination of wreckage, operational and maintenance records and laboratory testing of components where required.The crashed VSR Ventures-owned Learjet 45 was equipped with a Digital Flight Data Recorder and a Cockpit Voice Recorder. Both devices were exposed to intense heat and sustained fire damage. Data from the DFDR, manufactured by L3-Communications, has been successfully downloaded at AAIB’s Flight Recorder Laboratory.""The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), manufactured by Honeywell, is undergoing detailed technical examination. Assistance has been sought from the Accredited Representative of the State of Manufacture for specialised support in data retrieval,"" AAIB said in a statement on February 17.Following the accident, the ministry directed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to conduct a special audit of VSR Ventures. The audit covers regulatory compliance, operational control systems, maintenance practices, crew training standards, safety management systems and CVR and FDR monitoring.""The audit commenced on February 4, 2026, and is expected to conclude shortly. Findings will be reviewed, and action will be taken in accordance with DGCA’s Enforcement Policy and Procedures Manual,"" the ministry said.The regulator has also been asked to carry out special audits of other major non-scheduled operators and aerodromes engaged in VIP and VVIP operations. These audits are being conducted in phases and enforcement action will be taken wherever required.In 2025, the DGCA conducted 51 regulatory audits of non-scheduled operators, the ministry said. It added that multiple surveillances of VSR Ventures were carried out in areas including flight safety systems, flight duty time limitations, maintenance compliance, documentation and station facilities, and that all findings were addressed and closed.""Stakeholders are requested to refrain from speculation and allow the statutory investigation and regulatory processes to proceed in accordance with established procedures,"" the ministry said, reiterating that all investigative and regulatory actions are proceeding with full transparency and professional integrity.Meanwhile, political reactions intensified with fresh demands for an independent inquiry.Nationalist Congress Party leader Rohit Pawar called for the Aviation Minister to step down, alleging a possible conflict of interest.""The owner of VSR Aviation recently held his son's wedding in Jaipur, Rajasthan, which was attended by a main leader of the TDP. The Aviation Minister belongs to that party. If they can attend the wedding of the VSR Aviation owner's son, the investigation may not proceed in the right direction. That is why we believe he should not remain in that post while the investigation is ongoing,"" he said.He further said, ""Everyone should demand a different kind of inquiry. If everyone conducts a transparent inquiry, we can reach a proper conclusion. So, I welcome that move. Though it is a little late, it doesnot matter. What matters is that the investigation should be done by many organisations and investigation agencies, but along with this, some international agencies should also be involved.""NCP working President Praful Patel also demanded a CBI inquiry into the crash."" After the tragic demise of Ajit Pawar, we should also get information whether every aspect is being investigated in the right direction or not. Today, AAIB is investigating technical matters. I have heard that the black box is also going to America for investigation. Perhaps they have not been able to investigate thoroughly here. The state government has also given the investigation to the CID. But after such a big accident involving such a big leader, we feel that information should be obtained from every aspect. CBI is a reliable organisation. If the investigation is done by CBI, then some facts and aspects should also be taken into account. CBI can do this work.""",Data from the Digital Flight Data Recorder of Ajit Pawar's crashed Learjet 45 has been successfully downloaded at the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s Flight Recorder Laboratory. A preliminary report into the January 28 accident will be issued within 30 days in line with ICAO norms.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128589503,imgsize-58332,width-400,resizemode-4/ajit-pawar.jpg"

New Delhi: Jolted by allegations of anti-Brahmin bias, FIRs and court petitions, the producer of 'Ghooskhor Pandat' on Thursday filed an affidavit informing Supreme Court of the decision to withdraw the film's title and not use the words that had hurt the sentiments of a section of society anywhere in the Manoj Bajpayee-starrer.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for producer Neeraj Pandey , told a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan that given the concerns expressed over the teaser since its release on Feb 3, the promotional material had been withdrawn.He said the film was a fictional police drama that revolved around a criminal investigation without portraying any caste, religion, community or sect as corrupt.In his affidavit, Pandey said, ""I respectfully submit that the earlier title, 'Ghooskhor Pandat', stands unequivocally withdrawn and shall not be used in any manner whatsoever.

Parents' qualification doesn't matter in custody battle: Calcutta HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parents-qualification-doesnt-matter-in-custody-battle-calcutta-hc/articleshow/128586587.cms,"Calcutta HC

Kolkata: The child of a separated couple who has been living with his father for five years cannot be ""planted som-ewhere else"" even if the father's educational qualification is less than the mother's, Calcutta HC held on Tuesday.The mother, who was recently awarded custody of the child by a trial court, has a master's in music. She runs a music school and is also a private tutor. The father, whose custody claim over the 8-year-old has been upheld by the high court, is a matriculate and earns a living selling fish.The child, who has been living with his father since the couple separated five years ago, had told the trial court judge that he wanted to stay with both parents.Since the couple filed for restitution of conjugal rights several times while the custody battle was on, a HC division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya observed on Tuesday: ""It transpires that all is still not lost and there is ample scope for the parties reconciling their matrimonial disputes, as well as a chance of the parties staying together as a couple by shedding their personal differences, which will be of utmost benefit to the child in the final count.The bench referred the couple for mediation, to be supervised by the Calcutta HC mediation committee. The committee was requested to include a psychologist in the mediation.The trial court in a recent order had noted that the father earned more than the mother but awarded custody to the mother on the grounds that she was more educated. The judge had observed that the child's upbringing would be affected if he were to be deprived of his mother's love.Acting on an appeal by the father against the trial court order, the division bench observed on Tuesday: ""The finding of the trial judge is that any detachment of the minor from his mother may cause a scratch in the mind of the minor, who is eight years old. That scratch was caused five years ago; from age three to eight, he has been residing with his father... He has been living with his father for five years; now we cannot pick him up and plant him somewhere else. ""The bench also observed: ""The trial judge was swayed more by personal inclinations and views than the facts of the case.""The couple separated in 2021, when the child was just three. The man has alleged that his wife left to live at her paternal home, while the woman claimed she had been driven out of the house by her husband.The division bench said no evidence was provided to establish that the child's education suffered during the five years he was with his father. Rather, it was noted that the child is being tutored by his aunt and two private tutors.The mother has been granted visitation rights by the high court.","The child of a separated couple who has been living with his father for five years cannot be ""planted som-ewhere else"" even if the father's educational qualification is less than the mother's, Calcutta HC held.

(Representative Image)

Competency-Based Questions Test Conceptual Clarity

Challenging Areas: Circles and Lengthy MCQs

What Lies Ahead

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted the Class 10 Mathematics examination today, February 17, 2026, in both Standard and Basic formats. Early reactions from students and teachers indicate a noticeable difference in difficulty levels between the two papers. While the Standard paper was largely balanced and manageable, the Basic paper drew criticism for being lengthy and challenging.Principal Dr. Alka Kapur of Modern Public School shared with TOI, “The Standard paper was balanced, well-structured, and manageable within the allotted time, while the Basic paper was relatively tough and lengthy, with graph-based questions proving particularly challenging.”Several teachers across India also shared their analyses. Manpreet Kaur, TGT Mathematics at Global Indian International School, noted, “The Grade 10 Mathematics board exam paper was balanced and prepared according to the prescribed board pattern. Overall difficulty was easy to moderate. Most questions were concept-based and straightforward, though a Triangles question and a Probability question were tricky. Time management was important, but well-prepared students could attempt most questions confidently.”Similarly, Suneeti Sharma, TGT Mathematics at Global Indian International School, said, “The paper was moderate in difficulty, with some sections leaning toward easy. Case-study and application-based questions, particularly from Trigonometry, required careful thinking. Students who had practised NCERT examples thoroughly found the paper manageable.”From JAIN International Residential School, Bengaluru, Vamanrao S Patil and Benasir P A described the paper as “moderate and largely NCERT-focused. While MCQs and two-mark questions were accessible, Section D and the case-based Section E required deeper analysis, careful reading, and effective time management.”Shaifali Bhatt, HOD Mathematics at DPS Sector 45, shared her expert view on the exam: “The Class X Mathematics examination, both Standard and Basic, was well-structured and strictly aligned with the NCERT curriculum. The paper was balanced in difficulty, covering all key concepts fairly. Importantly, no questions were outside the prescribed syllabus, and both papers maintained consistency in structure and conceptual clarity, effectively assessing students’ understanding and application skills without being unpredictable. ”Students also expressed their views. Abhhisek Sen, a Class 10 student, said, “The paper set 430/2/2 was extremely lengthy and also difficult, especially when it is a Basic paper. CBSE should shed its ego and reconduct the exam and this time must set the difficulty level equivalent to basic level.”Teacher Sanjay Sharma from Yamuna Vihar added, “The Basic paper demanded extensive calculations, whereas the Standard paper tested conceptual clarity without being overly lengthy.”One of the key highlights of this year’s paper was the presence of competency-based questions. Teachers noted that these questions required students to apply concepts rather than rely solely on memorisation.“The competency-based questions were thoughtfully framed. They tested students’ understanding of concepts in real-life contexts,” said Mr. Abhishek Mehra, PGT Mathematics. “CBSE is clearly moving towards assessing application skills.”In particular, some word problems and case-study based questions required step-by-step reasoning. Students who had practised exemplar problems reportedly found these manageable.While the overall paper was accessible, early reviews of the Mathematics Basic paper highlighted that a few questions from the ‘Circles’ chapter posed challenges. Some students felt that these questions required deeper conceptual understanding.“I was slightly confused in one of the questions from Circles, but after re-reading it, I could attempt it,” said another student from Yamuna Vihar.Additionally, a section of Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) was described as lengthy. Though not necessarily difficult, these questions required time and careful calculation. Time management, therefore, played an important role. Another student from Mumbai told TOI, “Section E was difficult while the rest of the paper was moderate. Many students looked tense, and some were even crying after coming out of the exam hall. ”With Mathematics marking the beginning of the board exams, students seem relieved and hopeful about the upcoming subjects. As the board exams progress, expert analyses and actual question papers are expected to be out soon.On the whole, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 Maths Paper 2026 has been termed as moderately difficult, with a mix of direct and application-based questions. Although some students found the paper manageable with proper preparation, certain parts of the paper demanded a better understanding of concepts and time management. Despite its difficulties, the paper was found to be fair and in line with the syllabus, marking a steady start to this year’s board exams.In conclusion, while the Standard paper was largely fair and student-friendly, the Basic paper challenged many learners. Competency-based and application-driven questions tested conceptual understanding and time management. Students and educators alike are now analysing both papers to gauge performance and prepare for upcoming subjects.","CBSE Class 10 Maths exam 2026 moderately difficult, competency-based questions challenge students.

INDORE: Displaying striking indifference during a crime scene reconstruction, the accused in the murder of a 24-year-old MBA student reacted casually when questioned by reporters, brushing aside queries about the killing.Surrounded by media personnel on Tuesday, Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder. “Kuch nai hua hai, chhodo, ho gaya jo hogaya yaar… chhod do na… kya karoge jaan ke,” he said in Hindi, refusing to explain his actions. When asked whether he regretted the crime, he responded with a faint smirk and said he would reveal the reason “when the time comes”.Police officials present at the reconstruction described his demeanour as unusually calm. Officers said his behaviour during interrogation and subsequent proceedings appeared erratic and detached.According to investigators, the accused allegedly muttered apologies in the hours following the crime and claimed he wanted to “communicate with the victim’s spirit”. He also told police he had contemplated suicide by jumping in front of a train but did not act on it.During questioning at the Dwarkapuri police station, Dhamnodiya reportedly asked for a blank sheet of paper and wrote that he had committed a “grave wrong” and wanted to die.He repeatedly requested officers to let him meet the victim, claiming he loved her.DCP Krishna Lalchandani said the accused had been consuming occult-related online content and searching for suicide methods, though he never attempted self-harm. Investigators also learned that Dhamnodiya suspected the victim of speaking to other men.Police said the woman’s body was recovered on Feb 13 from a rented room in Indore, three days after she was reported missing. Dhamnodiya, identified as her boyfriend and classmate, was traced to Mumbai and arrested from Andheri on Feb 14.During interrogation, police alleged that Dhamnodiya tied the victim’s hands and legs, gagged her and strangled her. Officers further claimed he later purchased beer, returned to the room and consumed alcohol beside the body. Investigators accused him of sexually assaulting the corpse and engaging in acts of necrophilia before fleeing.Police said the accused travelled by train after leaving Indore, changing routes before reaching Mumbai. Investigators stated he later went to a deserted location near Panvel, where he allegedly lit incense sticks and watched online videos about summoning spirits.Dwarkapuri police seized items linked to the crime and recreated the scene. The accused is scheduled to be produced before a court on Wednesday.","Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder.

Gurgaon: Shocking Murder, School Chaos, Delivery Scam Bust & More





ROHTAK: The murder of a 27-year-old bank employee, found with her throat slit near Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district, was solved within 18 hours, with police arresting her husband — a chartered accountant from Hisar — as the prime accused.Investigators said the accused killed his wife over repeated suspicions about her character and then attempted to pass it off as a robbery-cum-murder.The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.She was married to Anshul Dhawan, a chartered accountant and resident of Hisar’s Sector 14, on September 25, 2025, in an arranged marriage. The couple had been married for barely five months.On Valentine’s Day (February 14), the couple visited Hisar and stayed with family.The next evening, around 7 pm on February 15, they left Mahak’s parental home in Hansi for Gurugram. About four hours later, Anshul called the police, claiming unidentified attackers had intercepted their car near Pahsaur village in the Badli area of Jhajjar district, killed his wife, and fled.Police found Mahak’s body lying outside the car on a dirt track about 100 metres off the Jhajjar-Badli road. Her throat had been slit.However, Anshul’s version soon fell apart during questioning. He failed to describe the alleged attackers and repeatedly changed his statement.During sustained interrogation and a crime scene reconstruction, Anshul confessed. Police said the couple frequently argued over his suspicions about Mahak’s character. The dispute escalated during the drive, leading him to first strangle her and then slit her throat with a pair of scissors, allegedly while wearing gloves to avoid leaving evidence.

India Signals Tough Stand On Rafale Fighter Jet Deal, Seeks Deep Localisation And Tech Transfer

NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said that Rafale fighter jets will boost India’s military strength and that he is committed to having more indigenous content in ‘made-in-India Rafale', as sought by the Modi govt.Speaking on the sidelines of the AI-India Summit at the end of his three-day visit, Macron told the French and Indian media, “Rafale improves the strategic relations between us, and it creates more jobs here.” On criticism in some western quarters over the performance of the 4.5-gen fighter, especially during Operation Sindoor last year, the President said, “I don't see how people can criticise the aircraft because it (Rafale) makes your country stronger. ”Macron said France and India are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce Rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters.“On Rafale, what we want to do is expand. India confirmed a few days ago its willingness to command a new bunch of Rafales... 114... and to co-produce in India,” he said. India's expected order for another 114 Rafales is a “new step forward” in defence ties. On India’s demand for increasing indigenous content in the jet’s co-production, Macron said, “Very clearly, we are extremely, I would say, committed to having a maximum number of Indian components and manufacturing a maximum number of critical devices in India.... We will have increased cooperation in maintenance and diversification.”Showing his willingness to sell more French submarines to India, Macron cited the tie-up on Rafales to make his case. “I hope we will do it on submarines. We have offered additional capacities,"" he said. The Indian Navy currently operates six French Scorpene submarines and there are plans to have more -- at least three -- such submarines from France in the near future.The President said India's push to co-produce Rafale fighter jets is a “legitimate” ambition that aligns with the “direction of history.... Rafale is the key.” He underscored the long-term necessity of this partnership, predicting that India's requirement for advanced aviation will only grow in the coming decades. “Looking ahead to 2040 and 2050, I am telling you, India will need combat aviation,” Macron said.“We don’t have a strategic partnership, we have a global spatial strategic partnership, which is unique for both France and India,” he said.Macron’s reaction came just days after the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council gave the initial clearance for acquiring 114 more Rafale jets and the defence minister discussed the jet deal with his French counterpart Catherine Vautrin as part of the India-France annual defence dialogue on Tuesday.","France and India are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce Rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters.

India Displays Naval Might At International Fleet Review 2026, President Murmu Lauds Indian Navy

NEW DELHI: India’s sea-based nuclear deterrent will be strengthened soon as the country’s third indigenous Arihant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), INS Aridhaman (designated S4), is likely to be commissioned by April-May. “The commissioning of INS Aridhaman is expected by this summer as the submarine is currently in the final stages of sea trial,” a defence source told TOI.Last Dec, Navy chief Admiral D K Tripathi had said that INS Aridhaman would be commissioned this year.INS Aridhaman, built under the Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV) project at the Ship Building Centre in Visakhapatnam, will be larger (7,000 tonne) than predecessors INS Arihant and INS Arighaat (6,000 tonne), featuring enhanced capability to carry long-range K-4 missiles. INS Aridhaman will be armed with 24 K-15 Sagarika SLBMs (750 km range) and eight K-4 SLBMs (3,500 km range), which are capable of reaching most parts of Asia.Once it enters service, India will have three operational ballistic missile submarines under the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) at sea for the first time, moving the country closer to achieving ‘Continuous At-Sea Deterrence’, a strategic defence policy where a nation maintains at least one SSBN on patrol 365 days a year.As a stealthy underwater platform, INS Aridhaman boosts India’s “second-strike” capability—the ability to retaliate after a nuclear attack. It is designed to carry more long-range nuclear-tipped missiles than its predecessors INS Arihant and INS Arighaat.In addition to INS Aridhaman, the Indian Navy is securing an Akula-class SSN nuclear-powered attack submarine from Russia, commonly referred to as “Chakra III”, with expected delivery by 2027 or early 2028. Besides these submarine projects, India and Germany are in the final stages of negotiating a $8-10 billion Project-75(I) deal to build six advanced, conventional diesel-electric submarines equipped with Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology.The new submarine acquisitions are timely as Pakistan is acquiring eight advanced Hangor-class diesel-electric attack submarines from China under a $5 billion 2015 deal to bolster its naval capabilities.INS Aridhaman is equipped with an 83 MW pressurised water reactor and advanced sonar suites, possesses indigenous USHUS and Panchendriya sonar systems for better target detection and has improved acoustic damping with anechoic tiles to reduce noise, making it harder to detect. Once operational, it will be based at Project Varsha, a high-security facility with underground pens near Visakhapatnam.","INS Aridhaman is India’s third indigenous Arihant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine.

"Thyroid, infection drugs get fresh safety warnings after national review",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thyroid-infection-drugs-get-fresh-safety-warnings-after-national-review/articleshow/128577149.cms,"Decision taken after national review

NEW DELHI: Two medicines used widely - antibiotic doxycycline and thyroid drug carbimazole - will soon carry stronger safety warnings, following a national review of adverse drug reaction reports.After examining patient-level safety data, regulators have flagged possible mental health symptoms linked to doxycycline and a rare but potentially life-threatening blood disorder associated with carbimazole. In separate communications issued this month, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) directed all State and Union territory licensing authorities to ensure manufacturers update prescribing information and package inserts for both medicines and report compliance.For doxycycline - commonly prescribed for respiratory infections, acne, sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infection and numerous vector-borne diseases - the authorities have asked that specific central nervous system side effects be explicitly mentioned. These include restlessness, anxiety, irritability, nervousness and dizziness.The decision follows an assessment by Pharmacovigilance Programme of India, which reviewed adverse reaction reports and individual case safety data.The issue was examined at a Signal Review Panel meeting in March 2025 and later discussed by Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on antimicrobial and antiparasitic drugs in Jan 2026, which endorsed updating the official prescribing documents.While gastrointestinal discomfort and photosensitivity were already known side effects of doxycycline, the latest directive formally adds neuropsychiatric symptoms to the safety profile. Regulators have directed manufacturers of carbimazole - prescribed for hyperthyroidism, including Graves' disease - to prominently warn about agranulocytosis, a rare but serious condition marked by a sharp fall in white blood cells.Agranulocytosis can leave patients vulnerable to severe infections. Early warning signs include fever, sore throat and unexplained infections. The recommendation emerged from the 26th Signal Review Panel meeting and was subsequently reviewed by SEC on endocrinology and metabolism before being approved for inclusion in prescribing information leaflet.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of Internal Medicine at Max Hospital, Saket, said the move reflects a maturing safety system. ""CDSCO's decision on for doxycycline and carbimazole reflects a proactive and responsible pharmacovigilance system. While the medicines remain safe and effective when used appropriately, clearer warnings help both doctors and patients recognise rare but important side effects early. In the case of carbimazole, prompt attention to symptoms like fever or sore throat can be life-saving. Such regulatory steps strengthen patient safety without creating unnecessary alarm,"" he said.For patients, the updated leaflets mean clearer information on risks. For clinicians, the advisory reinforces the need to counsel patients on warning symptoms and monitor use appropriately.",Two medicines used widely - antibiotic doxycycline and thyroid drug carbimazole - will soon carry stronger safety warnings. Decision taken after national review of adverse drug reaction reports. Regulators have flagged possible mental health symptoms linked to doxy cycline.

Imphal/Churachandpur: A fractured state tried to talk to itself. For the first time since ethnic violence tore Manipur apart in May 2023, chief minister Yumnam Khemchand Singh addressed on Thursday displaced Meitei and Kuki-Zo families together - on a shared platform, if only virtually - pairing cash relief with an appeal to rebuild trust.The outreach, anchored at a relief camp in Langol of Imphal West district, connected displaced Meitei families in the valley with Kuki-Zo inmates of camps in Churachandpur and Kangpokpi via video link. Direct benefit transfers were credited during the meet.Each displaced person received Rs 2,420 for essentials. Families whose homes were burnt are being paid Rs 1 lakh in instalments, officials said.More than 260 people have been killed and over 60,000 displaced since clashes erupted between Meitei and Kuki communities in 2023. Since then, movement has been sharply curtailed - valley residents rarely enter Kuki-majority hills, and Kukis seldom travel into Imphal.Singh said resettlement had begun in peripheral areas, but restoring homes in sensitive zones remained difficult. ""Resettling IDPs (internally displaced persons) to their original places is a priority, though challenges remain. While tensions have eased, mistrust continues,"" he said, urging social groups and families to help bridge the divide.It was a modest step - cheques and promises - but the first time the state tried to stitch two wounded communities into the same conversation. Voices from camps cut through the screen. A young Kuki woman from Kangpokpi asked for access to jobs and higher education. A Meitei woman broke down, pleading to return home after three years in a camp. Another Kuki-Zo inmate flagged the struggle to reach hospitals.The CM promised security for Kuki-Zo patients visiting Imphal and special plans for about 6,000 displaced students whose schooling has been disrupted.

Why SC flagged freebies

Concern over impact on work culture &finances

Court issues notice but clarifies wider concern

Freebies: New currency of political power?

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday raised serious concerns over the growing culture of 'freebies' across states , warning that indiscriminate distribution of such benefits could hamper economic development and strain state finances. The top court also cautioned states and asked whether such a culture, without drawing a distinction between the haves and the have-nots, would amount to an ""appeasing policy.""Hearing a plea by Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Ltd, which plans to provide free electricity to all consumers regardless of their financial status, the court said welfare measures are justified for the poor, but extending them to everyone could weaken development efforts.A bench led by Chief Justice India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, pointed out that many states already face revenue deficits yet continue to announce large-scale free schemes.“Most of the states in the country are revenue deficit states and yet they are offering such freebies” overlooking development, the bench said.The judges stressed that excessive spending on freebies could slow economic progress and reduce funds available for infrastructure, jobs, and long-term growth.""The economic development of the nation will be hampered by this kind of largesse distribution. Yes, it is the State's duty to provide, but the ones who are enjoying freebies... is it not something that should be looked at?"" Chief Justice of India Surya Kant verbally observed.The CJI also questioned whether states were using their revenue wisely.""States are running into deficit but still giving freebies. See, 25 per cent of the revenue you collect in a year, why can it not be used for the development of the State?""The bench warned that indiscriminate distribution of benefits could affect productivity and reduce incentives to work.“What kind of culture are we developing in India? It is understandable that as part of the welfare measure you want to provide to those who are incapable of pay the electricity charges,” the bench asked.“But without drawing a distinction between those who can afford and those who cannot, you start distributing. Will it not amount to an appeasing policy,” the CJI asked.The court also questioned the timing of the Tamil Nadu power firm’s proposal.“The states should work to open avenues for employment. If you start giving free food from morning to evening then free cycle, then free electricity then who will work and then what will happen to the work culture,” the CJI said.JusticeBagchi added that states must properly justify such spending in their budgets.""It's not one State we are talking about, it's about all States. It is planned expenditure. Why don't you make Budget proposals and give justification that this is my outlay on unemployment of people?""Despite its sharp observations, the Suprme Court issued notice to the Centre and other parties on the petition filed by the DMK government-run power utility challenging electricity rules.The court clarified that its concern was not limited to Tamil Nadu but applied to all states offering similar schemes without proper financial planning.A report by Aequitas Investments noted that freebies have increasingly become a major electoral strategy.""As political parties compete in what appears to be a race to the bottom, welfare schemes and 'freebies' have evolved from mere campaign promises to the new currency of political power,"" the report said.","Suprme Court raises serious concerns over growing culture of 'freebies' across states.

NEW DELHI: Mere awareness drives or campaigns will not be enough to reduce violations of road traffic rules and road crashes; rather, the “certainty of enforcement” will have a greater deterrent impact, Union road transport secretary V Umashankar said on Thursday while sharing details of the recently notified e-challan rules.Speaking at the release of the New Delhi Road Safety Declaration at the National Road Safety Confluence held at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Umashankar questioned whether a juvenile (referring to a recent case in Delhi) did not know that he was underage and should not have been driving a car, or whether the vehicle owner who modified a tourist bus — resulting in the deaths of more than 20 people in a fire — did not know that such modifications were illegal.“Forty-five percent of fatalities involve two-wheelers or people riding two-wheelers. We find that most of these deaths occurred because the rider was not wearing a helmet. Does he not know that wearing a helmet is good for him?” he observed. Umashankar said, “Awareness is not enough — what we need is organised, district-level action, backed by certainty of enforcement and supported by strong institutions. When compliance becomes a habit and accountability becomes certain, road safety will move from intention to impact.Mats-Ake Belin, global lead for the Decade of Action for Road Safety at the World Health Organization, said that road safety is now firmly on the global agenda, with strong political and media attention. “Our responsibility is to move beyond awareness and ensure consistent, evidence-based implementation so that no country is left behind in preventing road traffic deaths,” he added.The New Delhi Road Safety Declaration, aligned with the WHO Decade of Action for Road Safety, states that India records the highest number of road fatalities globally, with vulnerable road users — such as pedestrians, cyclists, two-wheeler riders, gig workers, and rural communities — being the most affected. Despite several initiatives, the absence of coordinated, institution-led action has limited national impact. “The declaration addresses this gap by adopting a Safe System approach, placing human life at the centre of all mobility decisions,” it said.The declaration, spearheaded by the Bharat Association of Road Safety Volunteers (BARS), an organisation comprising members from diverse fields, has set five pillars of action: strengthening road safety management through leadership at all levels; promoting open crash data, annual public reviews, dedicated funding, and enhanced enforcement; ensuring safer vehicles and fleets; promoting safer road users and improved post-crash response; and creating a safer driving environment.Participants included representatives from ministries, WHO and other multilateral agencies, civil society, academia, industry bodies, OEMs, technology innovators, and youth groups.","V Umashankar: What we need is organised, district-level action, backed by certainty of enforcement and supported by strong institutions. “When compliance becomes a habit and accountability becomes certain, road safety will move from intention to impact,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128575122,imgsize-17756,width-400,resizemode-4/v-umashankar.jpg"

How controversy unfolded

Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj

Tipu Sultan

Why did it explode into controversy



BJP activists protest against Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal's remarks equating Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with Tipu Sultan outside Congress Bhavan, in Pune.

From portrait to protests



Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis pays tribute to the greatest king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Shivtirtha, Ichalkaranji, in Kolhapur.

History does not always stay in textbooks. Sometimes, it returns framed on a wall. In Malegaon, a portrait of the 18th-century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan , briefly placed inside the office of a newly-elected deputy mayor, triggered a political controversy that has travelled far beyond the municipal corporation building where it began.Within 48 hours, the image was removed by the civic administration, the matter escalated into a war of words between Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal, protests broke out in multiple cities, and eight people were injured in stone pelting in Pune.At the centre of the row was not merely the presence of Tipu Sultan’s portrait but Sapkal’s statement comparing him with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as belonging “to the same league of valour”. The chief minister described the comparison as “unacceptable” and said the Congress politician should be “ashamed”. What followed was a familiar pattern in Indian public life where history, memory, symbolism and contemporary political positioning intersect.The controversy began after Shiv Sena corporators in Malegaon objected to the display of Tipu Sultan’s portrait in deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed’s office.A delegation met Malegaon civic chief Ravindra Jadhav, demanding that it be removed and warning of an agitation if the administration failed to act. The Malegaon Municipal Corporation on Saturday removed the portrait from the office.Jadhav confirmed that the administration examined the state government’s official protocol list, which outlines leaders whose anniversaries are observed and whose portraits are permitted for display in government offices, before taking the action. “Tipu Sultan’s name is not included in the list. Therefore, the portrait was removed from the deputy mayor’s office,” MMC officials said.Ahmed, however, defended the figure’s historical relevance. “Tipu Sultan fought against the British and was acknowledged for his bravery at that time. There are roads named after him in Mumbai and Nagpur. This is an attempt to divert attention from our work. Some people are unable to digest that two Muslim women are mayor and deputy mayor in Malegaon,” she told reporters.When asked about the controversy, Sapkal, speaking in Buldhana on Saturday, said, “He (Tipu Sultan) waged a war against the British and was a brave warrior. He was a son of the soil. He never entertained poisonous or divisive thoughts. We should view Tipu Sultan as an equal to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a symbol of bravery,” he said.CM Fadnavis called the comparison unacceptable. Congress “should be ashamed of equating the founder of Hindavi Swarajya with Tipu Sultan, who butchered 1,000s of Hindus,” he said.The episode reopened an older historical debate that has periodically entered political discourse as both figures occupy significant but very different spaces in Indian history.Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born in 1630, is widely regarded as the founder of the Maratha state and the architect of Hindavi Swarajya. His military campaigns against the Mughal Empire and regional sultanates laid the foundation for a political formation that eventually expanded into one of the most powerful empires in early modern India.Shivaji’s legacy in Maharashtra is not confined to historical admiration alone. He represents resistance, self-rule, regional pride, and a warrior ethos deeply embedded in the state’s socio-political consciousness.Tipu Sultan, born in 1751, ruled the Kingdom of Mysore during a period of intense conflict between Indian polities and the expanding British East India Company. Alongside his father, Hyder Ali, he waged multiple wars against British forces and is remembered in several accounts as one of the earliest rulers to adopt modern military technologies such as iron-cased rockets.In 1799, Tipu Sultan died fighting the British during the siege of Srirangapatna.For many historians, Tipu Sultan’s significance lies in his sustained resistance to colonial expansion. For others, particularly in regions such as parts of Karnataka and Kerala, he remains a contested figure due to accounts of forced conversions, temple desecrations and harsh campaigns against certain communities.The debate over his rule has persisted for decades and has often been shaped by political context as much as archival evidence. These differing interpretations have given Tipu Sultan a complex afterlife in contemporary politics.In Maharashtra, Shivaji Maharaj occupies an almost sacred position across ideological lines, but particularly within the political vocabulary of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Shiv Sena.The Maratha ruler is frequently invoked as a symbol of indigenous sovereignty, martial pride and cultural assertion. References to Hindavi Swarajya resonate strongly with narratives centred on civilisational identity and self-determination.Any perceived attempt to equate Shivaji Maharaj with another historical figure, especially one whose legacy is contested, therefore carries political sensitivity.BJP leaders have argued that comparisons diminish the unique historical role of Shivaji Maharaj. BJP Pune city president Dheeraj Ghate said, “Sapkal’s remarks deeply hurt the sentiments of all those who idolise Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a deity. It is a deliberate attempt to create a rift in society.”For the Congress, Tipu Sultan has at times represented anti-colonial resistance and an inclusive strand of historical nationalism. In southern states, especially Karnataka, Congress governments have celebrated Tipu Jayanti, framing him as a freedom fighter who resisted British rule.Political opponents, particularly from the BJP and allied organisations, have long argued that such commemorations reflect an attempt at minority outreach, with the emphasis on Tipu’s anti-British legacy seen by them as part of a broader effort to counter the rise of Hindutva-centred historical narratives.This divergence in emphasis reflects deeper ideological differences in how the past is mobilised in present day politics. While the BJP’s political messaging often foregrounds civilisational continuity and indigenous cultural pride aligned with Hindutva thought, the Congress has tended to promote pluralist interpretations of history that critics frequently characterise as accommodative or appeasement-driven in their political intent.The political undertone of invoking either figure is therefore significant. Shivaji Maharaj serves as a unifying icon in Maharashtra, but also as a potent symbol within a wider discourse on identity, sovereignty and cultural resurgence associated with Hindutva politics.Tipu Sultan, by contrast, often becomes a focal point in debates where his remembrance is interpreted by critics through the prism of Muslim appeasement versus majoritarian assertions of historical identity.The controversy in Malegaon quickly spread beyond the initial administrative decision. BJP and right organisation supporters protested in Nagpur, Nashik, Ahilyanagar, Sangli, Solapur, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nanded, Latur and elsewhere. In Pune, Patit Pawan Sanghatana members were the first to assemble in front of the Congress Bhawan on Sunday morning, condemning Sapkal's remarks.Around 12.30 pm, BJP workers, including mayor Manjusha Nagpure, reached the site and started sloganeering and showing posters. By then, about 100 Congress workers reached the site and started raising counter slogans.“As the sloganeering was on from both sides, someone hurled a stone. This set off stone pelting by members from either side,” additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil said. “Two women constables, two reporters and two workers each from BJP and Congress were injured. “The nature of injuries was not serious,” he said.As political leaders weighed in, the debate widened. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi defended Tipu Sultan, saying, “In 1799, Tipu Sultan died fighting the British,” and added, “He did not sit in jail and write love letters to the British.”Meanwhile, Telangana BJP president N Ramchander Rao said by glorifying Tipu Sultan, the AIMIM “is distorting history”.Amid mounting criticism, Sapkal later clarified his remarks. “My statement was misinterpreted by the BJP for political benefits. I said that there cannot be anyone like Shivaji Maharaj, and Tipu Sultan took inspiration from him.” He subsequently expressed regret, saying, “I did not say anything wrong about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The question of comparison does not arise; I did not make one.”He described Shivaji Maharaj as ""my ideal, my inspiration and my pride,"" and appealed for calm. “If any Shiv devotees' sentiments were hurt because of misuse of my words, I sincerely express regret. It was never my intention to hurt anyone's feelings. Let us put this matter to rest here.”Yet, the episode illustrates how historical figures continue to function as political signifiers in contemporary India. Portraits in public offices are rarely neutral. They signal not only admiration but also affiliation, narrative and sometimes ideological positioning.As demonstrations spread and leaders traded charges over historical interpretation, the controversy showed no immediate sign of abating. What began as the placement of a portrait has become a reminder that in Indian politics, the past remains an active participant in the present. The images on the wall often speak as loudly as the speeches delivered beneath them.","A portrait of 18th-century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan was briefly placed inside the office of a newly-elected deputy mayor in Malegaon. Within 48 hours, the image was removed by the civic administration, the matter escalated into a war of words between Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal. The episode reopened an older historical debate that has periodically entered political discourse.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128566218,imgsize-348316,width-400,resizemode-4/bjp-activists-protest-in-pune.jpg"

SRINAGAR: Operations were suspended at the 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir after it got flooded two days ago.As water entered the project’s machine room, engineers immediately halted power generation to prevent damage to critical electro-mechanical components. The project, located in Ramban district, is a major contributor to the region’s power supply. As the project’s stage 1 remains suspended, stage 2 which adds another 450 MW capacity, will be operational. It has not been impacted by the flooding, officials said.A senior official called it minor flooding which happened during scheduled maintenance. Stage 1 was anyway scheduled to remain closed for three months for repair works, the official said. “Since stage 1 has to stay shut for 90 days, we will operate stage 2 during the period,” he said.The official said stage 1 typically runs at full load for seven to eight months and at partial load for three to four months annually. Stage 2, however, operates only for about four months, from July to Sept, as per design, as there is not enough discharge to run both stages simultaneously during lean period. “Now that stage 1 is shut down for repairs, we will run stage 2, which otherwise remains closed during the lean period,” he said.","The 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir got flooded two days ago.

Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman Makes BIG Promise To Hindus As India Detains Hindu Cop Killer In Delhi

NEW DELHI: With Muhammad Yunus ’ departure from the power centre in Dhaka, steps are under way to “fully restore” all Indian visa services, India’s senior consular official in Sylhet, Aniruddha Das, has confirmed.Aniruddha Roy on Thursday assured full cooperation to strengthen India-Bangladesh relations and said efforts are being made to ease visa services.Speaking at the Sylhet District Press Club, he said medical and double-entry visas are currently being issued, and steps are under way to resume other categories, including travel visas.“Medical and double-entry visas are being issued now, and steps are under way to resume other categories, including travel visas,” BD News24 quoted him saying.He said India-Bangladesh ties are based on mutual respect and shared interests.“India-Bangladesh relations stand on the foundation of mutual respect and honour. The people of both countries will be the principal stakeholders of a stable, positive, constructive, long-term and mutually beneficial relationship,” he said.He added that both countries share cultural links and common goals, and cooperation can help create new opportunities.“We should transform our geographical and cultural proximity, growing economic capacity, and future aspirations into new opportunities through cooperation,” he said.He also said journalists can play an important role in strengthening ties between the two countries.“Through objective reporting and constructive criticism, journalists can further reinforce and strengthen this relationship,” he added.Days earlier, Bangladesh entered a new political phase after Tarique Rahman took charge as the country’s new prime minister. Following the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s landslide victory, securing a two-thirds majority, Rahman invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend his swearing-in ceremony.Prime Minister Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s victory and later invited him to visit India after he took oath.India-Bangladesh relations had come under strain after Sheikh Hasina ’s exile in August 2024. Ties were affected during the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, particularly after India provided refuge to the former prime minister Hasina. This led to tensions between the two countries, with several reports highlighting diplomatic unease in recent months.India had also expressed concern over incidents of violence against minorities, especially the Hindu community, during the period of unrest in Bangladesh under Yunus’ interim government.","India-Bangladesh relations had come under strain after Sheikh Hasina ’s exile in August 2024.

NEW DELHI: Israel on Thursday condemned the attack on two Indian workers in the city of Ashkelon, calling the incident “absolutely unacceptable.”The Israeli embassy in India also denounced the assault and said action had been taken against those responsible. In a post on X, it said, “The attack on two Indian workers yesterday in Ashkelon by delinquents is absolutely unacceptable. The Israeli police have caught the perpetrators and will bring them to justice.”The two workers were reportedly beaten in Ashkelon, located about 50 km from Tel Aviv. Israeli media described the assault as a “targeted, racially motivated attack.”Congress leader Pawan Khera raised concerns over the incident and urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to intervene. In a post on X, he said, “It was a premeditated racist assault, planned over private chats. This is not the first such attack. And sadly, it may not be the last.”He added, “The government’s failure to generate adequate employment at home has pushed Indian labourers to seek work in Israel. It celebrates Indo-Israel ‘friendship’ when sending Indian labourers there. But when our people face barbaric treatment, it falls silent and shrugs off responsibility.”Tagging Jaishankar, he said the minister “should urgently look into the matter, confirm the victim’s condition, and ensure he has access to adequate, free-of-cost medical care if required.”Khera also questioned whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi would raise the issue during his upcoming visit to Israel. “PM Modi is visiting Israel soon, will he raise the issue of racism and violent attacks against Indian nationals in Israel?” he asked.According to TRT World, the incident comes at a time when India has chosen not to join more than 80 countries that criticised Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank in a joint statement at the United Nations.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Israel next week, marking his second trip to the country since 2017.","The two workers were reportedly beaten in Ashkelon, located about 50 km from Tel Aviv.

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India as he is legally barred from leaving the United Kingdom.In a statement submitted through his counsel Amit Desai, Mallya said that he does not have an active Indian passport and is also restrained by court orders in England and Wales from travelling outside the UK.The submission came after a bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad last week made it clear that it would not hear his plea challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender unless he returns to India.The court had asked Mallya to clarify whether he intended to come back to the country.Mallya, who has been based in the UK since leaving India in March 2016, has filed two petitions before the high court, one challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender and another questioning the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act.In his statement read out in court, Mallya said that he cannot give a definite date for his return as his passport was revoked by the Indian government in 2016 and because courts in England and Wales have prohibited him from leaving the country.“Mallya is not permitted to leave or attempt to leave England and Wales or apply for or be in possession of any international travel document. In any event, the petitioner is unable to precisely state when he will return to India,” Desai read out from the statement.The senior counsel further argued that Mallya’s physical presence in India was not necessary for the court to hear his pleas against the fugitive tag and the provisions of the Act.“If he (Mallya) were to appear in India, then all these proceedings would be rendered irrelevant as the statute says that once the offender appears in the concerned court of law, then all these orders would be set aside,” Desai told the court.Mallya, 70, faces multiple cases of alleged fraud and money laundering linked to the default of loans amounting to several thousand crores. He was declared a Fugitive Economic Offender in January 2019 by a special court hearing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The high court has directed the Union government to file its reply to Mallya’s statement and posted the matter for further hearing next month.","Vijay Mallya tells Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India.

New Delhi: More than six years after its enactment sparked riots in Delhi, the Supreme Court on Thursday scheduled a four-day final hearing from May 5 on 243 petitions challenging the validity of Citizenship (Amendment) Act that provides a pathway for citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians who may reach India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said the petitioners, that include Muslim organisations among which Indian Union of Muslim League has been termed the lead petitioner, and functionaries from Congress, TMC and AIMIM, would conclude their arguments within one and half days and the Centre would respond in a similar time frame. May 12 has been kept for rejoinders to be filed by petitioners.On Dec 18, 2019, a three-judge bench, which included Justice Kant, had issued notice to the Centre on the petitions challenging CAA on the ground of discrimination against Muslims who came to India from neighbouring countries but were not entitled to citizenship under CAA.Protesters, mainly Muslim women supported by political parties, had blocked a major arterial road in Shaheen Bagh here from Dec 15, 2019 till March 24, 2020.Blockades were organised in other parts of the city too. The resultant tension triggered riots in northeast Delhi on Feb 23, 2020 that lasted several days and left 53 dead.SC had last heard the petitions on March 19, 2024, the year the Centre framed Citizenship (Amendment) Rules. The Centre had filed its response to the petitions in Oct 2022 and termed CAA a benign piece of legislation providing Indian citizenship to members of those communities who have been persecuted for the last 70 years in the three neighbouring Islamic countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.Countering the plea that CAA discriminated against Muslims, the Centre had said, ""CAA does not seek to recognise or seek to provide answers to all or any kind of purported persecution that may be taking place across the world or that may have taken place previously anywhere in the world.""On Thursday, the bench agreed with solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the challenge to CAA in relation to Assam and Tripura, where separate accords set deadlines for entry of migrants from Bangladesh, could be de-linked from the ones which have questioned the law from a pan-India perspective.","Citizenship (Amendment) Act provides pathway for citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians who may reach India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

MUMBAI: A suit dating back to the year India got independence finally stood disposed of by the Bombay high court this month, with the fourth generation of the original land owner amicably settling a property dispute. The estate included vast portions of the village of Dahisar in north Mumbai. The area was a whopping 2,891 acres or over 1,100 hectares. It was 3.5 times the size of Central Park in New York.Over the decades, the legal battle saw repeated pleas against sale of parcels of land in Dahisar to private parties, as well as an acquisition by the state under the Salsette Law and Forest Act.Justice Farhan Dubash, one of the newest judges of the high court, put a quietus via a consent term order to the legal tussle 78 years, or over three quarters of a century later, on a suit filed on Oct 7, 1947.The original suit had sought administration of the estate of one Haji Alimohammed Haji Cassum following his demise, as per personal laws applicable. It was filed by Badrushama, widow of Suleman Haji Alimohammed Haji Cassum, versus Salim Dawood Agboatwala and others.Justice Dubash, began his order with: ""This order disposes of probably the oldest Suit that is currently pending before the Bombay high court.""Over the years, several orders were passed in the matter, including a preliminary decree passed on Nov 25, 1952 that determined the legal share of all heirs.Before that, the HC appointed a court receiver in 1950 to look after the property. Successive generations continued the legal battle before the HC. Finally, with the litigation entering the fourth generation, all heirs decided to amicably settle. They filed consent terms before the HC on Feb 5. The terms were accepted, and the suit was struck off from a pendency list to a disposed one.This verdict resulted in one of the longest pending cases in the history of the Bombay HC coming to a close.The HC recorded the agreement arrived at between the parties after hearing Kevic Setalvad, senior counsel with advocate Vijaylaxmi Kulkarni appearing for the plaintiffs, and Anupam Surve, counsel with solicitor Nanu Hormasjee and Co for contesting heirs.The settlement was between Ateeq Anwar Agboatwala, a power of attorney holder for the first plaintiff, and other members of the Agboatwala family.At the end of the settlement, what was payable to the court receiver towards costs and charges in the matter was Rs 7 lakh. After deducting this amount, the rest of the undisclosed amount is to be returned on or before Feb 20, 2026 to the family.","A suit dating back to the year India got independence finally stood disposed of by the Bombay high court.

PM Modi Pushes Human Centric AI Model, Launches MANAV Framework At Mega AI Impact Summit 2026

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed on Thursday for democratisation of AI, saying it must become a tool for inclusion and empowerment and a force for global good, especially across the Global South, while taking aim at countries and companies that consider AI to be a strategic asset that must be developed in secrecy.Questioning the walls that have come up around the development of AI as it is leveraged by countries and companies as a force and profit multiplier, Modi said India thinks different. ""It is said sunlight is the best disinfectant. We believe AI will benefit the world only when it is shared. When codes are open and shared, millions of young minds can make them safer and better. Therefore, let us resolve to develop AI as a global common good,"" he said.Speaking at the AI Impact Summit and with heads of foreign govts and tech giants and representatives of 100 countries in audience, Modi cautioned against reducing individuals to ""mere data points or raw material"" and unveiled India's approach of ""MANAV"" framework of ""responsible AI"". He said AI's transformative power must be a multiplier.At a time when fears have grown about AI, which, while generating impressive benefits in diverse fields, can lead to risks ranging from autonomous weapon systems, machines breaking free of control of developers, and breakthroughs widening the gap between powerful countries and others, the PM struck a positive yet cautious note.He noted the wariness about the consequences which could have not been imagined until very recently, but focused on the enthusiasm with which the youth have approached, what he called, the latest of turning points in history.""Today, the world is divided into two kinds of people: those who see fear in AI and speak only of that fear, and those who see fortune in AI. I say with responsibility and with pride that India does not see fear in AI, India sees fortune in AI. India sees the future in AI,"" Modi said.He acknowledged the task that govts and societies face and said while history has seen many turning points, the transformative change represented by AI is unprecedented in terms of speed and scale.The PM sought to strike a balance between increasingly desperate cries for regulating AI and those saying that curbs could stifle innovation, thus nipping potential breakthroughs, which hold the key to challenges of Alzheimer's, cancer and climate change. ""We must give AI the open sky, but keep the command in our hands. Just like GPS - it suggests the route - but the final decision of direction is ours. The path we choose for AI today will determine the future we create tomorrow,"" he said.On Wednesday, senior White House policy adviser on Artificial Intelligence, Sriram Krishnan, had said that the US wants to make sure that the world uses the American AI stack.Modi said India's perspective on AI is reflected in the theme of the summit - Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya - Welfare for all, Happiness for all' - and that is India's benchmark. He said that the emergence of AI is a turning point for human civilisation and urged global leaders and innovators to ensure that the technology remains human-centric, inclusive and ethically governed.Highlighting the need for setting up of global standards, PM flagged deepfakes and fabricated content that are bringing instability to open societies. Drawing a parallel with nutrition labels on food which make a person aware of what they are eating, the PM said the digital world should have authenticity labels on content so that people know what is real and what is created by AI.""As Artificial Intelligence is creating more text, images and videos, the need for watermarking and clear source standards in the industry is increasing. That's why it's necessary that this trust be built in to technology from the beginning,"" he added.The PM said alongside the present generation, there is a need to consider what form of AI will future generations get. Drawing another parallel with nuclear power, where the world has seen its destructive force, and its positive contributions, Modi said, ""AI, too, is a transformative power - if directionless, it leads to disruption; if guided rightly, it becomes a solution. How to make AI human-centric, sensitive and responsible is the core purpose of AI Impact Summit,"" he added.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed for democratisation of AI, saying it must become a tool for inclusion and empowerment.

'Bulls***t': Macron Slams Social Media's 'Free Speech' Rhetoric, Calls For Algorithm Transparency

Govts must work together for safe Net: Macron

PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday spoke on the need to shield children from the harms of AI and social media. ""We must become even more vigilant about children's safety. Just as a school syllabus is carefully curated, the AI space too must be child-safe and family-guided,"" Modi said at the India AI Impact Summit.Addressing the summit earlier, Macron expressed hope that India would join France and other countries in banning social media networks for children under 15 years of age, emphasising that protecting children is about not just regulation but civilisation as well. He said there was no reason to expose children to content online that is legally forbidden in the real world.The French leader struck a bullish note on India being part of AI revolution and benefiting from it. Backing India and Europe's AI aspirations, he said India had proved the world wrong after being told a decade ago that 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy.On a ban on social media networks for children under 15 years of age, Macron said France is embarking on the journey, with several European countries also committed to it.Australia has become the first country to ban social media for children under 16 and, in India, BJP ally TDP has pushed for a regulation along similar lines.""I know, Mr Prime Minister, you will join this club. And this is great news that India will join such an approach to protect children and teenagers,"" he said, referring to Narendra Modi who was in the audience along with other global leaders and tech bigwigs. IT minister Ashwini Vaishnav had on Tuesday said that India was debating the issue of restricting children's access to social media.""Our platforms, govts and regulators should be working together to make the Internet and social media a safe space,"" Macron said.He also emphasised France's shared vision with India to ensure access to AI for everyone at a time when it has become a ""major field of strategic competition"".""Hegemony from any quarter is not a fatality. There is a path for innovation, independence and strategic autonomy. And this path, I'm convinced, is what countries like France and India must take together,"" he said, heaping praise on India for its advances in providing digital access, be it for identity or financial transaction, to its entire population. ""That is not just a tech story. That is a civilisation story,"" he said.""Access to Al for all is critical. France and India share a common vision: a sovereign Al used to protect our planet and to foster prosperity for all."" He said the future of Al will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, and technology with humanity. ""India and France will help shape this future together. We are determined to continue to shape the rules of the game. And to do it with our allies because we believe in core shared values.

Visakhapatnam: Defence minister Rajnath Singh urged global powers to confront fast-evolving, intertwined maritime risks through cooperation rooted in respect and reciprocity, as India opened its largest-ever multilateral naval exercise, Exercise MILAN-2026.""When our ships sail together, when our sailors train together, and when our commanders deliberate together, we build a shared understanding that transcends geography and politics,"" he said on Thursday.The defence minister addressed visiting navy chiefs and delegations from nine Asean members at the inaugural ceremony, welcoming participation that has grown from four foreign navies in 1995 to 74 nations this year.Navies now shoulder a broader burden as global commerce surges and competition sharpens around chokepoints and channels, he said. Interest in underwater resources, including rare earth minerals, is rising. Terror networks spanning borders complicate security, while climate change is intensifying disasters and pushing humanitarian missions to the fore. ""No single navy, however capable, can address these challenges alone,"" Singh said.Inviting Asean countries to tap India's expanding defence-industrial base, he said the govt's Aatmanirbhar Bharat push led by PM Narendra Modi has transformed India into a ""builder's navy"". He cited aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and the Visakhapatnam-class destroyers as proof of growing indigenous shipbuilding capacity.Singh traced India's maritime outlook from SAGAR to its expanded vision, MAHASAGAR, signalling wider engagement. He backed United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as a durable framework and called for stronger global naval architecture. India, he said, will remain a steady ""vishwa mitra"" in the Indo-Pacific.","Rajnath Singh urges global powers to confront fast-evolving, intertwined maritime risks through cooperation rooted in respect and reciprocity.

NEW DELHI: TMC MP Mahua Moitra moved Delhi high court on Thursday, challenging a district court order refusing to grant her shared custody of a pet Rottweiler called Henry. The lawmaker had sought interim custody of Henry for 10 days every month.HC sought the stand of Moitra's former partner and advocate, Jai Anant Dehadrai, on her appeal and asked him to file his response. Dehadrai appeared in person and contended that the petition should be dismissed at this stage itself, arguing that it had no merits. HC listed the case for hearing on April 29.In her appeal, Moitra argued that the district court's decision was ""bad in law and on facts"" as it failed to consider that Henry was given to her as her pet ""to be loved and cared for"" and primarily resided at her residence, except when she was away on constituency duties, during which time the dog stayed with Dehadrai.Dehadrai has argued that the dog was purchased by him in 2021. Moitra contended that owing to her friendship at the time with Dehadrai, she was entitled to joint custody of the pet. Last year, HC had advised the parties to ""sit together"" and sort out the dispute. Both claimed Henry belonged to them and accused each other of ""kidnapping"".","TMC MP Mahua Moitra moved Delhi high court on Thursday, challenging a district court order refusing to grant her shared custody of a pet Rottweiler.

NEW DELHI: Smoking on board an aircraft, with lavatories being one of the favourite places for this illegal act, could soon get one arrested and also put on the no-fly list.

'We have given Pakistan very generously but ...

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and former diplomat Shashi Tharoor , leading an all-party delegation, arrived in Colombia 's Bogota on Thursday as part of a diplomatic outreach to brief global partners on India’s recent counterterrorism action, Operation Sindoor , and to reaffirm India’s firm position on, now suspended, the Indus Waters Treaty , a long-standing pact between India and Pakistan Addressing the media in Colombian capital, Tharoor highlighted India’s evolving approach to terrorism and the broader diplomatic consequences of continued crossborder threats.Speaking about the suspension of the water-sharing agreement with Pakistan, Thiruvananthapuram MP said, ""The Indus Waters Treaty was one that was offered by India to Pakistan in the early 1960s in a spirit of goodwill and harmony. In fact, those words occur in the preamble of the treaty; sadly, that goodwill has been repeatedly betrayed by the terrorist actions of the last four decades.""He added, ""Even though we have had terrorism and war inflicted on us, the treaty has remained in place, but this time our government has placed the treaty in abeyance, which means it is in effect suspended. Its operations are suspended until such time as we get satisfactory indication from Pakistan that they're prepared to conduct themselves in that spirit of goodwill that is provided for in the preamble of the treaty.Tharoor also pointed out India’s restraint over the years: ""We are very conscious that we have been a generous neighbour when it comes to the operation of the treaty. We are in an upper riparian state. We have given Pakistan very generously the waters that they are entitled to under the treaty, and we have not even used all the waters we are entitled to under the treaty. But the time for acting on the basis of goodwill unilaterally is frankly no longer with us. ..""Reacting to Colombia’s diplomatic response to India’s recent strikes on terror camps, Tharoor said, ""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism...""He further added, ""We will say to our friends in Colombia, there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding. We're very happy to talk to Colombia in some detail about the circumstances. We have, as I said, very concrete proof. In fact, when this terrorist attack occurred, it was immediately claimed by an organisation called The Resistance Front, which is a unit of the Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, Pakistan... Just as Colombia has endured many terror attacks, so have we in India. We have endured a very large number of attacks for almost four decades.""Tharoor also recalled the recent terror strike that prompted India’s military response: ""India suffered a grievous terrorist attack on the 22nd of April... When this happened, of course, the world rose up to condemn the terrorist attack, but that was as far as it went. There was no action taken, not even by the country where these people had emerged from, Pakistan. Nobody was arrested, and there was no attempt at any prosecution. India decided that this kind of outrage could not go unpunished. On May 7, India chose to strike against known terror bases and launch pads.""Tharoor is leading a broad all-party parliamentary delegation touring countries in the Americas to explain India’s counterterrorism operation launched on May 7 and to counter Pakistan’s global narrative.The outreach is part of India’s diplomatic push to promote its zero-tolerance approach to terrorism.The delegation includes representatives from across the political spectrum, Congress, BJP, Shiv Sena, JMM, TDP, LJP - as well as former Indian ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Their visit began at the 9/11 Memorial in New York, a symbolic gesture linking global victims of terrorism and reinforcing the shared nature of the threat.Among the members are Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G M Harish Balayagi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, Bhubaneswar Kalita (BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), Milind Deora (Shiv Sena), and Taranjit Singh Sandhu.The all-party delegation is structured into seven groups, each led by one MP, to engage in wide-ranging discussions with governments, think tanks, and media across the region, seeking to strengthen India’s position in the global fight against terrorism.","Congress MP and former diplomat Shashi Tharoor is leading an all-party delegation to Colombia.

A frightening video has gone viral on social media, showing a furious wild rhino attacking a tourist vehicle and nearly overturning it. The incident was recorded in the Salbari Range at Manas National Park in Assam on Thursday.There were no injuries reported however, it caused fear amongst the group of tourists that were attacked.In the video, the rhino can be seen approaching the jeep, which had stopped on a forest path. The animal repeatedly tries to flip the vehicle.Few minutes later, a couple of men were seen chasing the rhino away.During the monsoon season, rhinos often leave their natural habitat seeking refugee from flooded areas and to find better grazing spots. This increases the chances of human-wildlife conflict. Many social media users have raised concerns about the safety of using open jeeps in such areas.There have been frequent rhino attacks on humans but the exact reason behind their aggression is unknown.","A wild rhino attacked a tourist vehicle in Assam, India.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , one of the leaders of seven all-party delegations, on Thursday (local time) expressed disappointment over Colombia's condolences for the people who lost their lives in Pakistan when India launched a counterstrike on May 7, and said that there can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. He added that India was only exercising its right of self-defence.Tharoor, who is in Columbia as part of the Centre's move, has also shown the picture of Pakistani Army officials attending the funerals of terrorists after India's strike on their terror bases and said that if there is any misunderstanding the delegation is here to clear that.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism.

""He highlighted Pakistan's role in providing terrorists with sanctuary and support.""There (in Pakistan) was a well-publicised funeral of one of the terrorists on the sanctions list. That funeral was attended by uniformed senior military and police personnel from Pakistan.

World's longest hairball removed from teen's stomach at SMS Hosp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worlds-longest-hairball-removed-from-teens-stomach-at-sms-hosp/articleshow/121501576.cms,"Photo/Agencies

JAIPUR: The SMS Hospital doctors surgically removed a 210-centimetre-long trichobezoar (a collection of hair) from the stomach of a 14-year-old girl, a resident of Barara village in Agra district of Uttar Pradesh, on Tuesday. It is believed to be the longest trichobezoar ever recorded in the world. The previous record stood at 180 cm.The trichobezoar was entangled throughout the small intestine, which made the surgery a challenging task. Removing it in one piece was a major challenge, as breaking it could have necessitated multiple incisions in the intestines. In the operation, which lasted about two hours, and notably, no blood transfusion was required, the doctors managed to remove trichobezoar in one piece.The girl was brought to the SMS hospital with complaint of abdominal pain and vomiting for over a month. Upon examination, doctors found a hard mass in her abdomen stretching from the stomach to the navel and the upper right part of the abdomen. A CECT (Contrast Enhanced CT scan) revealed a swollen stomach containing an unusual object.The girl was diagnosed with a psychological condition known as Pica, where a person eats non-edible substances. ""She began with ingesting chalk in her school since Class 6, influenced by her peers' behaviour, and later she started eating hair. As we operated upon her, we found wooden pieces, rubber bands, pieces of stones, threads and other non-food items closely packed in the bunch of hair forming a long trichobezoar,"" said Dr Jeevan Kankaria, of surgery department at SMS Hospital,""When we measured, we found it 210 cm long, which is the world's longest trichobezoar ever removed from the stomach of a patient. We will apply for a Guinness World Record for it,"" said Kankaria, who has four Guinness World Records in surgeries.The girl is now receiving treatment in the hospital. She will be discharged soon once the doctors ensure that her condition has improved. The girl is a Class 10 student and belongs to a farmer family.","A 210-centimetre-long trichobezoar (a collection of hair) was removed from the stomach of a 14-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh.

PANAJI: At 5.22pm Thursday, as Lt Cdrs Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy stepped on Indian soil after a 239-day historic voyage, they became the first Indian duo to sail across the planet.""Yes. We made it."" These four words from Dilna summed up the poignant and emotional 25,400-nautical-mile journey that began Oct 2 from the banks of the Mandovi.""We saw the ocean and waves rising in anger some days. The waves were as high as 20 feet tall, looking like a wall. But we also had days when the sea was as calm as a mirror, and it felt heavenly, and time felt meaningless,"" said Roopa, narrating their audacious endeavour to fly the Tricolour and naval ensign ""in every sea and land across the world"".The circumnavigation took them through four oceans, crossing the equator twice and rounding the three great capes - a route acknowledged as the gold standard in ocean sailing. The mission was part of the Navy's broader initiative to showcase women's role in maritime operations. It also aimed to inspire a new generation of women to embrace adventure and take to the seas - a domain long dominated by men.""I feel I lived all my seven lives in these eight months.This is not going to be my last journey, I am sorry,"" said Roopa with a laugh, as she addressed her family.The voyage tested not just mental endurance but seamanship too. The naval officers navigated some of the world's most treacherous waters, including the South Pacific and the Southern Ocean. They battled towering waves, gale-force winds and long spells of isolation with only each other for company and their 56-foot yacht as their shelter.During the circumnavigation, the duo suffered a complete navigation blackout in the middle of the night in the Pacific Ocean. ""We lost GPS, boat heading, wind instrument, auto-pilot... everything. It took us three hours, but it felt like an eternity to get back the systems. This actually gave us a false sense of security in modern equipment,"" Roopa said.The duo covered 25,400 nautical miles over a period of eight months with port calls at Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falkland Islands) and Cape Town (South Africa).Commander Abhilash Tomy (retd), the first Indian to sail around the Earth non-stop, provided mentorship to the duo. His survival and maintenance experience helped the duo master the critical skill of dual-handed sailing. Captain Vipul Mehershi, Captain Atul Sinha, and Commander Nikhil Hegde also played a key role in preparing the officers and the vessel for the expedition.The two naval officers' triumphant return at Mormugao Port was witnessed by defence minister Rajnath Singh and chief of naval staff Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi.","Lt Cdrs Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy became the first Indian duo to sail across the planet.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26.

Poll Should national security decisions be influenced by foreign powers? No, they must be made independently Yes, if it serves long-term strategic interests

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Thursday claimed that the 1988 nuclear agreement between India and Pakistan was signed under pressure from the United States, during the tenure of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Sharing what he described as a declassified letter on X, Dubey alleged that then US President Ronald Reagan had dictated the agenda of talks between New Delhi and Islamabad.“Under American pressure, we spoke to Pakistani President General Zia. The agenda for the talks was set by the US President,” Dubey posted on X.“What we understood after this letter was that Pakistan and we did the nuclear deal in 1988 under American pressure.”“Why is Congress angry? When I saw this paper, I felt ashamed,” he added, attaching a copy of the letter that he said was addressed by Reagan to Rajiv Gandhi.Dubey also accused the Congress-led government of aligning with US interests in its foreign policy decisions.“Whatever we talked to our friend Soviet Russia about on the Afghanistan problem was an American agenda. Is this the Shimla Agreement? Is the Iron Lady the mentality of slavery? Were we a sovereign nation at that time? Is Congress abusing Modi Ji to make India stronger?” he wrote.The 1988 agreement between India and Pakistan, officially known as the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, was signed on 31 December 1988 and came into force on 27 January 1991. It obligates both nations to annually share lists of nuclear facilities and refrain from attacking each other’s nuclear infrastructure.Dubey’s remarks come amid renewed domestic debate over foreign involvement in India-Pakistan diplomacy, particularly following the Pahalgam terror attack and India’s subsequent Operation Sindoor . He also referred to a letter reportedly written by Rajiv Gandhi to Reagan seeking mediation with Pakistan, a move he said violated the 1972 Shimla Agreement which barred third-party mediation.“It is not easy to be Gandhi,” Dubey said, asserting that Rajiv Gandhi’s request for American intervention was contrary to India’s stated diplomatic policy.Earlier, the BJP MP had posted a declassified 1971 US intelligence cable suggesting that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had agreed to a UN ceasefire during the Bangladesh Liberation War due to international pressure. The post was aimed at countering opposition criticism of the government’s current diplomatic approach.Meanwhile, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh criticised external affairs minister S Jaishankar for remaining silent on US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s alleged remarks about possible American mediation in India-Pakistan talks. India has since reaffirmed its longstanding stance that all issues with Pakistan, including those concerning Jammu and Kashmir, must be addressed bilaterally without foreign mediation.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey claims 1988 nuclear agreement between India and Pakistan was signed under pressure from the United States.

"'Shashi Tharoor very much part of the family': Congress softens stance after 'clarification' post, but flags 'factual error'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-very-much-part-of-the-family-congress-softens-stance-after-clarification-post-but-flags-factual-error/articleshow/121494894.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday softened its stance towards senior party leader Shashi Tharoor hours after after the MP defended his Line of Control (LoC) remark in a strongly worded post on X by saying he is ""very much part of family"".Seeking to ease internal friction, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala reiterated that Tharoor remains an important part of the party.""Shashi Tharoor is a senior Congress leader and very much part of the Congress family. However, what he said about the surgical strike was factually incorrect,"" Surjewala told reporters.""The Congress party only corrected the record by pointing out that the surgical strike on Pakistan and also at other places on the den of terrorists were regularly executed during Congress-led UPA government to give a befitting reply to terrorists by our armed forces and the then Congress Government,"" he added when questioned on the war of words between some Congress leaders and Tharoor.Surjewala's statement comes as Tharoor faces criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks—not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.The controversy erupted after Tharoor reportedly stated in Panama that India breached the LoC ""for the first time"" during the 2016 surgical strike. This prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LoC and International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicizing the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.“The shameless exploitation of the 2016 'surgical strikes'... as a party election tool—something the Congress had never done—marked a particularly disgraceful dilution of the principle that national security issues require discretion and non-partisanship,” Tharoor wrote at the time.Despite the public discord, the Congress leadership has now sought to downplay the fallout. Surjewala stressed that setting the record straight should not lead to “acronyms or doubts” within the party.","Shashi Tharoor is a senior Congress leader and very much part of the Congress family.

From honeymoon to homicide: What mental health experts see

Red flags before violence: The four D’s

Danger – the individual might injure themselves or another person

Deviance – their actions violate social conventions in jarring ways

Dysfunction – they are no longer able to operate normally

Distress – there's profound pain they can't verbalize or flee from

Why people kill their partners

The silent suffering of men

NEW DELHI: It begins as it always does. A random look over a room, that brief moment when eyes connect and all else disappears. Late-night texts, words with promises. The romantic whispers of ""forever"" in the night, visions of futures together, lives intertwined. But sometimes, forever isn’t enough. Sometimes, forever ends in a zipped-up body bag - some chopped, some torched, some frozen.Across India, 2025 has seen a gruesome string of murders where wives and their lovers are allegedly turning executioners, transforming homes into horror scenes.In Meerut, Saurabh Rajput was chopped, stuffed in a blue plastic drum, and buried in cement. His wife and her lover reportedly watched him die.In Bijnor, a man was strangled, his wife pinned him down, and her lover crushed his throat. Reason? He didn’t want to move.In Auraiya, two weeks into marriage, the husband was lured, ambushed, and dumped like trash.In Jaipur, a man was burned alive. Flesh melted, and smoke choked the room. His crime? Questioning infidelity.In Korba, a woman confessed to stabbing her husband multiple times.She claimed abuse, but the scene was soaked in rage—blood on walls, a body left in fury.These murders echo an earlier case in Delhi, where Shraddha Walkar’s dismembered remains were found stuffed in a fridge by her live-in partner. A similar horror played out months later in Munirka, where a woman’s body was chopped up and left to rot by her partner.There’s no one pattern, no clear trigger. But there’s always a simmer. A slow erosion. A point where love curdles into control, affection turns into obsession, and murder feels like the only exit.""People are not coming in time to seek advice and help. By the time they do, it's often too late,"" mental wellness experts said unequivocally.They have seen the breakdown happen up close - from honeymoon to homicide.“There is rising infidelity, emotional neglect, and extramarital affairs. By the time couples come for therapy, the relationship has deteriorated to a point of no return,” said Dr Sameer Malhotra, head of mental health and behavioral sciences at Max Healthcare.It’s no longer just women who are speaking up. “Many men come in crying. Some attempt suicide. Some are completely broken, manipulated, or threatened with legal action. They’re unable to function at work, having emotional breakdowns in the office.”And when people choose to kill others, it's not necessarily on the spur of the moment. Sometimes it's horrifyingly deliberate.“For some, the cause is longstanding anger, frustration, and neglect. For others, it’s sadism, psychopathic traits, control, and domination. There’s a complete lack of remorse,” Dr Malhotra said.Experts collectively testified, when someone kills a partner and hides the body, it reflects emotional coldness and the need to erase the person. These acts are not just about fear—they’re about complete annihilation. They said the person might be involved in careful planning — how to dispose of the body, stuff it in a bag, burn it beyond recognition. These aren’t crimes of passion anymore. It’s a calculation.Rashi Sahai, a clinical psychologist, Max Super Specialty Hospital, is seeing the same pattern emerge.""Such killings are often the product of unresolved trauma, emotional neglect, or a broken sense of self. It's not spontaneous. It builds. And then it shatters,"" she said.Sahai listed the red flags. Four D's that nearly always appear prior to it being too late:But even when they're apparent, few take them seriously.Dr Kriti Bhargava, a clinical psychologist, said what drives someone to commit violence is disturbingly simple: “Punishment is immediate. It offers instant gratification. Walking away takes emotional maturity, and most don’t have it.”For many people, violence appears as justice. Particularly when they feel control is slipping.“A wife asserting independence, or a husband cheating, it shakes their core. It becomes about humiliation. Retaliation.”Men and women kill differently, Dr Bhargava explained. Generally, not always, ""Men tend to kill for power, for entitlement, and for humiliation. Women kill when they are threatened, desperate, or have suffered years of abuse.""And yet, society largely overlooks the male victims — men emotionally battered, manipulated, or shattered behind closed doors.Dr Malhotra is adamant: “Rights come with responsibilities. Men are suffering in silence, and that silence is exploding.”So what can be done?""Couples should be counselled, yes,"" said Sahai, ""but it must be supportive, not punitive. Otherwise, it won't work.""""We need to teach people emotional control, conflict resolution, not merely math and science,"" said Dr Malhotra. “There’s a vacuum of coping skills.”Love's not meant to be lethal. But in Indian homes across this country, too often it's becoming a risky game. A game where defeat in an argument might equal the loss of life.“People don’t listen anymore. They don’t try to understand. Relationships are transactional now, not emotional,” Dr Malhotra said.The question is no longer why someone was killed. It’s why no one saw it coming.","Murders in India are on the rise due to lack of emotional control and communication. Unresolved trauma and prolonged neglect are the main reasons behind the violence. The four D's - danger, deviation, distress and deviation - are the red flags that nearly always appear before violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121491287,imgsize-3968547,width-400,resizemode-4/121491287.jpg"

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment after his pet husky bit his neighbour inside an apartment lift. The man, Rishab Patel, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.Judicial magistrate Suhas Bhosale, while delivering the verdict, said he would not show Patel ""too much leniency"". Referring to CCTV footage, the judge noted, ""The way in which the accused dragged his pet inside lift shows he is not compassionate towards his own pet. He did not care about the informant, his son and dragged his own pet inside the lift... the act... resulted in injury.""The victim, Ramik Shah, a resident of Alfa Apartment in Worli, was heading down from the fourth floor with his one-and-a-half-year-old son and domestic help. When the lift stopped at the third floor, Patel was standing with his dog. Shah said he requested Patel to wait, explaining that his son was cynophobic (afraid of dogs). However, Patel allegedly ignored the request and did not even allow them to exit. Instead, he dragged his dog into the lift, which bit Shah on his left forearm. After the incident, Shah, his son, and the help exited the lift, but Patel allegedly followed them and challenged Shah to ""do whatever he wanted.""Shah later sought medical treatment and filed a police complaint.During the trial, the prosecution presented oral evidence from the victim, Ramik Shah, and his domestic help, Anuj Singh, who confirmed Patel had forcibly entered the lift with the dog despite repeated requests.The defence pointed to inconsistencies, including a delay in medical treatment and the initial absence of administration of anti-rabies vaccine for the victim. However, the magistrate found the testimonies of both Shah and Singh consistent and credible. ""Only because the witness is servant of the first informant we cannot brush aside his evidence if it is otherwise trustworthy,"" he ruled. Holding Patel's actions as ""voluntary,"" the court fined him Rs 4,000 in addition to sentencing him to jail.","A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment.

It is a continuous one, but it would be incorrect for me and also premature to speak about the results,"" confirmed Alipov.He mentioned that Moscow is also ""very satisfied"" with the 'Made in India' BrahMos missiles, a product of joint collaboration with Russia.""We have a joint venture, designing and producing these weapons.

The Guru said he asked for a unique dakshina in return: “I want PoK back.”General Dwivedi visited the revered seer at his Chitrakoot Ashram on Wednesday during a tour that also included the inauguration of a state-of-the-art simulator machine at Sadguru Netra Chikitsalaya, a pioneering step in medical training for eye surgeries.“This machine allows doctors to practice surgical procedures virtually before operating on real patients. There are only 4–5 such machines in India, and this is the first one in Madhya Pradesh,” said a member of the Sadguru Sewa Centre, adding that the Army Chief also observed the functioning of the facility’s operation theatres.With 140 vision centres and an equal number of surgeons operating across the network, the centre also explored possibilities of collaboration with the armed forces to extend eye care services to personnel and veterans.The Army Chief’s visit comes days after his critical leadership role in Operation Sindoor , India’s retaliatory mission against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22.General Dwivedi, alongside Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi and Air Force Chief Marshal AP Singh, oversaw operations from the military command centre, featured in a booklet recently circulated among Indian Army personnel.India has since launched diplomatic efforts, sending multi-party MP-led delegations to key countries to underscore its zero-tolerance stance on terrorism and expose Pakistan’s role in cross-border attacks.", Spiritual leader Jagadguru Rambhadracharya bestowed the Ram Mantra Diksha upon Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi.

Pak To Get 'Chinese Version' Of U.S. THAAD Air Defence System? HQ-19 Shield Explained

NEW DELHI: Under Operation Sindoor , India did not just win a military conflict with Pakistan but also scored a victory over China in the technological domain as Pakistan essentially fought as a Chinese proxy by relying heavily on Chinese platforms, according to military expert John Spencer.“Operation Sindoor pitted India’s indigenously developed weapons systems against Chinese-supplied platforms fielded by Pakistan. What unfolded was not just retaliation but the strategic debut of a sovereign arsenal built under the twin doctrines of Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat (the two key programmes of the Modi govt that lay emphasis on self-reliance in the defence sector),” Spencer, a retired US army officer who is currently the chair of urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute, wrote on X.“India fought as a sovereign power—wielding precision tools it designed, built and deployed with unmatched battlefield control. Pakistan fought as a proxy force, dependent on Chinese hardware that was built for export, not for excellence. When challenged, these systems failed — exposing the strategic hollowness behind Islamabad’s defence posture,” he said.The ‘Made-in-India’ BrahMos supersonic cruise missile with Russian collaboration, totally indigenous Akash surface to air missile and Akashteer missile defence system, Rudram anti-radiation missile, Netra airborne early warning and control (AEW&C), loitering munitions (SkyStriker, Harop) and D4S counter-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, an indigenous multi-layer drone defence system integrating radar, radio frequency jammers, sensors and kinetic kill options had an upper hand over several Pakistan-owned but Chinese-built HQ-9/ HQ-16 SAM Systems, LY-80 & FM-90 air defence systems and CH-4 drones (China), Spencer elaborated.India’s thrust for self-reliance in defence weaponry began as part of PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, he said.“The goal was clear: reduce dependence on foreign arms imports and build a world-class domestic defence industry. The policy incentivised joint ventures, opened defence to foreign direct investment up to 74%, and encouraged both public and private sector manufacturers to build sophisticated military hardware at home. Within a few years, systems like the BrahMos missile , K9 Vajra howitzer, and AK-203 rifle were being produced inside India—many with technology partnerships but increasing domestic control,” Spencer said.However, in 2020, the combined shock of the Covid-19 pandemic and Galwan Valley clash with China exposed the fragility of foreign supply chains and the urgency of operational self-reliance, he said. “India imposed phased bans on key defence imports, gave the armed forces emergency procurement powers, and poured investment into indigenous research, design and production. By 2025, India had increased domestic content in defence procurement from 30% to 65%, with a goal of 90% by the decade’s end,” the military expert said in his post.India’s T-72 main battle tanks and advanced fighter jets Russian-origin Su-30MKIs and French-built Rafales provided firepower and flexibility, launching multiple strike packages on Pakistan and ensuring airspace control.“India fought as a sovereign power—wielding precision tools it designed, built, and deployed with unmatched battlefield control.

I would refer you to our position that was made clear on 13th of May.

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh high court (HC) held that forcing unnatural sex on one's wife, coupled with physical assault and cruelty, constitutes an offence under IPC section 498A, and upheld an FIR registered by a woman against her husband. The court, however, said the husband cannot be prosecuted under IPC sections 377 or 376 as 'marital rape' is not an offence under the law.Police had registered a case against the accused under IPC sections 377, 323 and 498A which he challenged in HC, contending that unnatural sex with wife is not recognised as an offence in Indian law. Also, 498A is not applicable as no dowry harassment has been alleged in the FIR, he argued.Justice G S Ahluwalia of Gwalior bench, in his order, said, ""Committing unnatural sex with a wife against her wishes and on her resistance, assaulting and treating her with physical cruelty will certainly fall within the definition of cruelty. It is not out of place to mention here that demand of dowry is not sine qua non for cruelty.""The order said, ""From a plain reading of IPC section 498A, it is clear that any wilful conduct which is of such nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or cause grave injury or danger to life, limb, or health, whether mental or physical, to the woman, would amount to cruelty.""It is clear that unnatural sex with wife would not be an offence under section 376 or 377 of IPC, HC said, and quashed this charge in the FIR.""However, since there are specific allegations that whenever the wife resisted the unnatural conduct of petitioner, she was assaulted and treated with physical cruelty, this court is of the opinion that offence under section 498A IPC is made out. Accordingly, this application is partially allowed. Offence under section 377 is hereby quashed.

BENGALURU: Karnataka's Congress government is considering sending to the President a bill that proposes reservation for Muslims in civil contracts after governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot returned it a second time, insisting it be forwarded to President Droupadi Murmu.Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to Muslims in civil contracts up to Rs 1 crore, besides quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs (Category I and II-A) in government tenders for goods and services. It was passed by the state legislature in March. Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil had planned to meet senior officials and legal experts Thursday to decide the next course of action, but that meeting was postponed.Senior officials said the government had considered challenging Gehlot's decision in court. However, constitutional experts reportedly advised against legal action, urging the government to pursue alternative routes instead. The issue is likely to be informally discussed during a meeting that CM Siddaramaiah is scheduled to chair on Friday.Gehlot had referred the bill to the President previously following objections from the BJP.The principal opposition party argued that providing reservations based on religion violates constitutional provisions and urged the governor to withhold assent.The government then re-sent the bill to Raj Bhavan without amendment but included detailed explanations justifying its stance and requesting the governor's approval. Gehlot, however, remained firm and sent it back again, reiterating reference to the President.","Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to Muslims in civil contracts up to Rs 1 crore.

NEW DELHI: India has redesigned and redefined its strategy and response to terrorism emanating from Pakistan and if talks do take place with Islamabad in the future, they will only be on terrorism and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday in what appeared a repudiation of Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif's suggestion that the two countries should engage in comprehensive dialogue that covers all their disputes.POK was an integral part of India and its people, who got geographically and politically separated, and would sooner or later voluntarily return to India ""listening to the voice of their souls and self-respect"", Singh said, addressing the annual CII business summit here.Echoing Singh, the external affairs ministry later in the day said any dialogue with Islamabad will have to be focused on the return of POK and also wanted terrorists to India. The ministry also said any engagement between the two countries would be strictly bilateral.""We want to reiterate that terrorism and dialogue cannot go hand in hand. And as far as the issue of terrorism is concerned, any discussion with Pakistan will focus on the list of terrorists we had provided them some years ago - they should hand them over to us,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""Regarding J&K, any bilateral talks will only be about one thing - when will Pakistan vacate POK, which it has been holding illegally and unlawfully,"" he added.Singh earlier warned Pakistan that India could have inflicted much more damage between May 7 and 10 during Operation Sindoor, with 'Made in India' weapons having the power to ""penetrate any armour of the enemy"", but exercised restraint as a responsible country.Stressing that 'Make in India' was an essential component of national security, he said the country's home-grown weapons systems surprised the entire world by playing a key role in Operation Sindoor.","India has redesigned and redefined its strategy and response to terrorism emanating from Pakistan.

New Delhi: Supreme Court Thursday refused to entertain a doctor's plea seeking suspension of the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to him after being convicted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) for raping his seven-year-old daughter.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said he was not entitled to bail, considering the kind of things he did to his daughter.The convict's lawyer contended that he was framed because of differences with his wife, and that she tutored the child to testify against him. His wife is also a doctor but despite that the medical examination of his daughter was delayed by three months and no injury marks were found on her body, the advocate said.The bench, however, said there was no reason to disbelieve the child's statement and she also withstood the cross-examination. ""The man became a beast. Please don't force us to say anything more... She testified against her father. Why should we disbelieve her,"" it asked.Pressing for relief, the convict said it would take years for Allahabad HC to decide his appeal and he would have to languish in jail during the pendency of the case. He said 12 lakh cases were pending in HC, and appeals filed in 1981 were being heard now. But SC refused his plea and granted him permission to file a fresh bail petition after some time.""This is the most liberal bench and if we are not granting bail it means there is something. We cannot help it,"" Justice Sharma said.The man was convicted by a Varanasi court and sentenced to life imprisonment.","A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said he was not entitled to bail.

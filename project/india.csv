Raja Ravi Varma’s ‘last’ painting caught in ugly ownership row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raja-ravi-varmas-last-painting-caught-in-ugly-ownership-row/articleshow/128334362.cms,"‘Imminent risk of painting being transferred to gallery in Australia’

NEW DELHI : A rare Raja Ravi Varma painting — by some accounts his last work — is at the centre of a high-stakes legal battle with multiple ownership claims.The painting, ‘Kadambari’, by the 19th-century maestro, is at present in the possession of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, which assured Delhi high court recently that it is only exhibiting the artefact, being a private museum, and is not going to sell it further.The piece of art, estimated to be worth well over Rs 100 crore, was originally in possession of a Delhi-based art collector, who moved HC alleging that he was “conned” by his close associates into handing it over to them and lost out on a work of immense emotional and cultural value to the country. The associates, he said, sold the painting.In his suit, art collector Mohinder Verma alleged that in 2021 he entrusted the masterpiece to individuals he considered trusted associates, as one of them was also a director in Verma’s company. However, they first tricked him into accepting advance payment of Rs 3 crore in pounds sterling in London, then tipped off local police, resulting in him being jailed abroad.Taking advantage of his incarceration, the people he entrusted with the painting for safekeeping and restoration, with the explicit understanding that no further action could be taken without his express approval, sold the artwork through a web of intermediaries.The suit claimed the painting ended up at a public auction conducted by Saffronart, where the work was acquired by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) for a substantial sum — all while the original owner remained entirely in the dark.Meanwhile, UK police dropped charges against Verma and he was acquitted. On returning to India, he lodged a complaint with Delhi Police against his associates, resulting in an FIR and a probe.While hearing the suit, Justice Mini Pushkarna asked the parties to first pursue pre-litigation mediation. During the hearing, the defendants told court that Verma’s brother and sister-in-law should also be made party to the suit, as ownership of the painting was being claimed by them.HC agreed and said it is “of the view that the brother and sister-in-law of the plaintiff ought to be before this court”. It asked the duo to also appear before the mediation wing with the other parties.In his suit, Verma explained why he rushed to court, claiming he recently learned that the Queensland Art Gallery, in Brisbane, Australia, is establishing a dedicated section for the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma.“Several prominent art dealers informed the plaintiff that ‘Kadambari’ is intended for permanent display at this gallery, thereby resulting in its removal from India and beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this court. The plaintiff therefore states that there is an imminent risk of the painting being transferred to the Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane, Australia,” Verma said in his plea.Appearing for the art collector, advocate Giriraj Subramanium contended that those who profit from the commercialisation of art cannot distance themselves from the responsibility of verifying the title and urged the court to hold the intermediaries accountable.With Verma naming auction houses and market intermediaries as defendants in the suit, any decision by HC is likely to impact the longstanding “culture of informality” in the Indian art trade. The suit also highlights that auction houses and buyers must first verify the provenance of the artwork before going further.","The painting, ‘Kadambari’, by the 19th-century maestro, is at present in the possession of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art.

'Symbols Of British Empire': PM Modi On North & South Block In 1st Address From Seva Teerth

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday paid tributes to the soldiers, that were killed in the Pulwama attack 7 years ago calling them ""brave heroes"".""Remembering the brave heroes who laid down their lives in Pulwama on this day in 2019. Their devotion, resolve and service to the nation remain forever etched in our collective consciousness. Every Indian draws strength from their enduring courage,"" said PM Modi on X.Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi also remembered the soldiers saying, ""My heartfelt tribute to our brave soldiers who were killed in the audacious terrorist attack in Pulwama in 2019. The nation shall forever remain indebted to them for their supreme sacrifice in the defence of Mother India.""Vice President CP Radhakrishnan also paid his tributes on the seventh anniversary of the attack. ""I pay homage to the brave personnel who laid down their lives in the Pulwama terror attack . Their supreme sacrifice will forever remain etched in the nation's memory and continues to inspire us to build a strong and secure India,"" he said.On February 14, 2019, the Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed one of the deadliest terror attacks in Indian history.A convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) travelling along the Srinagar–Jammu National Highway was targeted in a suicide bombing, killing 40 personnel. The date has since been remembered as a “Black Day” in the country’s security narrative.The convoy consisted of 78 buses carrying nearly 2,500 CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into one of the buses, causing massive casualties and destruction.The attack drew widespread international condemnation and led to an immediate tightening of security protocols across Jammu and Kashmir. The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility, stating that a suicide bomber carried out the assault, according to local media reports.In response, India initiated a series of counter-terror measures, most notably conducting airstrikes on alleged terror training camps across the border in Pakistan. The military action marked a sharp escalation in tensions between the two countries.Beyond its immediate impact, the Pulwama attack reignited global debate over cross-border terrorism, militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, and the broader security dynamics between India and Pakistan.",PM Narendra Modi paid tributes to the soldiers killed in the Pulwama attack 7 years ago.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25.

'MOUs Close To 1L Cr': Himanta Biswa Sarma Seeks Investment As Assam Makes Davos Debut

Assam is going to witness a historic moment on Saturday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi will land at the Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) on Moran Bypass in Dibrugarh, where he will witness the aerial display of fighters, transports and helicopters.The ELF is the first of its kind in Northeast India. It has been specially designed and constructed in coordination with the Indian Air Force to support the landing and take-off of military and civil aircraft during emergencies. It will serve as a critical asset for emergency response, enabling quick deployment of rescue and relief operations during natural disasters or strategic requirements in the Northeast.Envisioned as dual-use infrastructure, the ELF is capable of handling fighter aircraft up to 40 tonnes and transport aircraft up to 74 tonnes maximum take-off weight.PM Modi will also inaugurate and flag off development projects worth over Rs 5,450 crore, aimed at strengthening connectivity, digital infrastructure, higher education and urban mobility in the North-Eastern Region.According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), around 10:30 AM, the PM will land at the Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) on Moran Bypass in Dibrugarh.At around 1 PM, the Prime Minister will inspect the newly built Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu across the River Brahmaputra.Later, at approximately 1:30 PM, he will inaugurate and flag off development projects valued at over Rs 5,450 crore at Lachit Ghat in Guwahati.Further, PM Modi will inaugurate Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu across the River Brahmaputra, built at a cost of around Rs 3,030 crore. The 6-lane extradosed Prestressed Concrete (PSC) bridge connects Guwahati with North Guwahati and is the first of its kind in Northeast India. It will cut travel time between Guwahati and North Guwahati to seven minutes.Given the region's high seismicity, the bridge incorporates base isolation using friction pendulum bearings. High-performance stay cables have been used to ensure durability and long-term structural performance.A Bridge Health Monitoring System (BHMS) has also been incorporated to enable real-time condition monitoring, early damage detection, and improved safety and service life of the extradosed bridge.According to the PMO, PM Modi will inaugurate the National Data Centre for the Northeastern region at Amingaon in Kamrup district of Assam. The state-of-the-art Data Centre, with a total sanctioned load of 8.5 MW and an average rack capacity of 10 kW, will host mission-critical applications for various government departments and serve as a Disaster Recovery centre for other National Data Centres.This will enable governments in the Northeast to digitally deliver essential citizen-centric services. Aligned with the vision of Digital India, the National Data Centre for the northeastern region has been envisioned as a strategic initiative to strengthen the region's ICT backbone and ensure robust, secure, and always-available digital infrastructure, according to the PMO's statement.The inauguration of the Indian Institute of Management is another highlight for the state, as the IIM Guwahati is set to provide a major boost to higher and management education in the North-Eastern Region.Over 225 electric buses under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme in Guwahati (100), Nagpur (50), Bhavnagar (50), and Chandigarh (25) will also be flagged off. With the launch of e-bus operations under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme in these four cities, more than 50 lakh citizens are expected to benefit from access to clean, affordable, and reliable public transport services, thereby improving urban mobility and enhancing quality of life.","PM Narendra Modi will land at the Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) on Moran Bypass in Dibrugarh.

That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win.

Why stock market crashed today: Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,500, BSE Sensex closed down over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,471.10, down 336 points or 1.30%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,626.76, down 1,048 points or 1.25%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence. Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams.The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff.

On a busy afternoon in Old Delhi’s Parathe Wali Gali, Darshit Singh held up his phone and did something unusual.He didn’t hype the food.He critiqued it.The reel — an “honest review” of a legacy eatery and Daulat ki Chaat — crossed 7.3 million views. Messages flooded in. Invitations followed. Cities called.That was 2024.Today, Singh calls himself India’s first “food deinfluencer”.Elsewhere, Santosh was boarding a late-night flight after wrapping up a full corporate workday.An IIT-Delhi alumnus by degree and a traveller by instinct, he refuses to choose between spreadsheets and sunsets.“I’m a traveller with a full-time job,” he says — a line that has now become his digital identity.Every month, a new state.Every trip, a vlog.Every journey, proof that passion doesn’t need permission.What once looked like just another viral reel is now part of something bigger — a creator economy projected to be worth thousands of crores, and increasingly recognised in India’s economic blueprint.This year’s Union Budget did something subtle but significant: it placed creativity inside the growth narrative.Welcome to India’s Orange Economy moment.For decades, art, storytelling and digital creation lived in the margins of economic planning — celebrated culturally, rarely counted financially.That is beginning to change.The “Orange Economy” — a term popularised by the Inter-American Development Bank refers to industries that transform ideas into cultural goods and services protected by intellectual property. It includes media, film, music, publishing, animation, gaming, advertising, design, fashion, digital content and now, increasingly, independent creators.In India’s Union Budget 2026–27, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a major push for India’s creative industries — or what is increasingly being called the “Orange Economy.”Presenting the Budget, Sitharaman emphasised that India’s creative and AVGC-XR (Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics and Extended Reality) ecosystem has the potential to generate large-scale employment and position India as a global content hub.The Economic Survey projected that the AVGC sector alone could require up to 2 million skilled professionals by 2030.Sitharaman highlighted that India’s demographic dividend must be aligned with emerging sectors, particularly those driven by digital platforms and intellectual property.At the WAVES summit earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reinforced this direction, describing India as a nation with “a billion-plus stories” and positioning the creative economy as both cultural capital and economic opportunity.India’s creator economy is projected to grow at an 18% compound annual growth rate, rising from Rs 19 billion in 2023 to Rs 34 billion by 2026, according to Ernst & Young.Influencer marketing is defined as “a collaboration between popular social-media users and brands to promote brands’ products or services.”What began as informal brand shoutouts has now evolved into a regulated, data-driven industry.The scale today is substantial. Globally, the influencer marketing economy was valued at $21.1 billion in 2023, having more than doubled since 2019 on the strength of platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.According to ET, the global influencer marketing platform market grew from $6 billion in 2020 to a projected $24.1 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 32%.Forbes highlighted that the broader creator economy is now a $250 billion global force, projected by Goldman Sachs to reach $480 billion by 2027.Statista reports that over 200 million creators operate globally, while social commerce is expected to touch $2.9 trillion by 2026.India’s influencer marketing sector is projected to reach Rs 3,375 crore by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 18%, according to EY’s ‘State of Influencer Marketing in India’ report.Exchange4Media estimates the core influencer market at around Rs 3,600 crore in 2024, projected to reach Rs 4,500 crore in 2025, though insiders suggest the real size may exceed Rs 10,000 crore due to direct brand-creator deals outside conventional tracking.Creator fees rose between 10–30%, while top-tier creators in India reportedly earned between Rs 10–25 crore annually through endorsements, platform monetisation, live events and equity partnerships.Influencers are categorised by follower size:EY observes that marketers leverage both large/macro and micro/nano influencers equally.While mega and macro influencers drive awareness and brand loyalty, micro and nano influencers often deliver stronger engagement and relatability.Regional creators are becoming central to brand strategies. According to Influencer.in (Social Beat), regional creators drive 35–40% better engagement in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Budget allocation for regional creators has increased from 3–10% earlier to 8–20%, with expectations of further growth.The ecosystem is increasingly youth-driven. A 2024 YouTube India–SmithGeiger report found that 83% of Indian Gen Zers consider themselves creators, and 75% see content creation as a genuine career path. More than 55% reported gaining financial independence through digital platforms.As ET highlights, influencer marketing is seen as cost-effective and personalised. Influencers build relatability and directly shape purchase decisions. In fact, 61% of consumers trust recommendations from creators more than traditional brand advertising, according to Sprout Social cited by Forbes.Influencer partnerships typically follow two models:Increasingly, creators are moving beyond endorsements to ownership — launching brands, seeking equity partnerships and building independent revenue streams. Exchange4Media notes a visible shift from “endorser to owner.”From hyper-local memers to pan-India gaming stars, from nano creators in Tier-3 cities to mega influencers earning crores annually, India’s influencer economy is no longer peripheral to marketing. It has become a structured, high-growth pillar of brand strategy — reshaping commerce, culture and consumer trust in the digital age.For creators like Darshit, having a mass following of 51.7K followers, the viral Old Delhi reel was only the beginning. What followed was a clearer understanding of how the influencer economy actually works.“I started making content post-COVID but it was mostly just pictures and a few videos with music. No voiceover,” he says. It was only after that breakout moment in 2024 that he began studying the platform more closely — especially the algorithm.“Instagram is fundamentally different… it thrives on recommendations,” he explains. Unlike platforms that depend heavily on follower count, Instagram pushes reels to users who may never have heard of the creator but are likely to engage. “Someone who has never made a video in their life can come to this platform and make one and get millions of views.”Uploading identical content across YouTube Shorts, Facebook and Threads, Singh says Instagram consistently delivers his highest reach. For him, discovery is not accidental — it is engineered.But growth alone was never the goal. His identity as a “food deinfluencer” is built on resisting what he sees as blind positivity in brand culture.“Our society today has a trust crisis. Be it government, institutions, or media. Everyone is facing that. So for me, my audience’s trust is paramount,” he says. Even in paid collaborations, he critiques dishes he does not like. “I wanna be the reason behind someone’s memorable meal.”His approach reflects a broader shift in marketing strategy. “Earlier brands used to only work with celebrities and movie stars but now they prefer influencers in most cases as the latter gives them higher ROI,” he observes. “Celebrities promoting a product feels like an ad. But some influencers subtly promote the brand in their organic way… audiences are more likely to purchase that product later.”A few kilometres away from Old Delhi’s food lanes, Santosh is planning his next trip — between client calls.Santosh began his creator journey not in airports or mountains but inside hostel rooms. What started as campus vlogs on YouTube, hostel stories, placement anxiety, the reality of being an IIT student slowly built a community of aspirants and peers.Then came Instagram.Reels allowed him to compress entire journeys into seconds — a new state every month, documented between office deadlines. The platform’s real-time engagement — stories, reels, DMs helped him move beyond informational content into something more personal.“You can be discovered without being famous,” he says, pointing to how a few of his travel and IIT reels travelled far beyond his existing follower base.More importantly, he has watched the industry change.“When I started, content creation felt experimental,” Santosh says. “Now brands plan structured budgets. Long-term collaborations. There’s more professionalism.”In his words, the creative economy is no longer informal hustle.It’s recognised work.If the orange economy is the ecosystem and creators are its lifeblood, then Instagram is the marketplace — the digital high street where attention turns into advertising, and creativity converts into commerce.To understand how influencer marketing thrives, it’s important to understand how Instagram itself makes money.Founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger as a simple photo-sharing app, Instagram was built on one idea: visuals connect people. What started as a minimalist platform for filtered photos has evolved into a billion-user ecosystem of Stories, Reels, shopping tabs and creator tools.After Meta (then Facebook) acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, the platform scaled rapidly. Today, Instagram is estimated to be worth around $400 billion, making it one of the most valuable digital assets globally.The engine driving all of this? Advertising.Instagram’s primary revenue model is advertising. What makes Instagram powerful for marketers is its algorithmic precision. Content appears based on user behavior, engagement patterns and interests.The platform’s shift toward short-form video has supercharged engagement. According to a Meta-commissioned IPSOS study:Meta India’s Managing Director Arun Srinivas said: “India is leading the world in video adoption, and Reels is at the center of this shift. Five years since its launch, Reels is India’s leading short-form video platform—driving massive engagement, shaping culture, and delivering real business impact.”Instagram’s model is symbiotic with the influencer economy.While food reels dominate one corner of the ecosystem, knowledge-driven creators are building influence in quieter but equally powerful ways.For Bikramjeet Dutta, having a massive following of 51.9K followers, Instagram’s inflexion point came during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “I was attending several political rallies, press conferences etc. I started uploading that it started gaining views and followers,” he says.His content extends beyond political coverage into books, geopolitics and history. “Instagram helped me to connect with those who are experts in these fields,” he says, adding that credibility assessment feels more immediate on the platform. “In Instagram it's quite easy to verify whether the person is credible or not.”Discovery, he believes, has fundamentally shifted the opportunity landscape. Posting book reviews led to requests from publishers. Geopolitical commentary brought invitations to panel discussions and book launches. “Yes, Instagram has made it easier for creators to be discovered,” he says.For many small businesses in India, Instagram is no longer just a marketing add-on. It functions as a storefront, catalogue, customer service desk and storytelling space — often all at once.The shift became especially visible during the pandemic. In 2020, Instagram introduced the ‘Support Small Business’ sticker, which grouped Stories using the sticker into a shared feed so “more people can discover more small businesses.”Around the same time, it rolled out features that made it easier to discover gift cards, online food orders and fundraisers, allowing users to tap directly and purchase through partner websites.For Nidhi who runs a handmade chocolate business, Instagram became more than a display window.“Instagram didn’t just become a platform… it became the space where my creativity found its voice,” she says.She explains that unlike other platforms, Instagram allowed her “to connect, not just sell — to share stories, build trust, and grow a community that appreciates handmade details and thoughtful gifting.”Instead of simply listing prices, she moved toward behind-the-scenes reels — melting chocolate, assembling hampers, last-minute packing. The shift from static posts to process-driven video felt “more genuine for the audience.”Another small business owner Harsh in the fabric trade echoes a similar sentiment.“Instagram has played a major role in building our fabric brand identity. Through reels, product videos, and live customer interactions, we showcase our manufacturing quality, fabric textures, and latest collections in a very visual way.”Increased competition, he highlights, has pushed businesses “to become more creative by high-quality reels and by making it more realistic.”In the architecture of the orange economy, small businesses are not just beneficiaries of digital platforms. They are active participants: adapting content, tone and strategy in response to algorithmic culture and rising competition.","In India’s Union Budget 2026–27, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a major push for creative industries. The ‘Orange Economy’ includes media, film, music, publishing, animation, gaming, advertising, design, fashion, digital content and now, increasingly, independent creators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128293766,imgsize-1386798,width-400,resizemode-4/128293766.jpg"
Married man in SC over dowry complaint by 'live-in partner',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/married-man-in-sc-over-dowry-complaint-by-live-in-partner/articleshow/128326932.cms,"NEW DELHI: Can a married man in a live-in relationship be prosecuted for dowry harassment on the complaint of a woman with whom he was in an extra-marital affair, even though the law specifies that only a wife can make such a complaint against her husband and his relatives?A Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh on Friday entertained an appeal by a doctor, Lokesh B H, challenging a Karnataka HC order rejecting his plea for quashing prosecution launched against him based on a complaint filed by his alleged live-in partner.The bench said, ""The pertinent question that arises for consideration in this petition is whether a man, who is in a live-in relationship in the nature of marriage with a woman, can be prosecuted for having committed an offence under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or its corresponding section in the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita.""SC sought a response from govt on the issue and requested additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to assist the court. It also appointed advocate Nina Nariman as amicus curiae.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Sanjay Nuli said the HC erred in interpreting that rigour of Section 498A applies even to a live-in relationship, even though the definition under the IPC section envisages action against the husband by the wife. Section 498A provides that ""whoever being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall be liable to fine"".Under it, cruelty includes dowry demands, and coercion and ill treatment.In the current case, Lokesh - a cardiologist - was married to Naveena in Feb 2000. It was alleged by another woman, Teertha, that she got married to Lokesh in 2010. In 2015, Teertha lodged several complaints with police against Lokesh, his mother, sister and a cousin, but these were closed.In 2016, Teertha lodged a complaint accusing Lokesh of attempting to burn her while demanding dowry, even though Lokesh's employer certified that on the day of the alleged incident, he was at his workplace - a hospital. She later lodged a domestic violence case against him. Lokesh filed a suit before a family court at Bengaluru seeking a declaration that there was no marital relationship between him and Teertha, which is still pending adjudication. In 2023, the police filed chargesheet against Lokesh for allegedly attempting to burn Teertha and demaning dowry. He challenged this before the HC which dismissed it.","A Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh on Friday entertained an appeal by a doctor, Lokesh B H.

J&K: CM Omar Abdullah gets rare praise from BJP MLAs for Amarnath Yatra fund allocation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-cm-omar-abdullah-gets-rare-praise-from-bjp-mlas-for-amarnath-yatra-fund-allocation/articleshow/128320933.cms,"JAMMU: In the J&K assembly, BJP members miss no opportunity to corner the Omar Abdullah govt over a host of issues. Outside the House, however, some of the party MLAs generously praised the chief minister on Friday over his budgetary allocation for the annual Amarnath Yatra “Our CM’s move to allocate Rs 180 crore for Amarnath Yatra is a positive step,” Pawan Gupta, BJP MLA from Udhampur West, said, adding that it “reflects the changing times in Jammu and Kashmir”.Linking govt’s move to a broader sense of political and social transition in the region, Gupta said: “What we want at the end of the day is that Kashmir should join the mainstream, and slowly that is happening. In this Assembly, today you hear legislators saying they are proud Indians. Earlier, we mostly heard about special status.”The MLA said although BJP remained critical of govt on several issues, good and constructive decisions should be acknowledged.In his budget speech last week, Omar said his govt was deeply committed to ensuring the safety, comfort and spiritual experience of pilgrims visiting the holy cave shrine. He proposed to “further modernise pilgrimage infrastructure with an outlay of Rs 180 crore during 2026-27, in partnership with the Border Roads Organization, to improve road connectivity, emergency response systems and logistical support.” The initiative would ensure that the yatra became safer, smoother and more dignified for the pilgrims, he announced.Gupta said the chief minister’s current stance on the Amarnath pilgrimage marked a significant shift from the past. “Earlier, Omar Abdullah had different opinions about the yatra, but now his views have changed. As an Indian, it is my duty to appreciate this change,” he said.BJP legislator Balwant Singh Mankotia, too, appreciated the change in the CM’s approach, recalling in the Assembly how Omar had opposed such measures during the 2008 agitation, when he had stated that “not an inch of land would be given”.Another party MLA, Vikram Randhawa representing Bahu constituency, who had earlier in the day created a ruckus in the House alleging that Kashmiris were illegally settling on land belonging to the Jammu Development Authority, praised the CM for the budgetary allocation for Amarnath Yatra.","BJP members miss no opportunity to corner the Omar Abdullah govt over a host of issues.

NEW DELHI: A heated exchange broke out between Haryana minister Anil Vij and Kaithal Superintendent of Police Upasna during a district grievance redressal meeting on Friday after the officer declined to suspend a policeman in a land-related case, saying she did not have the authority to do so.The incident occurred in Kaithal where Vij, who holds the energy, transport and labour portfolios, was chairing the meeting. A local resident had levelled allegations against an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in connection with a land sale matter that is currently under investigation.During the proceedings, Vij directed that the ASI be suspended. “I am ordering that till action is taken in the matter, he (the ASI) should be suspended because he can use his influence (in the case),” the minister said.SP Upasna responded that the officer in question belonged to a neighbouring district and was not under her administrative control. “I don't have the power to suspend him. The suspension order in this case can be issued by the Kurukshetra SP,” she said.Vij insisted that she act on his direction. “I am giving orders to suspend him (the ASI),” he told her, asking her to write to the Director General of Police (DGP) for necessary action.The SP maintained her position. “I can write this… But I cannot suspend (the ASI),” she said.As the exchange grew tense, Vij remarked, “In every work, you do like this. I am ordering you that he should be suspended. You write to the DGP… I am telling you, you only have to execute my order.”He added, “‘Mera order sare Haryana mein chalta hai’ (my order is applicable in entire Haryana),” drawing applause from some people present at the meeting, according to a video of the incident.The complainant, who was attending the session, also intervened, saying, “Madam, every time you do like this.”Sensing the situation escalating, Kaithal deputy commissioner Aparajita told the minister that the SP had agreed to write to the DGP. Vij responded, “You write to the DGP that he (the ASI) should be suspended… I will see who doesn’t listen (to the order),” pointing towards the SP.This is not the first time a disagreement has surfaced between Vij and senior police officials during grievance meetings. Three months ago, he had a similar altercation in Kaithal, alleging that a police officer ignored his directive to register a Zero FIR in a fraud case. More than a decade ago, Vij had also stormed out of a grievance meeting after a heated exchange with a woman IPS officer.",The incident occurred in Kaithal where Vij was chairing the meeting.

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress Rajya Sabha MP Renuka Chowdhury has been served a privilege breach notice for bringing a stray dog into the Parliament complex during the Winter Session and for her remarks about fellow members.According to the notice, she has been asked to respond to the notice by February 23.The motion was moved by Rajya Sabha MPs Brij Lal and Indu Bala Goswami, who alleged that her actions amounted to a breach of parliamentary privilege and protocol.News agency ANI, citing sources close to Chowdhury, reported that she will respond to the notice in accordance with parliamentary rules, norms and conventions.The row began on the opening day of the Winter Session on December 1 when Chowdhury brought a stray puppy to the Parliament premises. She later explained that she had found the animal on her way to Parliament after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car.“Is there any law? I was on my way. A scooter collided with a car. This little puppy was wandering on the road. I thought it would get hit by the wheel. So I picked it up, put it in the car, came to Parliament, and sent it back. The car left, and so did the dog. So what's the point of this discussion?” she said.Chowdhury maintained that there is no rule preventing an MP from bringing a dog or any animal into Parliament.The matter escalated after the Congress MP made controversial remarks while defending her action. In a swipe at the ruling BJP party, she said, “The real dogs are sitting in Parliament. They run the government. We take care of a mute animal, and this has become a big issue.”Earlier, when asked about the possible privilege motion, she responded by mimicking a dog’s bark. “Bhow, bhow… aur kya bolun?” she said, adding, “We will see when it (the privilege motion) is brought. I will give a 'munhtod' reply.”She also argued that there were more serious issues facing the country. “People are dying because of pollution and no one is worried… Labour laws are being forced upon us… but Renuka Chowdhury’s dog has rattled everyone. What can I say? I will continue to take care of animals,” she remarked.BJP MP Jagdambika Pal criticised her action, calling it a “tamasha” and a breach of protocol. He said members are not permitted to bring anyone into the premises without proper documentation and urged the Chairman to take action.“She is a member of the House and should raise issues of public importance instead of indulging in such drama,” Pal said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also reacted to the controversy. “Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here. Why is it not allowed?” he said, adding, “Pets are not allowed here but they are allowed inside.”",Congress Rajya Sabha MP Renuka Chowdhury has been served a privilege breach notice for bringing a stray dog into the Parliament complex. She has been asked to respond to the notice by February 23. The row began on the opening day of the Winter Session on December 1 when she brought a stray puppy to the Parliament premises.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128314894,imgsize-619575,width-400,resizemode-4/128314894.jpg"

GalaxEye’s upcoming spacecraft will be folded into what the founder described as a “virtual constellation”, allowing Nsil to plug data gaps in its current offerings.“Nsil will resell our data. From now on, whatever satellites we launch, Nsil becomes a reseller for that data,” GalaxEye co-founder and CEO Suyash Singh told TOI.The first satellite — “Drishti” — in GalaxEye’s planned 10-satellite constellation is scheduled to leave for launch on Feb 25. The company plans to deploy all 10 spacecraft over the next four years. The current agreement is structured to cover the entire planned constellation, meaning Nsil can distribute data from each satellite as it comes online.In practical terms, Nsil will function as an extended sales arm for the start-up.It will be able to market raw data as well as downstream products built by GalaxEye. The arrangement also allows Nsil to directly sell the satellite data to its own customer base, which includes govt agencies and commercial clients.Drishti, which is expected to launch aboard a SpaceX mission, weighs 160-kg and is pegged to be India’s largest privately built commercial satellite. While GalaxEye, through contracts with Ananth Technologies and XDLINX procured the satellite bus, the firm said the spacecraft will carry its proprietary “SyncFused OptoSAR” technology, combining optical and synthetic aperture radar data on a single platform.About one cubic metre in size with a 3.5-metre deployable antenna, Drishti will offer 1.5-metre resolution imagery and a global revisit time of seven to ten days. The data is aimed at defence, border surveillance, disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, agriculture, and financial risk assessment.GalaxEye has completed around 500 aerial test flights and earlier flew a payload on Isro’s PSLV mission. The structural model was recently tested at Isro’s UR Rao Satellite Centre.The start-up is in discussions with Indian defence and agriculture ministries and has signed letters of intent with partners in over 20 countries. It plans to scale up its future satellites, targeting 0.5-metre resolution in future versions.“With recent geopolitical events increasing, we look forward to providing unparalleled imagery intelligence. We already have interest from defence and security agencies, utilities, agriculture, and financial companies and we are truly excited about the potential of this technology to transform decision-making and operational efficiency across industries,” Singh had earlier told TOI.","Bengaluru-based space start-up GalaxEye has signed a channel partnership agreement with Space PSU NewSpace India Limited.

NEW DELHI: India is in a ""superb position"" in a highly fragmented geopolitical world, as the fastest-growing economy with the scale, stability and technological ambition to help shape the next global order, Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital said on Friday.""So, India is in the box seat for two reasons. In that fragmented world, picking growth is really important. India is growing.

It is quite extraordinary that computing changes and capacity changes we are going to see not just from AI, but from implementation and quantum. India can play a huge role, he added.

It has leadership, it has a strategy built around not only manufacturing but tech as well, and it has structure to get things done. India was the fastest-growing country last year.

NEW DELHI: The opposition is likely to file for the impeachment of Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar in Parliament. The move, coinciding with the notice for no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, will further escalate tensions between the ruling camp and the INDIA bloc.Sources said the notice for impeachment will be aimed at the post-recess Budget session that starts in the second week of March. The demand for impeachment of Gyanesh Kumar has been pushed by TMC. The opposition had been staying clear of the demand, until now. As if to get back at the allies, TMC did not sign on the removal notice the INDIA bloc recently moved against Speaker Birla even while pointing out that it was not opposed to the move in principle.The INDIA bloc allies’ sudden push to heed Trinamool’s demand appears aimed at appeasing Mamata Banerjee and reinforcing opposition unity, while also maximising support for the removal notice against Speaker Om Birla when it comes up in March. A senior Congress member said, “It will happen soon. We are discussing the issue”.With a firm majority in both the Houses, Modi govt and BJP are unlikely to be bothered by opposition’s moves.However, it would be an unprecedented sight that two top constitutional posts would face simultaneous no confidence from opposition.TMC’s demand against CEChas a wide approval within the opposition camp, with virtually every regional party questioning the process of SIR of poll rolls in the states. Opposition has dubbed it as a BJP ploy to disenfranchise opposition voters to benefit the governing party. While the issue has been debated at length in SC, its reverberations have also been felt in Parliament.Moving against the Speaker, opposition has accused the LS Chair of acting on behest of the governing party, and not allowing opposition to have its say in House proceedings. The fresh bout of tension between the two camps was sparked by refusal of the Chair to let Rahul Gandhi quote from an unpublished book by former Army chief M M Naravane on the Chinese aggression of 2020. The issue derailed the LS proceedings for over a week.Speaker Om Birla has decided not to officiate till the removal notice is settled.","The demand for impeachment of Gyanesh Kumar has been pushed by TMC.

NEW DELHI : Taking a hardline stance for improving public faith in the integrity of justice delivery in trial courts, Supreme Court Friday said a district judge’s “spoken reputation” is an important factor for a high court in deciding to give him extension or retire him compulsorily.A Gujarat additional district judge was compulsorily retired in “public interest” in July 2016 on attaining the age of 56 years and nine months based on a report of a committee of three HC judges, who examined service records and recommended premature retirement of 18 judicial officers.The judge had unsuccessfully challenged his compulsory retirement before HC. In the appeal, his counsel Mayuri Raghuvanshi told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi the judicial officer is not contesting his compulsory retirement but challenging the ‘unfit’ tag which, according to him, was stigmatic.The bench said compulsory retirement is not a punitive action and assuaged the feeling of the judicial officer by saying that the remarks in the order compulsorily retiring him would not be an impediment to his entitlements to post-retirement benefits.However, the CJI had some harsh words for those with doubtful integrity in the justice delivery system. “If there is a report about doubtful integrity of a judicial officer and the HC is of the view that he should not continue in service, how can the SC interfere in that decision?” “Spoken reputation of a judicial officer is important to maintain public faith in the justice delivery system.Once a committee of judges casts a doubt on the integrity of a judicial officer and if a decision is taken to compulsorily retire him, then the benefit of doubt (about the correctness of the decision) should go to the institution and not the judicial officer,” the CJI said.The high court had said the service record of the judicial officer from 2000 till 2015 shows the case disposal was either ‘just adequate’, ‘inadequate’, ‘adequate’ or ‘poor’.“We have also noticed adverse entries in his confidential reports. There were three vigilance complaints registered against him, though they were filed. The petitioner was aware of all these adverse facets, and they have become final. At this stage, we cannot substitute the entries in confidential reports or assessments of disposal,” HC had said.“The office that a judge holds is an office of public trust. A judge must be aperson of impeccable integrity and unimpeachable independence… The standard of conduct expected of a judge is much higher than an ordinary man. This is no excuse that since the standards in the society have fallen, the judges who are drawn from the society cannot be expected to have high standards and ethical firmness required of ajudge,” the court had said.","A Gujarat additional district judge was compulsorily retired in July 2016 on attaining the age of 56 years and nine months.

A division bench of the HC had set aside the interim directions — change of credit and Rs 2 crore deposit — saying Dagar had failed to establish prima facie proof of authorship or originality of ‘Shiva Stuti’.An SC bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told Rahman’s counsel, A M Singhvi, that the plaintiff has made out a case with regard to the originality of the composition but the issue of authorship would be examined.Both the CJI and Justice Bagchi were unequivocal about the immense contributions made by Dagar Bandhu to Indian classical music and said, “Without their and other exponents’ contributions, do you think modern singers would have survived?” SC told Singhvi “instead of going into legal niceties, you could give some respect to them.

It was the state election commission that had cited this fact before SC, he said.For the state govt, senior advocate V Giri said the HC should have kept the logistics in mind while setting the deadline for completion of civic body elections.The CJI-led bench in its order said, ""The direction by the HC that elections to local bodies are required to be held after the expiry of their tenure as per constitutional mandate does not warrant any interference.""""However, having regard to logistic difficulties, we modify the time schedule and direct that all preparatory work be completed before March 31 instead of Feb 28.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Friday appointed ex-IPS officer N K Mishra and ex-IRS officer Pratap Singh as special observers for West Bengal and Tamil Nadu respectively, tasking them with overseeing the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral roll as well as the preparedness and conduct of impending assembly poll in the two states.Polls in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Kerala as well as the Union territory of Puducherry are expected to be held in April-May. EC usually appoints special observers after announcement of Lok Sabha/assembly poll schedule.“As a special observer, you will oversee that the process of special intensive revision is strictly as per the directions of the commission issued from time to time. You will be required to visit West Bengal/Tamil Nadu from time to time to observe the ongoing SIR….poll preparedness and the conduct of forthcoming general election to the legislative assembly of West Bengal/Tamil Nadu, 2026 and give your inputs to the commission for necessary action,” EC said in separate communications sent to Mishra and Singh on Friday.Mishra, a Sikkim cadre IPS officer of 1988 batch, had served as DGP of Sikkim and as special director in the Intelligence Bureau. He had also served as special police observer in Maharashtra during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. West Bengal has a history of poll violence and clashes between political workers of rival parties. Mishra, as special observer, will be keeping a watch on law and order in the state as well as observance of EC’s guidelines and directions for free and fair conduct of assembly polls, including those relating to deployment of Central paramilitary forces.Singh, a 1991 batch IRS officer, had served as Director General, Income Tax (Investigation) in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu is known for high and unaccounted poll expenditure; in 2019 Lok Sabha election, the EC had cancelled the poll in Vellore parliamentary constituency due to excessive use of money power to influence voters. Earlier in 2016, assembly polls in two constituencies - Thanjavur and Aravakurichi — were cancelled on the same grounds, followed by rescinding of election in R K Nagar assembly constituency in 2017.The EC asked the two retired officers — who will be under EC’s superintendence and control and shall receive an honorarium — to visit their respective states in coordination with the chief electoral officer concerned. As per EC rules, special observers are paid a base slab of Rs 1 lakh for a two-week deployment, which goes up by Rs 25,000 with each extra week of deployment.",The Election Commission on Friday appointed ex-IPS officer N K Mishra and ex-IRS officer Pratap Singh as special observers for West Bengal and Tamil Nadu respectively.

Need to focus on value addition in food processing: Chirag Paswan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-focus-on-value-addition-in-food-processing-chirag-paswan/articleshow/128326537.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has the volume to support food security of many other countries, but the full potential of the food processing sector has not been tapped yet, food processing minister Chirag Paswan said on Friday, while emphasising the need to take this sector deeper into the rural India.Paswan said that in the food processing industry, India has volume, but now there is a need to focus on value addition. He said there are key challenges, including making farmers financially strong, which can happen only when they have holding capacity to sell their produce when they get a good price. The minister said this can happen when the shelf life of farm produce is enhanced by value addition. He added that there is a need to set up more food processing units close to agriculture production hubs. He also highlighted the need to address wastage, particularly of perishable products.He said several interventions, which govt has taken in the past decade, will help India to position itself as a global food basket. On India’s growth story, Paswan said a decade of structural reforms under PM Modi have strengthened the country’s economic resilience. Paswan said even amid global uncertainties, India remains the fastest-growing major economy.He added the country’s next leap will be powered not merely by scale, but by value creation particularly in agriculture and allied sectors. “Our agriculture sector is shifting from subsistence to value creation,” he said, underscoring the renewed focus on animal husbandry, fisheries, and food processing.On India-US deal, Paswansaid the interests of farmers will never be compromised. The assurance came as the Opposition raised questions over the deal, calling it ‘anti-farmer.” “India is one of the fastest-growing economies. That means we are doing something right. Our policies are often challenged, but we are allaying every fear.”","Food processing minister Chirag Paswan said India has the volume to support food security of many other countries.

Spectrum can't be part of insolvency process: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spectrum-cant-be-part-of-insolvency-process-sc/articleshow/128322830.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday held that telecom companies cannot claim ownership over spectrum allocated to them by govt and the natural resource cannot be subject to insolvency and liquidation process of a bankrupt telecom company.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the plea of banks, which submitted that licenced spectrum could also be put on block to recover debt taken by a bankrupt telecom company. It quashed an NCLAT order in insolvency proceedings of Aircel group, which had said that spectrum usage rights could be treated as assets of a corporate debtor and could be transferred during insolvency or liquidation. The court's order is a setback to banks, which have exposure to telecom firms.""Recognition of spectrum licensing rights as an intangible asset in the balance sheet is not determinative of recognition/transfer of ownership of the spectrum to telecom service providers (TSPs). It only indicates control over the future economic benefits flowing from the grant of the right to use the spectrum. Hence, even if the right to use spectrum exhibits property-like features, such as longer licensing terms, exclusivity, transferability, tradability, etc, they merely represent different sticks in the bundle of rights and falls short of conferring complete ownership of the spectrum on TSPs,"" the bench said.Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment, said merely because spectrum can be treated as an ""asset"" on the basis of certain attributes - such as possession and usage, lease and assignment, claim and liability or credit and debt - the entirety of the telecom sector cannot be brought under the sweep of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).He said the grant of a telecom licence, including the right to use spectrum, does not effect a transfer of ownership or proprietary interest. ""What is conferred is a limited, conditional and revocable privilege to use spectrum for specified purposes and for a defined duration,"" the bench said.""In conclusion, the framework of IBC is clear in excluding assets over which the corporate debtor has no ownership rights. Mere recognition of spectrum licensing rights as an intangible asset by TSPs in financial statements is not conclusive of their ownership, as it only represents control over future economic benefits. Even assuming that licensing of spectrum rights is one among the bundle of rights, in the absence of transfer of title over the spectrum, no ownership rights are created in TSPs either in the spectrum or in its right to use as governed by licensing conditions. Hence, under the IBC framework, spectrum licensing right is not a part of the pool of assets for insolvency or liquidation,"" the judgment said.It said licence agreement leaves no doubt that effective and pervasive control over the licence and spectrum vests with the licensor (govt) and licensee's rights are circumscribed by regulatory oversight, disclosure obligations, restrictions on transfer, and the ever-present power of the licensor to suspend or terminate the licence for breach, liquidation, or winding up of the licensee.","Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the plea of banks.

In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones

Israel Bombs Gaza; Kids Among Several Killed As IDF Claims Attack On Soldier In Northern Strip

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy has announced that she will not attend the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale), where a film she wrote nearly four decades ago is scheduled to be screened in the festival’s Classics section. Roy’s screenplay, written 38 years ago, was selected for screening at Berlinale 2026. In a statement released on Friday, she described the selection as meaningful on a personal level.“In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, a whimsical film that I wrote 38 years ago, was selected to be screened under the Classics section at the Berlinale 2026. There was something sweet and wonderful about this for me,” she said.However, Roy said she had been grappling with broader political concerns related to Germany’s stance on Palestine, even as she acknowledged the support she has received from German audiences in the past. “Although I have been profoundly disturbed by the positions taken by the German government and various German cultural institutions on Palestine, I have always received political solidarity when I have spoken to German audiences about my views on the genocide in Gaza.This is what made it possible for me to think of attending the screening of Annie at the Berlinale.”Her decision not to attend, she said, followed remarks made by members of the Berlinale jury earlier on Thursday. “This morning, like millions of people across the world, I heard the unconscionable statements made by members of the jury of the Berlin film festival when they were asked to comment about the genocide in Gaza. To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping. It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time—when artists, writers and filmmakers should be doing everything in their power to stop it. ”Roy went on to state her position unequivocally: “Let me say this clearly: what has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people...""She also criticized prominent cultural figures for what she sees as their silence. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”Concluding her statement, Roy announced her withdrawal from the event: “With deep regret, I must say that I will not be attending the Berlinale.”","Author Arundhati Roy has announced that she will not attend the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale) A film she wrote nearly four decades ago is scheduled to be screened in the festival’s Classics section.

NEW DELHI: Coal and mines minister G Kishan Reddy on Thursday launched the second round of auctions for exploration licences covering 11 blocks of critical and deep-seated minerals across eight states. The licences will allow exploration of rare earth minerals in Telangana, Rajasthan and Odisha, along with diamond, vanadium, titanium and other minerals in additional states.The minister said the second tranche builds on the strong response to the first round, deepening private sector participation under the new exploration regime and promoting technologically advanced exploration practices. He also launched the Geological Survey of India’s Next-Generation Portal — a cloud-enabled platform integrating data acquisition, analysis, visualisation and dissemination.As global competition for critical minerals intensifies, Reddy said resilient supply chains are essential for strategic security and underscored the country’s push to reduce import dependence and achieve mineral self-reliance under the ‘Viksit Bharat’ vision.“India is working to reduce import dependence and achieve mineral self-reliance in line with the Viksit Bharat vision,” the minister said, highlighting mining sector reforms aimed at building a robust exploration ecosystem.He also referred to the expanded scope of the National Mineral Exploration and Development Trust and a “whole-of-govt” approach to strengthening exploration, data integration, data-driven decision-making and systematic identification of mineral prospects.","The licences will allow exploration of rare earth minerals in Telangana, Rajasthan and Odisha, along with diamond, vanadium, titanium and other minerals in additional states.

"SC upheld soldiers’ disability pension as recognition of sacrifice, not charity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-upheld-soldiers-disability-pension-as-recognition-of-sacrifice-not-charity/articleshow/128317451.cms,"CHANDIGARH: In a significant ruling affecting thousands of former Armed Forces personnel, the Supreme Court (SC) has held that eligible ex-servicemen (ESM) are entitled to full arrears of disability pension from the applicable cut-off dates, either January 1, 1996, or January 1, 2006, without restriction to a three-year limitation period. The SC also made it clear that ""the disability pension is not a matter of largesse, but a recognition of sacrifice made in service of the nation.""""Right to receive disability pension is a valuable right and once found due, the benefit of the same has to be given from the date it became due. The same cannot be curtailed by restricting the benefit to a period of three years preceding the filing of the original application,"" the apex court has clarified.A bench comprising Justice Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Justice Alok Aradhe passed these orders while dismissing the appeals by the central government and allowing those filed by ex-servicemen seeking complete arrears.The main issue of consideration before the apex court was if the arrears of disability pension be restricted to three years prior to filing the claim before the armed forces tribunal (AFT).The dispute traces back to the Supreme Court’s landmark 2014 judgment titled Union of India versus Ram Avtar, where a three-judge bench ruled that Armed Forces personnel who retired with disabilities attributable to or aggravated by military service were entitled to “broad banding” of disability pension, even if they were not invalidated out of service.Following that ruling, many ex-servicemen approached the AFT seeking re-computation of their disability pension and payment of arrears. While some tribunal benches granted arrears from the date of retirement or applicable pay commission cut-off, others restricted arrears to three years, citing limitation principles.In its appeal, the central government represented by Attorney General submitted that the grievance of the government is confined to the direction to pay arrears of disability pension beyond a period of three years. It was contended that claims for arrears of disability pension are governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963, as well as Section 22 of the Act, and that even in cases of continuing wrong, arrears cannot extend beyond the prescribed period of limitation.However, rejecting the centre's plea, the SC observed that pension is not a matter of charity or executive discretion. It is a “deferred portion of compensation” and constitutes a vested property right protected under Article 300A of the Constitution. ""The contention advanced on behalf of the Union of India that the claim for arrears of disability pension is barred by Limitation Act, cannot be accepted,"" held the SC in its 17-pages detailed order.","Supreme Court rules that eligible ex-servicemen (ESM) are entitled to full arrears of disability pension without restriction to a three-year limitation period. The SC also made it clear that ""the disability pension is not a matter of largesse, but a recognition of sacrifice made in service of the nation""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128317465,imgsize-1000510,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

He informed the Upper House that timelines and safety measures are being followed in commissioning nuclear plants, and Unit-3 of the Kudankulam plant is likely to be completed by 2026 and Unit-4 by 2027.The country’s nuclear capacity is set to nearly triple to about 22,380 MW by 2031-32 from the current 8,780 MW and further expand to 100 GW by 2047, he said.","The govt also said that directorates, wings and divisions will be set up to ensure enforcement of safety, security and safeguards.

In several locations, protests also took place outside the homes of Congress leaders.In Hoshiarpur, Deputy Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Jai Krishan Singh Rouri, along with some party MLAs, were among those present at the protest.The ruling party even arranged for a wedding band to play during the demonstrations as a symbolic protest against Bajwa's alleged derogatory remarks.Addressing the gathering in Hoshiarpur, AAP leaders described Bajwa's comments as ""unfortunate and unacceptable,"" demanding an apology from him. They stated that they would continue to oppose him on this issue during the upcoming Budget session of the Punjab Assembly.Bajwa had accused Minister Harbhajan Singh of corruption and stated that the Congress would hold him accountable once they form the government.""Jehra pehle band vajaanda reha, ehda band asin vajaavange (He who used to be a band player will be taken to task by us), Bajwa had said, referring to Singh.In response, Harbhajan Singh criticised Bajwa, asserting that mocking honest, hard-earned livelihoods was shameful. He noted that his father was a bandmaster who educated his children through hard work.Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission chairman Jasvir Singh Garhi had taken suo motu notice of Bajwa's remark. Bajwa's counsel had said on Wednesday that the leader of the opposition (LoP) in the Punjab Assembly did not make any objectionable remarks against Harbhajan Singh.Bajwa's denial came through his counsel Arvind Kumar Sachdeva, who appeared before the chairman of the Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission in a case of his alleged objectionable remarks against Harbhajan Singh.Meanwhile, speaking to reporters during the protest in Hoshiarpur, Rouri said such language did not suit the LoP. ""In a democratic system, it is not appropriate to make comments on someone's background or profession. Such language has no place in Punjab,"" he said.Rouri added that Bajwa's remarks had hurt the sentiments of working-class individuals. He highlighted that Harbhajan Singh comes from a humble background and has achieved success through hard work, emphasising that disrespecting any profession goes against Punjab's culture.""The band is traditionally associated with celebrations and the dignity of labour. Targeting someone for such work reflects a narrow mindset,"" he said.Rouri further stated that political opposition should be based on issues and policies rather than personal or derogatory references.In Ludhiana, AAP protested outside the office of Punjab Congress chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, with Minister Hardeep Singh Mundian leading the demonstration.

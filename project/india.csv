'Daisy has driven everyone crazy': Karnataka HC dismisses case against man accused of stealing neighbour's cat; calls it 'frivolous',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/daisy-has-driven-everyone-crazy-karnataka-hc-dismisses-case-against-man-accused-of-stealing-neighbours-cat-calls-it-frivolous/articleshow/121766748.cms,"Representative images (File Image)

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka High Court dismissed a ""frivolous"" criminal case on Tuesday against a man accused of stealing a cat named 'Daisy'.During the post-lunch hearing, Justice M Nagaprasanna commented with amusement: ""Cat named Daisy has driven everyone crazy"".The proceedings against Taha Husain were terminated after he stated that his neighbour had lodged a false police complaint accusing him of taking her cat.The petitioner approached the high court in 2023 to dismiss the case, which was heard on July 23, 2024. Justice Nagaprasanna provided temporary relief by suspending all legal actions against Husain.The court stated: ""Permitting further proceedings in such frivolous cases will clog the criminal justice system.""In July 2024, police filed a chargesheet following the FIR. Husain faced charges under Sections 504, 506 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal intimidation, breach of peace, and insulting the modesty of woman. The police cited CCTV evidence showing the cat inside Husain's residence at a particular time.The defence lawyer argued that cats naturally enter and leave houses through windows, which should not be considered a criminal act.","Karnataka High Court dismisses a ""frivolous"" criminal case against a man.

"'India ain't football you kick around': Ex-Pentagon official Rubin on ties with Canada; calls Khalistan, Nijjar issue 'Trudeau's fictions'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-aint-football-you-kick-around-ex-pentagon-official-rubin-on-ties-with-canada-calls-khalistan-nijjar-issue-trudeaus-fictions/articleshow/121766861.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ex-Pentagon official Michael Rubin criticised Justin Trudeau 's approach towards India and said that it was ""not a football which you kick around but an ally you strive to embrace"". Terming the Khalistan and Hardeep Singh Nijjar issues- the core reasons behind souring of India-Canada ties- ""Trudeau's fictions"", Rubin appreciated Mark Carney for making an effort to rebuild ties with India.""India is not a football which you kick around. It is an ally to be embraced"", Rubin said in an exclusive interview with ANI.""The grievances about Hardeep Singh Nijjar and the Khalistan movement were not real. They were exaggerations that Justin Trudeau amplified...Justin Trudeau may have wanted so much to appease radical Sikh extremists in various constituencies that he was willing to take an organised crime hit between various Sikh groups and mafias and blame an outside power for it, rather than acknowledge the problem and the fault was Canada's alone. That is Justin Trudeau's problem. But now that Justin Trudeau is gone and likely will never return to power, Prime Minister Carney is taking a sober approach and recognising that he is not going to be tied to Justin Trudeau's fictions,"" he added.Contrasting Trudeau's approach towards India with that of current Canadian PM Mark Carney's, he said, ""Mark Carney is working on repairing the relationship rather than following Justin Trudeau down the rabbit hole already shows that Prime Minister Carney is a much more serious person than the former Prime Minister of Canada...Canadanow needs to demonstrate its good faith.""""Canada's relationship with India, especially under Justin Trudeau, was not principled. It was all virtue signalling and politics. The fact of the matter is that India is crucial to Canada, and Canada needs to decide whether ultimately it's going to side with the democracies like India and the United States, or whether it's going to posture the way Justin Trudeau did and allow China, which also has significant interests in Canada,"" he added.Talking about Carney's invite to PM Narendra Modi for G7 summit, Rubin said, ""Canadian PM Mark Carney originally was a banker. He understands the importance of India. Justin Trudeau was a politician who peddled in image and imagination, and therefore it makes sense that Carney wants to restore maturity to the relationship.""""It makes sense for Prime Minister Modi to show that the problem was not Canada itself, but the immaturity and unprofessionalism of Justin Trudeau,"" he added.Canada will host the upcoming G7 summit from June 15 to 17, gathering the world's top industrialized nations—France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Japan, the US, and Canada—alongside the EU and international bodies such as the IMF, World Bank, and UN.

India will strike deep inside Pak if provoked with terror attacks: Jaishankar in Belgium,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-will-strike-deep-inside-pak-if-provoked-with-terror-attacks-jaishankar-in-belgium/articleshow/121765720.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will go deep into Pakistan to hit terrorists if they provoke the Indian govt with terror attacks, foreign minister S Jaishankar said while stressing that India will not live with terrorism anymore. In an interview in Brussels, he said Pakistan had trained thousands of terrorists and was ready to unleash them on India.Asked about China's support to Pakistan, the minister warned against double standards on the issue of terrorism. ""They have had close ties for decades. But on an issue like terrorism, you cannot afford ambiguity or double standards. In the end, it's a problem that concerns all of us,"" said the minister.The message to the terrorists, he said, is that there is going to be retribution, and that retribution will be against the terrorist organisations and the terrorist leadership.""We don't care where they are. If they are deep in Pakistan, we will go deep into Pakistan,"" he said, adding that India's fighter aircraft and missiles had inflicted far more damage on the Pakistani Air Force than vice versa, forcing Pakistan to sue for peace in the conflict that followed India's Operation Sindoor against the terrorists.""As far I'm concerned, how effective the Rafale was or frankly, how effective other systems were - to me the proof of the pudding are the destroyed and disabled airfields on the Pakistani side,"" he said.

"India crosses the Rubicon with Op Sindoor but challenges remain; a riveting, action-packed year awaits Modi 3.0",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-riveting-action-packed-year-awaits-modi-3-0-on-the-diplomatic-front/articleshow/121765702.cms,"The first year of Modi 3.0 will be remembered most for Operation Sindoor that followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, thrusting Pakistan back to the centre stage of Indian foreign policy. By striking terrorist infrastructure deep inside Pakistan, India imposed unprecedented costs upon Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism but also raised the stakes for the international community’s indulgence of Pakistan’s duplicity in addressing a core Indian concern.The year also saw milestones being delivered like the India-UK FTA and the India-EU end-of-2025 deadline set by both sides for a similar agreement that the EU has described as the largest deal of its kind anywhere in the world. PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US within a month of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, along with the launch of negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement, was also one of the high points.There were other foreign policy pluses, none perhaps more significant than the breakthrough with China in the form of the successful settlement of the 5-year-old border standoff. The thaw in the relationship after the Modi-Xi meeting in October in Russia saw India resuming bilateral visits to Beijing and agreeing on a host of measures to normalize ties.Among the highlights was the upgrade in ties with the Taliban with the first political contact in the form of external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s talks with the acting Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi. PM Narendra Modi also garnered international attention for his back-to-back visits to Russia and Ukraine, during which he stressed the importance of direct talks to end the war – something the 2 sides are engaged in currently.However, many of these foreign policy hits remain an unfinished business and will test India’s resolve in the new year. On Pakistan, the challenge will be to ensure the global community, particularly the UN Security Council where Pakistan is a member, shows understanding about the punitive terms India has set out in the “new normal” against Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism. This will be critical in the event of another terrorist attack from across the LoC. The all-party delegations have made a beginning but there’s more to be done, while being mindful of the risks of India-Pakistan re-hyphenation that such an exercise might entail.Managing the relationship with the US will be another pressing challenge in the 2nd year of Modi 3.0. This has arisen unexpectedly from Trump’s constant needling of India on bilateral trade and perhaps even more damaging utterances on the India-Pakistan conflict, like his use of the term mediation – a big taboo in Indian foreign policy lexicon - and his drawing an equivalence between India and Pakistan. India is hoping that not just the US but also its other Quad partners will be more liberal in their support for India on cross-border terrorism, like in the form of a joint statement when the foreign ministers and leaders meet this year.The third significant challenge in the next few months will be to decide whether it’s time to reinforce the improvement in ties with Beijing by resuming direct air and normal visa services with China and, more importantly, with a visit to the country by Modi for the SCO summit. Despite China’s ties with Pakistan acting as a deterrent, especially in a supercharged atmosphere with Pakistan, India has kept the door open for continued engagement, with CDS Anil Chauhan recently declaring that “there’s no definitive proof of real-time targeting support” from China to Pakistan during the conflict.Modi has also shown interest in rebuilding ties with Canada by accepting his counterpart Mark Carney’s delayed invitation for the G7 but this will be subject to Ottawa’s handling of Khalistan separatists and also the probe into the Hardeep Nijjar murder that wrecked the relationship. Signs of improvement in Pakistan-Taliban ties and the proposal to expand CPEC into Afghanistan might pose a few problems too. All in all, a riveting, action-packed year is what awaits Modi 3.",The first year of Modi 3.0 will be remembered most for Operation Sindoor that followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India imposed unprecedented costs upon Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism. The breakthrough with China in the form of the successful settlement of the 5-year-old border standoff was also significant.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121765711,imgsize-1249119,width-400,resizemode-4/121765711.jpg"
"Modi government at 11: Operation Sindoor a success, but defence budget needs to go up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-government-at-11-operation-sindoor-a-success-but-defence-budget-needs-to-go-up/articleshow/121765634.cms,"With the deep military collusiveness between Pakistan and China being rudely reinforced during Operation Sindoor , India needs to raise its annual defence budget to at least 2.5% of GDP, impart a greater thrust to self-reliance in military R&D and production, and invest heavily in unmanned aerial systems, long-range weapons, space-based systems, electronic warfare and other such tech that will be decisive in future warfare.Modi govt will have to contend with the now well-fused two-front challenge along our long unresolved borders, which will see China continue to use Pakistan as a more than willing proxy to bog India down in South Asia.China is, and will remain, India's main strategic threat in the years ahead. ""India will have to tackle a superpower (China), which will also actively continue to support a near-peer military adversary (Pakistan) against us. We need to continue bolstering both our conventional and nuclear deterrence,"" a top military officer told TOI.The wide array of Chinese weapons and sensor-shooter networks used by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities, ranging from J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to HQ-9 air defence missile batteries, make this quite evident. It's only going to get worse, with Pakistan on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets and even the formidable HQ-19 long-range air defence missile systems from China.Despite competing demands from other crucial developmental sectors, India simply cannot let its defence budget languish at just about 1.9% of GDP. The bulk of the allocation, as of now, is gobbled up by the huge salary and pension bill as well as operational sustenance, leaving barely 25% for concrete military modernisation. ""Emergency procurements approved by govt are more than welcome to plug immediate operational gaps, but the overall budget needs a sharp hike,"" another officer said.There is also no getting away from the fact that genuine 'Atmanirbharta' in defence production with a much greater role for the private sector, instead of the present half-hearted measures, is critical for systematically building potent capabilities across the spectrum, ensuring adequate war-wastage reserves and surge capacities in crisis situations. ""It's critical for retaining strategic autonomy. India will have to fight its battles alone or largely on its own,"" the top officer said.The indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), for instance, needs to be majorly fast-tracked after the defence ministry last month finally approved a new ""programme execution model"" for prototype development.The long, meandering developmental history of the fourth-generation Tejas, which began way back in 1983, cannot be repeated. The IAF is still waiting to get the first Tejas Mark-1A 'improved' fighter. Similarly, indigenous development of 110 Kilonewton engines, with or without foreign collaboration, to power AMCA is critical. IAF is currently grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised.Then, there are drones and standoff weapons, which have revolutionised the nature of modern-day combat. From low cross-section loitering munitions and swarm drones to FPV (first person view) drones and UCAVs (unmanned combat aerial vehicles), all need to be produced in India in large numbers.The sheer operational utility of a robust multi-layered air defence also came to the fore during Operation Sindoor, with India using Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range), Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km, jointly developed with Israel), the indigenous Akash systems (25-km) and several short-range systems to thwart multiple drone and missile attacks by Pakistan.Towards this end, DRDO needs to complete its ongoing development of the very short-range air defence system missiles, which have a 6-km range, and the long-range system under Project Kusha, with a 350-km range, on a war footing.Amid all this, long-pending systemic defence reforms like slashing the non-operational flab in the 15-lakh strong armed forces, streamlining long-winded procurement procedures and setting up unified theatre commands for an integrated war-fighting machinery in a cost effective manner, cannot fall by the wayside.","China is, and will remain, India's main strategic threat in the years ahead. India simply cannot let its defence budget languish at just about 1.9% of GDP. The bulk of the allocation, as of now, is gobbled up by the huge salary and pension bill as well as operational sustenance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121765665,imgsize-1759781,width-400,resizemode-4/121765665.jpg"
Modi at 11: PM increases vitality gap with opposition as new challenges loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-at-11-pm-increases-vitality-gap-with-opposition-as-new-challenges-loom/articleshow/121765620.cms,"One year ago, when Narendra Modi began his record-equalling third term, the mood in BJP and the larger saffron fraternity was far from that of unalloyed celebration. Contrary to the near-total consensus that BJP would surpass its 2019 score of 303, the party's tally had dropped to a modest 240, forcing it to depend on the support of TDP and JD(U) to form the govt. Instantly, commentary was rife that the law of diminishing returns had finally caught up with the man who had defied the capriciousness of public sentiment as well as the headwinds and vicissitudes which had, quite predictably, marked his 10 years, not just to maintain but to improve his standing with the voter.True to himself, Modi struck a sunny note, focusing on the positive takeaways from the less-than-satisfactory outcome. But that was not enough to quell the doubts gnawing at supporters. Rivals, of course, were jubilant, not letting their third consecutive defeat come in the way of celebrations.But it did not take long for the pall of uncertainty to lift. BJP's victories in Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi proved wrong those who had rushed to write the obituaries. It failed to form a govt in Jammu and Kashmir, but its performance in Jammu was yet another indication of its superiority over Congress in straight contests: something that the defeat in Jharkhand could not erase.Several factors contributed to the outcomes. But Modi's continuing popularity was, unarguably, the common thread. Together, they also showed that the opposition, particularly, had drawn disproportionate conclusions from the setback in the Lok Sabha polls. Also, the gambits, for instance, the unsubstantiated charge about a conspiracy to abolish quotas or the consolidation of Muslims in favour of the opposition, may not necessarily be all-weather winners.Modi, keeping any disappointment over the dip in numbers to himself, had started his third innings on a brisk note, in any case. The electoral wins came as an impetus, countering the hope of opponents and the fear of supporters that his dependence on allies, both of whom were tough bargainers, would force him to govern with one hand tied behind his back. The enactment of the Waqf Bill is a prime example. Both TDP and JD(U) supported the legislation, dubbed communal by the opposition, which tried to bait them into breaking ranks with BJP by saying that the stands of N Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar would be a litmus test of their secular credentials. Changes in the waqf law affect powerful interests among Muslims far more directly than the abrogation of J&K's special status. Understandably, the lobbying against the move was more intense, often threatening to match the feverish heights last seen over the Shah Bano case and the Babri demolition.If Naidu and Nitish stayed firm, it was because of the simple calculation that Modi's enduring appeal would more than compensate for any loss of Muslim support they still had.There is no sign yet of the opposition closing the vitality gap that Modi has opened up. It is 11 years since he took over, but he has not stopped taking either initiatives or plotting counter-manoeuvres to disrupt opposition's plans. The decision on caste census is a classic example of Modi coming up with a move which the rival had not anticipated. With this single move, he undercut Rahul Gandhi's effort over the years to cast himself as a social justice warrior. That it came in the wake of Pahalgam only added to the audacity.Operation Sindoor only served to strengthen Brand Modi. India won this round decisively, with satellite images of the losses inflicted by the Indian Air Force deep inside Pakistan and the destruction of the hostile neighbour's strategic bases providing tell-tale evidence. No amount of scorekeeping of losses, both real and imaginary, and the embrace of US President Donald Trump's claim to have brokered the 'ceasefire' can take away from this. Looked at purely through the prism of politics, it has recharged the PM's 'jo kaha so kiya' persona and, given the performance of indigenous weapons systems, should put an end to the mocking of his 'Make-in-India' ambition.The military confrontation and its aftermath have seen justified criticism of the outlandish claims made by ultra-zealous individuals on social media and in a few newsrooms. But what has gone unnoticed is the readiness of society to back him to the hilt, regardless of what turn a conflict between two nuclear-armed adversaries might take. Starting with Uri in 2016 and through Balakot, Modi had single-handedly created a new national resolve, which speaks to the people's trust in him.The 'surrender' charge does not seem to bother the Prime Minister. Otherwise, he would not have accepted the invitation to attend the G-7 meeting in Canada, where Trump will loom large.The coming days will not be easy. In Bihar, he will have to strain hard to offset Nitish's incumbency. Global volatility, Trump's tariff war, the general uncertainty that he has generated, and the possibility that Pakistan's military-jihadi complex may try to avenge their humiliation: all these add up to a challenging task. The BJP organisation has not been in good shape for quite some time. A reorganisation has been delayed, putting him and his trusted associate Amit Shah under strain. But don't be surprised if he negotiates them well. He has a proven track record, dating back to 2002 when he took over as chief minister of Gujarat, as well as the crucial wherewithal in the form of a reservoir of goodwill.","One year ago, when Narendra Modi began his record-equalling third term, the mood in BJP and the larger saffron fraternity was far from that of unalloyed celebration.

Gold price prediction today: Amidst ongoing US-China trade deal talks, gold prices are likely to continue fluctuating, with geo-political uncertainties adding to volatility. Where are gold prices headed in the short-term and what are the factors that investors need to watch out for?Top trade deputies of the US and China began their talks in London on Monday. Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar. MCX August gold contract was at Rs 97200, up 0.16% on the day.Earlier, spot gold prices fell 1.25% to close at $3310 on Friday as the US non-farm payroll report (May) came in somewhat better than expected, though details were not so encouraging.Easing US-China trade tensions pressurized the yellow metal further. Despite falling for two straight days on June 5 and June 6, the metal closed nearly 0.63% higher on a weekly basis in the week ending June 6.The metal rose to $3403 on June 5 --highest since May 8- as traders piled into the metal on safe haven demand as US-China tensions escalated.US Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick and US Trade Representative Greer met a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng Monday at London's Lancaster House. Presence of high-profile officials in Trump's Team reflects willingness of the US administration to allow some relaxations in the US exports to China, which may include technical supplies, jet engine parts, etc. China, in turn, is expected to ease rare earth exports to the US.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.394MOz as of June 6. ETF holdings witnessed net inflows for the second consecutive week following net outflows for five straight weeks. ETF holdings are up around 6.70% YTD.China's inflation data released Monday showed that China's CPI (May) declined 0.1% y-o-y vs the forecast of -0.2%. It was the fourth straight monthly decline as the Chinese economy continues to struggle with sluggish demand amid a raging trade war. China’s factory deflation continued for the 32nd straight month as PPI (May) declined 3.3% y-o-y as against the estimate of 3.2% and 2.7% decline in April. The deflation threat will continue to linger unless consumer demand remains sluggish.China's exports slowed from 8.1% y-o-y in April to 4.8% y-o-y (forecast 6%) in May as shipments to the US declined 34% y-o-y, worse than a 21% decline registered in April. Chinese imports dipped 3.4% y-o-y due to trade uncertainty as against the forecast of a decline of 0.8%.The US non-farm report (May) released Friday was somewhat better-than-expected as US employers added 139K jobs Vs the forecast of 126K jobs, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Average hourly earnings m-o-m and y-o-y rose 0.4% and 3.9% respectively Vs the respective estimates of 0.3% (prior 0.2%) and 3.7% (prior 3.9%). However, two-month payroll net revision showed a decline of 95K jobs as labor force participation rate slid from 62.6% to 52.4%. The household survey reflected a weakening job market. Even as the population increased by 188k, the labor force dropped by 625k. Thus, even though employment fell by 696k, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.20%.Traders will closely monitor US CPI (May) and PPI (May) data to be released on June 11 and June 12 respectively for clues to the Fed rate cut path.The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing, was seen at 98.95, down nearly 0.24% on the day. The Index fell 0.14% in the week ending June 6. Ten-year and 30-year US yields were a tad lower at 4.48% and 4.95% respectively.Money managers increased their net bullish gold bets to a seven-week high in the week ending June 3.China's gold reserves were up for the seventh consecutive month as PBoC bought around 2 tons of gold in May. China's gold holdings reached 73.80 MOz at the end of May.The lingering deflation threat to China’s economy, positive ETF inflows and not so strong US non-farm payroll report (May) are positive factors for the yellow metal. However, in the near-term, the metal is expected to take its clues from the ongoing US-China trade talks in London. Positive outcomes from the talks will weigh on the shiny metal. In that case, gold may fall to as low as $3260 (Rs 95,000). Interim support is at $3292 (Rs 96,000). Resistance is at $3365 (Rs 98,000)/$3405 (Rs 99,200).In all the possibility, there may be some tentative positive developments in the trade deal talks. In that case, gold may decline to test the support at $3292. However, full resolution of all the trade related issues looks to be elusive for the time being. Nonetheless, traders need to take cognizance of the ongoing US-China trade deal talks. In the meantime, a light sell position can be initiated with due risk management in place.","Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers.

This was quickly followed by a meeting of PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Russia in October and the resumption of the Special Representatives’ (SR) Talks on the Boundary Question 2 months later.ToI has learnt that Sun will arrive in India on Thursday for a 2-day visit that will likely see him calling on NSA Ajit Doval, apart from holding talks under the foreign secretary-vice minister mechanism. Doval is also likely to host the Chinese Special Representative, Wang Yi, who doubles up as foreign minister, later this year for another round of SR talks.The meeting this week will be an important occasion for India and China to review progress on steps announced in January to normalize the relationship. The 2 sides had then agreed to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025, an Indian demand that has been fulfilled.While there has also been progress in cooperation on trans-border rivers, both sides are yet to resume direct air services between the 2 countries, something they had agreed to do “in principle” in January.The 2 sides will likely also touch upon the possibility of a visit by PM Narendra Modi to China in September to cap a year of détente in the bilateral relationship. Modi has been invited for the SCO summit in Tianjin but is yet to confirm his participation. The summit will be preceded by a meeting of the foreign ministers which external affairs minister S Jaishankar is likely to attend. The visit by Sun, who served as ambassador to India when the eastern Ladakh standoff erupted, also signals an intent on the part of both sides to build upon the nascent thaw in the relationship, not allowing India-Pakistan hostilities to come in the way.India wants dialogue mechanisms to be resumed step by step, in a way that allows both sides to address each other’s concerns. India is likely to raise its concerns related to trade in the meeting, as it seeks a more transparent and predictable economic and trade relationship. Both sides in the last Misri-Sun meeting had also agreed to facilitate people-to-people exchanges, including media and think-tank interactions.",Chinese vice foreign minister Sun Weidong is likely to travel to India this week.

All new ACs to come with minimum temp setting of 20 degrees C,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-new-acs-to-come-with-minimum-temp-setting-of-20-degrees-c/articleshow/121759311.cms,"NEW DELHI: Soon all new air-conditioners (ACs) will come with a minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees centigrade (degrees C) instead of 16 or 18 degrees and a maximum of 28 degrees against 30 degrees at present, a move that can potentially result in savings of Rs 18,000-20,000 crore for consumers in three years once the mandate becomes effective.Describing it as a “uniqe experiment”, power minister Manohar Lal on Tuesday said the new mandate for AC makers will improve efficiency in cooling operations, mitigating the surge in power demand and electricity bills as summers get hotter.As and when the new norms are notified, the new mandate will apply to air-conditioners used across sectors — from domestic to commercial establishments such as office blocks, malls, hotels and movie theatres, which often run their units at the lowest setting.The ‘experiment’ appears to be inspired by similar moves in Italy and Japan. While Rome has fixed the lowest temperature setting for public buildings at 23 degrees C, Japan follows a fixed temperature of 27 degrees C.Government data indicate that every 1 degree C increase in temperature setting for cooling reduces power consumption by 6%. They also show that if 6 crore urban households and 12 lakh commercial establishments keep their AC setting between 22 and 24 degrees C, it will save 12-15 billion units of power annually and do away the need to build 4-5 coal-fired power plants and substantially reduce carbon emission.Industry bodies representing the manufacturers said the move will raise their R&D expenses but also push up demand for more efficient units, which usually cost more.Based on a 2018 Bureau of Energy Efficiency study, the government had in 2020 mandated a default setting of 24 degrees C for air-conditioners and suggested running the units at 26-27 degrees C, a temperature level it described as healthy.In October 2023, the International Energy Agency said India's demand for electricity from household air-conditioners will increase significantly by 2050, potentially exceeding total power consumption in Africa. It also anticipated India will experience the highest energy demand growth globally over the next three decades, driven by rising incomes and a warming climate.GoThe minister also announced a Rs 5,400 crore VGF funding for 30 gigawatt of battery storage projects and extending the waiver of inter-state transmission charges for green power till June 28, 2028. These decisions are expected to spur investments of Rs 33,000 crore in the battery storage projects and prove to be a boon for Rs 1 lakh crore worth of green transmission projects underway.",All new air-conditioners (ACs) will come with a minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees centigrade (degrees C) instead of 16 or 18 degrees. Power minister Manohar Lal said the new mandate for AC makers will improve efficiency in cooling operations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121759309,imgsize-494855,width-400,resizemode-4/121759309.jpg"
"India population 1.46 billion, but fertility rate down: UN report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-delhi-kerala-tamil-nadu-educated-middle-class-put-off-childbirth/articleshow/121762535.cms,"In Delhi, Kerala, TN, educated middle-class put off childbirth

NEW DELHI: India’s population for 2025 is estimated at 1.46 billion, says a new UN report, which also flagged a declining total fertility rate (TFR) in the world’s most populous country.The population is expected to grow to about 1.7 billion before it begins to fall, around 40 years from now, said the UN Population Fund’s (UNFPA) 2025 State of World Population Report released Tuesday. China’s population is estimated to touch 1.41 billion this year.India’s population was 1.44 billion last year, according to World Population Prospects-2024, also a UN report, released in July last year.The UNFPA report showed India’s TFR has declined to 1.9, which is below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, indicating women are having fewer children than needed to maintain the population size from one generation to the next.It noted that while India has made significant progress in lowering fertility rate, deep inequalities persist across states, castes and incomes.Even as India's fertility rate is declining, many people in India, especially women, still face significant barriers to making free and informed decisions about their reproductive lives, says the UN Population Fund's State of World Population Report released Tuesday.These barriers create what the report identified as India's ""high fertility and low fertility duality"".The fertility rate has come down from nearly five children per woman in 1970 to about two, courtesy improved education and access to reproductive healthcare. The TFR fell below the replacement level rate to 2.0 for the first time in the National Family Health Survey (2019-21).States such as Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh continue to experience high fertility rates. Here, unintended and closely spaced births are common due to poor contraceptive and health services, and gender norms, it said.On the other hand, states such as Delhi, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have sustained below-replacement fertility with many couples delaying or skipping childbirth due to costs and work-life conflict, especially among educated middle-class women.The report called for a shift from panic over falling fertility to addressing unmet reproductive goals as it highlighted that millions of individuals are not able to realise their real fertility goals. ""This is the real crisis, not underpopulation or overpopulation. The answer lies in greater reproductive agency - a person's ability to make free and informed choices about sex, contraception and starting a family,"" it said.In line with these trends, a UNFPA-YouGov survey of 14,000 respondents across14 countries, including India, challenged global narratives around ""population explosion vs population collapse"" as it showed that one in three adult Indians (36%) face unintended pregnancies while 30% experience unfulfilled desire of having either more or fewer children. Notably, 23% faced both.Financial limitation is one of the biggest barriers to reproductive freedom with nearly four in 10 people citing it as a reason stopping them from having the families they want. Job insecurity (21%), housing constraints (22%), and lack of reliable childcare (18%) are making parenthood feel out of reach.","India’s population for 2025 is estimated at 1.46 billion, says a new UN report. The population is expected to grow to about 1.7 billion before it begins to fall. The fertility rate has come down from nearly five children per woman in 1970 to about two.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121762538,imgsize-1957573,width-400,resizemode-4/121762538.jpg"

Poll Do you believe the position of Deputy Speaker should be filled promptly? Yes, it's essential for democracy No, it's not a priority right now

NEW DELHI: Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , who is also the Rajya Sabha leader of opposition, wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.Highlighting the vacant status of the position for the two consecutive Lok Sabha terms, Kharge said this ""does not augur well for India's democratic polity and is also in violation of well-laid-out provisions of the Constitution"".""From the First to the Sixteenth Lok Sabha, every House has had a Deputy Speaker. By and large, it has been a well-established convention to appoint the Deputy Speaker from among the members of the principal opposition party,"" Kharge wrote on X with a letter he wrote to the PM.He further wrote: ""No Deputy Speaker was elected during the Seventeenth Lok Sabha, and this concerning precedent continues in the ongoing Eighteenth Lok Sabha.""The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is a key constitutional position in India’s lower house of Parliament.The Deputy Speaker is elected by the members of the Lok Sabha, usually from among themselves, soon after the Speaker is elected. The primary role of the Deputy Speaker is to preside over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker and to ensure the smooth conduct of the House. The Deputy Speaker has the same powers as the Speaker when presiding, including maintaining order, deciding on points of order, and managing debates.Importantly, the Deputy Speaker is expected to function in a non-partisan manner, similar to the Speaker, despite being elected from a political party. Traditionally, this post is often offered to a member of the opposition or another party to maintain a balance, although this is not mandated by the Constitution.The position is significant for upholding the parliamentary process and ensuring continuity in the functioning of the Lok Sabha when the Speaker is unavailable.The last Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha in India was M. Thambi Durai from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). He served as the Deputy Speaker during the 16th Lok Sabha (2014–2019).","Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.

Shashi Tharoor, Priyanka Chaturvedi Share Key Insights After Meeting PM Modi At His Residence

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday criticised the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for appointing Pakistan as the vice-chair of its counter-terrorism panel. Singh said this decision is similar to ""making the cat guard the milk"" as Pakistan has a known history of protecting and supporting terrorists.""What is astonishing is that this Counter-Terrorism panel, was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks. Pakistan had sheltered the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. This (decision) is akin to cat guarding the milk,"" Singh said.At an event in Dehradun, Singh said Pakistan has supported terrorism for many years and described Operation Sindoor, which was carried out in response to the Pahalgam attack, as the ""biggest action"" against terrorism in India’s history.Singh pointed out that both India and Pakistan became independent at the same time, but while India is now seen as the ""mother of democracy"", Pakistan has gained the label of ""father of global terrorism"". He said this comparison should be kept in mind.Singh also said Pakistan is ""stubborn"" and needs to be dealt with using ""strategic, diplomatic and economic pressure"" from the global community to stop terrorism from its land.""Pakistan has always given shelter to terrorists, trained them on its soil and helped them. Pahalgam (attack) was just an example, but I want to tell you that list of Pakistan-aided terrorists is very long. And, Pakistan always tries to justify terrorism. So, it is important that we eliminate not just these terrorists but the entire terror infrastructure that aids them,"" he said.He added that Pakistan has not been able to stop development in Kashmir despite efforts.""Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway link is a shining example of the government's relentless pursuit of progress in Jammu & Kashmir. Soon, PoK will join us and say 'I, too, am Bharat',"" he said.Calling terrorism a problem for humanity and a global issue, Singh said that no society should accept it.He also mentioned that some people glorify terrorists as ""freedom fighters"" and said, ""no revolution is born out of the womb of terrorism, it only engenders destruction and hatred"".Singh further stated that ""No religious, ideological or political reason can justify terrorism. No human objective can ever be achieved through bloodshed and violence.""He said Pakistan supports terrorism and a large portion of its foreign aid is used to fund this support.""Funding Pakistan means funding the infrastructure of terrorism. Pakistan is a nursery of terrorism. It should not be nourished,"" he said, asking other countries to stop giving money to Pakistan.Singh said that Pakistan’s land has been a shelter for global terror groups. He named terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar who move freely there, and added that even senior officers of the Pakistan Army have attended terrorists' funerals.""Now, the same country is expected to lead the global community against terrorism. This raises serious questions on the intentions and policies of the international system,"" he said.Singh urged the international community and organisations like the UN to take the issue of terrorism seriously.

Students raise serious concerns over errors in NEET-UG papers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/students-raise-serious-concerns-over-errors-in-neet-ug-papers/articleshow/121762602.cms,"NEW DELHI: NEET-UG 2025, held on May 4, was conducted securely, thanks to enhanced security measures put in place by ministry of education, in coordination with state authorities. However, students and parents/guardians have raised serious concerns over errors in the question paper and delays in redressal of grievances, urging National Testing Agency (NTA) to respond quickly.The results are expected later this month. NEET-UG remains the gateway for over 20 lakh students aspiring to get into MBBS, BDS, and other UG medical courses.In Sikar and Gujarat, candidates received faulty booklets with jumbled page numbers. For example, students who received Paper Code 47 in Sikar found that pages of the question paper were not in order. In Gujarat, particularly in Jamnagar, candidates using Gujarati-medium Paper Code 48 faced the same issue.Due to incorrect sequence of pages in question paper - like question 7 being followed by question 15 - some candidates said they darkened the circle for the wrong question. Others said valuable time was lost trying to figure out the correct corresponding circles on the answer sheet.Following the exam, guardians submitted formal complaints to Gujarat govt and NTA, attaching scanned copies of the faulty booklets as proof. ""Students even raised the issue during the test but were told to solve the faulty paper,"" a parent wrote. A state official confirmed the receipt of such complaints.NTA has declined to comment on the Sikar case, stating the matter is sub judice.Examinees and coaching experts also flagged certain questions as being beyond the medical syllabus. One example doing the rounds is question 38 of Code 47, which involved solving a calculus-based derivative - a topic more suited to engineering entrance tests like JEE (M).An NTA official said: ""All questions were from the prescribed syllabus. The answer keys have been published and objections invited from candidates. These will be reviewed by a committee of subject experts"". However, this does not resolve the concern about misprinted or non-sequential pages, which is a layout issue rather than a content-related one.","In Sikar and Gujarat, candidates received faulty booklets with jumbled page numbers.

"Advocate abused woman trial judge, SC upholds 18-month sentence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-jailed-for-abusing-judicial-officer/articleshow/121762573.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused leniency to an advocate, who was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for using abusive language in 2015 to outrage the modesty of a judicial officer in a Karkardooma courtroom in east Delhi and rejected his plea for reducing the jail term to six months already undergone by him.The convicted advocate, Sanjay Rathod, pleaded with the partial working day bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Manmohan that he was the sole breadwinner of the family comprising his old parents, wife and two children and that he was remorseful about the incident that took place in the courtroom nearly a decade back.The bench said the Delhi High Court has already directed the sentences to run concurrently, thus reducing the total period of incarceration from two years to 18 months. It asked the advocate to surrender within two weeks to serve the remaining period of imprisonment.Justice Manmohan, who was the chief justice of Delhi HC prior to his appointment as a judge of the SC, said, “In Delhi, women judicial officers comprise nearly 50% of the total working strength of judges in the trial courts. If their dignity is not protected, it will create an unsafe atmosphere in the courtroom”. At present the female judicial officers constitute 38% of the total judges in trial courts in India.In Delhi their numbers are healthier at 48%.When the woman judicial officer was conducting proceedings in a traffic challan case, the delinquent advocate was informed by the court that his client’s case had been adjourned. Enraged, he started abusing the judicial officer and used intemperate and abusive language to threaten her. The judicial officer filed a police complaint accusing the advocate of outraging her modesty by using filthy language.In the police case, he was convicted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for insulting the modesty of a woman and three months each for two other offences and was directed to serve the sentences consecutively. On appeal, the additional sessions judge upheld the sentence and directed him to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to her.The HC in its judgment said it was a case in which injustice was inflicted upon a sitting female judicial officer, within her own courtroom – a space that should embody respect, order and the majesty of law.“Here, where she was entrusted with the solemn duty to dispense 'justice' without fear or favour, she was subjected to misconduct, threats, and humiliation by one who, as an advocate, was duty-bound to uphold the dignity of the court. This is, therefore, not merely a case of individual misbehaviour, but a case where injustice was done to justice itself - where a judge, who symbolizes the impartial voice of the law, became the target of personal attack while discharging her official duties,” the HC had said and upheld the 18-month sentence to the advocate.","The advocate, Sanjay Rathod, pleaded with the partial working day bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Manmohan.

If she could do it all over again, Saraswati says she would have fewer children. But her granddaughter Pooja Kumari today has a voice. A graduate, married at 22, she and her husband decided to not have more than two children.The story of Saraswati, her daughter-in-law and granddaughter - three generations of women reflect India's evolving fertility story and their journey finds space in UNFPA's 2025 State of World Population Report. Residents of Bihar's Sheikhpura district, they reflected on how things have changed from grandmothers to granddaughters over 65 years as women gained a voice slowly to an extent over generations affecting fertility aspirations.Saraswati shared that when she was young all the other women in her village had about that many children. If women had fewer, people thought they were sick, Saraswati recalled. ""My mother-in-law always said, ""The more children you have, the more hands there are to work in the fields."" ""We didn't know about contraceptives back then,"" she said. ""When I wanted to stop having children, my mother-in-law insisted that I continue, and I could not disobey her,"" recalled the 64-year-old.Her daughter-in law Anita Devi (42) got married when she was 18 years old in the late 1990s. Unlike her mother-in-law, Anita knew about family planning as health workers visited her village. Nevertheless, she ended up having six children- four daughters and two sons - as her husband and mother-in-law wanted more children, especially a son.But things drastically changed for her daughter Pooja Kumari who is 26 and had her first child at 23. In the following three years, she used contraceptives provided by an Accredited Social Health Activist. She recently decided to have a second child. ""We want to raise them well, provide them with a good education, and ensure a secure future for our family. A small family is best,"" she said.The report noted that in 1960, when India's population was about 436 million, the average woman had nearly six children.

Railways working on releasing passengers charts with confirmed seats 24 hours before departure of train,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-working-on-releasing-passengers-charts-with-confirmed-seats-24-hours-before-departure-of-train/articleshow/121759955.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: Moving to address a major cause of anxiety among train travellers, railways is working on a mechanism to release passenger charts with confirmed seats 24 hours instead of the current norm of releasing it just four hours before the departure of a train. At present, wait-listed passengers, particularly those coming from far-off places to catch trains, remain uncertain and clueless about their ticket status till the final list is put out by the railways.A senior railway official said that a pilot run started in the Bikaner division in Rajasthan from June 6, and so far, there have been no issues. “We will carry out this pilot for some more weeks to identify any issues and how to fix them. There have been several instances of passengers facing problems as they come to know that their wait-listed ticket has not been confirmed, barely hours before reaching the station. An advanced chart will help people plan better and reduce stress,” he added.Officials said the new system aims to help passengers plan their journeys more effectively. For instance, travellers coming from locations 100 km or more away will have better clarity and time to reach the boarding station without last-minute uncertainty.Sources said the proposed norms won’t have any impact on people who plan to travel at the last minute and book Tatkal tickets. “Since Tatkal tickets are booked 48 hours before the scheduled departure of trains, bringing out the full chart a day before won’t be an issue,” another official said.As of now, there is no clarity if railways will release the second and third lists of passengers with confirmed reservations, as there is a possibility of many passengers with confirmed tickets cancelling their booking within the last 24 hours. “Let the pilot run be over and then decisions will be taken keeping in mind the best interest of passengers,” a source said.Earlier, the railway reservation charts were usually prepared twice. The first chart was prepared four hours before the scheduled departure time of the train and the second, or final, chart was prepared between 30 minutes before the train’s departure.","Railways is working on a mechanism to release passenger charts with confirmed seats 24 hours instead of the current norm of releasing it just four hours before the departure of a train.

NEW DELHI: Photos of Shweta Khan, also known as Fultusi, who is accused of running a pornographic racket in West Bengal’s Howrah district, have surfaced online with several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders.

Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.","India women secured a historic win at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the ICC.

NEW DELHI: The air quality in the national capital deteriorated further on Monday, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) near Anand Vihar and surrounding areas touching 371, categorised as ‘Very Poor’ by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Visitors and residents expressed concern over the worsening smog Shane, a foreign national visiting India, said, ""It's pretty bad. I came from Agra by bus and the closer I got to Delhi, the thicker the smog was. You could definitely tell the difference. The closer I got to Delhi, it kept getting worse to the point where I could even barely see the sun anymore.""Saif, a local resident, added, “Pollution in Delhi is rising. There is burning in the eyes and difficulty in breathing.

Investigators: 80 CCTV dashboards compromised

AHMEDABAD: A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare. What began at Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot as a case of careless digital housekeeping spiralled into one of India's most disturbing cyber scandals. Hackers breached the hospital's CCTV system through its default admin login, stole hours of intimate footage of women being examined in the gynaecology ward, and fed it into an international porn fetish network for profit.The access logs spanned nearly a year, from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024, until the perpetrators were arrested this Feb. The hackers were able to steal at least 50,000 clips over nine months from across the country.The scam came to light after teaser clips from the Rajkot facility were posted online on YouTube channels like ""Megha Mbbs"" and ""cp monda"". Customers were led to Telegram groups to buy the footage, for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000. Investigators found about ""80 CCTV dashboards compromised nationwide, including in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, and Delhi"". The victims ranged across 20 states, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate houses, cinema halls, factories, and even private residences.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ""admin123"".An Ahmedabad cybercrime branch officer told TOI: ""The primary method used was a 'brute force attack' (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).""Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this. With stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya - who was later arrested in Delhi and used a diploma in medical laboratory technology as a cover - used a tool meant for legitimate remote viewing to input stolen login details and gain unauthorised access to the hospital's cameras.","A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare. The hackers were able to steal at least 50,000 clips over nine months from across the country.

‘Create Apmaan Mantralaya’: Priyanka Gandhi Takes Dig At PM Modi Over Insult Claims In Bihar Rally

Tharoor flags ‘Family Business’ in Indian politics

BJP seizes on Tharoor’s remarks

Congress hits back:

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has praised senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor ’s latest article criticising dynastic politics, using it to target the Gandhi family and the Congress leadership.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla called the piece “insightful” and hailed Tharoor as a “Khatron ke Khiladi” for directly questioning political succession in his own party.In his essay titled “Indian Politics Are a Family Business” published on Project Syndicate, Tharoor described dynastic politics as a “grave threat to Indian democracy” and urged India to move toward “meritocracy.”He argued that leadership in the Congress and other INDIA bloc parties including the Samajwadi Party, RJD, Shiv Sena (UBT) and DMK has often passed from one generation to the next.Tharoor wrote that from Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Nehru-Gandhi family has cemented the idea that political leadership can be a “birthright.”""For decades, one family has towered over Indian politics. The influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty - including independent India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - is bound up with the history of India's struggle for freedom. But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright,"" his article read.He also cited examples of other political families including Uddhav and Aaditya Thackeray in Maharashtra, Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, Farooq and Omar Abdullah in Jammu and Kashmir and M Karunanidhi and MK Stalin in Tamil Nadu to highlight how dynastic politics extends beyond the Congress party.Responding to the essay, BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla said it “rightly exposes how the Gandhi family turned Indian politics into a family business.”Speaking to ANI, Poonawalla said, ""A very insightful piece has been written by Dr Tharoor on how Indian politics has become family business and in the opening of that piece he has explained how the first family of Congress party, the Gandhi-Vadra dynasty has been responsible for cementing this negative thought that political position and power can be a matter of birth right.""In a post on X, Poonawalla wrote, “Dr Tharoor has become Khatron ke Khiladi. He has directly called out Nepo Kids or Nawabs of Nepotism. Sir, when I called out Nepo Naamdar Rahul Gandhi in 2017, you know what happened to me. Praying for you… The first family is very vengeful.”He also added, “Very insightful piece written by Dr Shashi Tharoor on how Indian politics has become a family business — he has launched a direct attack on India’s Nepo kid Rahul & chhota nepo kid Tejashwi Yadav!”Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan welcomed Tharoor’s remarks, saying they were based on “experience” and would “hurt Congress and RJD because their politics are limited to family.”Congress leaders Rashid Alvi played down the controversy, saying dynastic politics exists across fields, not just in politics.Speaking to reporters, he said: ""The public makes the decisions in a democracy... You cannot impose a restriction that says you cannot contest elections because your father was an MP.... This is happening in every field... What way will you find for this?...""Tharoor has previously faced criticism from Congress party for praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s “energy, dynamism and willingness to engage,” calling them “a prime asset for India on the global stage.”Tharoor’s recent alignment with the ruling party on several occasions, a noticeable departure from the Congress line, has drawn attention. Notably, he was chosen to lead India’s diplomatic outreach under, representing the nation on the global stage and heading delegations to several countries across the Americas, including the US.","BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla hails Tharoor as a “Khatron ke Khiladi” for directly questioning political succession in his own party.

Zubeen Garg Death: CM Clarifies Cause, Fans Recall His Love For Water

Himanta claim in Zubeen case follows reports from Singapore

GUWAHATI: Cultural icon Zubeen Garg's death in Singapore on Sept 19 has been officially treated as a murder case from day one, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Monday, setting Dec 8 as the deadline for the special investigation team to file its chargesheet with clearance from MHA.""Today, I am not calling it an accident,"" Sarma told reporters. ""As the state's home minister, I get to know what I need to know. Whatever I say, I do so with conviction.""On whether that meant investigators had found evidence Zubeen didn't die in a swimming accident, Sarma said, ""This is not a new revelation from me... Everyone currently in judicial custody has been charged with murder."" Sarma said he briefed home minister Amit Shah on the probe during his visit to Delhi Sunday.Himanta said he requested speedy clearance from MHA for the chargesheet to be filed. The SIT, headed by CID's special DGP MP Gupta, will write to MHA with details within 2-3 days. ""Since the incident occurred on foreign soil, we need prior approval from the ministry before filing the chargesheet.""MP and PCC president Gaurav Gogoi demanded to know what prompted Sarma to explicitly say for the first time that Zubeen didn't die in an accident.""Now, he claims it was murder, but he hasn't told the public how or why it happened,"" Gogoi said, questioning what he said was ""lack of clarity and transparency in the govt's handling of the case"".Sarma had previously only hinted that Zubeen's death while swimming off an island in Singapore may not have been accidental, leading the opposition to ask how he could say so when the chargesheet was still to be filed.The CM's statement came days after Singapore Police Force handed over the final autopsy and toxicology reports to the SIT. Sarma described these reports as ""authentic"" proof of the cause of Zubeen's death, given these tests were conducted immediately after he was declared dead in a hospital there.Zubeen's friend and fellow singer Manas Robin expressed shock at the CM's statement, saying he couldn't have imagined anyone from Assam would target the icon.""The timing of the CM's statement suggests he is not lying. Speaking openly to the public and calling it a murder - there must be some truth in it,"" he said. ""We expect the maximum punishment for the culprits if it was murder."" Seven suspects are in judicial custody, including North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and Zubeen's manager Siddhartha Sharma.

Deadly Collision on Hyderabad-Bijapur Road: 19 Killed After Truck Rams Into RTC Bus Near Chevella

CHEVELLA: A scream. Then, silence - broken only by cries muffled under stone and steel. The bus lay crushed beneath a mountain of gravel, its passengers trapped - some buried up to their necks - as minutes stretched into nearly an hour before rescuers could reach them.""It felt like the whole world had collapsed on us. We couldn't move or breathe properly,"" said R Venkataiah, 55, a head constable from Vikarabad. He was on a work trip, now lying on a hospital cot, his voice still trembling. ""We screamed for help. But no one could get to us for so long.""By the time emergency crews pulled survivors from the wreckage, many had suffered deep cuts, crushed limbs and spinal injuries. Women, students, and children were among those badly hurt.""It all happened in a flash,"" said C Sri Sai, a 27-year-old govt school teacher from Chevella. Speaking from her hospital bed, her leg wrapped in bandages, she recalled boarding the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation bus around 5am.""I sat in the last row. About an hour later, suddenly there was a huge crash - the entire bus shook violently, people screamed, and within moments everything went dark and dusty.""Her family rushed from Tandur town after hearing the news. ""It took nearly 30 minutes before the rescuers managed to pull us out,"" she said.The truck smashed head-on into the Hyderabad-bound bus, tearing open its right side and spilling gravel. Those seated behind the bus driver never had a chance. ""They were almost instantly buried under the gravel - I could only hear muffled cries,"" said Abdul Razak, 38, another survivor. His hands still shook as he spoke. ""It was nerve-wracking.""Mohammed Yunus, a businessman from Tandur, had climbed aboard the same bus. He escaped with bruises - but not without images he can't forget. ""I was standing in the middle of the bus. When the lorry hit, I fell sideways, and the gravel started pouring in. I thought I would die,"" he said. ""Because I wasn't sitting, I managed to wriggle out through a broken window."" Others weren't as lucky. Many remained pinned, gasping under the weight of stones.""We were buried up to our necks. It was impossible to move. We could hear people groaning in pain,"" said another injured passenger.When the rescue teams - locals, police, and emergency workers - finally broke through the debris, the morning sun had risen high. What they found inside mangled shell of the bus was a scene of devastation that words could barely contain.","Truck smashed head-on into the Hyderabad-bound bus, tearing open its right side and spilling gravel.

12 OD deaths in India every week: NCRB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-od-deaths-in-india-every-week-ncrb/articleshow/125069465.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, at least 12 people died every week in India on average due to drug overdose, NCRB data reveals. That is nearly two deaths daily. Between 2019 and 2023, 3,290 deaths were attributed to the same cause, with the average for the five-year period remaining roughly the same as in 2023.What makes this data particularly sobering is what it doesn't capture. These figures represent only confirmed drug overdose deaths - they don't account for unreported cases and deaths misattributed to other causes. Also, NCRB doesn't specify if the overdose involved a narcotic substance or prescription drugs.Psychiatrists, clinicians and retired police officers TOI spoke to said there needs to be more clarity in the classification of drug overdose cases. They pointed out that in many of these cases, there could have been an overuse of prescription drugs such as sleeping pills or painkillers.The figures tell a story of volatility rather than steady decline. After recording 704 deaths in 2019, the country saw a sharp drop to 514 deaths in 2020, likely influenced by Covid-induced lockdowns.The number of deaths surged to 737 in 2021 - the highest in the five-year period - before moderating to 681 in 2022, and 654 in 2023.Tamil Nadu dominated the statistics in the early years of this period. In 2019, it recorded 108 deaths, the highest in the country. The figure tapered to 110 in 2020, before spiking to 250 deaths in 2021. Since then, however, the state has seen a remarkable reversal. Deaths dropped to just 50 in 2022 and rose marginally to touch 65 in 2023.Punjab, sharing a porous border with Pakistan that has long been a conduit for drug trafficking, has maintained a consistently high position in the rankings. While it didn't feature among the top five states in 2019, it recorded 34 deaths in 2020. The figures more than doubled to 78 in 2021, before touching 144 in 2022 - making it the state with the maximum overdose deaths that year. In 2023, though deaths fell to 89, it still topped the national list.Rajasthan has shown a troubling consistency in terms of deaths. Starting with 60 deaths in 2019, the state's toll climbed to 92 in 2020. It reached 113 in 2021 and rose to 117 in 2022. While the deaths declined slightly to 84 in 2023, Rajasthan has remained in the top five every year, occupying second or third positions throughout the period.Madhya Pradesh wasn't among the top five in 2019 or 2020 but emerged in the list with 34 deaths in 2021. This figure was 74 in 2022 and rose again to 85 in 2023, making it the second-highest state in the most recent year.Mizoram and Manipur have appeared intermittently in the top five. Mizoram saw 30 deaths in 2020 and 61 in 2022, while Manipur saw 36 deaths in 2021. Karnataka was in top five in 2019, with 67 deaths, and in 2020, with 36.","In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, at least 12 people died every week in India on average due to drug overdose, NCRB data reveals.

DMK in SC: SIR exercise can disenfranchise lakhs of voters

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu's governing party DMK on Monday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the Election Commission 's decision to conduct special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls of all states.It alleged that SIR is an arbitrary exercise that would lead to removal of voters' names from the lists.DMK said a special summary revision of TN voter list was conducted between Oct 2024 and January 2025.The revision had addressed issues of migration, death and deletion of ineligible voters from the existing state electoral roll.""The SIR and the Orders, if not set aside, can arbitrarily and without due process, disenfranchise lakhs of voters from electing their representatives, thereby disrupting free and fair elections and democracy in the country, which are part of the basic structure of the Constitution,"" said DMK said through its organising secretary R S Bharathi.DMK said the Bihar SIR was carried out by introducing new and stringent requirements for voters to provide proof of citizenship, particularly for those who were not registered as voters in the 2003 electoral roll.It cited several orders of the SC, tweaking the procedure and allowing Aadhaar as an identity proof.DMK and said the procedure adopted by EC in conducting SIR is neither prescribed in the Representation of the People Act nor in Conduct of Election Rules.""There is neither a necessity for conducting de novo verification of electoral rolls nor a compelling reason for such extensive exercise."" it said.

Gold Card versus EB-5



EB-5's rising momentum



MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite the high approval rate for applications, the EB-5 route remains a high-stakes bet: a blend of financial investment, immigration strategy, and faith in the American market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it. Despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card.

MATHURA: The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries-old offerings, was opened last month after 54 years on the orders of an SC-appointed panel tasked with overseeing the temple's financial, structural and administrative functioning. But what emerged from the vault shocked many: one gold and three silver bars and utensils. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit, covering bank deposits worth up to Rs 400 crore, sealed lockers, land holdings and donation records - as questions mount over where the ""missing treasure"" is.Like on every Dhanteras, on Oct 18, the priest lit a small earthen lamp and placed it at the foot of the door of the treasury. The wood had darkened, carvings dulled, a panel eaten halfway by termites. No key had survived and a metal cutter was brought in. Snake catchers moved in first as forest officials stood by with oxygen cylinders. Behind the panels - sealed for more than five decades - lay the toshakhana.When it opened, there was no gold crown as expected. Or a gemstone necklace. Just a long wooden box containing a single gold bar and three silver bars streaked faintly with vermilion.Around them, there were brass utensils, wooden trays, and layers of dust so thick that one official described it as ""undisturbed for generations"". The chamber yielded no spectacle. But what it did offer was unsettling - the near-total absence of any official record of what had once been kept there: no donor register, no inventory, no valuation documents, and no reconciliation with decades of temple offerings.The toshakhana, last opened in 1971, had been spoken of for years in reverent tones - a place where ornaments, royal gifts from Bharatpur, Karauli and Gwalior, land deeds and handwritten letters were believed to lie, donated by kings and commoners to ""Thakurji"". Instead, the inventory was strikingly thin and sparked disbelief among devotees, demands for a CBI probe from locals, and a quiet but unmistakable scrutiny of the shrine's financial history.As of now, the items found in the toshakhana have not been formally valued, though they have been sealed. No FIR has been filed, and no report has been made public. ""The audit is on. This is the first official attempt to document the temple's assets,"" said a senior official associated with the panel. ""We don't have the full inventory yet. Even the panel is trying to find out. A CA firm has been appointed.""Banke Bihari temple, founded in 1864 by followers of saint and musician Swami Haridas, receives some 50,000 visitors a day - a number that rises to several lakhs on festivals and auspicious days. Yet unlike temples in the south, whose wealth was historically documented and regulated under systems of royal patronage and formal audits, Banke Bihari has evolved with a structure rooted in tradition rather than regulation. Offerings - jewellery, land, cash - have come in over generations, but few comprehensive records exist to track them.Among devotees, reactions have been mixed. ""My devotion is to the deity, not to any treasure,"" said Ramesh Patel, a Surat-based cloth trader who visits Vrindavan two or three times a year. ""Yes, I too was expecting something spectacular. But I am not disappointed. We hope all the assets will eventually be documented."" Others, however, have gone further. Dinesh Falhari, a local, has written to PM Narendra Modi seeking a CBI probe. Several residents in the vicinity have echoed the concern.The committee, chaired by retired HC judge Ashok Kumar, was formed after a series of PILs raised concerns over crowd management and administrative lapses. The recent vault opening has prompted the panel to expand its scope and begin a full structural and financial audit - the temple's first.As per official estimates, the temple holds between Rs 350 to 400 crore across over 10 bank accounts in Mathura and Vrindavan, most currently in Multi-Option Deposit form - a product that offers lower interest rates than fixed deposits. The panel has directed that these accounts be converted into FDs for better returns and asked bank officials to submit details of the temple's funds and their status.The audit has also raised questions about assets held outside the temple premises. While members of the Goswami community - hereditary sevayats who manage rituals and daily operations - acknowledge that jewellery had once been deposited in SBI's Mathura branch, there is no documentation on when this was done or what was deposited. ""Still not with us,"" said the official. ""The Goswamis say the jewellery is there. But no order to open the lockers has been given yet. We don't have a list of items, and there is no record of valuation.""There is no exhaustive list of temple-owned land, income from leases, or encroachment details. Officials have said that the local tehsildar and SDM have been asked to retrieve land records from around the temple. The temple manager has also been asked to prepare a consolidated report of all bank accounts, financial assets and donation receipts before the panel's next meeting on Nov 19.Within the sevayat community, there is growing discomfort over public speculation around the temple's finances. ""People are comparing Banke Bihari with temples in the south,"" said Shailendra Goswami, a member of the committee and part of the lineage of Swami Haridas. ""But those temples were built by kings. Our's was built in stages, in 1864, with around Rs 70,000 collected from devotees. Even the large Hindola (rocking cradle) was made from offerings. Some of Bihariji's jewellery is in the SBI branch - this has been shared with the committee. No one can make a single accusation against the priests.""Three of the four Goswami members who are part of the high-powered committee confirmed that their concerns had been placed on record at the committee's Oct 29 meeting. Among the issues discussed was the crowd situation and the perception being created around the vault opening. ""This is Bihariji's temple,"" one of them said. ""The service is done by love. Let them do their audit. We have nothing to hide.""","The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple was opened last month. It is believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries- old offerings. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125027574,imgsize-1634329,width-400,resizemode-4/banke-bihari.jpg"

(ANI)

JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Monday said the age-old “Darbar Move” tradition, discontinued four years ago, was revived by his government to bridge the gap between the twin capitals of the erstwhile state — Jammu and Srinagar.The “Darbar Move” bi-annual tradition of shifting the J&K government offices from Srinagar to Jammu in winter and vice-versa in summer was started by Dogra rulers nearly 150 years ago. In June 2021, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha halted the practice, citing the administration’s complete transition to e-office, which, he claimed, would save approximately Rs 200 crore annually.The tradition was revived by the Abdullah govt on Oct 16.On Monday, CM Abdullah, accompanied by deputy CM Surinder Choudhary and minister Javed Rana, walked approximately 4-5 kms from his official residence on Wazarat Road (Residency Road) in Jammu to the Civil Secretariat in the morning, interacting with traders on Residency Road, Raghunath Bazaar and Shalimar Road on the way.“Jammu suffered the biggest setback since the Darbar Move practice was discontinued. The National Conference had promised to restore it.It was our responsibility, and we have done it today. We hope that with the resumption of the Darbar Move, the economy of not only Jammu but the entire J&K will get a boost,” Omar told reporters. “You must have seen the rousing reception. Today, a distance that takes a few minutes to cover took nearly an hour. It was the love and affection of the people.”Abdullah said some people always try to create a wedge between Jammu and Srinagar and rake up “Jammu versus Kashmir” for political advantage. “We want to address that wedge and remove the distance,” he said.The decision to discontinue the practice in 2021 had drawn sharp criticism from various quarters, including Jammu’s business community, which had termed the move a blow to trade and the traditional bond between the two regions. The trading community had been pressing for the revival of the practice ever since.Abdullah said the tradition was revived by his government to bridge the gap between the twin capitals of the erstwhile state and asserted that some things “should not be weighed by money”.“Everything should not be weighed in money. The ‘Darbar Move’ was stopped to save money. Some things are more than money, as they involve sentiments and unity between the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir ,” he said.","The bi-annual tradition of shifting the J&K government offices from Srinagar to Jammu in winter and vice-versa in summer was started by Dogra rulers nearly 150 years ago.

Watch: Pappu Yadav Gets Angry When Asked Why He Wasn’t Seen with Rahul Gandhi

RJD hits back at PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday stepped up his attack on the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in poll-bound Bihar, questioning why the person responsible for bringing “jungle raj” (lawlessness) to the state is ""missing"" from the party’s posters.Although he did not name anyone, the remark was a clear reference to RJD chief and former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav.“Look at the posters of the RJD and the Congress. The pictures of the person who brought ‘jungle raj’ to Bihar are either missing altogether or so tiny that they can’t be seen even with binoculars,” PM Modi said at a rally in Katihar.“The one who is such a big leader of the RJD, whose entire family is in politics — why are his pictures not being used?” he asked.PM Modi went on to question why Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son, Tejashwi, was ""reluctant"" to mention his own father’s name.“Why are you so ashamed to take your father’s name? What is the wrongdoing that the RJD feels compelled to hide from Bihar’s youth?” he remarked, without naming Tejashwi, the chief ministerial candidate of the RJD-led opposition Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress and other allies.The term “jungle raj” is frequently used by political opponents to attack Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, and the RJD.The RJD hit back at PM Modi, with both Tejashwi Yadav and his sister Misa Bharti taking aim at the prime minister.""PM Modi should talk about the 14 crore people of Bihar, why is he talking about useless things? The kind of profit Lalu Yadav has given to the Railways, PM Modi cannot do that even in 7 births,"" the Mahagathbandhan CM face retorted.""PM Modi has come for Bihar elections or to search for Lalu Yadav's photos? The fear of Lau Yadav has not come out of the minds of NDA leaders and PM Modi. On one side the prime minister of the country talks about 'katta' and on the other side, Tejashwi Yadav talks about providing employment to the youth,"" Bharti remarked.Bihar will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The election is shaping up as a direct contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Mahagathbandhan.","PM Narendra Modi questions why the person responsible for bringing ""jungle raj"" to Bihar is ""missing"" from the party's posters.

SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir high court on Friday quashed the preventive detention of a man booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) for alleged involvement in anti-national activities.The detainee, Sajad Ahmad Bhat of Drabgam, Pulwama, was represented by Zameer Abdullah and Zahir Abdullah, the two sons of J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah According to the judgment, Bhat was placed under preventive detention after being accused in FIR No. 119 of 2020 at Police Station Rajpora for offences punishable under the Indian Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The Pulwama district magistrate, in a detention order on April 30, 2025, had stated that Bhat had “re-activated his contacts” and was “in close touch with active terrorists in the area”, enabling them to evade arrest. The order had described his activities as “highly prejudicial to the security of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir” and warranting preventive detention under the PSA.Pleading before a single bench of Justice Moksha Khajuria Kazmi, the defence lawyers argued that Bhat had already been arrested in the 2020 FIR and was later released on bail by a competent court on Nov 13, 2023 in the case.In its order, the HC observed that “the counsel for the petitioner have successfully shown that the detainee had been granted bail by a competent court of law, and the impugned detention order, based on the same FIR, is an outcome of stale allegations”.The bench said the detention order issued in 2025 was based on a case registered in 2020, terming it “stale” and lacking a “proximate link” between the alleged actions and the present security situation.The HC directed that the petition be allowed, the detention order be quashed and the respondents directed to release the detainee forthwith if not required in any other case.The judgment comes at a time when PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has moved the HC seeking the return to the UT of all undertrials held in jails outside Jammu and Kashmir.Outside the HC in Jammu on Monday, Mehbooba said they were hoping that the elected govt would take action on the issue of undertrial prisoners lodged in jails outside J&K.National Conference, however, used the judgment to criticise Mehbooba. “While Mehbooba Mufti opts for theatrics with zero benefit to those under detention, Zamir and Zahir quietly do the real work, offering help, legal aid, and support without the drama. What’s needed isn’t noise outside courts but action inside them,” NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said. “National Conference remains committed to advocating the release of those with minor or no charges, and to ensuring that others lodged in distant jails across the country are brought back to J&K,” he said.","Sajad Ahmad Bhat of Drabgam, Pulwama, was represented by Zameer Abdullah and Zahir Abdullah, the two sons of J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah.

Assam Police Slaps Murder Charge On Zubeen Garg’s Manager & Festival Organiser

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday claimed that state icon and celebrated singer Zubeen Garg was ""murdered,"" even as investigations into the case remain underway.Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in the sea in Singapore on September 19. He had travelled there to attend the fourth edition of the North East India Festival (NEIF).“I am not calling it an accident. The charge-sheet in this murder case must be submitted by December 17, but I have set a target to file it by December 8. We are ready now,” Sarma told reporters, according to news agency PTI.The chief minister, however, did not disclose what prompted investigators to classify the case as murder. Special Investigation Team (SIT) under the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Assam Police is probing Garg’s death after more than 60 FIRs were lodged across the state.Meanwhile, Sarma added that he had met Union home minister Amit Shah to seek expedited approval to file a charge-sheet in the case, as Ministry of Home Affairs' (MHA) permission is required to file a charge-sheet in incidents that occur abroad.“Yesterday, I met the Union home minister to fast-track the process.The SIT will approach the MHA within the next three to four days to seek the necessary clearance before filing the charge-sheet,” he stated.When asked whether the Assam government had extended any financial assistance to the NEIF, Sarma replied it had not.Those arrested in connection with the case include NEIF chief organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma, and two band members — Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and Amrit Prabha Mahanta. The singer’s cousin, Assam Police DSP Sandipan Garg, was later taken into custody as well.Two of Garg’s personal security officers, Nandeswar Bora and Prabin Baishya, were also arrested after police uncovered alleged financial transactions worth over Rs 1.1 crore in their accounts.All seven accused are currently in judicial custody and have been booked under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, criminal conspiracy, and causing death by negligence.","Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in the sea in Singapore on September 19.

BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

SRINAGAR: The Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) fiasco triggered a political uproar Monday, with opposition BJP calling it an “international disgrace” and demanding that National Conference-led J&K government reveal who was behind the event.“Who were these scamsters who deceived umpires, players, and those who participated in the cultural programmes?” BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur asked in Srinagar alongside party colleague Sajid Yousuf Shah.The T20 league, launched with fanfare on Oct 23 to promote grassroots cricket and tourism in Kashmir, collapsed after its organisers — a non-profit called Yuva Society — fled their Srinagar hotel Saturday, leaving international players, staff, and umpires unpaid and stranded.Thakur said J&K Cricket Association (JKCA) and BCCI had confirmed they had no connection with IHPL. “Govt must clarify who invited the international cricketers to Kashmir, who brought in players from different parts of J&K, and how matches were allowed at Bakshi Stadium without proper approval,” he said.NC-led govt distanced itself from the debacle. “It was a private event, not a govt-organised one,” said sports minister Satish Sharma.“Police have launched a free and fair investigation and an FIR has been filed. All details will come to light soon.” J&K Sports Council also denied involvement, saying it had no role in the tournament.The league was announced on Sept 18, promising to run Oct 23–Nov 7. IHPL had listed 32 international players, including former West Indies star Chris Gayle, New Zealand’s Jesse Ryder, and Sri Lanka’s Thisara Perera.Official documents show govt engagement in IHPL’s preparations. An Oct 22 press release detailed a meeting chaired by divisional commissioner Anshul Garg “to take first-hand appraisal of IHPL readiness”. Garg had predicted 25,000–30,000 spectators at Bakshi Stadium and directed security forces to assist with crowd management.However, attendance was poor from the opening day. Ticket prices were slashed as stands remained empty, except for matches featuring Chris Gayle, the tournament’s biggest draw.BJP said IHPL’s collapse had dealt a blow to the region’s image. “Cricket was the only sport showing promise this year, with tourism and horticulture struggling. Many children aspired to become the next Virat Kohli, but J&K govt has played with their future,” Thakur said.","The Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) fiasco triggered a political uproar Monday.

slams attempts to crush farmers’ movement

Justice N V Ramana (retd) disclosed Saturday that the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021 because they supported Amaravati capital city project of Andhra Pradesh.""All of you present here know how my family was targeted and criminal cases were filed against them. All this was done only to coerce me,"" he said while addressing students at the convocation ceremony of VIT-AP at Amaravati.The Jagan Reddy government diluted the previous N Chandrababu Naidu government's Amaravati capital project by announcing the trifurcation of the capital, which was opposed by farmers whose land had already been acquired.The farmers agitated for five years from 2019 till 2024 and the trifurcation idea was dropped after the Chandrababu Naidu government returned to office last year.Recalling his deep association with Amaravati since his student days, he said, ""Present-day Amaravati owes its existence to the resilience of the farmers of this region. The city survives on the back of the farmers' struggle, one of the longest in southern India.""Talking about attempts to ""crush the farmers' struggle"", Justice Ramana said, ""Rarely the media or any politician ever spoken the truth or given real credit as to how the capital of Amaravati survived and sustained,"" he said.Briefly touching on the ""painful days of police action"" against his family members, the former CJI said, ""I was not alone. During that difficult period, all those who empathised with the cause of the farmers, faced intimidation and coercion."" ""Even members of the judiciary who upheld constitutional principles faced transfers, pressure, and at times, persecution. Families of judges, who had no role, suffered collateral damage because of political machinations,"" he said.In these testing times, many political leaders hesitated to take a stand and preferred silence, he said. ""It was the jurists, lawyers and the courts which stood by their constitutional promise,"" he said. ""While govts may change, the courts and the rule of law remain as the anchor of stability. The rule of law survives only when people, in whom the public repose trust, decline to surrender their integrity for convenience,"" he said.""In the coming times, the role of farmers, lawyers, jurists, members of civil society and judges will have to remain the enduring source of inspiration with their integrity and commitment to rule of law,"" he said.",Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021.

Jason Kelce may be retired from the NFL, but his personality still pulls as much attention as it did when he was the unstoppable anchor of the Philadelphia Eagles. Now, with PEOPLE preparing to reveal its 2025 Sexiest Man Alive, Jason is weighing in with two surprising picks of his own.Instead of playing it safe, he went straight for star power, nominating Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson first and then gave love to a rising NFL name, rookie Cam Skattebo, who recently suffered a devastating injury. For someone who himself held the title in 2023, Jason is hilariously humble about his place in the “attractive rankings,” and is using his new fragrance launch to joke that maybe his sexy label was accidental.Jason told PEOPLE, “I just had The Rock on the podcast and it's hard to say that anybody's sexier than that.” That’s a headline in itself, because Dwayne Johnson remains one of the most influential entertainment figures on earth. And Jason knows firsthand the marketing, athleticism and charisma The Rock carries, all qualities that Sexiest Man Alive voters lean into.Jason doubled down on a more unconventional selection, adding Cam Skattebo to his list, saying, “He's sexy with the way he operates, so I respect that.” Skattebo recently earned sympathy and respect after a brutal season-ending injury.That Jason included him shows this year’s conversation isn’t just about movie-star faces, but energy, grit, and narrative.Jason has always roasted himself, even back when his own name was called by PEOPLE in 2023. When asked whether he agreed with the title back then, he famously laughed: “I'm not even the sexiest man in my family.”That authenticity is why fans keep showing up for him post-retirement.

Who is Gemmi Schottenheimer?



How Gemmi Schottenheimer supported Brian through NFL challenges



More coverage on NFL:

In the high-stakes world of the NFL, where coaches are constantly under pressure to deliver results, few pause to notice the steady forces that keep them grounded. For Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer, that unwavering force is his wife, Gemmi Schottenheimer. Her life may unfold away from the sidelines and flashing cameras, but her presence has shaped Brian’s career and family in ways only those closest to them can truly understand. Behind every play call and every move across teams, Gemmi has been the quiet constant—strong, patient, and deeply supportive.Gemmi Schottenheimer has lived through the highs and lows of the NFL lifestyle. From team changes to unexpected firings, she has been Brian’s anchor in an unpredictable profession. Before their marriage, fate brought her close to his family in a rather unusual way. While working for the Washington Redskins, Gemmi crossed paths with legendary coach Marty Schottenheimer, who happened to be Brian’s father. She recalled in a 2024 podcast with Stacey Bell, “I had not met Brian at that point. I sort of became an assistant to him [Marty] while he was trying to find one. I was on his voicemail. I did all these things and just sort of had an opportunity to watch him lead without being in the family or dating Brian.”Ironically, when she finally met Brian, she didn’t even realize who his father was. “When I met Brian, didn’t even know that he was Marty’s son in the beginning… So it was just kind of unique for me to transition into a daughter-in-law,” Gemmi said. Over the years, their relationship only grew stronger, especially during the toughest times — like when Marty was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2016. Through those painful moments, Gemmi held the family together, showing the same calm strength that defines her today.Life with an NFL coach demands patience and adaptability. For Gemmi, that meant managing home life, raising two children, and maintaining a sense of stability while Brian juggled long hours and constant team transitions. Her resilience shone through even during career shocks. Reflecting on tough times, she said, “The Seattle firing, you know, was definitely something we didn’t see coming. We had just won the division. And as you know, I mean, Marty was fired after a 14 and two season. So these firings, it can happen when you least expect it.”Beyond the sidelines, Gemmi’s support also extended to moments of celebration. When Brian was named Cowboys head coach in 2025, Gemmi learned the news directly from Jerry and Stephen Jones. “I got out of [Brian’s] truck and started saying, ‘Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!’ I didn’t have anyone to talk to. I was by myself, but it was really special,” she recalled.Gemmi may not wear a headset on game day, but she’s every bit a part of Brian’s success. Her quiet strength and enduring love have shaped his journey. Together, the Schottenheimers have shown that true partnership — built on trust, loyalty, and resilience — is the real foundation of greatness.","Gemmi Schottenheimer has lived through the highs and lows of the NFL lifestyle.

"Vedanta, BEL & more: Top stocks to buy on November 4 — Check list",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vedanta-bel-bank-of-baroda-bpcl-gail-top-stocks-to-buy-on-november-4check-list/articleshow/125072470.cms,"(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





CLSA has an outperform rating on Vedanta with the target price at Rs 580. Analysts said that the company’s July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBIDTA) of Rs 11,400 crore was in line with consensus. It guided for higher FY26 EBIDTA, driven by higher commodity prices and operational improvement. Over the next couple of years ramp-up of expansion projects and backward integration (largely aluminium, power and zinc) are likely to be the key drivers. Debt at parent Vedanta Resources (VRL) is now well funded, while demerger is guided to be complete by end-FY26. The outcome of the $2 billion bid for Jai Prakash Associates is a key monitorable given it is a diversified asset.Nomura has a neutral rating on BEL with the target price at Rs 427. Analysts said the company reported strong Q2FY26 numbers but rich valuations limit any upside for the stock. They raised BEL’s FY26 EBITDA and profit after tax (PAT) estimates by 2% and 1%. They also estimated that its PAT would show a compounded annual growth rate of 13% between FY25 and FY28. Analysts also said BEL’s order book was robust but warned that large orders have larger execution timelines.HSBC has a buy rating on Bank of Baroda with the target price raised to Rs 340. Analysts said during Q2FY26, the lender showed a broad-based sequential loan growth, net interest margin (NIM) expansion and asset quality performance were key positives. Incrementally, its operating performance will likely remain healthy with an upside risk from better asset quality. They also raised FY26-FY28 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 5-7%.Jefferies has a buy rating on BPCL with the target price at Rs 430. Analysts said that during Q2FY26 the company reported strong EBITDA because of strong refining & marketing inventory gains. They also said that the govt's compensation for LPG losses will boost earnings over the next few quarters. However, they said marketing profitability has weakened somewhat in Q3, and inventory losses are likely. Also that large capex in refining and petchem would drag return on capital employed (RoCE). Analysts said BPCL’s earnings outlook was strong on range bound crude given OPEC supply.Citigroup has a buy rating on GAIL with the target price at Rs 215. Analysts said GAIL’s Q2FY26 EBITDA at Rs 3,200 crore was ahead of estimate, aided by strong gas trading performance, with gas transmission volumes also showing modest recovery. Petchem performance, however, remained subdued, they said. The management reiterated its guidance for gas trading profitability, lowered its guidance for gas transmission volumes and remains confident on their tariff hike expectations. Analysts were encouraged by the granularity provided on gas trading, which should boost investor comfort, and also from upcoming commissioning of new pipelines, which should aid volume growth even if all else stayed equal.","CLSA has an outperform rating on Vedanta with the target price at Rs 580.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

Yet, Irvin’s dedication never wavered. He emphasizes the emotional labor behind every decision, reflecting a side of him fans rarely see, the deep and unwavering devotion of a husband navigating one of life’s hardest battles.For Irvin, the focus has always been on Sandy’s comfort and dignity.

The fiery five-emoji comment from Kara Bieber under Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post had Blue Jays fans buzzing online

From the field to the feeds, the Blue Jays wives are winning hearts their own way

Toronto Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk has been one of the key performers in the team’s World Series campaign against the Los Angeles Dodgers, driving in crucial runs and proving his consistency when it matters most. After helping the Blue Jays win the AL East title for the first time since 2015, Kirk’s bat has stayed hot into the postseason, where he has already hit two home runs and driven in six RBIs in five games. As much as the spotlight has stayed on his performance, it was his wife, Sofia Castaneda, who found herself trending recently after she shared a few glimpses from her time at Game 5 — a post that unexpectedly set social media abuzz across Blue Jays circles.Sofia, who has been a constant presence at the Rogers Centre and on the road, posted a carousel of images on Instagram showing her cheering for her husband from the stands during Wednesday night’s Game 5. The post, captioned “Recent > 🤍”, quickly drew reactions from fans and fellow players’ families alike. But it was Shane Bieber’s wife, Kara Bieber, whose fiery comment — “🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️” — turned the post into a viral moment overnight.Without a single word, Kara’s five-emoji reaction summed up both her excitement for Kirk’s performance and her admiration for Sofia’s unwavering support, sparking a flood of comments and likes from fans across the Blue Jays community.Within hours, the post became one of the most talked-about moments from the Blue Jays’ social media circle this postseason. Fans flooded the comment section, praising the show of friendship between the two players’ wives and calling it “the most wholesome Blue Jays moment of the year.” The exchange highlighted the close-knit camaraderie among players’ families — a side of professional sports rarely seen in such a lighthearted, genuine way.As the Blue Jays continue their chase for a long-awaited World Series crown, Kirk’s red-hot form has been mirrored by the rising visibility of the team’s wives and partners, who’ve brought a sense of unity and charm to the postseason narrative. Kara’s reaction may have lasted just five emojis, but it carried the same energy and warmth that Blue Jays fans have been rallying behind. And for a team chasing its first championship in nearly 30 years, that blend of on-field brilliance and off-field bonding might just be what defines their season. In a season full of big hits and bigger moments, it's these small gestures that keep fans smiling. And as the World Series drama unfolds, Blue Jays fans are loving every bit of it. Moments like this remind everyone that baseball's heart beats far beyond the field - with love and loyalty. It's what makes the game feel beautifully human.Also Read: Dave Roberts’ unexpected race with Hyeseong Kim at Dodgers’ camp spirals into a hilarious moment fans can’t stop talking about","Toronto Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk has been one of the key performers in the team’s World Series campaign against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Harvard initiative brings together nine US states to identify effective education policies: Here's what to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/harvards-states-leading-states-initiative-unites-nine-us-states-to-identify-effective-education-policies/articleshow/125072452.cms,"The Harvard Crimson

The Crimson

From research to reform

The Crimson

A long time in the making

The Crimson

A bipartisan approach to learning



The Crimson.

When the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) launched its States Leading States (SLS) initiative earlier this year, its goal was not to dictate policy but to measure what works, and why. Last month, the programme announced its first cohort of nine partner states: Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas.The initiative, led by the Centre for Education Policy Research (CEPR) at HGSE, will collaborate with local governments to assess a spectrum of education policies — from literacy programmes in Colorado to summer reading and mathematics camps in Alabama. The idea is to establish a consistent, evidence-based understanding of which state-level policies genuinely improve student learning outcomes,reports.Scott E. Sargrad, senior director of the initiative, toldthat the project aims to strengthen both state leadership and collective learning. “What we are hoping to do with this project is support state leadership, but also support learning about what’s actually working with state policy,” he said.The programme’s first report is expected this spring and will share early findings across its participating states. In Illinois, for instance, education officials are keen to understand whether restricting student mobile phone use can enhance classroom focus and academic performance. Illinois State Superintendent of Education Anthony “Tony” V. Sanders toldthat the partnership offers “a powerful forum to exchange ideas, strengthen data use, and support continuous school improvement.”The Illinois case illustrates the SLS model: identifying local challenges, collecting comparative data, and developing metrics to measure success. For Sanders, that means quantifying the impact of cell phone bans on student engagement, a question that resonates with school systems nationwide.Although formally launched in January, the idea for the SLS programme dates back nearly two decades. CEPR faculty director Professor Thomas J. Kane recalled that in 2005, Joel I. Klein, then Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, had approached Harvard researchers to evaluate elements of the city’s schooling system. The request, Kane told, revealed a broader capacity gap. “Because he was saying he didn’t have the internal capacity to do this kind of work, we just thought, ‘Well gosh, if Joel Klein, the chancellor of the largest school district in the country, doesn’t have the capacity to do this, then nobody does,’” he said.That observation eventually led CEPR to raise funds for a sustained, data-focused collaboration among US states. The SLS initiative will run for four years. It will also draw on a network of more than 700 trained data analysts from Harvard’s Strategic Data Project — a CEPR effort that, since 2008, has focused on embedding data science in education policy.Kane emphasised that SLS was deliberately structured as a bipartisan programme. Its first cohort includes both conservative and liberal states — a design choice meant to prioritise areas where agreement is still possible. “Our plan is to stay away from culture war issues,” he explained, focusing instead on reducing absenteeism and improving student achievement.That approach feels particularly urgent at a time when US academic performance has been declining for over a decade. Kane said the programme hopes to offer practical, evidence-backed answers to reverse the trend. “We’re really focused on trying to provide some answers on that in the next year,” he toldFor Harvard, the initiative represents more than a new research collaboration, it signals an effort to rebuild trust in education policymaking through data, not debate.

We had a lot of discussions on general issues. We wish to have an alliance (between NCP SP and NCP). He told me that a decision will be taken soon,” Pansare said.This comes days after NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule hinted at a possible alliance, saying that her party is in talks with Ajit Pawar and that senior party leaders have spoken to each other.“Of course, we are looking at all alliances. Ajit Pawar constantly says that he has not given up that ideology. Right now, the focus is on the corporation elections. A lot of our colleagues have spoken to each other,” Sule had said.“We are engaged in dialogue with them, but no decision or final offer has come,” she added.Earlier, Maharashtra minister Sanjay Shirsat also said that efforts were under way in Pune to bring both NCP groups together.“Both the NCPs are coming together by forming an alliance for the upcoming municipal corporation elections,” he said, adding that such local-level adjustments could be the beginning of a broader political understanding.The undivided NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar, split in 2023, with the Ajit Pawar-led faction not only joining the BJP–Sena alliance in the state government but also bagging the “real NCP” status through an Election Commission ruling.The NCP (SP) has since been contesting against the NCP in various polls and on social issues.As municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra are expected to be held next month, various parties have been working on different alliance combinations.

MUMBAI: Pablo Picasso famously said that ""art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life,"" but at the Yogakshema Building at Nariman Point, which houses the headquarters of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), a wall mural painted by M F Husain appears to be doing the opposite, quietly accumulating dust as visitors and employees offer only fleeting glances while passing through the metal detector at the security screening area.The mural, depicting a female musician, is located on the wall directly opposite the security checking area in the lobby of the building's east wing.It shows visible signs of deterioration, including cracks, tearing and layers of settled dust. Ongoing renovation work, including plastering and the erection of scaffolding, has been carried out close to the artwork, placing it at further risk of damage.Though a metal detector stands next to the mural, there is no name plaque to inform the thousands who pass through the entrance about the value and heritage of the work.Painted in 1963, the mural was created after Husain won a competition organised by LIC to adorn the lobby of its then newly inaugurated headquarters. Husain was paid Rs 1,000 for the commission.Brinda Miller of the Kala Ghoda Arts Association said such neglect was not unusual.""A mosaic mural by Jatin Das was similarly destroyed in a government building years ago. In contrast, another Husain mural inside a restaurant at the Cricket Club of India stands beautifully preserved,"" she said, adding that wall art in India is often undervalued.Conservation architect Vikas Dilawari said the issue extended across institutions. He cited neglect of a K K Hebbar mural at Nair Hospital and noted that Husain painted directly onto the marble wall, requiring protection during construction.Raisa, the artist's daughter, called the situation a ""tragedy"".

Though the region comes at fifth in the list of 10 in terms of suffering financial loss, it reported the highest number of casualties.Globally, the US - the largest historical carbon emitter - bore the brunt with the fires in California topping the list as the single biggest one-off event at $60 billion in damage (nearly 50% of the total cost globally) and leading to the deaths of more than 400 people.The annual report of Christian Aid, released on Saturday, underlined that most of these estimates are based only on “insured losses”, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be even higher, while the human costs are often uncounted.Second on the list after the US were the cyclones and floods that struck Southeast Asia in Nov, causing $25 billion in damage and killing more than 1,750 people across Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Malaysia. Third were the devastating floods in China which displaced thousands, caused $11.7 billion in damage and killed at least 30.“These disasters are not ‘natural’ — they are the inevitable result of continued fossil fuel expansion and political delay. While the costs run into the billions, the heaviest burden falls on communities with the least resources to recover. Unless govts act now to cut emissions and fund adaptation measures, this misery will only continue,” said Joanna Haigh, emeritus professor of Atmospheric Physics, Imperial College London.Though the top 10 focuses on financial costs, which are usually higher in richer countries because they have higher property values and can afford insurance, some of the most devastating extreme weather events this year hit poorer nations, which have contributed little to causing the climate crisis and have the least resources to respond.“The suffering caused by the climate crisis is a political choice. It is being driven by decisions to continue burning fossil fuels, to allow emissions to rise, and to break promises on climate finance,” said Patrick Watt, Christian Aid CEO, while urging world leaders to act in 2026.","Extreme weather events such as wildfires, heatwaves, floods and cyclonic storms cost the world more than $122 billion in 2025.

US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics, calling them ""sleazebags"" and accusing them of having close ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before ""dropping him like a dog"" and then ""blaming Trump. "" He also fired shots at Democrats and ""fake media coverage"" further warning ""enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.""Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump posted, ""Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein, gave him bundles of money, went to his Island, attended his parties, and thought he was the greatest guy on earth, only to 'drop him like a dog' when things got too HOT.""He claimed these critics ""falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J Trump.""Trump further went on to assert that he was ""actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.""The US President further alleged that those who would be named in the ""ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt"" would largely turn out to be Democrats.He said, ""When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife 'Republican,' Massie!), and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do, much like there was when it was made public that the Russia, Russia Hoax was a fictitious story - a total Scam - and had nothing to do with 'TRUMP.'""He also criticised the media coverage on Epstien files singling out The New York Times.""The Failing New York Times, among many others, was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election 'Reporting,' even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage.

But sadly, that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!! Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!"" he added.The post comes amid renewed scrutiny of Epstein's links with powerful figures, alongside ongoing political and legal debates over the release of documents.Trump and Epstein were friends for several years, but the MAGA leader has stated that they fell out around 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Meanwhile, the US Justice Department (DOJ) has released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Epstein, marking the largest disclosure so far in the long-running investigation.The newly released files contain multiple references to Trump, including an email from a prosecutor noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.In a response to the latest files released, the DOJ said that some of the latest documents released from the Epstein files contained ""untrue and sensationalist claims"" against Trump, which were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 US election.The latest disclosure follows criticism of an earlier tranche of records, some of which were briefly removed from the DOJ's online portal over concerns about protecting victims’ identities. The files were later restored after authorities determined that no victims were depicted in the disputed material.The newly released material also included hundreds of video and audio files, as well as surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.","US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics.

Horror In Coimbatore: Student Gang Raped After Abduction, Three Accused Shot And Arrested By Police

GWALIOR: A 26-year-old engineer died after allegedly consuming poison at his uncle’s house in Gwalior on Saturday.The man was facing a rape case under the POCSO Act in Dabra involving a 2-year-and-11-month-old girl.His family alleged that he was being blackmailed for money to “settle” the case.The deceased, identified as Love, also known as Lovejeet Singh Rana, was a BTech graduate and a resident of Ramgarh in Dabra.He had been living in Purushottam Vihar Colony with his uncle after losing his job following the registration of the case.He allegedly consumed poison on Friday night. Family members found him in critical condition on Saturday morning and rushed him to the hospital, where doctors declared him dead.According to the family, the girl’s mother had demanded Rs 60 lakh to withdraw the case. They claimed Rs 30 lakh had already been paid, but the pressure continued for the remaining amount.The family also accused the complainant’s lawyer of issuing threats and pressuring them for money. They alleged that the sustained pressure pushed Love into depression, leading to his suicide.Police said an FIR under the POCSO Act had been registered at Dabra City police station in April after the woman alleged that Lovejeet and another man took her daughter for a car ride and returned her frightened, following which she noticed an injury.The allegations had sparked outrage at the time.Lovejeet, who had reportedly topped his board exams in Dabra, completed his engineering from an institute in Indore and was working with a multinational company in Gurgaon.

‘We did nothing wrong’: Indian truck drivers challenge California over mass licence cancellations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-did-nothing-wrong-indian-truck-drivers-challenge-california-over-mass-licence-cancellations/articleshow/126177821.cms,"'Thug' Indian Truck Driver Crash In Florida Sparks US Visa Freeze, Triggers Illegal Immigration Row

Truck drivers say they are being punished for state errors

Federal pressure and political fallout

Livelihoods and supply chains at risk





Thousands of Indian truck drivers in California have launched a legal challenge against the state after being told their commercial driving licences will be cancelled. Drivers say the move threatens their livelihoods and has left their families in limbo. The lawsuit follows decisions by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke licences issued to immigrant drivers after a federal audit flagged problems with expiry dates. Many of the affected drivers are Punjabi Sikhs, according to advocacy groups, who say the crackdown has led to increased profiling of drivers in the industry.The dispute centres on around 20,000 commercial driver’s licences (CDLs) that the DMV says were issued with expiration dates extending beyond the period drivers were authorised to stay and work in the United States. On 6 November, the agency sent 60-day cancellation notices to roughly 17,000 drivers, a figure that has since risen as more cases were reviewed.Civil rights groups argue the problem stems from clerical mistakes made by the DMV itself, not wrongdoing by drivers. Under California law, they say, the agency is required either to correct such errors or allow licence holders to reapply for amended documents. Instead, the DMV halted the issuing, renewal and correction of non-resident CDLs, leaving drivers with no clear way to fix the issue.“The state of California must help these drivers because the clerical errors threatening their livelihoods are of the state’s own making,” said Munmeeth Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, which filed the class-action lawsuit alongside the Asian Law Caucus.Advocacy groups say the crackdown followed increased scrutiny from the Trump administration after a fatal truck crash in Florida earlier this year became a national political issue. Federal officials accused several states, including California, of lax licensing standards and pushed tougher enforcement of immigration and English-language proficiency rules for commercial drivers.The Sikh Coalition says the response has had wider consequences, including racial profiling of Sikh truckers, many of whom wear turbans and beards as part of their faith. Industry figures warn that stricter federal policies could remove hundreds of thousands of drivers from the workforce nationwide over the coming years.For drivers, the immediate impact is stark. Losing a CDL means losing the legal right to work, while the threatened cancellation of regular driving licences would prevent them from driving at all. Many affected drivers are the sole earners for their families and have invested heavily in trucks, homes and small transport businesses.“If the court does not step in, we will see a devastating wave of unemployment that harms families and destabilises supply chains,” Kaur said.The DMV has declined to comment on the lawsuit but has previously said it is prepared to reissue licences if federal objections are lifted.

Statistics and silence: What trauma leaves undocumented

Every reported crime carries a backstory that never makes it into the case file. Before the FIR, there is the moment of doubt, whether to speak, whom to trust, and what might follow. For countless women in India, that moment ends in silence.That silence is in reality filled with a lot of calculations, the fear that people might not believe them, families asking them to ""let it go"" because of the risk of retaliation or to protect family honour, the cost of legal battles that can go for years, and the silent understanding that the road to justice, even when promised, can be unforgiving. For most women, safety is not a guarantee. It is something worked out every day, by calculation which roads to avoid, staying quiet in unfamiliar spaces, adjusting behaviour, and often living with an abuse that feels easier to manage than to report.In 2025, crime data remains the only way women’s safety in India is judged. These numbers shape headlines, policy debates, and official claims of progress. But they reflect only those cases that enter the criminal justice system.Far more experiences remain outside the record, abuse within homes, harassment in public spaces, threats online, incidents that never become complaints because the cost of speaking up feels higher than the abuse itself.The most recent comprehensive figures from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) are from 2022. Since then, there has been no official dataset available, leaving a gap in understanding more recent trends and ground reality.As per data reported in 2022, India recorded 4,45,256 cases of crimes against women, reflecting a 4 per cent increase from the previous year and translating to an average of 51 complaints every hour. The national crime rate stood at 66.4 cases per lakh women. While these numbers point to the persistence of gender-based violence, they also reveal widely contrasting data across states. Union Territory Delhi reported a crime rate of 144.4 per cent, more than double the national average, while Haryana (118.7) and Telangana (117.6) also recorded significantly higher rates.Such variations raise critical questions: do higher numbers indicate greater prevalence of crime, better reporting mechanisms, or a combination of both?Official statistics, however, capture only those incidents that enter the criminal justice system formally and are reported. A substantial body of evidence suggests that a large proportion of violence against women remains unaccounted for, particularly when it occurs within households or involves perpetrators known to the survivor. Data from the National Family Health Survey–5 (2019–21) paints a starkly different picture of women’s lived experiences.According to the survey, nearly one in three married women in India, 32 per cent, at some point in their lives, have faced physical, sexual, or emotional violence at the hands of their husbands, while 6.1 per cent reported experiencing sexual violence. The contrast between these prevalence-based findings and police-recorded crime figures highlights a persistent gap between reality and reporting.This gap is shaped by multiple factors: fear of retaliation, social pressure that stems from maintaining one’s family’s honour, lack of trust in law enforcement, prolonged judicial processes, and economic dependence. In rural areas and among communities living on the fringes, these barriers are often compounded by limited access to police stations, legal aid, and survivor support services. Even in urban areas, where reporting is relatively higher, cybercrime and workplace harassment may be beyond regulatory scope or are addressed through informal mechanisms rather than criminal complaints.In 2025, crime statistics continue to remain an indispensable tool for understanding trends, allocating resources, and holding institutions accountable. Yet numbers alone cannot capture the full extent of women’s vulnerability, resilience, or the systemic failures that allow violence to persist.An increase in the number of First Information Reports (FIRs) registered does not automatically signal a spike in crime; in many cases, it reflects changes in reporting behaviour, policing frameworks, and legal awareness. This distinction is crucial when interpreting data on crimes against women, where historically low reporting has long masked the true scale of violence.One key factor behind higher FIR counts is improved access to the justice system. Supreme Court rulings mandating the compulsory registration of FIRs for cognisable offences, coupled with women’s help desks at the state-level, online portals for lodging complaints, and dedicated women’s police stations, have lowered procedural barriers that previously discouraged survivors from coming forward. In such contexts, rising FIR numbers may indicate institutional responsiveness rather than an actual rise in such incidents.Shifts in social attitudes also play a significant role. Greater public discussion around gender-based violence, through media coverage, civil society advocacy, and movements demanding accountability, has contributed to increased awareness of legal rights among women.However, it is pertinent to note that increased FIR registration does not eliminate concerns about underreporting. Crimes such as domestic violence, marital sexual abuse, cyber harassment, and trafficking remain highly underrepresented in police data. In many cases, complaints are withdrawn, informally “settled,” or never converted into FIRs due to pressure from families or local authorities. Additionally, rising numbers of FIRs often are not proportionately reflected in advances made to charges and convictions. It raises questions about whether the system is equipped to handle greater reporting effectively.Recent findings from the National Annual Report and Index on Women’s Safety, released by the National Commission for Women (NCW), further underline the limits of relying solely on official crime statistics to assess women’s safety.Based on a survey of 12,770 women across 31 cities, the report seeks to document unreported harassment, everyday experiences, and perceptions of safety that rarely enter police records. India received a national safety score of 65 per cent, with six in ten women saying they felt safe in their city. However, a substantial 40 per cent still described themselves as “not so safe” or “unsafe,” revealing a significant perception gap.The data shows that while educational institutions are viewed as relatively safe by 86 per cent of respondents during the day, feelings of safety decline sharply at night and in off-campus spaces. The survey also found that 7 per cent of women reported experiencing harassment in public spaces in 2024, a figure that rises to 14 per cent among women under 24, identifying young women as a particularly vulnerable group. Crucially, the report highlights pervasive underreporting, with nearly two-thirds of harassment incidents never formally reported, suggesting that NCRB figures capture only a fraction of the problem. Neighbourhoods (38 per cent) and public transport (29 per cent) emerged as the most frequently cited harassment hotspots.Women’s responses to harassment varied widely: 28 per cent confronted the harasser, 25 per cent left the area, and only 20 per cent approached authorities reflecting low confidence in institutional redress. Indeed, just one in three victims filed a formal complaint, pointing to enduring trust deficits in policing and complaint mechanisms, and reinforcing the gap between lived experience and recorded crime.For many survivors of violence, the decision to report an offence is shaped less by the severity of the crime than by the social and institutional costs of speaking out. Policing structures, patriarchal norms, and sustained pressure from families and communities combine to create formidable barriers to reporting, particularly in cases involving sexual violence, domestic abuse, or harassment by known perpetrators. While legal frameworks mandate the registration of complaints, the lived experience of engaging with the criminal justice system often deters survivors from approaching it in the first place.Interactions with the police remain a significant point of friction. Survivors frequently cite fear of being disbelieved, questioned about their character, or pressured into compromise rather than a formal complaint. In cases of domestic violence or sexual assault, women are often encouraged to deal with matters in private spaces, reflecting deeply ingrained attitudes that prioritise social harmony over individual justice. Procedural hurdles, such as repeated visits to police stations, insensitive questioning, or delays in registering First Information Reports, further discourage reporting, especially for women with limited mobility, financial dependence, or caregiving responsibilities.Patriarchal expectations within families and communities add another layer of pressure. Survivors may be warned that reporting violence will bring shame, damage marriage prospects, or invite social ostracism. In intimate partner violence, economic dependence and concern for children’s welfare frequently compel women to endure abuse in silence. Young women, in particular, face heightened scrutiny, with families often prioritising “reputation” over accountability, discouraging formal complaints even when harm is severe.These pressures are compounded by structural weaknesses in survivor support systems.Together, policing practices, patriarchal control, and social pressure create a climate where silence appears safer than disclosure. As a result, official crime data captures only a narrow slice of women’s experiences, masking the depth of violence that continues to shape everyday life.Crime data is designed to count incidents, not to measure the enduring weight of trauma or the complex realities of survival. While statistics can indicate how many cases were reported, registered, or prosecuted, they remain largely silent on what violence does to women’s bodies, minds, livelihoods, and relationships long after the event. The aftermath of abuse, fear, anxiety, depression, disrupted education or employment, and fractured social ties rarely appears in official records, even though these consequences often shape a survivor’s life more profoundly than the crime itself.Numbers also fail to capture the uneven paths to survival. For many women, continuing daily life involves constant negotiation: avoiding certain routes, abandoning jobs, changing schools, or remaining in unsafe homes due to financial dependence or lack of shelter. These acts of adaptation and endurance are invisible in crime statistics, which treat incidents as discrete events rather than ongoing experiences. A closed case or a withdrawn complaint may signal resolution on paper, but it often masks unresolved harm or coercive compromise.Equally absent from the data are the cumulative effects of repeated, low-level violence, verbal abuse, intimidation, stalking, and digital harassment that may not meet reporting thresholds but steadily erode a sense of safety and autonomy. Crime figures can show whether violence is counted, but not whether dignity is restored.Without incorporating survivor-centred perspectives, trauma-informed indicators, and long-term outcomes, data risks reducing deeply personal suffering to abstract totals, obscuring both the cost of violence and the resilience required to live with it.","In 2025, crime data remains the only way women’s safety in India is judged. These numbers shape headlines, policy debates, and official claims of progress. But they reflect only those cases that enter the criminal justice system. Far more experiences remain outside the record, abuse within homes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126190684,imgsize-1336965,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

""People Who Are..."" MEA Responds To Viral Mallya And Modi “Biggest Fugitive” Video

NEW DELHI: Reacting to a video that surfaced showing fugitives Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya at a party in London, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday reiterated that India remains firmly committed to bringing back individuals wanted by law to face justice in the country.“We remain fully committed that people who are fugitive and are wanted by law in India, they return to the country. For this particular return, we are in talks with several governments, and processes are on,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters at a weekly briefing in New Delhi.He added that there were several legal processes involved, but reiterated the government’s commitment to ensuring the return of such individuals to India.""As you know, in several of these cases, several layers of legalities are involved. But we remain committed to bring them back to the country so they can face trials before the court here,"" Jaiswal said.The MEA’s remarks come days after Lalit Modi shared a video on Instagram from Mallya’s 70th birthday celebrations, in which he referred to himself and his fellow fugitive as the “two biggest fugitives from India.”“Let me do something to break the internet again. Happy birthday my friend #VijayMallya.Love u,” he wrote in the caption.Modi hosted the celebration at his upscale six-bedroom residence in London’s Belgrave Square, among the most expensive neighbourhoods in the UK. Several of Mallya’s associates travelled from India to attend the party.Mallya, who turned 70 on December 18, is the former owner of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines and previously owned the Bengaluru franchise in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He left India for the UK in 2016 after multiple cases were filed against him over alleged financial irregularities and loan defaults involving thousands of crores of rupees.Modi, a former cricket administrator and the founder of the IPL, left India in 2010 after investigations were launched into alleged financial misconduct and irregularities during the league’s early years.",A video surfaced showing fugitives Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya at a party in London.

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The CBI on Friday filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi high court’s order suspending the life sentence of the Unnao rape convict and former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.According to a CBI spokesperson, the decision was taken after examining the order passed by the high court’s division bench.The agency’s move came three days after the HC granted relief to Sengar, an order that sparked widespread outrage and led to protests by the victim, her mother, and women's groups.The survivor of the June 2017 assault had already said she would approach the top court.On Tuesday, a division bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar ordered the suspension of Sengar’s sentence during the pendency of his appeal against conviction and life imprisonment, subject to the furnishing of a bail bond of Rs 15 lakh. He was also granted conditional bail.The bench directed that the politician shall not enter a five-kilometre radius of the area in Delhi where the survivor resides. He has also been ordered to remain in the national capital and to have no contact with the woman and her family members.Senior advocate N Hariharan, along with advocate SP Tripathi, appeared for Sengar and argued that their client was not a public servant at the time of the offence.They also contended that there were “discrepancies” in documents relating to the survivor’s age and said medical evidence should be relied upon.Opposing the bail plea, advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for the victim, submitted that there had been “serious threats” to her life in the past. Pracha pointed out that she had earlier been provided security, which was later withdrawn, and highlighted that her father was assaulted in police custody and later died due to his injuries — a case in which Sengar was separately convicted.The former MLA remains in judicial custody as he has not been granted bail in the second case, for which he was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He has also challenged his conviction and sentence in that matter.The Uttar Pradesh government transferred the investigation to the CBI in April 2018. In August 2019, the Supreme Court shifted the case and all related proceedings from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi to ensure a fair and speedy trial. Sengar was convicted and sentenced in December that year.","CBI files a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi high court’s order suspending the life sentence of the Unnao rape convict and former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

NEW DELHI: The year 2025 is drawing to an end and most people are busy figuring out the New Year's resolutions. Every new year promises change and every December claims a reset.This year, India moved fast, yet some headlines felt like deja vu.In some cases, the names, dates and locations changed, but the storylines did not - a dominant BJP , a drifting Congress , toxic Delhi air, Pakistan‑linked terror. Several themes remained the same, think: sexist soundbites by netas, language wars and renaming frenzies.In 2025, BJP once again proved that the default setting of India remains “saffron”. The party registered emphatic wins in both Delhi and Bihar – two very different, politically crucial states.In February, BJP ended its Delhi drought and stormed back to power after 27 years. It won 48 of 70 assembly seats with around 46% vote share. The incumbent AAP government slumped to 22 seats and got around 44%.In Bihar, where the NDA was fighting an anti‑incumbency wave, the alliance swept the assembly with 202 of 243 seats. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 89 seats. The party got nearly 21% vote share.In Maharashtra, the BJP-led Mahayuti won 207 municipal councils and nagar panchayat seats of the 288, securing a single largest majority.The BJP won most of them, securing 117 seats, Shiv Sena 53 and NCP 37 seats. Congress won 28 seats.As the results were counted on various days for different elections, the headline still read - BJP starts favourite, BJP finishes first.If BJP’s script stayed familiar, so did the Congress’s. The party’s national brand continued to underperform even where local anger against incumbents was visible.This year, after failing to even open the account in the Delhi elections, the party held the AICC meet in Ahmedabad in April. Same age-old issues were raised: call to rebuild the organisation from booth‑level, sharpen the party’s ideological pitch beyond anti‑BJP rhetoric and regain lost ground in the Hindi belt.But again in Bihar, Congress managed to win only 6 seats with 8.7% vote share.This year, the Congress story, yet again, remained about its potential and plans rather than outcomes.Election after election, the analysis throughout the year kept throwing up the same words: ""fragmented"", ""faction‑ridden"", “no ground-level connection”.Cricket fandom in 2025 remained addicted to its favourite off‑field sport - guessing when India’s modern greats will walk away from the field.After announcing retirement from the T20 format last year, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli played reduced schedules. However, every match, series, or dip in form or rest sparked ""is this his last?"" debate.But RoKo ended the year as No. 1 and 2 batsmen in ICC ODI rankings. The duo were also back with a bang in the domestic Vijay Hazare Trophy after years.At home, MS Dhoni, long retired from international cricket but still a Chennai Super Kings totem, stayed in the retirement gossip each IPL match. Talking about reading too much into it, people went crazy this year over his t-shirt ahead of the IPL season that had ""one last time"" written in Morse code.He obviously went on to play in 2025 and also took over as CSK skipper mid-season after captain Ruturaj Gaikwad suffered an injury.From Diwali to winter, it was the same story in Delhi once again. By December, the city’s AQI remained in the “severe” to “hazardous” range for days at a stretch. GRAP restrictions were imposed repeatedly, cycling through Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4. One analysis showed sustained AQI levels above 500 through mid‑December, with peaks over 600 and no meaningful dips into safer categories, underscoring that this was not a one‑day spike but a chronic toxic wall.Flights were delayed, schools moved online, construction bans returned, and familiar visuals of masked children, disappearing India Gate and grey skylines flooded the feeds.Experts once more cited the same cocktail: winter inversion, low wind, vehicle and industrial emissions, and stubble burning. Policy responses remained reactive and short‑term.With this, the headline seemed copy‑pasted from almost any winter in the past decade: “Delhi chokes”, ""Delhi turns gas chamber"", ""Delhi air turns red"".In 2022, when Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was asked about the sliding rupee, she had said: ""I would not look at it as rupee sliding, I would look at it as dollar strengthening.""In 2025, the rupee quietly set fresh records for weakness against the US dollar. After relative stability, it fell to an all‑time low of Rs 91 in December.The rupee has slid by 5-6% so far this year, making it Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.Addressing the concerns, the finance minister stated earlier this month: ""The rupee will find its own level.Meanwhile, analysts point to a wider trade deficit, foreign portfolio outflows, and Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on Indian goods for the slide.2025 did not break the pattern of Pakistan‑linked terrorism. On April 22, a terrorist attack near Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir killed 26 civilians, mostly Hindu tourists. The probe revealed that the mastermind of the attack was a Lashkar‑e‑Taiba offshoot, The Resistance Front.This was followed by India's strong response with Operation Sindoor in which the missiles destroyed the terror infrastructure linked to Jaish‑e‑Mohammed and Lashkar‑e‑Taiba in Pakistan and the Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir region.Islamabad once again refused to own up while its Army majors were seen attending funerals of the terrorists.The headline “Terror strains India–Pakistan ties yet again” remained sadly accurate.If there is one genre of political controversy that never goes out of fashion, it is misogynistic remarks by our leaders. This year gave us multiple examples, cutting across parties and states. In early January, BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri drew outrage for a sexist comment about Priyanka Gandhi, prompting Congress and AAP leaders to call it proof of a “deeply anti-women” mindset.“Lalu said in Bihar that he would make roads like Hema Malini’s cheeks, but he lied, he could not do it. I assure you that just as we made the roads in Okhla and Sangam Vihar, we will make all the roads in Kalkaji like Priyanka Gandhi’s cheeks,” Bidhuri had said.In Kerala, a CPI(M) leader won a panchayat seat, took out a victory rally, and said that “women are only for sleeping with husbands”.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar stirred a row by pulling the naqab of a hijab-wearing woman at an event. What followed was even more disturbing. BJP leader Giriraj Singh defended the CM’s act, saying Kumar had behaved like a “guardian” and that the woman could take the job or “go to hell”. Bihar governor Arif Mohammad Khan also spoke along similar lines and added that Nitish “considers female students his daughters”.This year, Bihar also threw up other such moments. Nitish found himself in trouble after saying, “Girls have become so confident. They speak so well and dress up so well. Did we see them wearing such fine clothes earlier?”RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav, too, passed a lewd remark about Nitish, suggesting he was participating in a women’s rally to “ogle at women”. “Nayan sekne ja rahe hain,” he said when asked about Nitish’s Mahila Samvad Yatra.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also invited criticism after resorting to victim-blaming while defending her government following a gangrape case. “Why was she out at midnight?” Mamata asked.The response cycle was identical each time: viral clip > outrage > absurd defence > forgotten. The headline “Neta’s sexist remarks trigger storm” could have been reused almost every month.India’s language politics remained combustible. In 2025, much of the heat centred on school language policy and perceived “Hindi imposition” in non‑Hindi states. In Maharashtra, a BJP‑led government's move to make Hindi compulsory from Class 1 to 5 triggered a backlash.Parallel debates raged in southern states over NEP’s three‑language formula and the balance between English, regional languages and Hindi with Tamil Nadu MK Stalin taking the charge. The core storyline of the “language war” – Centre‑pushed Hindi vs regional pride and access concerns – remained unchanged.Renaming towns, villages and roads stayed a favourite symbolic tool. In 2025, Uttarakhand grabbed headlines by renaming 11 places across four districts, replacing names like Aurangzebpur and Mohammadpur Jat with Shivaji Nagar, Mohanpur Jat, Shri Krishnapur, Ambedkar Nagar and Jyotiba Phule Nagar, among others.The finale came during the Winter session of Parliament when the Centre came up with the Viksit Bharat—Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) aka VB—G RAM G Bill that replaced the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA).Even as India debated war, the rupee and air quality, one light but telling constant stayed in pop‑political culture: the obsession with the marital status of the eternal bachelors of India. Salman Khan, about to celebrate his 60th birthday, and Rahul Gandhi, still unmarried and still central to the Congress story, remained prime targets of perennial “shaadi kab karoge?” question.In fact, during the run-up to the Bihar Assembly elections, Rahul occasionally used the topic to lighten the mood at press conferences. While sharing a stage with Tejashwi Yadav, he revealed that Lalu Prasad Yadav had advised him to get married soon.Tejashwi, however, used the same platform to turn the spotlight on another eligible bachelor - his rival Chirag Paswan - publicly urging him to tie the knot.","The year 2025 is drawing to an end and most people are busy figuring out the New Year's resolutions.

'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee

India's beloved former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained unmarried his entire life, but there was a time when he was proposed to by a woman, a Pakistani woman to be precise.On the late prime minister's 101st birth anniversary on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh narrated the anecdote, recalling Vajpayee's repartee and sense of humour.Singh recalled that during Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, a Pakistani woman reporter proposed to him, inspired by his speech.""I would like to share one incident. Inspired by his speech, a Pakistan i reporter said she was ready to marry him, but sought ceding of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan in Mehr,"" Singh said.Atalji, with a smile on his face, said, 'Madam, I am ready to marry you, but in return, I want Pakistan as dowry,"" Singh said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.Vajpayee definitely had a way with his words. He was admired for his oratory skills across parties and was an accomplished poet known for his patriotic and humanist compositions.Once, when a supporter urged him to remain ""atal"" (unshakeable), Vajpayee quipped back playfully, with, ""Atal toh hoon, lekin Bihari bhi hoon!"" (“I am Atal, but I am also a Bihari!”).Vajpayee travelled to Lahore by bus in 1999 and embraced Pakistan’s then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, a gesture that came to symbolise hope for better ties between the two neighbours.However, the bonhomie did not last long. Just months later, the Pakistan Army carried out a covert operation to send troops into the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir, triggering a limited conflict that Pakistan ultimately lost.Rashtra Prerna Sthal was inaugurated by PM Modi on Thursday and has been developed as a landmark national memorial and inspirational complex of enduring national significance. Constructed at an approximate cost of Rs 230 crore and spread across an expansive area of 65 acres.","'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered that a man convicted of raping and murdering a five-year-old girl remain behind bars for 30 years without remission, holding that his incarceration must continue until he nears loss of ""virility"" to prevent further sexual crimes.""To save other children and women, the convict must remain within the four walls of the prison until he is closer to the sunset of his virility,"" a division bench of Justices Anoop Chitkara and Sukhvinder Kaur ordered after commuting the convict's death sentence.The case dates to May 31, 2018, when the child was raped and stabbed to death in a village in Haryana's Palwal district by the man, who was a long-time employee of her father. Her body was stuffed into a flour storage drum in the courtyard of his house.CCTV footage from a nearby school showed him leading the child towards his home. He was convicted of kidnapping, rape, murder, criminal conspiracy, and destruction of evidence IPC and Pocso Act , and sentenced to death.He appealed in HC, which upheld his conviction but spared him the gallows and acquitted his mother of the charge of shielding him.""In a civilised society, this barbaric incident would not have happened, and if it did, a mother would have preferred justice for 'Laado' (the name given to victim by the court) than for her 'Raja-beta',"" the bench observed, adding: ""This social attitude, however appalling, is not new.It is deeply embedded in the region's patriarchal mindset and culture.""HC was of the view that to be proportionate, any sentence must be stable and balanced like a table, and for any table to be stable, all its legs must be comparable. Thus, the courts, while awarding a sentence, are under an obligation to consider the crime, victim, criminal and his family, society and the state, the bench observed.HC observed that the facts on record indicate a gruesome crime because 'Laado' was walking with the convict, swaying one hand and letting the convict hold her other hand in absolute trust, ""without the mental age or information to suspect the probable evil of a devil"".However, the convict has no criminal antecedents, and his conduct in prison is not violative, which makes reformation possible, HC observed. ""Considering the victim's age to be 5 years and 7 months, we are convinced to impose a sentence of 30 years, without remission... The fine is enhanced to Rs 30 lakh,"" HC ruled.","Punjab and Haryana high court orders man to remain behind bars for 30 years. He was convicted of raping and murdering a five-year-old girl.

SRINAGAR: Mirwaiz Umar Farooq removed on Thursday his designation as Hurriyat Conference chairman from his social media handle, blaming the move on “pressure” from J&K authorities and calling it a “Hobson’s choice”.“For some time now, I was being pressed by the authorities to make changes to my X (formerly Twitter) handle as all constituents of Hurriyat Conference, including Awami Action Committee that I head, have been banned under UAPA, making Hurriyat a banned organisation, failing which they would take down my handle,” Mirwaiz said.He bemoaned the alleged “pressure” that had shut out a key outreach outlet for him since Thursday. “At a time when public space and avenues of communication stand severely restricted, this platform remains among the very few means available to me to reach out to my people and share my views on our issues with them and the outside world,” Mirwaiz said.Most of Hurriyat’s 20-odd constituents have been proscribed since the Aug 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and J&K’s conversion into a Union territory.The social media curbs came as Mirwaiz was put under house arrest, preventing J&K’s chief cleric from addressing Friday prayers at Srinagar’s historic Jamia Mosque. Since his release in Sept 2023 after being under house arrest for four years following the abrogation of Article 370, Mirwaiz has frequently faced such restrictions, with police often detaining him at home on Fridays without offering any explanation.The social media move unleashed trolling against Mirwaiz, with many accusing him of compromising on Hurriyat’s ideology. But former CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti described the removal as “immaterial”, arguing that Hurriyat “is an idea and reflects alienation”. “You can remove names from any platform but you have to address this idea of Hurriyat,” Mehbooba said.PDP MLA Waheed Parra backed Mirwaiz, saying choosing “peace over rigidity is not weakness, it is leadership”.Tanvir Sadiq, spokesperson for J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), slammed the alleged coercion. “Mirwaiz is a religious scholar, and if he is being pressured, then it is wrong,” Sadiq said.BJP described Mirwaiz’s move as the “right decision”. “It is a message to J&K’s youth that the road of separatism has ended,” spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.",Mirwaiz Umar Farooq removed his designation as Hurriyat Conference chairman from his social media handle.

NEW DELHI: Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants and a large number of eye-related side effects, according to a global safety analysis that has flagged dozens of baby-related cases and more than 1,600 eye disorder reports worldwide.Researchers identified more than 45 reports of excessive hair growth in infants aged up to 23 months linked to exposure to minoxidil. In several cases, exposure was not due to direct application but occurred unintentionally within the household, including contact with caregivers or contaminated surfaces.Globally, the analysis found 2,664 suspected cases of excessive hair growth linked to minoxidil use during pregnancy. Among infant cases, maternal exposure accounted for 22.2%, accidental exposure for 44.4%, while the route of exposure was unclear in 33.3% of cases.Though no infant cases were reported from India, the authors of the study cautioned that this likely reflected under-reporting rather than absence of risk, given the drug's widespread use.The study also raised concerns about eye health. A total of 1,660 reports of eye-related adverse effects associated with minoxidil use were recorded globally, including 25 reports from India.Frequently reported problems included eyelid swelling and blurred vision.More serious eye conditions were also noted, including central serous chorioretinopathy. After removal of duplicate reports, four serious eye cases remained - three involving central serous chorioretinopathy and one case of retinal artery occlusion.The findings are based on a post-marketing safety analysis of adverse drug reports submitted to VigiBase, the global drug safety database maintained by WHO, covering data up to March 2025.The study was authored by Dr V Kalaiselvan and Dr Jaishree Suresh of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, health ministry, and Dr Rohit Saxena of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Minoxidil was originally developed as an oral medicine to treat high blood pressure. Hair growth was later observed as a side effect, leading to its reformulation as a topical drug used to treat hair loss. Its effectiveness against androgenetic alopecia has since made it one of the most commonly used treatments worldwide.The authors warned easy over-the-counter availability, aggressive online promotion and limited counselling had allowed use to expand faster than safety awareness, particularly among pregnant women and households with infants.The study underlined that minoxidil was contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but awareness of this warning remained low. With topical formulations commonly used at home, unintentional exposure through skin contact or household surfaces may place infants at risk.Calling for action, the authors recommended clearer warning labels, stricter oversight of over-the-counter sales and routine counselling by pharmacists and healthcare providers.Caregivers were advised to store products safely and avoid use around infants and pregnant women.While minoxidil continues to benefit adults using it to treat hair loss, the authors stressed public awareness and pharmacovigilance must keep pace with growing use to prevent avoidable adverse effects.","Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants and a large number of eye-related side effects.

NEW DELHI: People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Friday lost her cool with a journalist who asked her to speak in Urdu instead of Kashmiri, which the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister was using at the time.As soon as she began her press conference in Kashmiri at the PDP headquarters in Srinagar, a journalist asked her to speak in Urdu.“Do you want a translation? Why? Translate it. Why don’t you ask Stalin to speak in English or Urdu?” Mufti snapped, referring to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, who speaks only Tamil, his native language.She further urged Kashmiri journalists to “show some respect” for their language.“This is the only thing that is left now, so respect the Kashmiri language a little,” the former chief minister said, before continuing her address in her mother tongue.Mufti also spoke about the lynching of two Hindu youths in separate incidents in neighbouring Bangladesh, drawing a parallel with the ""intolerant"" situation in India.“The intolerance in the entire country has increased. Lynchings are taking place.What is happening in Bangladesh pains us, but those who criticise it remain mute spectators when lynchings take place here,” she told reporters.The PDP chief further urged the Jammu and Kashmir government to send ministerial teams to various states to ensure the ""safety"" of Kashmiris living there.""Our government should send a ministerial team to every state and especially to Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana, where most such incidents take place,"" she said.Mufti's remark came in the wake of an alleged assault on a shawl seller from the Union territory in Uttarakhand. She also took credit for the arrest of the accused.""I immediately put out a tweet and tagged the Uttarakhand DGP, seeking his intervention. That is why the accused was arrested. There are still some officers in the police who respond. But three incidents took place in 72 hours? In Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.

Will the 'red fortresses' collapse?



NEW DELHI: Kerala got its first BJP mayor, VV Rajesh, after the National Democratic Alliance won Thiruvananthapuram civic body elections, marking an end to 45 years of Left Democratic Front's (LDF) rule in the city.Thiruvananthapuram was treated like ""inherited property under Left–Congress dominance for decades,"" said state BJP general secretary Anoop Antony Joseph.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already hailed the saffron wave in the red-dominated region as a ""watershed moment"", saying: “Thank you Thiruvananthapuram! The mandate the BJP-NDA got in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is a watershed moment in Kerala’s politics.”In Kollam corporation, UDF’s AK Hafeez was elected mayor, while Kochi saw four-time councillor VK Minimol assume the mayor’s post. Thrissur also went the UDF’s way with Dr Niji Justin elected mayor, though the result was accompanied by internal dissent after councillor Lali James alleged she was sidelined following bribery by party leaders. In Kannur too, the UDF strengthened its position, with P Indira set to take charge as mayor.One of the standout moments of the results came from Pala municipality, where 21-year-old Diya Binu Pulikkankandam was elected chairperson with UDF backing, becoming the youngest municipal chairperson in Kerala. Diya, along with her father Binu and uncle Biju, won as Independents before extending support to the UDF — a move that ended Kerala Congress (Mani)’s long-standing dominance in Pala, once considered its political citadel.The NDA, meanwhile, posted selective but symbolically significant gains. The BJP retained control of Thiruvananthapuram and also emerged victorious in the municipalities of Tripunithura and Palakkad, underlining its expanding footprint in urban local bodies. While the LDF managed to hold its ground in Kozhikode by winning the majority of wards, it secured only one of the six corporations overall.As the CPI(M) looks ahead to the 2026 Kerala Assembly election, it does so from a position of growing vulnerability. A strong wave of anti-incumbency and governance fatigue has begun to weigh on the Left after a decade in office.These fault lines were evident not just in the local body polls, but also in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Left struggled badly at the national level even as the Congress regained momentum in the state and the BJP carved out space in what was long considered a near one-party arena. The parliamentary contests exposed a shrinking footprint for the Left beyond state politics.In both the 2019 and 2024 general elections, the CPI(M) won only a handful of Kerala’s 20 Lok Sabha seats, while the Congress-led UDF dominated and the BJP managed to open its account. This contrast has underscored a weakening appeal in national elections, even as the Left retains power in Thiruvananthapuram. That control was reaffirmed in 2021, when the LDF secured a decisive Assembly victory and achieved the rare feat of a second consecutive term in Kerala.

Pizhaiththa Thennandhoppu—The Spared Grove

Rain can create havoc and harm; yet for those

afflicted, rain alone becomes refuge.

I was standing by a glass window, watching the rain . The sound was muted, yet the sight was anything but gentle. Jets of water struck the glass ferociously, as though the sky itself was knocking—urgent, restless. I was reminded that nature often speaks most powerfully even when unheard.As I watched, my thoughts drifted to poets across eras and cultures, separated by time and geography, and to how rain has unfailingly served as a spring of creativity.Keen observation, emotional depth, and mastery over language allow them to distil fleeting moments into enduring truths. Whether ancient or modern, poetry repeatedly returns to the same elemental concerns—love and loss, despair and hope , destruction and renewal.Tamil poetry offers a striking illustration of this convergence. From the Sangam era onward, poets lived in intimate dialogue with their landscape. Nature was never a passive backdrop; it was a symbolic language. Love, separation, anticipation, and sorrow were mapped onto hills, forests, seashores, and rain-laden skies.Kapilar, one of the greatest Sangam poets, exemplifies this sensitivity. In a celebrated verse, he describes a lovelorn heroine stringing a garland of 99 flowers after bathing in a waterfall. Each flower suggests a slightly different shade of love—desire, tenderness, hesitation, ache.On Nov 30, 1916, Subramania Bharati, then living in Puducherry, witnessed a devastating cyclone that ravaged the coast. In its wake, he composed, often described as the ghostly dance of divine rain. For Bharati, rain a cosmic force—fierce and sublime.The day after the storm, he walked along the shore and found dead birds scattered on the beach. It is said that he gathered them using his turban cloth and buried them. Later, he visited a coconut grove owned by a poor friend. While neighbouring farms lay uprooted, this small grove alone had survived. From this experience emerged. Bharati marvels at the rain’s benevolence in protecting the poorest, seeing in it both fury and compassion.Centuries earlier, Andal had offered a different, equally radical vision. In one evocative passage, she watches thunderous rain and imagines it as Krishna himself. The dark raincloud becomes his blue form; lightning is likened to the Sudarshana Chakra; thunder becomes the Panchajanya conch, the sound of cosmic creation. Yet she asks the rain to nourish the world, not to destroy it. Emotion, theology, and ecology merge seamlessly.Thiruvalluvar, earlier still, devoted an entire chapter to rain. One couplet captures its paradox with timeless clarity:Keduppadhoong Kettaarkku Charvaaimatr AangeEdupadhoom Ellaam MazhaiValluvar had already distilled its essence into a few spare lines. Rain may wound and rain may heal, he reminds us, but it is rain alone that sustains life. In that truth lies the shared wisdom of poets across time: what falls from the heavens carries both burden and blessing, and it is in learning to receive it with humility that the world endures.It was perhaps the last rain of this calendar year. The clouds had emptied themselves, the windowpane stood clear again, and the world returned to stillness. Yet rain, like poetry, does not obey calendars. It will return—in another season, another century, another line of verse. Long after dates are forgotten, rain will continue to fall, and poets will continue to listen.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126189865,imgsize-57334,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/126189865.jpg"

NOIDA: A Class 10 student died by suicide early on Dec 23, allegedly hours after she was pulled up by her teachers and principal at a private Greater Noida West school for using AI on her mobile phone to write her pre-Board exam papers.The girl's father submitted a police complaint on Thursday seeking an FIR against the school management, the principal and two teachers, accusing them of abetment to suicide and mental harassment.While police are examining allegations before registering an FIR, the principal told TOI that the student, though reprimanded, was not harassed and told that cheating in the board exam could earn her a five-year suspension from writing the test.According to the minor's father, the 16-year-old allegedly jumped from her eight-floor flat early on Dec 23. He alleged that his daughter was deeply distressed after she was scolded and humiliated by teachers for bringing her phone to the exam hall on Dec 22.In his complaint, the father said he has three daughters, all of whom study at the same school. He alleged that his eldest daughter had ""unknowingly"" carried her mobile phone to school on the day of the exam.She was caught by the invigilator, who reprimanded her and informed her class teacher. The student was then taken to the principal.The principal called the girl's parents to the school, and her father arrived shortly afterwards. He alleged that even in his presence, the teachers and principal continued to scold and insult the student aggressively. He also claimed that he was called ""careless"" by the teachers.The father claimed his daughter was shaken by the incident and that the harsh words used by her teachers had a severe psychological impact. He named the child's class teacher, Poonam Dubey, another teacher, Taapas, and the school management in his complaint, accusing them of pushing his daughter towards taking an extreme step.He has urged police to register a case under BNS Section 108 (abetment of suicide), and other relevant provisions. He claimed the incident had left his other two daughters traumatised and fearful of returning to the school.The school has strongly denied the allegations. The principal told TOI over the phone that the student was not harassed and that the school followed standard protocol prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education . ""The girl was found with a mobile phone during the pre-board examinations. When the invigilator checked the device, it appeared that she had been using AI to get answers. The phone was confiscated, and she was brought to the examination head, who then brought her to me,"" the principal said.She said she had informed the student that using such methods during the CBSE board examinations could lead to a ban of up to five years from appearing in the exams. ""That is the rule, and the child was only told about the consequences,"" she said. According to the principal, the student's parents were informed immediately and reached the school within 10 to 15 minutes, as they lived nearby. She said the interaction took place at the reception area and was brief.","A Class 10 student died by suicide early on Dec 23, allegedly hours after she was pulled up by her teachers and principal at a private Greater Noida West school.

Red Line From New Delhi: India Calls Out Yunus Govt As Minority Attacks In Bangladesh Escalate

‘2,900 incidents against minorities have been documented during Yunus government’

NEW DELHI: The acrimonious exchanges between India and Bangladesh in the past few weeks came to a head on Friday with India slamming Dhaka for ""unremitting hostility"" against minorities - including Hindus, Christians and Buddhists - in the country at the hands of extremists.Calling it a matter of grave concern, ministry of external affairs (MEA) condemned the recent killing of a Hindu youth in Mymensingh and stressed that the perpetrators of the crime must be brought to justice.Asked about the return of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman to Dhaka after 17 years, the Indian govt only said it should be seen in the context of India's call for efforts to ensure free, fair and inclusive parliamentary polls in Bangladesh.PM Narendra Modi had earlier expressed concerns about the failing health of Tarique's mother and former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia and offered all possible assistance to her.Tarique returned to Dhaka on Thursday, further energising BNP - which was revived by former PM Sheikh Hasina's ouster last year - ahead of the Feb 12 parliamentary elections.On the security situation in Bangladesh, the ministry said it rejected the false narrative created in the country.""You would understand that law and order or security situation or the developments that are happening in Bangladesh is the responsibility of the govt of Bangladesh, and to portray a narrative where things go in some other direction is completely false and we reject that,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.The official said that more than 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities, including cases of killings, arson, and land grab, have been documented by independent sources during the tenure of the interim govt and these incidents cannot be brushed aside as mere media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence. The interim govt led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly brushed aside India's concerns as propaganda by the Indian media.""We are all aware of the recent developments in Bangladesh. We have been closely following them. And, as far as the law and order situation is concerned, I have been apprising you from time to time as to what our position has been or should be and is today. The unremitting hostility against minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists at the hands of extremists, is a matter of grave concern,"" said the official.“India wants close and friendly relations with people of Bangladesh which is rooted in Liberation struggle and strengthened through various development and people-to-people initiatives,” he said.BNP had earlier said it wanted balanced ties with India. Indian govt’s response was that it remained committed to the best interests of people of Bangladesh, including peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country and will continue to engage constructively in this regard with all stakeholders.","India slams Dhaka for ""unremitting hostility"" against minorities.

Ambulance staff stop work over wages

SHIMLA/KULLU: The Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla — following backing from Himachal Medical Officers Association and RDAs of other medical colleges — announced an indefinite strike from 9.30 am Saturday, demanding immediate reinstatement of Dr Raghav Nirula, who was sacked on the recommendations of an inquiry report for assaulting a patient on December 22.They will be joined by govt doctors in other health facilities across the state. All routine services, OPDs and elective operation theatres will remain closed, but emergency services will continue to function, IGMC RDA announced Friday.CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu’s promise of a fresh inquiry cut no ice with the doctors, who see Nirula’s sacking as a “mob trial”. There’s a video of Nirula brutally thrashing the patient, who is also seen kicking him while lying in bed, but RDA said Nirula’s side of the story hasn’t been considered, and the termination is unjust.Himachal residents are already facing the brunt of the protest as govt doctors, excluding those on emergency and VIP duties, went on mass casual leave. Long queues were seen at OPD counters of regional and zonal hospitals in Kullu, Dharamshala, Una and Mandi.On Friday morning, representatives of IGMC RDA, HMOA and State Association of Medical and Dental College Teachers met the CM with their demands. RDA president Dr Sohail Sharma told mediapersons that Sukhu listened to them in detail, “considered all available evidence” and promised a fresh inquiry.The association alleged that Nirula received “direct threats to his life” and was warned to “leave the country”. RDA called for the immediate revocation of Nirula’s termination order. The association expressed concern over instances of “mob intimidation” inside the hospital, saying safety of healthcare workers was under threat and services were disrupted. It has demanded registration of FIRs and legal proceedings under BNS.“A fresh inquiry should be conducted to find out the exact circumstances that led to this incident. Moreover, govt should inquire into the threats made against the doctor by the patient’s attendants,” said Dr Satyavrat Vaidya, posted at Regional Hospital, Kullu.Former BJP CM and current LoP in assembly, Jai Ram Thakur, on Friday termed Nirula’s sacking a “harsh” move. “The decision to terminate Dr Raghav seems to have been taken in a hurry. A suspension order with a warning would have sufficed,” he said. RDA has also sought legal action over the vandalism of govt property during the December 22 fracas, and steps to end CCTV and security deficiencies at IGMC-Shimla.To add to patients’ woes, around 1,300 employees of 108 and 102 ambulance services also went on a two-day strike across the state on Friday , demanding minimum wages.They staged protests and stopped work, impacting emergency services across Himachal. Protests were held in Una, Shimla, Kullu, Solan, Nahan, Chamba, Mandi, Dharamshala and Hamirpur as employees raised slogans against the company hired by the health department to run ambulance services.The employees’ union has alleged the firm isn’t giving them the basic salary ordered by various courts, including HP HC.","Routine services, OPDs and elective operation theatres will remain closed, but emergency services will continue to function.

NEW DELHI: In a first, government notified standards for incense sticks (agarbatti) and has laid down quality norms or Indian Standards, specifying a list of substances prohibited for use in their manufacture.The items include certain insecticidal chemicals such as allethrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fipronil, as well as synthetic fragrance intermediates like benzyl cyanide, ethyl acrylate and diphenylamine. Many of these substances are restricted or banned internationally due to their potential impact on human health, indoor air quality and ecological safety.The standard, IS 19412:2025, developed by BIS was released by consumer affairs minister Pralhad Joshi on Consumer Rights Day. The department said this was aimed at enhancing quality, safety, and sustainability. At present, this will be a voluntary standard. It classifies agarbatti into machine-made, hand-made, and traditional masala agarbattis, and prescribes requirements for raw materials, burning quality, fragrance performance and chemical parameters.“Substances historically used... have been linked to respiratory irritation, allergic reactions, neurological effects and environmental harm when inhaled repeatedly in indoor environments,” the department said.","In a first, government notified standards for incense sticks (agarbatti) Indian Standards specify a list of substances prohibited for use in their manufacture.

NEW DELHI: India is committed to bring back all fugitives who are wanted here to face prosecution, ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Friday at a media briefing.He was replying to a question on the recent videos of fugitives Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya apparently mocking at Indian law enforcement agencies for their failure to get them deported from London.“We remain fully committed that people who are fugitives and who are wanted by law in India, return to the country. For this particular return, we are in talks with several governments, and processes are on,” Jaiswal said.He said the delay (in the Mallya and other extradition cases) is because “in several of these cases there are several layers of legalities involved”. Jaiswal, however, reiterated that the government remained committed to bringing them back to the country so that they can face trial before courts here.Modi and Mallya are facing multiple money laundering charges in India and have taken refuge in London, refusing to return to face trial in cases against them.On Dec 16, Modi hosted a birthday bash at his London residence at Belgrave Square for his friend Mallya with Indian billionaire Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and others in attendance.Modi mocked the enforcement agencies with his “we’re the biggest fugitives” comment as he posed for a picture with Mallya and a woman guest.Two days later, ED announced it has restituted Rs 312 crore from the sale proceeds of Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines to its former employees towards their long-pending dues. The funds were released from earlier proceeds restituted by ED to SBI from sale of shares of Mallya’s company.Mallya has already lost his appeal against his extradition before the high court in London and has little chances of getting away. He had recently also filed a case in the Bombay high court challenging the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act. The high court rebuffed his plea asking him to furnish a timeline for his return to the country and that any such appeal cannot be heard in absentia.","India committed to bring back all fugitives who are wanted here to face prosecution, MEA says. “We are in talks with several governments, and processes are on,” Randhir Jaiswal said.

Bangladesh Election Turmoil Deepens, Hasina's Awami League Rejects Poll Timeline Under Yunus Re

NAGPUR: Amidst the brutal persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh in the run-up to the February polls, a party registered in April hopes to fight its maiden elections, seeking Hindu and other minority votes.Bangladesh Minority Janta Party (BMJP) is preparing to contest 91 of 300 seats of Jatiya Parishad (national parliament), hoping to win 40 to 45 seats, said the outfit's president, Sukriti Kumar Mandal.Talking to TOI on phone from Dhaka, Mandal said, ""We have zeroed in on constituencies where the minority, especially the Hindu vote-bank, ranges from 20% to 60%.""Scrambling to file nominations before the Monday deadline, Mandal feels Hindus need to feel safe to come out and vote. A tie-up with any mainstream party - be it Tarique Rahman's BNP or Jamaat-e-Islami - can help. ""With an alliance with these parties, minorities can come out of their houses without fearing retaliation. Awami League is off the radar, and BMJP is the only voice of persecuted Hindus,"" Mandal told TOI.Mandal said the party candidates would be finalised in a day or two. ""By Saturday, all nominations would be filed,"" he said.He said India should change its stand on Bangladesh and only back the cause of Hindus, instead of supporting the Awami League.""If India shifts from its pro-Awami League stand, mainstream Bangladesh parties will sit up and take note. India must know that BMJP is the sole voice of minorities,"" Mandal said. A change in stand could also lead to a change in Bangladeshi mindset towards India, he said, adding the Awami League only used India to gain power.The five-point agenda shared with TOI includes working towards a secular Bangladesh, establishing a federal system by carving out five provinces, and establishing fundamental and constitutional rights of each state. BMJP also proposes changes in textbooks with a secular and scientific approach, apart from ensuring fair rights for minorities.","Bangladesh Minority Janta Party (BMJP) is preparing to contest 91 of 300 seats of Jatiya Parishad (national parliament) The outfit's president, Sukriti Kumar Mandal, hopes to win 40 to 45 seats.

NEW DELHI: From 11-year-old Shavan Singh's heartwarming story of social service during Operation Sindoor - regularly delivering water, milk and lassi to Indian soldiers stationed near his home along the Punjab border - to seven-year-old chess prodigy from Gujarat, Vaka Lakshmi Pragnika, the stories of the 20 recipients of Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar reflect resilience, courage and achievement.On Veer Bal Diwas, President Droupadi Murmu Friday, conferred the awards on children from 18 states for exceptional achievements in bravery, social service, environment, sports, art and culture, and science and technology, at an event organised by women and child development ministry.Later, PM Modi interacted with the awardees ahead of addressing a programme at Bharat Mandapam and lauded their achievements.Speaking to TOI, Shavan Singh, a Class IV student from Chak Taran Wali village in Punjab's Ferozepur, said that when drones began flying over his house, he thought of the soldiers stationed on the frontline and asked his parents if he could take essential items for them. Asked if he felt scared, Shavan replied ""bilkul nahin"" (not at all), adding that he wants to join the Army.Another inspiring awardee is Vansh Tayal from Chandigarh, recognised in the social service category.Orphaned during the Covid pandemic in 2021, Vansh lives in a child care institution. Despite his own emotional challenges, he volunteered to care for a six-year-old abandoned child with disabilities and contributed to the child's rehabilitation. Now in Class 12, Vansh said he aspires to become a psychologist.Lauding the children, President Murmu said it is because of talented youngsters like Pragnika that India is considered a chess powerhouse.

Pakistan Embarrassed Globally As Saudi Deports 56000 Beggars Despite No Fly Lists And Warnings

Most Indians deported for staying beyond visa validity

HYDERABAD: Over 24,600 Indians were deported from 81 countries in 2025, as per the latest ministry of external affairs data tabled in Rajya Sabha. It wasn't the US but Saudi Arabia that recorded the highest deportations - over 11,000 in 12 months.While in comparison, only 3,800 Indians - mostly private employees - were deported from the US in 2025, these numbers are the highest recorded from the country in the last five years, the report says. Experts attribute it to the recent crackdown and increased scrutiny of documents, visa status, work authorisation, overstays, etc, by the Trump administration.Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234).Countries that saw a significant number of deportations of Indians include Myanmar (1,591), UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), Malaysia (1,485), Thailand (481), and Cambodia (305). According to latest MEA data, common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers, and involvement in civil or criminal cases.""This is a pattern with Gulf countries, which see a large migration of workers from India who either take up jobs as labourers in the construction sector, become caregivers, or work as househelp. Most of them are low-skilled workers who migrate through agents and, in many cases, in an attempt to earn extra money, end up involved in minor offences,"" said Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana govt's NRI advisory committee. ""In other instances, lack of awareness about local laws and regulations proves costly,"" he added.In many cases, these migrant workers fall prey to fraud perpetrated by agents back home and are deported once caught by police abroad.Deportations from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia, however, follow a different pattern. ""Most of these are linked to cyber slavery. These countries have emerged as major hubs of a multi-billion dollar cybercrime industry where Indians are lured with promises of high-paying jobs but are later trapped, forced to work in illegal operations, and eventually detained and deported,"" Reddy explained.It is, therefore, important that workers are made aware of rules before they land on foreign shores, said Naga Bharani of Telangana Overseas Manpower Company. ""People should be told to closely track their visa timelines, and comply with local rules. There is always an option to apply for a visa extension,"" she said. Deportation of Indian students was the highest from UK, with 170 sent home in 2025. This was followed by Australia (114), Russia (82) and US (45).","Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234) Common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126196015,imgsize-86626,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image.jpg"

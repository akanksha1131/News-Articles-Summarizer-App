Conclusion

(by Brijesh Singh, senior IPS officer and cybersecurity expert, views are personal.)

NEW DELHI: The opposition has time and again raised concerns about the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in polling and suggested a return to paper ballots for the electoral process. After recent defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections , the Congress cited '99 per cent battery level' in the machines to suggest tampering and manipulation of the machines to favour the Bharatiya Janata Party. Can the EVMs be manipulated or hacked to favour a party in election? Can the number of votes be changed after polling? Here's your guide to all the EVM-related questions.The microcontroller in EVMs is One Time Programmable (OTP), meaning it can only be programmed once. This programming occurs under strict supervision by theTechnical Experts Committee , and the source code is audited by independent experts. Before each election, mock polls with over 1,000 votes are conducted, allowing political parties to verify that voting patterns are recorded accurately. Hence it is impossible to pre- program it to favor anyone.: EVMs are stored in secure strong rooms with 24/7 CCTV surveillance and armed security from multiple independent (center and state) agencies. They have tamper-evident seals with unique serial numbers, and a two-stage randomization process ensures that no one knows which EVM will be used where until the last moment. Pre-poll checks are conducted in the presence of representatives from multiple political parties to verify the machines' integrity.: Indian EVMs do not have any wireless components, including no internet connectivity, Bluetooth, or external ports. They are designed to be ""air-gapped,"" meaning they are physically isolated from any network, making them immune to remote hacking attempts.: EVMs are stored in secure rooms with:Any unauthorized access would trigger alarms and requires the presence of authorized personnel and party representatives.: Each EVM has unique serial numbers, digital signatures, holographic seals, and key codes. During First Level Checking (FLC), these identifiers are verified and documented in the presence of party representatives. These details can be cross-referenced before polling begins to ensure authenticity.: EVMs are designed with electromagnetic shielding, meeting military-grade standards. They are immune to electromagnetic fields up to 6 Tesla, surpassing the strength of MRI machines. This ensures that external magnetic fields cannot alter the stored vote data.: EVMs feature large, clear symbols and party names, with audible beep confirmations for each vote. The Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail ( VVPAT ) provides a visual confirmation of the vote cast. Additionally, braille markings assist visually impaired voters.: EVMs are designed to allow only one vote per voter. The control unit enables voting only after the presiding officer presses the ""Ballot"" button, and there's a mandatory 5- second wait between votes. This mechanism ensures that each vote is recorded individually and prevents multiple voting without detection.: EVMs do not accept software updates post-manufacturing. The program is burned into the OTP chip, which cannot be modified once set. There are no external input ports, and maintenance is purely physical and mechanical, ensuring that no software alterations can be made.: EVMs have continuous self-diagnostic features and provide visual and audio indicators for any errors. If a malfunction is detected, the machine locks down to preserve vote data, and backup machines are immediately available to prevent disruptions.: EVMs have a robust battery system with a 48-hour backup and non-volatile memory that retains data without power. Redundant power systems ensure that even in case of battery failure, vote data remains intact.: No, the OTP chip cannot be reprogrammed and records each vote exactly as cast without any conditional logic. Security protocols are in place to prevent such alterations, and multiple layers of verification ensure the integrity of the voting process.: VVPAT provides a physical paper trail that voters can see and verify immediately after casting their vote. This paper record is stored securely and can be used for audits or recounts, adding an extra layer of transparency and trust in the electoral process.: EVMs are designed with multiple security features, including:These measures ensure that any attempt at tampering would be immediately detectable and void the machine's validity.: The display unit is purely output-only and has no input capabilities. It is hardwired to display information and cannot be used as an interface for programming or altering the machine’s operations.: EVMs are designed to operate in a wide range of temperatures (from -10°C to+55°C) and high humidity levels (up to 95%). They are also tested for resistance to heavy rain, ensuring reliability across diverse Indian climates.: The memory is encrypted using AES-256 and is physically secured within the machine. Tamper-evident seals cover the memory area, and any attempt to access the memory directly would damage the seals and be immediately detected, rendering the machine invalid for use.: Results are first recorded physically on EVMs and then transmitted through secure channels. Multiple copies of results are maintained, including the VVPAT paper trail, which can be used for cross-verification. This redundancy ensures that any attempt to alter results during transmission would be detected.: The process uses computerized random number generation, and the selection is conducted in the presence of representatives from all political parties. This ensures transparency and fairness in the sampling method.: The manufacturing process is overseen by multiple agencies, including independent security auditors. Components are verified at each stage, and the final assembled units undergo extensive testing by different teams to ensure there are no vulnerabilities or backdoors.: From a technical engineering perspective, the allegation fundamentally misunderstands EVM power architecture. The ""99%"" display is not a battery charge percentage but rather a voltage threshold indicator that shows ""99%"" whenever the battery voltage remains within the optimal operating range of 7.4V - 8.0V. This is purely an administrative feature to indicate proper functioning voltage levels. The EVMs use non-rechargeable alkaline batteries (7.5V/8V configuration) with vote data stored in non-volatile EEPROM memory, meaning vote storage and counting are completely independent of battery status. The power system is entirely isolated from the vote recording circuit, making it technically impossible for battery status to influence vote patterns or counting sequence. Furthermore, each EVM's data integrity is verifiable through VVPAT audit trails, regardless of power status. Therefore, any correlation between battery display readings and voting patterns is technically unfeasible given the EVM's core architecture and security protocols.Indian EVMs, particularly the M3 model combined with VVPAT, incorporate a multitude of security measures and safeguards to ensure the integrity and transparency of elections. Through rigorous testing, multiple layers of verification, and robust security protocols, these machines provide a reliable and trustworthy voting system.","The opposition has time and again raised concerns about the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in polling.

These demonstrations led to national highway blockades in Punjab's Phagwara, Sangrur, Moga, and Batala regions.Concurrently, Haryana agriculture minister Shyan Singh Rana dismissed the planned farmer's march to Delhi, saying they lack valid concerns.""They have no issues. The previous farmers' agitation had an issue- the three farm laws. Those three laws were later repealed by PM Narendra Modi and he even apologised to them. The farmers' agitation has caused losses to Punjab,"" Shyan Singh Rana informed reporters in Karnal.""Rice miller industries from Punjab moved to Bihar and Madhya Pradesh... We will not let anyone play with the law and order situation in Haryana...

Mum cops book EVM critic for 'false claims',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mum-cops-book-evm-critic-for-false-claims/articleshow/115877096.cms,"NEW DELHI: Acting on a complaint from the Maharashtra chief electoral officer (CEO), the Mumbai Cyber Police on Saturday registered an FIR against foreign-based EVM basher Syed Shuja in connection with a video showing him making ""false, baseless and unsubstantiated claims"" that he could hack and tamper EVMs in the recent state polls by isolating their frequency.Shuja was booked under section 318(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and clauses 43(g) and 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Shuja, who EC sources said is based in a ""third country"", was last in the news for having addressed a press conference in London on Jan 21, 2019, with a handkerchief covering his face as he made similar claims that EVMs could be hacked by isolating their frequency, and that the 2014 LS polls were rigged. He had, however, provided no proof in support of his shocking claims.There are reports that Shuja is in the US.EC had taken serious note of Shuja's mischievous claims at the London press event - where, interestingly, Congress's Kapil Sibal was present - timed months ahead of the 2019 LS polls. It had then directed the Delhi Police to file an FIR against him under Section 505(1)(b) of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with acts of public mischief through circulation of content that may cause fear or alarm in the public.Though the Delhi Police has, through the ministry of external affairs, repeatedly approached relevant authorities ""in the third country"" for help to investigate Shuja, there has been no forward movement on the other end. Sources in EC said while access to Shuja may be dependent on cooperation of a foreign govt, both the Delhi and Mumbai police will take all possible steps to identify and apprehend anyone within India who is in contact with individuals like Shuja or complicit in their malicious activities.""Such actions are a serious offence, and no one who is involved will be spared,"" a senior EC official told TOI.Regarding his latest video offering to hack EVMs in the Maharashtra polls for a hefty payment by isolating their frequency, which he claimed would alter the result, the Maharashtra CEO office clarified on X on Sunday that EVM being a standalone device, ""cannot be connected to any network including any WiFI or Bluetooth by any person whatsoever"". ""Therefore, question of manipulating EVMs does not arise. EVMs are completely tamper-proof,"" it said.Recalling that SC has time and again reposed faith in EVMs, the post on X also mentioned the FIR registered by the Delhi Police against Shuja in 2019 on EC's directions.Section 318(4) of BNS - under which Shuja has been booked - states that whoever cheats and dishonestly induces a person to be deceived to make, alter or destroy anything which is signed or sealed, shall be punished with imprisonment up to seven years, with a fine.","Mumbai Cyber Police on Saturday registered an FIR against foreign-based EVM basher Syed Shuja in connection with a video showing him making ""false, baseless and unsubstantiated claims"" Shuja was last in the news for having addressed a press conference in London on Jan 21, 2019, with a handkerchief covering his face as he made similar claims.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115877102,imgsize-60390,width-400,resizemode-4/115877102.jpg"
Health camps a tool for private hospitals to hike occupancy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/health-camps-a-tool-for-private-hospitals-to-hike-occupancy/articleshow/115875971.cms,"The practice of private hospitals organising medical camps to get more inpatients has come into focus with death of four patients in Ahmedabad following angioplasty which was deemed unnecessary. Often labelled as charitable or CSR activity, in reality, camps are marketing activities for private hospitals, including large corporate hospitals that are constantly trying to push up occupancy, say industry insiders.Average occupancy in most hospital groups is about 60-70%. Footfalls in camps are closely monitored by marketing departments with calculations of what percentage of camp attendance gets converted to inpatients. There are quarterly plans for how many camps or outreach clinics have to be organised in which locations and of what specialties. These camps are not only organised within the regions where the hospitals are located but also in other states, especially states seen as promising ""catchment areas"" such as Bengal and the North-East. While some tie up with local health facilities or diagnostic set ups to provide logistical support, others have their own agents who make local arrangements.""Hospital chains organise camps in the Andamans every week, despite the population being small. Most of these hospitals fly in super-specialists who do consultations and then refer patients back to the main hospitals for procedures. They aggressively target patients with heart, and bone and joint issues. A lot of valve replacement, stenting and knee replacements are being advised. Neurology and urology camps are also popular,"" said a doctor who did not want to be identified.In places with inadequate tertiary care facilities, the camps are advertised as an opportunity for consultation with ""eminent doctors"" who are ""flying in"" to provide ""world-class healthcare"" by conducting comprehensive health evaluation to provide personalised treatment plans .The bait is often free health check-up, a few free medicines or free consultations. In some camps, consultation charges have to be paid while registration is free. Tests that cost a few hundred rupees like blood sugar, HB and BP check, ECG, weight and BMI measurement are done in the name of detecting health problems early and many are referred for ""specialised treatment or surgery"", which could cost several thousands to a few lakh rupees, to the main hospital. ""There is no external audit on whether the procedures recommended are necessary or appropriate,"" said a doctor working for a corporate hospital.The marketing departments have access to the database of patients who attended the camp and their diagnosis to follow up with reminders via emails, messages and calls. They have the responsibility of modifying the offer if the patients seem unsure. The focus is on how to increase extraction from camps, and even a 15-20% conversion to inpatients is considered decent.",Private hospitals organise medical camps to get more inpatients.

He was given an injectable dose on Saturday evening for bacterial infection (Monocef and Beplex saline 100ml).""When asked about the reason behind the health deterioration of Shinde, Dr Karpe said, ""He travelled a lot in the last month and also worked on his farm, resulting in exertion. We have suggested he rest for the next two days due to weakness. CM Shinde started feeling ill from Friday night. He felt better on Saturday morning but again at noon he started having a fever. We have stationed an ambulance, physician, a surgeon, and a brother along with medicines equipped in the ambulance,"" added Dr Karpe.Meanwhile, former minister from Shiv Sena, Deepak Kesarkar, arrived at Dare Tamb village to meet CM Shinde on Saturday but had to return without meeting the CM after learning about his health condition.Earlier on Friday, the Shiv Sena chief left for his native place a day after meeting Union home minister Amit Shah at his residence in Delhi. Other Mahayuti allies, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, and Bharatiya Janata Party chief JP Nadda were also present at the meeting.","Eknath Shinde, caretaker chief minister of Maharashtra, has a respiratory tract infection and is having fever, an itchy throat along with weakness.

Srishti Tuli Air India pilot suicide: Mumbai Police probe Aditya Pundit's deleted WhatsApp chats and video calls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/air-india-pilot-suicide-mumbai-police-probe-aditya-pundits-deleted-whatsapp-chatsandvideocalls-srishti-tuli/articleshow/115804661.cms,"MUMBAI: The Andheri Court on Friday extended the police custody of Delhi resident Aditya Pandit (27) until Monday.Pandit was arrested by the Powai police in connection with the abetment of suicide case of Air India pilot Srishti Tuli (25), who was found dead at her rented house near Marol Police Quarters in Mumbai on November 25.The police sought an extension of Pandit’s custody to gather more evidence and retrieve deleted WhatsApp chats between him and Srishti from his mobile phone. Investigators believe the chats may provide crucial insights into the events leading to her death.According to the Powai police, Tuli had made a video call to Pandit shortly before taking her own life.Authorities said she died following an argument with Pandit.His police custody, which began four days ago, was extended based on his alleged failure to report Tuli's threats and his decision to enter her locked house without involving law enforcement.""Pandit's arrest stems from his failure to alert the police about Tuli's threats and his decision to access her locked residence without police involvement. His position as the last person in contact with the deceased has raised suspicion about his potential involvement,"" the police stated.Before Pandit left for Delhi, Tuli had reportedly threatened self-harm. When he ignored her warnings, she allegedly made her intentions clear during a video call.""Pandit was arrested after learning that he has concealed information by deleting communications with Tuli. When questioned about the deleted messages, he stated he had threatened self-harm if she died. Police are sceptical of his explanation and are working with forensic experts to recover the deleted content,"" a police officer said.Investigators also found 10-11 phone conversations and numerous missed calls from Tuli on Pandit’s phone during the time he claimed to be returning to stop her actions.""Pandit's mobile has been seized and sent to FSL to recover the deleted data,"" officials confirmed.Tuli, who lived near Marol Police Camp in Andheri (East), was found unresponsive in her home and was later pronounced dead at Seven Hills Hospital in Marol.Initial investigations suggest she was experiencing mental distress due to alleged harassment by Pandit, who had failed to clear pilot qualification exams.""After Tuli returned from work on Sunday, she argued with Pandit, who then left for Delhi around 1am. Following this, Tuli contacted him, expressing her intentions. Pandit reportedly returned to Mumbai, found her door locked, engaged a locksmith instead of calling the police, and discovered her unresponsive. He then took her to the hospital,"" the police added.",Delhi resident Aditya Pandit (27) was arrested by the Powai police in connection with the abetment of suicide case of Air India pilot Srishti Tuli.

23-hour ordeal: Many Indians stranded after Gulf Air flight’s emergency landing in Kuwait,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/many-indians-stranded-after-gulf-air-flights-emergency-landing-in-kuwait/articleshow/115872638.cms,"NEW DELHI: Several Indian passengers have been left stranded at Kuwait Airport after a Gulf Air Bahrain-Manchester flight (GF5) of Dec 1 was diverted there due to a technical reason. Since Indians are not eligible for visa on arrival (VoA) in Kuwait, they were not able to leave the airport and the Indian embassy there is trying to assist them. What has added to the stranded Indians’ woes is that a meeting of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Kuwait has meant that the airport hotel is not available. The embassy has managed to put them up in airport lounge.""Embassy has been informed by Gulf Air that the flight for stranded passengers from Kuwait to Manchester is tentatively scheduled at 3.30 am on Dec 2. This is being conveyed to all passengers by the Embassy team at the airport. Food and water is available for the stranded passengers at the lounges.,” The Indian embassy in Kuwait said on X (former Twitter) Sunday night.Gulf Air GF5 had taken off from Bahrain at 2.05 am on Dec 1 for Manchester where they were to land after 7.5 hours. However, a snag forced the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to instead land at Kuwait at 4.01 am (all timings local). Then the nightmare started for Indian travellers — who were travelling one-stop via Bahrain to the UK — on board this aircraft as many other foreign nationalities were eligible for VoA in Kuwait and were able to leave the airport while they got stranded there.Shivansh, a software engineer among the stranded passengers, said on X (former Twitter) almost six hours after the aircraft landed in Kuwait from his handle @shiv4nsh : “Reading (foreign minister S Jaishankar’s) Why Bharat Matters while getting stuck in Kuwait without any help. All British passport holders got their hotels sorted with VoA while Indian passport holders have been left stranded without any info, food, or any kind of help.”Sai Samrat Anandapu, anotther passenger Tweeted from his handle @SamratChintu: “I was traveling from Hyderabad to Manchester with a transit in Bahrain. Our flight started at 2.10 am, but after 1.5 hours the left engine caught fire, leading to an emergency landing in Kuwait City. We’ve been waiting for support for over six hours, but only British nationals and GCC residents have been accommodated, leaving us Indians without assistance. There are children and elderly among us, with no confirmation about our flight to Manchester. Please provide accommodation as we need to freshen up and attend to our daily needs.”The Indian embassy in Kuwait said on X (former Twitter) Sunday night: “Embassy had immediately taken up the matter with Gulf Air in Kuwait. A team from Embassy is at the airport to assist the passengers and coordinate with the airline. Passengers have been accommodated in 2 airport lounges. Efforts are being made accommodate passengers in airport hotel which is currently unavailable due to ongoing GCC Summit. It may be noted that Indian nationals do not fall under Visa on arrival facility in Kuwait. All government offices are closed today due to GCC Summit being hosted by Kuwait.”",Gulf Air GF5 had taken off from Bahrain at 2.05 am on Dec 1 for Manchester where they were to land after 7.5 hours.

Our common agenda is to find the missing person and it is very unfortunate that such an incident happened inside the Army campus,"" he said.Kamalbabu, who had been supervising work for a contractor with the Military Engineering Services (MES) at the Leimakhong military station, went missing on November 25. He had left his home in Imphal West at 9 am for work, but failed to return later that afternoon. His family reported his disappearance after attempts to contact him failed.

: The Saga of the

Mysore Interregnum

1761-1799

The History of India (V) c. 1550-1605

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar attended the launch of historian Vikram Sampath 's book Tipu Sultan at the India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Saturday.During his address at the event, Jaishankar described Tipu Sultan as a ""very complex figure in history."" ""Tipu Sultan is actually a very, very complex figure in history. On the one hand, he has the reputation as a key figure who resisted the British colonial control over India, and it is a fact that his defeat and death can be considered a turning point when it came to the fate of peninsular India,"" Jaishankar said.He also pointed out that in Tipu Sultan’s case, a ""particular narrative"" has been promoted over the years, which has largely focused on his anti-British stance while downplaying other dimensions of his rule.""History in all society is complicated, and the politics of the day often indulges in cherry-picking facts. To a considerable extent that has happened in the case of Tipu Sultan,"" he remarked. According to Jaishankar, this narrative focuses on the ""Tipu-English binary"" while excluding a broader and more nuanced understanding of his role in history.The EAM noted that the current political environment in India has allowed for ""alternative perspectives"" on historical figures like Tipu Sultan to emerge. He said, ""In the last decade, the changes in our political dispensation have encouraged the emergence of alternative perspectives and balanced accounts. We are no longer prisoners of a vote bank, nor is it politically incorrect to bring out inconvenient truths. There are many more subjects on which the same degree of objectivity is needed.""Jaishankar discussed the importance of studying history with an open mind and engaging in genuine debates. He emphasized that a pluralistic society and vibrant democracy require objective accounts of history. He suggested that much of India’s past has been edited to suit specific political or ideological purposes. ""How much of our past has been airbrushed, how awkward issues have been glossed over, how facts are tailored for regime convenience—these are basic questions which confront us all today,"" he said.Referring to Tipu Sultan’s actions in different regions, Jaishankar noted that opinions about him remain divided. While many remember him for resisting British colonial control, others have strong negative sentiments about his rule, particularly in regions like Mysore, Coorg, and Malabar.He acknowledged that Tipu Sultan’s resistance to the British was significant, saying, ""There can be no doubt that Tipu Sultan was fiercely and almost consistently anti-British. But how much of it was inherent and how much a result of their allying with his local rivals, that is difficult to distinguish.""The minister also highlighted Tipu Sultan’s alliances with foreign powers, which complicate a straightforward interpretation of his legacy. ""To counter British ambitions, Tipu Sultan had no hesitation in collaborating with the French and that makes a ‘straightforward anti-foreign narrative’ very difficult to assert,"" he said.Touching upon Tipu Sultan’s foreign policy, Jaishankar said Tipu reached out to the rulers of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Persia for support, often on the basis of shared religious ties. He noted that this reflects the historical context of the time, where the modern sense of nationhood was absent. ""Perhaps the truth is that the sense of nationhood, all of us have now, was simply not there then,"" he observed.Jaishankar praised Vikram Sampath’s book for providing a detailed and ""balanced"" account of Tipu Sultan’s life and the era he lived in. He said the book goes beyond being a simple biography, offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology, and diplomacy. ""To call Sampath's book a biography would be a serious understatement. It is something very much more, capturing the flavour of a fast-moving and complicated era but offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology and even diplomacy,"" he said.He also appreciated the challenges Sampath might have faced in presenting a more comprehensive view of Tipu Sultan, given the strong existing narratives. He emphasized that the book allows readers to make their own judgments by presenting a detailed context.Jaishankar concluded by reiterating the importance of objective historical accounts. He shared his perspective as someone who has experienced what he calls politically influenced historical narratives during his education. ""As a product myself of an institution that was at the centre of these politically driven endeavours, I could well appreciate the need to present an actual representation of history,"" he said.Jaishankar spoke about selective narratives at a time when, as part of the syllabus ""rationalization"" process, NCERT last year removed significant portions of Mughal history from its textbooks for Classes 7-12. As a result, Mughal history is now briefly covered in Class 7, touched upon in Class 8, omitted entirely in Classes 9 to 11, and included in a shortened form in Class 12.This reduction is not limited to school education. At the undergraduate level, Delhi University’s BA History Honours program has also revised its curriculum to exclude references to the Mughals. In the 2019-20 academic year, the syllabus for Semester 4 dropped the topic The Consolidation of Mughal Rule under Akbar from the course. This topic had previously covered Akbar’s military campaigns, administrative reforms, and responses to revolts and resistance."," External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar attended the launch of historian Vikram Sampath's book Tipu Sultan at the India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Saturday.

Bangladesh carriers cancel 3 daily flights as flyer count nosedives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-carriers-cancel-3-daily-flights-as-flyer-count-nosedives/articleshow/115854778.cms,"No. of B'desh-Kol flights down by half since July

KOLKATA: At least two daily flights between Kolkata and Dhaka and one between Kolkata and Chittagong have been cancelled by airlines operating between the two countries as passenger count continues to nosedive in the wake of continued unrest in Bangladesh, attacks on minorities and curbs on travel due to Indian visa restrictions.Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day. The country's private carrier, US-Bangla Airlines, has reduced the frequency to Dhaka from twice daily to once and has discontinued the flight to Chittagong.Indian carrier IndiGo still continues to operate its twice-daily schedule, but sources said the airline was closely following the situation in Dhaka. The dip in passenger loads over the past few months, which has further accentuated in recent days, was a cause for concern, they said.The number of flights from Kolkata to Dhaka/Chittagong has dipped from 125 in Sept to 97 in Nov. Consequently, the count of departing passengers has reduced from 15,479 in Sept to 12,747 in Nov. The number of arrivals to Kolkata from Bangladesh has dipped from 114 in Sept to 96 in Nov, resulting in a drop in passenger count from 12,540 in Sept to 10,121 now.Bangladeshi carriers have been the worst-hit due to the crisis in the country. Biman Bangladesh flights from Kolkata are down from 59 in July to 28 in Nov while US-Bangla Airlines has fared worse with flight departures down from 84 in July to 24 now.In contrast, IndiGo flight departures are down from 62 in July to 45 in Nov, while arrivals during this period are down from 64 in July to 44 now.While Bangladeshis who depend on Kolkata for both commerce and healthcare are majorly impacted, a section of the economy in Kolkata, particularly hotels, restaurants and hospitals that serve Bangladeshis, have been dealt a body blow. Hotel occupancy in the Marquis Street-Sudder Street belt is down to 20% while shops and restaurants in and around New Market have witnessed a 65%-70% slide in sales.""Tourism, both conventional and local, as well as business, are impacted by the ongoing turmoil there. For most middle-class Bangladeshis, India is a foreign country within reach for medical as well as religious tourism where affordability, food and language are not a barrier. Unless the situation gets resolved, everyone will feel the pinch,"" said Travel Agents' Association of India chairman (East) Anjani Dhanuka.","Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day.

'Madam is busy': When Najma Heptulla waited an hour to talk to Sonia Gandhi during call from Berlin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madam-is-busy-when-najma-heptulla-waited-an-hour-to-talk-to-sonia-gandhi-during-call-from-berlin/articleshow/115865129.cms,"Najma Heptulla and Sonia Gandhi (Picture credit: X/Agencies)

Former Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Najma Heptulla recounted waiting for an hour on an international call from Berlin to inform then-Congress president Sonia Gandhi about her election as the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) president in 1999, only to be told, “Madam is busy.”Heptulla writes in her autobiography In Pursuit of Democracy : Beyond Party Lines that she immediately informed then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after her election, and he was elated by the news. “When he heard the news, he was delighted—first, because the honor had come to India, and second, because it had come to an Indian Muslim woman. He said, ‘You come back, and we will celebrate.’” She also promptly connected with the vice president’s office, where the response was equally enthusiasticHowever, her efforts to share the milestone with Sonia Gandhi were met with frustration. “When I called the Congress president, her staff responded with, ‘Madam is busy.’ Despite explaining that the call was international, I was told, ‘Please hold the line.’ I waited for a full hour, but Sonia never came on the line to speak to me,” she writes.“I pointed out that I was calling from Berlin, an international call. The staffer simply said, ‘Please hold the line.’ I waited for a full hour, but Sonia never came on the line to speak to me,” Heptulla writes.She expressed her disappointment, saying, “After that call, I didn’t tell her anything. Before forwarding my name for the post of IPU president, I had sought her permission, and at the time, she gave her blessings.”Reflecting on the incident, she adds, “If every country, culture, and family has its special moments—events so important and personal that they transcend the normal flow of daily life—this was one such moment for me. But it left a sense of rejection in my psyche forever.”Heptulla claims this incident marked a turning point within the Congress party . She alleges that a “new coterie of inexperienced sycophants” began handling party affairs, demoralizing veteran members.She eventually left the Congress following reported differences with Sonia Gandhi and joined the BJP in 2004. After her IPU election, the Vajpayee government elevated her ministerial rank to cabinet level and allocated funds for IPU-related travel.Heptulla also criticised the Congress party’s communication style under Sonia Gandhi’s leadership, contrasting it with Indira Gandhi’s accessibility. “Indira Gandhi used to keep an open house. She was accessible to rank-and-file members,” she writes. In her view, junior staff under Sonia Gandhi restricted access, hampering party communication and contributing to its decline. She also notes that Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were not active in politics at the time.","Former Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Najma Heptulla recounted waiting for an hour on an international call from Berlin to inform then-Congress president Sonia Gandhi about her election as the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) president in 1999. “When I called the Congress president, her staff responded with, ‘Madam is busy.’ I waited for a full hour, but Sonia never came on the line to speak to me,” she writes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115866604,imgsize-1383840,width-400,resizemode-4/115866604.jpg"

However, instead of focusing on the ceremony, he’s engrossed in a game of Ludo with two friends.The casual scene—amidst the formalities of the wedding—shows the groom lost in the game on his phone with friends.The humorous image, which had the priest and photographer in the background, was shared on social media with the caption, “Bro has his own priorities”. The photo quickly became a meme, sparking a wave of reactions that brought laughter to thousands of users.One user jokingly commented, “Bro be like: Ludo khelte khelte socha shaadi kar lu”. Another user playfully added, “Kuch bhi ho jaye, Ludo rukna nhi chaiye (No matter what happens, Ludo should never stop).”This photo is not an isolated incident. Another video making waves on social media shows a groom checking trading charts while sitting in the mandap, seemingly more focused on his investment portfolio than on the vows being exchanged. While some netizens found the groom’s behavior amusing, others found it a bit too casual for such a significant moment.","A photo of a groom playing Ludo during a wedding has gone viral on social media.

She also responded to BJP accusations, which blamed former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the removal of the marshals starting in November 2023.Atishi clarified that Kejriwal had, in fact, opposed the removal, referencing a letter from October 2023, in which the CM instructed that the marshals should remain in service, and called for disciplinary action against officials who had withheld their salaries.She accused the LG of removing the marshals without regard for public safety, a decision she said was politically motivated and harmful to the welfare of the marshals and their families.BJP leaders in the assembly dismissed the AAP’s narrative, insisting that the removal of the marshals was carried out under Kejriwal’s direction, and now the AAP was merely playing politics with the issue of their reinstatement.Gupta sought answers from Atishi saying the AAP government deployed bus marshals and then removed them.BJP MLA Abhay Verma questioned the ruling party’s ability to resolve the issue, asking why the AAP government, in power for nearly a decade, had failed to bring back the marshals.Urban development minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, however, highlighted that the regularization of bus marshals fell under the jurisdiction of the LG, as it involved ""services"" and ""law and order"" matters, areas where the Delhi government has limited authority.","Delhi chief minister Atishi says Aam Aadmi Party would not field a candidate against BJP’s leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta.

He urged police forces to modernise and realign themselves with the vision of 'Viksit Bharat'.During the three-day conference, in-depth discussions were held on challenges to national security , including counter terrorism, Left-Wing Extremism, cybercrime, economic security, immigration, coastal security and narco-trafficking.

Senior advocate D S Naidu, citing urgency, said HC's order, ""pursuant to which the demolition has started today, has not been uploaded as of now"". He showed photographs of the civic body's demolition squad at the site. ""If the demolition exercise is still going on, the same shall be stopped forthwith,"" the SC judges directed.They issued a notice to BMC, posted the hearing on Dec 5 and sought a report from HC registrar general ""with regard to uploading of the [HC] order...""The special leave petition was filed in SC by Rajendra Gomai and family, occupants of the 4,500 sq ft property, which has structures on it.

But the judges rejected the submission, stating that by ""misreading and misrepresenting"" the May 2016 order, Gomais carried out further illegal construction and ""this...is clearly taking advantage of the status quo order...which is unconscionable.""

BJP flays Mehbooba for equating Bangla minorities with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-flays-mehbooba-for-equating-bangla-minorities-with-india/articleshow/115873749.cms,"JAMMU

: J&K BJP leaders Sunday demanded action against PDP president Mehbooba Mufti for her remark comparing the condition of minorities in Bangladesh with those in India, calling it “anti-national.”Addressing party workers recently in Jammu, Mehbooba asked people to stand up to counter BJP’s alleged attempts at polarisation and asked if there was any difference between Bangladesh and India.Reacting to violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal, Mehbooba drew parallels between the row over survey of the mosque there and the atrocities being committed against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.“Our Hindu brothers are facing oppression in Bangladesh. But what is the difference if we treat minorities here the same way? Ours is a great country, known worldwide for its secular character,” she said.Criticising Mehbooba’s statements, BJP leaders described them as “wrong and condemnable.”Former J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina told mediapersons that the J&K govt should take serious note of the “anti-national statement made by Mehbooba and her conspiracies.”BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh dismissed Mehbooba’s claim that the nation’s secular foundation is being shaken as “baseless,” saying it reflected her “ideological bankruptcy.”“Her comments are detached from reality,” he said, adding that she was engaged in divisive rhetoric, attributing it to her “frustration” over repeated electoral failures.",Mehbooba Mufti asked people to stand up to counter BJP’s alleged attempts at polarisation.

"Kuki-Zo youths shot multiple times, mostly on back in Manipur's Jiribram, reveals autopsy report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kuki-zo-youths-shot-multiple-times-mostly-on-back-in-manipurs-jiribram-reveals-autopsy-report/articleshow/115872930.cms,"Manipur violence

NEW DELHI: The 10 Kuki-Zo youths killed in an alleged confrontation with CRPF sustained multiple fatal bullet wounds, predominantly from behind, according to reports of post-mortem examination conducted at Silchar Medical College and Hospital (SMCH) in Assam. The PTI-accessed autopsy reports indicated no signs of torture apart from bullet injuries and their consequent effects.The youths, one of whom was a minor, were reportedly killed in a gunfight with security forces on November 11 near Borobekra police station in Manipur’s Jiribam district. Police claimed the deceased were militants who attacked the station and a nearby CRPF camp.The victims were identified as Ramneilien (29), Fimlien Kung Ngurte (31), Elvis Lalropei Zote (21), Lalthanei (22), Joseph Lalditum (19), Francis Lalzarlien (25), Roulneisang (30), Lalsiemlien Hmar (30), Henry Lalsanglien (25) and Robert Lalnuntluong (16). The post-mortem reports indicate most were wearing camouflage or khaki clothing. Six bodies arrived at SMCH on November 12, and four more, in early stages of decomposition, arrived on November 14. The reports estimate the time of death for the first group as 24-36 hours prior to examination, and 72-96 hours for the second group, except for Hmar, whose estimated time of death was 48-72 hours prior.Each body had multiple bullet entry and exit wounds. Some had over a dozen wounds. The reports, signed by teams of three doctors, noted bullets hit the victims all over their bodies, with most shots fired from behind. Four of the victime (Ngurte, Lalzarlien, Hmar, and Lalsanglien) were each missing an eye.The final cause of death remains pending, awaiting chemical analysis reports from the Directorate of Forensic Sciences in Guwahati.The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF), a Kuki-Zo organization, stated the funeral will be held in Churachandpur district on December 5. The ITLF had previously stated, ""The funeral of the Kuki-Zo youths would not be conducted till their post-mortem examination reports were handed over to the families.”The bodies were transported from Silchar to Churachandpur on November 16 and remain in the local morgue. The ITLF claims the deceased were village volunteers, while the Manipur government maintains they were militants. This incident occurs amidst ongoing ethnic violence between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, which has resulted in over 250 deaths and thousands displaced since May. The conflict emerged following a 'Tribal Solidarity March' opposing Meitei community's ST status demands. Meiteis comprise 53 per cent of Manipur's population, residing mainly in the Imphal Valley, whilst tribals constitute over 40 per cent, inhabiting hill districts.","The 10 Kuki-Zo youths sustained multiple fatal bullet wounds, predominantly from behind.

Unpacking India's fuming response at COP29: What really transpired?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unpacking-indias-fuming-response-at-cop29-what-really-transpired/articleshow/115872889.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the wee hours of November 24, while most people in India were fast asleep, a drama unfolded at a sprawling conference hall of the Olympic stadium in Azerbaijan's capital Baku. Diplomats from nearly 200 countries, civil society representatives and journalists had gathered to witness a decision that could determine the fate of climate action in the Global South. But what transpired was far from routine -- it was a moment of diplomatic brinkmanship that left many stunned and India's delegation fuming.As the president of this year's UN climate conference, Mukhtar Babayev, approached the centrepiece agenda item -- the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance -- India's Deputy Lead Negotiator Neelesh Sah rushed to COP29 Lead Negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev to convey that the country wants to make a statement before the adoption of the contentious decision.Around 2:30 am, without so much as a pause for objections or comments, Babayev hammered the gavel, declaring the USD 300 billion climate-finance package adopted. The move was so swift, it left delegates from many developing countries blinking in disbelief.Avantika Goswami, head of the Climate Change Programme at the Centre for Science and Environment , said it happened ""quite suddenly and unceremoniously"".""We were surprised because the last-known figure on the table -- USD 300 billion -- was far below the latest G77 compromise of USD 500 billion. We also knew that India was preparing to interject in the process. The fact that it was passed before any such objections were raised came as a surprise,"" she said.Journalists witnessing the drama unfold in the plenary room saw the entire Indian delegation leap to their feet, making a timeout gesture. Sah dashed over to Rafiyev, exchanged a few words and returned to his seat, panting.Meanwhile, Babayev passed the microphone to Cuba for a statement, followed by India, Bolivia, Nigeria and Malawi, who spoke on behalf of a group of 45 least-developed countries. In total, 49 countries objected to the deal. In the UNFCCC process, one objection is enough to block a decision.However, India had no intention of blocking the deal and its outburst was about more than just the money.Delivering India's statement, Chandni Raina, Adviser at the Department of Economic Affairs , described the manner in which the deal was adopted as ""unfair"" and ""stage-managed"".Raina was scathing about the new climate-finance package, calling the meagre USD 300 billion a year by 2035 ""too little and too distant"".She labelled the sum ""abysmally poor"", ""paltry"" and an ""optical illusion"" -- a far cry from the USD 1 trillion developing countries need every year to cope with the warming world.Raina flagged three major issues for India in the deal -- paragraphs 8a, 8c and 9 of the agreement.Para 8a: This suggests that the USD 300 billion will come from all sorts of sources -- public, private, bilateral, multilateral -- and not directly as public money from developed to developing countries. Developing countries have long demanded grants or grant-equivalent funding, not loans that pile on debt. Many poorer nations already spend up to 10 per cent of their GDP on servicing debt.Paras 8c and 9: These allow developing countries' contributions -- whether through their funding to multilateral climate finance (MDBs) or their own bilateral climate finance -- to be voluntarily counted towards the USD 300 billion goal. Essentially, Global South countries might end up footing their own climate bills -- hardly the spirit of climate justice.Raina called it a ""deflection"" of developed nations' responsibilities.Questions have been raised as to why India did not mention these issues at the heads-of-delegation meeting on Saturday or earlier.To be clear, India had already articulated its concerns throughout the two-week conference.From high-level dialogues on just transition, pre-2030 ambition, climate finance and adaptation finance to the Mitigation Work Programme and its national statement, India has consistently made its case, aligning with the group of Like-Minded Developing Countries.A former negotiator familiar with the backroom drama told PTI that India's 11th-hour objection was not a tantrum -- it was a plea for fairness.India wanted more discussion, especially since the text -- with actual numbers -- only came out a day before adoption.""India was shown a figure of USD 300 billion in closed-door meetings on Saturday (November 23), but public documents still listed it as USD 250 billion. Understandably, India was nonplussed,"" the former negotiator said.To make matters worse, the COP29 presidency did not share how other countries had reacted to the USD 300 billion figure. India wanted to raise all these points before the decision was finalised, but the presidency did not give it the chance, the former negotiator explained.Another former negotiator pointed out that India's statement in the plenary hinted at its desire for a proper discussion on all these issues.If India and others had spoken before the decision, it might have delayed the agreement. India's actions suggest that it was not trying to derail the deal entirely, the negotiator added.Meanwhile, a civil society member was baffled by how two of the most vulnerable groups to climate change -- the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) -- ended up accepting ""such a bad deal"" after staging a walkout just hours earlier. These groups had demanded USD 220 billion and USD 39 billion respectively from the total finance package.Most experts PTI spoke to believe that the shadow of the US presidential elections played a big role. ""Countries were scared into thinking that next year's deal would be even worse. They felt cornered into accepting this one,"" said the first negotiator.An observer added that Brazil, set to host COP30, wanted to avoid inheriting a mess, while heavyweights like China and Saudi Arabia were busy safeguarding their interests -- they did not want to be officially recognised as climate-finance contributors.As the world turns its focus to the next climate summit in Brazil, one question lingers -- can meaningful progress be made if such critical decisions are seen as skewed against those most vulnerable to climate change?","India's Deputy Lead Negotiator Neelesh Sah rushed to COP29 to convey that the country wants to make a statement before the adoption of the contentious decision. The move was so swift, it left delegates from many developing countries blinking in disbelief. India had no intention of blocking the deal and its outburst was about more than just the money.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115872929,imgsize-826041,width-400,resizemode-4/115872929.jpg"

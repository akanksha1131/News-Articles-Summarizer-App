PM Modi 's visit to New York, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.rump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff. The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska."" ""Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Putin’s trip to Alaska will be his first to the US in a decade. The last time Russia’s leader was in the country for a meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2015 with then-President Barack Obama.The announcement came just hours after Trump told reporters he planned to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine with Putin. The President expressed cautious optimism, saying he believes “we have a shot” at brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.The 80th session of the UNGA will open on September 9.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said on Tuesday that a journalist's news article or video is prima facie not an act endangering the unity and integrity of the country to invite a charge under Section 152 of BNS, the modified version of the 'sedition' offence under IPC Section 124A.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said this while protecting from arrest the editor of news website 'The Wire', Siddharth Varadarajan, and members of the 'Foundation of Independent Journalism' in an FIR registered by Assam Police on a complaint accusing the editor of writing seditious articles by reporting about the alleged loss of IAF jets during Operation Sindoor . The scribe said he wrote the report quoting India's defence personnel, including the country's military attache to Indonesia.The bench said, ""For writing articles or preparing news videos, should journalists get entangled in cases? Should it require arrests?""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the petition filed by the journalist challenging the validity of Section 152 is a camouflage to avoid accountability.Justice Kant said, ""We are not classifying journalists as a separate class. However, does an article pose an imminent threat to the unity and integrity of the country? It is an article, not like someone is smuggling illegal arms and ammunition into India.""On the petitioners' allegation that Section 152 does not define which acts constitute an offence under the provision, Justice Kant said, ""How can it be legislatively defined as to which all acts would constitute an offence of endangering the unity and integrity of the country? Law has to be applied to facts of each case to determine whether the charge under Section 152 is correct. Inviting the legislature to define what endangers national unity and integrity will be inviting danger. ""Appearing for petitioners, senior advocate Nithya Ramakrishnan said they have also challenged the validity of BNS Section 152, which is nothing but a refined version of the draconian Section 124A, the operation of which was virtually stayed by SC pending adjudication of its validity by a five-judge bench.The court did not accept her second line of argument that Section 152 was prone to misuse and abuse by police. ""Is potential abuse or misuse of a provision of law by authorities a valid ground to declare that provision of law unconstitutional? There is a vast difference between implementation of a law and power to legislate,"" Justice Bagchi said.Justice Kant's response was similar. ""Any good law, declared constitutional by SC, can be misused or abused by police authorities. Should that be a ground to declare the law unconstitutional? SC ruling in the Kedar Nath Singh (1962 case) continues to hold the field and in which SC had ruled that the crime of sedition is restricted to 'actual violence or incitement to violence' against the govt.""Senior advocate Ramakrishnan said that the word 'sedition' is not there in Section 152 but for all other purposes the intent of the provision is identical to Section 124A and is being increasingly used to harass journalists.The bench reluctantly agreed to tag this petition with a petition by S G Vombatkere, who has also challenged the validity of Section 152 and whose earlier petition challenging Section 124A is pending adjudication.","A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said this while protecting from arrest the editor of news website 'The Wire' The bench said, ""For writing articles or preparing news videos, should journalists get entangled in cases?

NEW DELHI: In a tense contest between two BJP colleagues, former Union minister and Saran MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy seemed to have gained an unassailable lead over another ex-Union minister Sanjeev Balyan in the polls for the post of secretary (administration) at Constitution Club of India. Rudy was steadily widening his margin when reports last came in late on Tuesday.What was once a low-profile election acquired exciting dimensions this year, drawing prominent netas from various parties to cast their votes, thanks to Baliyan being in the fray with open support of another prominent BJP face, Nishikant Dubey.The Saran MP, of course, held on to his core support base among BJP colleagues.Union ministers Amit Shah, J P Nadda, Piyush Goyal and Kiren Rijiju from BJP, along with Congress's Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, voted in the keenly contested election.Himachal Pradesh governor Shiv Pratap Shukla also turned up to cast his vote as the candidates lobbied intensively to rally supporters.Balyan's campaign had appeared to be growing in strength but a vigorous pitch for him by Dubey, a vocal critic of the Congress leadership led many from the opposition benches to develop an interest in the outcome of what had started as a BJP versus BJP affair. Rudy may have benefited from the twist, noted a keen watcher.Of the 1,295 current and former MPs eligible to vote, 679 cast their ballots in person, with an additional 38 postal ballots, totalling 707 votes - over 60% turnout.With a decisive lead, Rudy reacted by saying, ""When Congress leader Sonia ji arrived along with Kharge saheb, and from our party Amit Shah ji and Nadda saheb came, the true spirit of democracy was seen in the Constitution Club elections."" ""For the first time, people learned about an institution called the Constitution Club, a body of MPs and former MPs with history and dignity,"" Balyan said. ""The country now knows of its existence, and I hope MPs will engage more actively,"" he said. Rudy, blends urbanity with political savvy, having defeated opponents like Rabri Devi and Rohini Acharya in Saran in Lok Sabha elections. Balyan, from Uttar Pradesh, embodies rural grit and warmth, with strong ties within and beyond BJP.Congress's AP Jithender Reddy and Rajiv Shukla and DMK's Tiruchi Siva had been elected unopposed as treasurer, secretary (sports) and secretary (culture), respectively.","Rajiv Pratap Rudy seemed to have gained an unassailable lead over another ex- Union minister Sanjeev Balyan.

India Makes Stunning Russia Oil Move In Response To Trump Sanctions Threat | Details

EU sanctions impact on Nayara Energy

Sanctions fallout

History of Nayara Energy

Nayara Energy’s focus on domestic market

Nayara Energy, the Russia-backed Indian refinery, is facing a perfect storm - hit by European Union sanctions, the company currently faces multiple challenges! These include disrupted global shipping, domestic regulatory constraints, changes in leadership and concerns regarding digital infrastructure.For Nayara Energy, which is responsible for approximately 8% of India's refining capacity and 7% of its retail fuel station network, these difficulties are testing both the company's adaptability and its future planning.Nayara Energy operates India's second-largest private refinery, alongside its oil storage terminal, port facilities, infrastructure and a network exceeding 6,000 petrol stations, according to an ET report.Its ambitious growth trajectory now faces significant uncertainty.On July 18, the EU implemented its 18th sanctions package against Russia, with restrictions on fuel imports refined from Russian crude, reducing the Russian oil price cap to $47.6 per barrel from $60 and addressing the shadow fleet involved in transportation.The price cap becomes effective September 3. Additionally, US President Donald Trump has imposed 50% duties on Indian imports, alleging India's support for Moscow's Ukrainian campaign through oil purchases.Also Read | Donald Trump tariffs: How much will India’s fuel bill rise if it stops Russian crude oil imports & where would it buy from? Explained Despite avoiding direct sanctions, Nayara's substantial Russian ownership has resulted in progressive complications.Shortly after the latest EU sanctions were implemented, Alessandro Des Dorides stepped down as Nayara Energy's chief executive, with Sergey Denisov, a company veteran since 2017, taking the helm.On July 28, Nayara Energy faced a significant challenge when Microsoft blocked their access to data, tools and products, despite having valid paid licences. Although services were restored following legal action by Nayara, the incident highlighted the gravity of their situation.A trader with knowledge of the situation was quoted as saying, ""Nayara's troubles have just begun. It is not only barred from exporting refined products to Europe, but fearing penalties, shipping companies are pulling back from transporting its products. Insurers and trade finance providers are wary."" The source indicated this has limited the company's ability to service export markets in Europe, Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.According to Care Ratings' July assessment, exports represented 25-30% of Nayara's total revenue, with domestic Indian sales accounting for the remainder. Despite minimal direct EU exports, with most international sales occurring through traders serving various markets, Nayara is actively seeking alternative payment arrangements as EU sanctions loom. Reports suggest the company is looking to partner with a local bank to handle crude oil import payments and receive funds for refined fuel exports.Under the weight of sanctions, Rosneft has been unable to transfer profits from Nayara Energy in recent years. According to informed sources, this inability to move earnings from the company is considered a primary factor in its consideration to divest the Indian operation.The recent wave of sanctions has created additional obstacles to this process. Discussions have occurred with Indian business groups, with valuations exceeding $20 billion.In a parallel development, UCP Investment Group, a prominent Russian financial investment organisation, seeks to dispose of its Nayara Energy holding for more than $5 billion. This follows Trafigura's divestment of its 24.5% ownership to Hara Capital Sarl, a fully-owned subsidiary of Italian energy investment company Mareterra Group Holding, in January 2023. Industry experts suggest that sanctions could reduce Nayara's market value, potentially making it an appealing prospect for international investors.In August 2017, following the acquisition of Essar Oil's 20-mtpa Vadinar refinery (Gujarat) by a Rosneft-led consortium, the entity was rebranded as Nayara Energy. The name combines 'Naya' (Hindi for new) and 'Era', reflecting the shareholders' aspirations for the asset's future development.The establishment of Nayara coincided with significant reforms in India's petroleum sector, where the government's deregulation of fuel retail prices created equal opportunities for private retailers like Nayara to expand their network, according to the ET report.This liberalisation caused considerable anxiety among state-operated oil marketing companies, which had previously maintained a stronghold over fuel retailing. Their primary concern was the potential loss of market share to private entities such as Nayara and Reliance Industries, the report said.Also Read | India-US trade deal: With Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs looming, India reviews market access offers for US; three-pronged strategy to protect exporters Nayara has seen steady growth until it encountered difficulties from sanctions imposed by the United States and EU, aimed at targeting Russia following its Ukraine war. The company's oil and energy revenue has become particularly vulnerable.The acquisition of the Essar facility by Russia's state energy corporation and an international investor consortium comprising Trafigura and UCP Investment Group was valued at $12.9 billion. This represented Rosneft's most substantial overseas investment in India's refining industry, securing access to one of the world's rapidly expanding markets.Nayara Energy has been compelled to focus on domestic markets due to international constraints. Recently, the company approached government-owned refineries, proposing to sell them its export-designated petrol and diesel quantities to avoid stockpiling.The shift towards domestic sales provides temporary respite but affects profitability. European markets traditionally yielded higher returns compared to domestic sales. Competition within India, particularly from government-owned fuel retailers, restricts pricing autonomy and adaptability.Also Read | Explainer: Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs - will India budge on Russia crude oil trade? This situation emerged precisely when Nayara Energy was preparing for substantial expansion. The company had declared intentions to invest more than ₹70,000 crore in various sectors including petrochemicals, ethanol production facilities and retail infrastructure development. Since August 2017, it had already invested over ₹14,000 crore in Indian projects, encompassing refinery upgrades, a petrochemical facility and infrastructure developments.The sanctions now threaten to disrupt technical assistance from European technology providers, essential for refinery operations. The critical consideration remains whether Nayara can maintain its diversification strategy while its primary refining-export operations face challenges under western restrictions.","Nayara Energy operates India's second-largest private refinery, alongside its oil storage terminal, port facilities, infrastructure and a network exceeding 6,000 petrol stations. The EU implemented its 18th sanctions package against Russia, with restrictions on fuel imports refined from Russian crude. US President Donald Trump has imposed 50% duties on Indian imports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123215237,imgsize-83846,width-400,resizemode-4/123215237.jpg"

Here is what happened during the hearing

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, said that the exclusion of about 65 lakh voters from the draft electoral roll published on August 1 is illegal.

, appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, said that the exclusion of about 65 lakh voters from the draft electoral roll published on August 1 is illegal. However, the top court said that as per the rules, the persons excluded have to submit applications for inclusion, and it is only at this stage that anyone's objection will be considered.

Sibal argued that most of the population of Bihar does not posses the documents specified by the ECI as acceptable. “Bihar people don't have these documents, that's the point.”

Justice Kant said it was a “very sweeping argument” to suggest no one in Bihar possessed valid documents, noting Aadhaar and ration cards existed but could not be treated as definitive proof.

“Bihar is part of India. If they don't have them, other states won't either,” the top court said. “There must be something to prove you are a citizen of India… everybody possesses some certificate - you need it even to buy a SIM. OBC, SC, ST certificates.""

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, said that the poll body not published a list of names of the 65 lakh persons who have been deleted from the draft roll. He also accused the EC of not specifying who are dead or migrated persons.

""Today, what they have done is something mischievous. Till the 4th of August, the draft of the roll was searchable. After the 4th of August, the document is not searchable. They say, go and ask the Booth Level Agent of the political party. Why should I, as a citizen, not know from their document and should ask an agent of the political party?"" Bhushan said.

Meanwhile, appearing for the EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said an exercise of this nature was “bound to have some defects”, but errors could be corrected before the final roll is published on 30 September. Opposition leaders and civil society groups have petitioned against the EC’s June 24 decision.

Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said ""You cannot start by presumptively doubting the citizenship of 5 crore of voters (who are in the post-2003 roll). The presumption is that they are citizens unless established otherwise through a procedure in accordance with the law....If you declare 5 crore people to be not valid and give them 2.5 months.""

Political activist Yogendra Yadav, who addressed the court in person, questioned the data given by the poll panel and said instead of 7.9 crore voters there was total adult population of 8.18 crore and the design of SIR exercise was to delete the voters. ""They (EC) were not able to find any individual whose name was added and the booth level officers visited house to house for deletion of names,"" Yadav said, calling it a case of ""total disenfranchisement"".

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reiterated that it can set aside the results of the entire special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral bonds in poll-bound Bihar - in as late as September - if its illegality is established.While hearing a bunch of petitions against poll body's exercise, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymala Bagchi said that logjam over the exercise is largely due the ""trust deficit"" between the poll body and the opposition.The hearing will resume again on Wednesday.On July 29, the top court warned it would step in immediately if there was “mass exclusion” of voters.

‘Step Back on Humane Policy’ Rahul Gandhi Criticises SC Ruling on Stray Dog Relocation

On June 30, six-year-old Chhavi Sharma, known as Bittu, was bitten by a stray dog while walking to her aunt’s house in northwest Delhi’s Pooth Kalan. Her family says the dog attacked without provocation, leaving her bleeding on the doorstep. She was taken to Dr B R Ambedkar Hospital for anti-rabies treatment, but her health worsened in mid-July.On July 21, her first day back at school, she began vomiting, lost strength in her limbs, and stopped speaking. Four days later, just before she was due for her final vaccine dose, she died.For her family, the Supreme Court’s order on Monday to remove stray dogs from all Delhi localities and place them in shelters is not only a policy decision but also a form of justice.""We don't want even our enemies to go through what we underwent. With the Supreme Court's decision, we believe that our child's death has not gone in vain,"" said Krishna Devi, Chhavi’s aunt, as quoted by PTI.""I feel like my child is the change. I hope there are no more Chhavis, who are hurt elsewhere. Nobody should go through the cruel fate we underwent,"" she said.The Supreme Court described the stray dog situation in Delhi as “extremely grim” and directed the Delhi government and civic bodies to immediately start picking up stray dogs and keeping them in shelters.It also warned of strict action against anyone obstructing the process.Chhavi’s family said the order brought them some relief. ""We heard about the Supreme Court's verdict on TV. The first thing we felt was a sigh of relief. Now I hope they take these animals to places where they can't hurt us,"" Krishna Devi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.""Just like gaushalas (cowsheds) are built for cows, something must be built for these dogs. We are not fighting the animals; we just want them kept separate so they don't hurt us. And those who feed them should be made accountable — they feed them on the streets and leave, and these dogs form packs and chase children,"" she added.Another family in the city has also faced a similar incident. Dheeraj Ahuja, a resident of Ashok Vihar, said his seven-year-old son, who often fed stray dogs, was mauled by one in their neighbourhood.""We welcome this Supreme Court order. It is a great, though delayed, step. My son, who is in Class 7, had to take 10 injections. The child who once fed these dogs was brutally attacked,"" he said, as quoted by PTI.Ahuja also addressed those opposing the order. ""They should come forward, adopt these dogs and keep them in their homes. Our suffering is personal and we hope this is implemented strictly,"" he added.","Six-year-old Chhavi Sharma was bitten by a stray dog while walking to her aunt's house in northwest Delhi.

'Who Runs the House, You or Amit Shah?' Kharge Attacks Speaker In Rajya Sabha, Rijiju Responds

Prominent leaders of different parties, including Union ministers Amit Shah and J P Nadda of the BJP and Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress, voted on Tuesday in the keenly contested Constitution Club of India polls, as two seasoned ruling party members slug it out for a key position.Incumbent Secretary (Administration) Rajiv Pratap Rudy , a fifth-term Lok Sabha MP, is facing a spirited challenge to his nearly 25 years at the helm from fellow BJP leader Sanjeev Balyan , a two-term former Lok Sabha MP.Over 690 votes were cast out of the total electors of 1,295 current and former MPs, officials said, making it one of the highest turnouts for the election to the club's office-bearers.Rudy had a slight lead over Balyan after initial rounds, with results expected to be out late in the night.Several Union ministers, including Piyush Goyal and Kiren Rijiju, and governors like Shiv Pratap Shukla of Himachal Pradesh, voted as contestants lobbied intensively to rally their supporters.Rudy has been a dominant presence, winning several elections uncontested, before Baliyan, spurred by the support from some BJP leaders with Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey being the most visible campaigner, decided to test the Bihar leader's strength.The elections include 14 members vying for the position of 11 executive members.Both former Union ministers, Rudy and Baliyan, may be from the same party but present two contrasting personalities drawn from different social milieus.Rudy, a commercial pilot, is a suave and polished leader who is at home with social elites, mixing his urbane personality effortlessly with his background as a savvy parliamentarian who has got the better of the likes of Rabri Devi and her daughter Rohini Acharya in Lok Sabha elections from Saran.Baliyan, who is from western Uttar Pradesh, is a representative of rural sensibilities and grassroots ruggedness. Warm and upfront, he has his share of close friends in the BJP and outside.That Rudy is a Thakur and his rival a Jat has given the contest an expected caste angle, but personal ties and behind-the-scenes manoeuvring are likely to play a big role in the final outcome.While Rudy has listed the addition of numerous facilities to the club under his tenure to seek another term, Balyan is rooting for a change, claiming that the club should focus on catering to MPs and former MPs and not ""outsiders"" like IAS and IPS officers.The Lok Sabha Speaker is the ex-officio president of the club. But the Secretary plays a crucial role in the executive functioning of the facility.","Incumbent Secretary (Administration) Rajiv Pratap Rudy is facing a spirited challenge to his nearly 25 years at the helm from fellow BJP leader Sanjeev Balyan.

NEW DELHI: In a relief to owners facing the threat of their overage vehicles being impounded by city authorities, Supreme Court Tuesday directed no coercive action be taken against them and agreed to re-examine its 2018 order by which it had banned the plying of over 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles.The respite came after SG Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Delhi govt, appealed to a three-judge bench led by CJI Gavai to recall the order on the grounds it was causing hardships to citizens of Delhi and that pollution, contrary to assumption, is not directly related to the age of vehicles due to advancements in technology and use of BS VI emission norm.Also read: Delhi govt requests SC to review 2018 blanket ban affecting middle class the most In its application, govt said there was a need for a graded, balanced and technology-driven regime to handle vehicular pollution, and that instead of an age-based blanket ban, a scientific and data-driven framework should be developed that considers all relevant indicators to ascertain pollution by individual vehicles. It submitted such a policy would ensure not only the protection of the environment through the phasing out of polluting vehicles but also preserve the rights of responsible vehicle owners.A senior citizen and owner of a 2011 BMW car, apprehending impounding of his vehicle, also moved the court and his lawyer Charu Mathur contended that a complete ban on vehicles based on their age rather than fitness or compliance with emission norms was wrong and needed to be examined.The bench, also comprising Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria, after a brief hearing, agreed to examine their plea. ""Issue notice. Returnable in four weeks. In the meantime no coercive steps should be taken against the owners of (such) vehicles on the ground... List it after four weeks,"" it said.The 2018 SC order was not vigorously implemented by authorities and was done only last year, which led to public outcry, following which the drive to impound the vehicles was halted. This compelled govt to seek recall of the SC order.The govt in its application said, ""It is submitted that if the order of this court dated 29.10.2018 continues to operate, it will result in road worthy, non-polluting BS-VI vehicles also going off the roads in a matter of a few years without a scientific basis for the same. Further, it is respectfully submitted that there does not appear to be a scientific basis for mandating that even BS-IV vehicles which meet PUC norms should be taken off the roads in Delhi NCR. It is submitted that these are serious issues which may require a fresh scientific evaluation"".""It is respectfully submitted that the order passed by this court was originally passed as an emergency measure during a period when BS-IV emission standards were in force and the migration to BS-VI, which has much stricter and advanced norms, had not yet commenced,"" the govt said. ""However, it is submitted that to tackle the issue of pollution in NCR, a comprehensive policy is required which gives vehicle fitness based on the actual emission levels of an individual vehicle as per scientific methods rather than implementing a blanket ban based solely on the age of the vehicle,"" it said.",Supreme Court agrees to re-examine its 2018 order by which it had banned the plying of over 15-year-old petrol and 10- year-old diesel vehicles.

NEW DELHI: There is an exodus of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across the country, with as many as 429 resigning from 20 institutes from 2022 to 2024, data shared by the govt with Parliament has revealed. The govt was responding to a question on doctors leaving AIIMS for private jobs.The data showed the maximum number of doctors - 52 - resigned from AIIMS Delhi, which is the parent institution and the most prestigious of all AIIMS. It was followed by 38 resignations at AIIMS Rishikesh, 35 at AIIMS Raipur, 32 at AIIMS Bilaspur and 30 at AIIMS Mangalagiri. The resignations have come at a time when most AIIMS are struggling with a faculty/doctor crisis.Nearly one out of every three faculty positions was lying vacant across all 20 AIIMS, including Delhi AIIMS, the data showed. Recently, the govt told Parliament in response to another question that provision has been made for hiring on contract basis of retired faculty members - from Institutes of National Importance and govt medical colleges - at the level of professor, additional professor and associate professor in new AIIMS, up to 70 years.In addition to this, the govt said, a visiting faculty scheme has been formulated to allow professors, additional professors and associate professors who are holding academic positions in govt institutions within India or academic institutions outside India, to be visiting faculty in new AIIMS for teaching purposes. However, doctors say further action is needed to stop the brain drain.AIIMS Delhi has 1,306 sanctioned faculty positions. Of these, 462 (35%) are vacant. AIIMS Bhopal has 71 (23%) vacant faculty positions, while AIIMS Bhubaneswar has 103 (31%) vacant positions. The percentage of vacant faculty positions in other AIIMS also ranges between 20% and 35%.Many non-faculty positions, including those of nurses, OT technicians and other crucial staff are also lying vacant."" over the last few years, focus has shifted towards improving the services and often we receive complaints about the lack of 'protected time' to carry out research, which is an important reason for the brain drain,"" a senior doctor from AIIMS who recently joined the private sector said.The senior doctor added that salaries in the private sector are four to 10 times the salary offered at AIIMS.","There is an exodus of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across the country.

Their caution, sent in a letter on Tuesday to Union ministry of road transport and highways, came days after the Aug 5 flood in Dharali brought down massive debris from glacier-fed streams, washing away homes.Senior geologist Navin Juyal and environmentalist Hemant Dhyani, both members of the scrutiny committee for the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone's zonal master plan, had submitted a detailed report in Oct 2023 as sought by MoRTH. That survey mapped the upper Bhagirathi valley's most unstable slopes and proposed an alternate design that they said could keep the road functional without undermining slope stability. Juyal, a former senior scientist at Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, has since resigned from the high-powered committee overseeing the Char Dham project; Dhyani remains on it.The Aug 5 flood played out almost exactly as they had predicted.At Dharali, one cirque stream burst through, dragging tons of rock and soil into the valley. In Bhatwari, a highway stretch almost sunk - in a zone they had documented as sinking 12mm to 22mm annually.

An order to release the bail applicant was also issued to the jail authorities. But Halke's relief was short-lived as court staff contacted his lawyer to say that there had been a goof-up.Around 6.30pm on Aug 8, hours after the confusion started, Justice Rajesh Kumar Gupta of Gwalior bench recalled the erroneously printed orders mentioning Halke was to be freed on bail while his son Ashok would stay in jail. The father and son were arrested within two days of each other - on July 8 and 10, respectively. During a re-hearing Monday, the judge clarified a typo caused the mix-up.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju , highlighting West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's ""victim-blaming"" remark on the Durgapur gangrape case, singled out the ""illiberal gang"" for being conspicuously silent on the matter.While taking the authorities of a private medical college in Durgapur to task for the circumstances leading to the alleged gang rape of a student late on Friday, Mamata Banerjee said that allowing a girl to step out of a campus ""located in a forested area"" past midnight is ""shocking"".""How did they (the girl and a male friend) come out of the campus at 12.30 am? Wasn't it the responsibility of the college? I don't know why they were allowed to leave at that hour,"" she said in her first reaction to the crime involving the second-year MBBS student from Odisha.""Imagine, if this statement was made by a BJP Chief Minister! The whole echo-system and self declared liberal journalists (actually illiberal gang) would have created unbearable situation in the country [sic],"" said Union parliamentary minister Kiren Rijiju.CM Banerjee, who had to contend with a public uproar and a prolonged doctors' agitation after August 2024 rape-murder of a medical resident studying for her PG at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, said it isn't possible for cops to be present everywhere at all times of the day.She urged students from other states to be ""careful and not venture out of campuses in forested areas late at night"" since they might be unfamiliar with the local terrain.Mamata's remarks coincided with the arrest of three suspects in the Durgapur case. The survivor's male friend is being detained for further interrogation. ""No one (linked with the crime) will be spared,"" the CM said, adding, ""Cops are searching for everyone involved. All the guilty will be punished strictly.""A classmate of the survivor and another man have been detained for quizzing. Police identified the latter as Sheikh Nasiruddin, 24, whose motorcycle was allegedly used by the accused to flee.

Kerala makes venomous snakebites health priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-makes-venomous-snakebites-a-health-priority/articleshow/124514625.cms,"Kerala records 3,000 critical snakebite incidents annually

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala, second only to West Bengal in venomous snake diversity nationwide, has declared snakebite envenomation a disease of public health importance, requiring mandatory hospital reporting of cases, strengthening anti-venom supply chains and standardising treatment protocols.Kerala HC directed the state govt recently to make snakebite a notifiable disease within two months in accordance with a circular issued by Union health ministry in Nov 2024. The Sept 26 order came on two petitions filed in 2019 after a Class 5 student suffered a fatal snakebite at a govt school in Wayanad that year.Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are two other states that have declared snakebite envenomation a notifiable condition. In Kerala, its inclusion in the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme under Section 28(3) of the Kerala Public Health Act, 2023, makes it a structured health priority.The state records over 3,000 critical snakebite incidents annually. Between 8,000 and 12,000 people are admitted to govt hospitals each year for treatment of snakebites, according to reports from the National Health Mission.Official data from SARPA, the forest department's ""snake awareness, rescue and protection"" app, shows 334 snakebite deaths between 2017 and 2019, averaging 110 fatalities a year.The number of deaths dropped to 76 in 2020, 40 in 2021 and 42 in 2022.The classification empowers coordinated action between departments and improved medical response mechanisms. Clinical management and reporting will follow the National Centre for Disease Control's updated national guidelines for management of snakebite, published in 2022.Kerala's rural and agricultural regions face continued risk from venomous snakes. Apart from the Russell's viper, cobra, krait and saw-scaled viper, the venom of hump-nosed pit viper - unique to the Western Ghats - is linked to severe renal complications and underreported deaths, says a 2021 study in Journal of the Association of Physicians of India.WHO recognised snakebite envenomation as a Neglected Tropical Disease in 2017 and urged countries to halve related deaths and disabilities by 2030. Kerala's new classification aligns state health policy with WHO's global strategy.The state's SARPA platform connects citizens to certified rescuers, records verified incident data and provides guidance on safe first response. The initiative, which integrates trained snake handlers, emergency rescue teams and hospital alert systems, is believed to have driven the decline in fatalities in recent years.","Kerala HC directed the state govt recently to make snakebite a notifiable disease within two months.

DEHRADUN: In a significant development in animal classification, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has for the first time evaluated the Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) separately, suggesting that it may be classified as a distinct species within the Canis genus - a move that could elevate its global conservation priority.According to IUCN's global panel of canid experts, the Indian wolf population is estimated to be around 3,093 (2,877-3,310) across India and Pakistan, putting it in the ""vulnerable"" category on the Red List. The canid experts noted that the trend of decline in its population is mainly due to habitat loss and persecution.The Indian wolf represents one of the most ancient wolf lineages globally - having evolved in the subcontinent long before humans arrived. Unlike the tiger, which is found in 11 countries, this wolf's range is almost entirely restricted to India, with Pakistan having just about 10 to 20 left.""While tiger numbers are stabilising, the Indian wolf's population continues to decline since it lives largely outside protected areas and is exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and threats. This species urgently needs focused conservation efforts,"" said Bilal Habib, senior scientist at the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Commonly known as Gray wolf (Canis lupus), the 'genus' currently has seven species recognised by the IUCN. Ex-dean at WII, YV Jhala, said, ""With the inclusion of the Indian wolf, this will be the eighth recognised species of Canis genus."" The other seven species of Canis genus are Canis lupus (wolf), Canis latrans (coyote), Canis aureus (Golden jackal), Canis simensis (Ethiopian wolf), Canis familiaris (domestic dog), Canis rufus (red wolf) and Canis lupaster (African wolf).The IUCN assessment of Indian wolf reads, ""Analysis indicates that only 12.4% of the Indian wolf's distribution is encompassed within protected areas across India and Pakistan. Most of its population is found outside of designated protected areas, where they are not subject to formal protection or management efforts by governmental bodies. As a result, the majority of the population is directly exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and threats. Given current trends, threats are anticipated to persist and intensify in the coming decade...""On the recent incidents of man-wolf conflicts in UP, Jhala said, ""Removing the problematic ones expediently and professionally wins community support, hence it becomes even more important to conserve the species.""","The Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) may be classified as a distinct species within the Canis genus. The Indian wolf population is estimated to be around 3,093 (2,877-3,310) across India and Pakistan, putting it in the ""vulnerable"" category on the Red List.

"Ahead of Supreme Court order, Delhi split on green crackers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-supreme-court-order-delhi-split-on-green-crackers/articleshow/124514552.cms,".

Return of firecrackers? Why green activists are not bursting with joy

NEW DELHI: A mix of anticipation and anxiety has gripped Delhi with the Supreme Court hinting that it may allow the sale of green crackers in the city just a week before Diwali. The apex court is likely to deliver its verdict on Monday. While many residents welcomed the prospect of fireworks returning to the skies, calling it an essential part of festive celebrations, others expressed concern that weak enforcement could once again pave the way for regular, more polluting and noisier crackers - turning the city into a ""gas chamber and boom box"".When TOI visited several key markets, shopkeepers said they didn't have firecrackers - green or not - in stock, but many claimed that ""others are selling it"".The permission, likely to be granted, would bring back the bursting of crackers within the legal ambit for Diwali, Gurpurab and Christmas after five years. Green firecrackers are designed to emit 20-30% less particulate matter than conventional ones, but experts argue that they still release harmful pollutants and are difficult to regulate effectively. They warn that enforcement of such selective permissions could prove challenging, given Delhi's already strained pollution control mechanisms.SC last week reserved its order on the sale of green crackers after earlier, in Sept, allowing certified manufacturers to produce them in Delhi-NCR. Manufacturers welcomed the development, recalling how a complete ban during last Diwali led to widespread use of conventional fireworks despite restrictions. They argue that bringing green crackers back into the market could help formalise the trade and reduce illegal manufacturing.According to Rajeev Kumar Jain, a member of Delhi Fireworks Traders Association, the move could curb black marketing and encourage safer options. ""There's a reason the Chief Justice said that if they don't permit crackers, a mafia will be created. Those engaged in illegal work must face the law, but allowing green crackers gives people cleaner and safer choices. Like food has FSSAI certification and jewellery has hallmarking, firecrackers too can have checks and balances. The goal should be to offer people better alternatives rather than push them toward illegal and more harmful options,"" he said.Jain added that innovations have significantly improved the new range of green crackers, with 80-90% of the same varieties and effects - sky shots, chakris, showers - but with a modified composition that converts emissions into water vapour. ""There's huge demand across India, not just during Diwali. From Janto Dec, there are at least 20 festivals where fireworks are used, cutting across regions and religions. But only Diwali faces such scrutiny, which feels unfair,"" he said.However, environmentalists and health experts remain deeply sceptical. Activist Bhavreen Kandhari argued that even so-called green crackers are far from safe.""Science, economics and common sense all point to the same truth - there is nothing truly 'green' about green crackers. The CSIR-NEERI's own data shows only about a 30% drop in emissions, and that too under controlled lab conditions. In Delhi's winter, when pollution gets trapped under a blanket of cold air, that reduction becomes meaningless. A single night of fireworks can poison the air for days. Allowing crackers, green or otherwise, means asking the youngest and oldest among us to pay the price for nostalgia. Clean air is not a privilege - it's a constitutional right under Article 21,"" she said.Parents of young children echoed similar concerns. Neha G Jain, a mother of two aged two and nine, urged the court to prioritise public health over festivity. ""Children are already suffering from toxic air, battling asthma and lung disease. The so-called 'balanced approach' tilts toward manufacturers, not the vulnerable population of NCR. My children depend on nebulisers daily. The polluted air doesn't care whether a cracker is labelled 'green' or not - it harms them all the same. Diwali can be just as beautiful without crackers,"" she said.Experts also fear this Diwali could be more polluted than the last, given that air quality has already started dipping following the withdrawal of the monsoon. Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at think tank EnviroCatalysts, warned that allowing even green crackers could worsen the situation.""With the emission load from other sectors like transport, power, and construction likely to be higher this year, any relaxation on crackers - green or otherwise - will make matters worse. The city is already struggling with deteriorating air quality, and any added pollution will push it deeper into the severe category,"" he said.According to the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, green crackers are made by reducing the size of the shell, eliminating ash and using additives that act as dust suppressants. These crackers can be identified by a green CSIR-NEERI logo and encrypted QR codes on the packaging to ensure authenticity. However, a Delhi Technological University study in 2022 found that even green crackers release high concentrations of ultrafine particles which can easily penetrate deep into the lungs.",Supreme Court hints that it may allow sale of green crackers in Delhi just a week before Diwali. Green firecrackers are designed to emit 20-30% less particulate matter than conventional ones. But experts argue that they still release harmful pollutants and are difficult to regulate.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124514565,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-29.jpg"

GURGAON: A 21-year-old labourer died after being crushed under a pile of iron rods that fell from a trailer at a construction site near Ambience Mall on Saturday.According to police, the incident occurred around 4 pm in the DLF 3 area, where a private company is constructing a multi-storey building. Rohit, who was from Parwani Gauri village in UP's Bahraich, worked for the company. He was extricated from under the debris by fellow workers and rushed to a nearby hospital, but was declared dead.A senior officer said, ""No FIR has been registered as preliminary investigation suggests it was an accident. We talked to Rohit's relatives, who also work in the same company.""Rohit was sitting on the stack of iron rods loaded on the trailer, which was being transported to the basement of the site. A truck, filled with construction waste, was already stationed on the ramp leading to the basement. As the waste-laden vehicle moved forward, it collided with the trailer, causing the iron rods to slip and fall. Rohit lost balance and was crushed underneath.","A 21-year-old labourer died after being crushed under a pile of iron rods that fell from a trailer at a construction site.

Action spans five examination sessions

Exam transparency under scrutiny

11 foreign medical graduates also disqualified

In a significant disciplinary move, the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has cancelled the NEET PG results of 22 candidates for alleged use of unfair means in examinations conducted between 2021 and 2025. The action, announced through an official notification, includes 13 candidates from the NEET PG 2025 session alone.According to the NBEMS, the scorecards and results of all 22 candidates stand null and void. “Producing the said scorecard and/or result of NEET-PG of the respective session for any purposes, including but not limited to, employment, enrolment, registration, or admission to PG courses, shall be unlawful,” the board stated in its notice.The NBEMS further clarified that it will not be responsible for any admissions, employment, or registrations obtained using the cancelled results. “NBEMS disclaims any responsibility or liability arising from employment, admission, or enrolment based on the NEET PG result cancelled herein above,” it added.Of the 22 candidates whose results were invalidated, 13 appeared in NEET PG 2025, three in 2024, four in 2023, and one each in 2022 and 2021.The board’s Examination Ethics Committee took the decision after a detailed inquiry into malpractice incidents reported across multiple sessions.One candidate, Srusti Bommanahalli Rajanna, was disqualified following the disposal of Writ Petition No. 5785/2025 before the Karnataka High Court. The remaining 21 candidates were found guilty of using unfair means by the NBEMS ethics panel.This year’s NEET PG exam saw participation from over 2.42 lakh candidates, of whom 1,28,116 were declared qualified for admission to Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Surgery (MS), and PG Diploma courses. However, the counselling schedule for NEET PG 2025 is yet to be announced, as the exam remains under legal scrutiny over transparency concerns and a pending petition seeking the release of full question papers and answer keys.Alongside NEET PG candidates, the NBEMS has also cancelled the candidature of 11 students who appeared in the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) between 2021 and 2025. These candidates were similarly found to have used unfair means during the exam.The FMGE, which allows foreign-trained medical graduates to obtain a licence to practice in India, reported a sharp decline in pass percentage this year. The June 2025 session recorded a pass rate of 18.61%, down by nearly 11% points from the previous year. Out of 37,207 registered candidates, only 6,707 managed to qualify.The NBEMS has reiterated its commitment to maintaining the integrity of medical entrance and licensure examinations, warning that strict action will continue against any candidate found compromising the fairness of the assessment process.","The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has cancelled the NEET PG results of 22 candidates for alleged use of unfair means.

IPS Officer 'Suicide': Wife Seeks FIR Against Haryana DGP, Rohtak SP Over 'Harassment And Abetment'

Body taken to mortuary but autopsy put off

Pressure on Haryana governement to take action against DGP

CHANDIGARH: In the strongest commitment yet of action in the alleged suicide of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warned on Saturday that no one will be spared, “no matter how influential”.The CM’s statement came hours after Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya was removed from his post. Bijarniya has not been given any posting and will be attached to police HQ in Panchkula. Bijarniya and Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur were named in Puran Kumar’s suicide note and his wife IAS officer Amneet P Kumar’s complaint to policeas the alleged “harassers” who drove him to suicide.Amneet has refused to allow an autopsy of her husband’s body until action is taken against the DGP & SP. It has been nearly five days since Puran Kumar’s suicide. On Saturday evening, while addressing the BJP state executive in Panchkula, Saini began by offering condolences to the deceased IPS officer. He expressed solidarity with the IPS officer’s family and said: “Our governement will conduct a thorough investigation into this matter.” He urged the opposition not to play politics.Chandigarh police faced backlash from the family of the IPS officer when it tried to get an autopsy done on Saturday, leading DGP Sagarpreet Hooda to say that the postmortem would not be conducted until the family agreed, reports Pawan Tiwari.Wife Amneet’s brother Amit Rattan, an AAP MLA, alleged police shifted the body without notifying the kin. The body was moved to PGI mortuary, where a team was ready for an autopsy. However, the family’s objection forced police put it on hold. DGP Hooda, IG Pushpendra Kumar & SSP Kanwardeep Kaur went to Amneet to get her nod, but she refused.Amneet P Kumar was a member of Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation on an official tour of Japan when her husband, Y Puran Kumar, allegedly shot himself dead. She flew home immediately. On returning from Japan, CM Saini had called on Amneet at her Chandigarh residence.During the meeting, Amneet had handed him a two-page letter seeking justice and protection for her family and action against those named in the suicide note, especially DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, for abetting her husband’s “suicide”. Two days later, on Saturday, Haryana governement removed Bijarniya and replaced him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria. This was the first action initiated by governement. Pressure is mounting on the governement to take action against Kapur as well. There is intense speculation that he may be asked to go on leave, but till Saturday evening there was no word from governement.The question in bureaucratic circles is whether governement will take action against the DGP. A section of Haryana IAS officers has also demanded Kapur’s arrest. Amneet said a “false FIR” registered in Rohtak was the “trigger point” for her husband’s “suicide”. Bijarniya was the supervising officer of the case in which head constable Sushil Kumar, PSO to Puran Kumar when he was IG Rohtak, was arrested on allegations of extortion. Police claimed Sushil had “confessed” during questioning that he had demanded money on behalf of Puran Kumar.A day after the IPS officer died, Bijarniya said, “The complainant provided audio-visual evidence which led to Sushil’s arrest. He was taken into custody for two days and confessed to demanding on behalf of Kumar. We were in the process of further investigation when we came to know about this incident (Kumar’s alleged suicide).” Kumar was shifted out as IGP (Rohtak range) on September 29. Sushil was arrested soon after. A day after the FIR was lodged, Kumar allegedly died by suicide. State chief secretary Anurag Rastogi and ACS-home Sumita Misra spent almost the entire Friday trying to pacify Amneet, but she stuck to her stand.",Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warns that no one will be spared.

KOLKATA: A 48-year-old YouTuber from Bengal with almost 4.3 million followers and his teenage son were arrested in North 24 Parganas district’s Haroa on Sunday for allegedly raping a 15-year- old girl after luring her with the promise of featuring her in comedy and dance reels.The survivor’s father is a cop attached to Kolkata Police. Basirhat sub-divisional court remanded Arabindu Mondal in police custody for five days and sent his son to a juvenile offenders’ home. Investigators said father and son approached the Class 9 student several months ago with an offer to make shorts with her.The girl went with them to various locations for shoots, and the two allegedly filmed and photographed her secretly when she was changing. “The duo used this to blackmail her into silence after repeated sexual assault. Arabindu’s son even put vermillion on the part of her hair to suggest he would marry her, then raped her,” a police officer said.Sources said the girl’s family, who knew and trusted Arabindu, had no inkling of what she was being subjected to until she confided in them. The suspects were arrested immediately after Haroa police station registered an FIR under the Pocso Act on Sunday and recorded the survivor’s statement. Investigators seized phones, cameras and other devices from Arabindu, who runs two YouTube channels —one for videos and shorts of him performing skits, and another where he dances to Hindi and Bengali songs.","The survivor’s father is a cop attached to Kolkata Police.

After Germany, Canada Aims To Lure Indian Tech Talent Amid Trump’s H-1B Visa Fee Hike

NEW DELHI: Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand landed in New Delhi on Sunday evening for a three-day visit aimed at boosting diplomatic and economic ties with India, as part of her broader tour of the Indo-Pacific region that includes Singapore and China.During her stay in the national capital, Anand will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal. The meetings, scheduled for Monday, are expected to focus on advancing a framework for strategic cooperation covering trade diversification, energy transformation, and security. She will later travel to Mumbai to meet Indian and Canadian business leaders working to deepen investment and job creation across both economies.Announcing the trip earlier, the Canadian government said the visit was part of efforts to “advance bilateral relations and cooperation” with key Indo-Pacific partners. “For Canada to be strong at home, we need strong, stable partnerships abroad. I am building bridges and increasing cooperation with India, Singapore and China,” Anand said in a statement. “In line with Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy, I will be working to advance efforts to position Canada as a trusted, reliable partner of choice for Indo-Pacific countries and their economies.The ministry of external affairs confirmed Anand’s official schedule, with meetings set at Hyderabad House and Vanijya Bhavan before her departure for Mumbai on Monday evening.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal welcomed Anand on her first official visit to India, describing it as an opportunity to “build on the positive momentum in India-Canada relations by revitalising our bilateral mechanisms, deepening economic cooperation, and further strengthening the enduring people-to-people ties that anchor our partnership.”The visit comes amid cautious efforts by both sides to normalise engagement following a period of strained relations last year. Canada and India share more than 75 years of diplomatic ties, underpinned by strong community and business links. Two-way trade between the countries stood at $33.9 billion in 2024, with Canada’s exports to India totalling $5.3 billion, Ottawa said.Anand will continue her tour with stops in Singapore, marking 60 years of diplomatic relations, and in China, where she will meet foreign minister Wang Yi to mark 55 years of Canada-China diplomatic ties.","Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand landed in New Delhi on Sunday evening for a three-day visit.

Congress questions 'respect' for allies



Weeks of negotiation



NEW DELHI: The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has finalised its seat-sharing for the upcoming assembly elections, after days of intense negotiations among allies.After earlier demanding 15 seats for his party, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief and Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi struck a somewhat contradictory tone following the seat-sharing announcement. While he expressed satisfaction with the six seats allotted to HAM(S), he also suggested that the NDA had undervalued his party and warned that such decisions could have repercussions within the alliance.""What the high command decided, we accept, but by giving six seats, they have undervalued us, it may have repercussions in NDA,"" he said.""In Parliament, we were given one seat, still we were happy. Here, we have been given six seats, and we respect the decision of the leadership.""""We are satisfied with what we have been allotted and we have no complaints,"" he added.Prior to the announcement, all eyes were on Chirag Paswan's LJP (RV), Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi led HAM(S). While Chirag made a strong pitch for a larger share by leveraging his party’s 100% strike rate in Bihar during the recent Lok Sabha elections, Manjhi sought dignity and recognition, reportedly demanding at least 15 seats to maintain HAM(S)’s previous strike rate from the 2020 Assembly polls.The final seat allocation was announced by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan was: BJP and Janata Dal (United) will contest on 101 seats each, while Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) will field candidates on 29 seats. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) will contest six seats each.Congress latched onto the seat-sharing announcement criticising NDA's 'treatment' of smaller allies.“What has Manjhi ji been saying over the past 15 days? His community was allocated 6 seats in the NDA. Upendra Kushwaha got 6 seats, indicating NDA assigned this many to the Kushwaha community. Does this mean the Kushwaha community is worth only 6 seats in Bihar?” Congress leader Manoj Kumar asked.Kumar further questioned if Chirag Paswan, who reportedly sought 40 seats, was truly respected with 29. Accusing the NDA of undermining key caste groups, he claimed the alliance had been “preparing to deal with” its allies rather than honouring them.""This was done because preparations were underway in the NDA to deal with these people... Jitan Ram Manjhi asked for respect, so did he receive it with 6 seats?"" he questioned.The seat-sharing announcement followed intense parleys in New Delhi over the weekend, involving top NDA figures including BJP president JP Nadda, Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, and Bihar leaders such as deputy CM Samrat Choudhary and state BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal.While BJP has sacrificed some seats (down from 110 in 2020), it seems to have emerged as the dominant partner in terms of influence, evident in how it brokered peace among allies and ensured cohesion ahead of the two-phase elections scheduled for November 6 and 11. Vote counting will take place on November 14.On the other side of the political aisle, the INDIA bloc led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is yet to finalise its seat-sharing formula. RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, his son Tejashwi Yadav, and wife Rabri Devi have travelled to Delhi amid reports of tension with the Congress, which is pushing to contest close to 70 seats—similar to its 2020 tally, when it won 19.","The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has finalised its seat- sharing for the upcoming assembly elections.

Centre has no plan to raise ‘creamy layer’ income cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-has-no-plan-to-raise-creamy-layer-income-cap/articleshow/124511990.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Centre has made it clear that it has no plan to raise the income ceiling for ‘creamy layer’ for OBC reservations, though the last revision took place eight years ago and is now twice overdue. There is at present an annual income bar of Rs 8 lakh for the purpose.An OBC family that earns more than the prescribed ceiling is ineligible for quotas in public education and employment. The view in government is that an upward hike would cater to a small segment of OBCs but end up making the competition difficult for poorer OBC segments. A lower ceiling of eligibility leads to greater exclusion of the better-off OBCs and works to the advantage of the financially weaker ones competing for a piece of the same quota pie.According to the norm, income ceiling should be revised every three years to factor in inflation, so that the economic criterion for quota eligibility, as defined by the ‘creamy layer’, does not become regressive and hurt the backward classes. The ceiling was last revised in late September 2017 from Rs 6 lakh to the existing Rs 8 lakh and was due for a revision in October 2020. It was to be revised again in 2023, but govt has refused to move ahead on the issue.The parliamentary Committee on Welfare of OBCs, headed by BJP MP Ganesh Singh, in its 7th report, had impressed on department of personnel & training and the social justice ministry the need for a revision of the income ceiling.While central govt in February 2020 did initiate a Cabinet proposal to hike income ceiling from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh, the issue kicked up a controversy as the social justice ministry sought an overhaul of the norms to include “salary” in the computation of “income”. According to the 1993 OM that governs “creamy layer” and also defines “income”, “salary and agricultural income” are not included in the calculation, and only “income from other sources” forms part of the “total income”.The row forced govt to put the proposal in deep freeze. Since then, there have been demands that govt decouple the two proposals — on overhauling the definition of “income” and revising the income ceiling to Rs 12 lakh — and move on just the latter proposal. But the social justice ministry refused to do so, calling it a reform package.","An OBC family that earns more than the prescribed ceiling is ineligible for quotas in public education and employment.

Taliban's Diplomatic Signal From Darul Uloom Deoband: Muttaqi Says India-Afghan Ties Look ‘Bright’

SRINAGAR: Accused of promoting “land jihad” through her proposed land regularisation bill, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti struck back Sunday — charging BJP with “embracing the Taliban” while allegedly branding Indian Muslims as extremists.“In the garb of accusing people of waging ‘jihad’, Muslims were lynched and demonised. Yet today, this government salutes the Taliban ,” she told supporters at Eidgah in Srinagar. She accused BJP-led Union government of engaging with the same Taliban it once branded terrorists.“BJP once wanted to lock Darul Uloom Deoband, now takes Afghan ministers there to shower them with flowers. If it can talk to the Taliban, why can’t it talk to its own people in J&K?”Her remarks came days after the BJP’s J&K unit described PDP’s proposed J&K Land Rights and Regularisation Bill, 2025 as an act of “land jihad and legislative jihad”.PDP’s draft legislation, unveiled by Mehbooba on Oct 8, seeks to regularise land holdings of people and institutions in continuous possession for more than 30 years. It also aims to prevent arbitrary evictions and ensure ownership security — provisions BJP claims could legitimise alleged illegal encroachments.Taking to social media, Mehbooba alleged that under slogans such as “love jihad”, “land jihad”, “vote jihad”, and “cow jihad”, BJP has been targeting Muslims and vilifying an entire community.“India, which calls itself the mother of democracy, is now embracing the Taliban — the father of jihad — under BJP rule,” she wrote.Mehbooba cited India’s recent outreach to Afghanistan, including educational scholarships for Afghan students, as evidence of what she called government's “contradictory” approach. “While maintaining good relations with Afghanistan may be strategically important, India’s own Muslim population — who have contributed to the country’s identity and progress — are being deprived of rights and opportunities,” she said.She urged government to focus on dialogue within J&K. “Building international relations is important, but peace and harmony must begin at home,” Mehbooba said.BJP has yet to respond officially to her latest remarks, but party functionaries have earlier said the proposed bill is an attempt to “legitimise illegal occupations under the guise of reform”.","PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti accuses BJP of 'embracing the Taliban' She accuses BJP- led Union government of engaging with the same Taliban it once branded terrorists.

NASHIK: A half-hour trek uphill, a line of women waiting in the midday heat for an OTP that rarely arrives. Their eyes fixed on a phone tied to a tree - praying for a single bar of signal. Digital welfare dream meets patchy network reality in the tribal heartland of Maharashtra's Nandurbar district as hundreds of beneficiaries are trying to complete the state-mandated e-KYC process to keep receiving their monthly Ladki Bahin Yojana payout.In Kharde Khurd village of Dhadgaon taluka, women walk nearly 30 minutes uphill to find a patch of signal. Over 500 beneficiaries from the Bhamane group gram panchayat and Kharde Khurd are forced to wait in the sun, hoping the phone - secured on a tree - will connect to a network, often from across the border in Gujarat or MP. Success rate: below 5%.We've set up a camp here, this is the only place where the mobile catches data,"" said Rakesh Pawara, co-founder of Ulgulan Foundation, an NGO. ""But the verification fails most of the time.""State govt's decision to make e-KYC mandatory has left beneficiaries in remote areas scrambling. Websites load slowly, OTPs take ages, and the Aadhaar-linked verification process times out repeatedly.""Out of more than 100 women trying, only five or 10 get through,"" said a volunteer at the site. For women like Usha Pawara, each attempt is an ordeal. ""To reach the taluka office in Dhadgaon, we trek and then pay Rs 300 for transport. It's not possible for us,"" she said.Deputy CM Ajit Pawar reiterated Friday that the e-KYC is non-negotiable. ""Only verified beneficiaries will receive funds,"" he told reporters in Pune. ""I know there are difficulties, but there is no alternative. The deadline can be extended if needed, but completion is mandatory."" The current cut-off is Nov 15.The directive follows growing frustration across rural Maharashtra - OTP failures, patchy internet, and confusion over cases involving divorced or deceased family members. ""No clarity exists on what to do in such cases. These are genuine concerns,"" an NGO worker said.Dhadgaon tehsildar Dnyaneshwar Sapkale admitted the difficulties. ""Mobile towers came up four-five months ago, but connectivity is still weak. We've asked operators to fix the issue.

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh government Saturday restored Y-category security cover for Samajwadi Party veteran and former cabinet minister Azam Khan, who walked out of Sitapur district jail on September 23 on bail after spending nearly two years behind bars in connection with multiple criminal cases lodged against him.Khan's Y-category security had been withdrawn after his conviction by a court and subsequent disqualification from the state assembly. Although the protection was briefly reinstated later, it was again removed when he was sent to Sitapur jail.With a steady flow of visitors thronging his residence after his recent release, authorities reviewed and restored his security cover yet again in view of potential law and order concerns, considering Khan's political influence and high-profile status in Rampur, said sources.Following formal orders to reinstate his protection detail, security personnel and gunners assigned to Khan resumed duty Saturday, official sources said. Khan's security was enhanced with a Gypsy vehicle and seven armed personnel deployed for his protection. Four guards were assigned to safeguard his residence, while three personnel will always stay with him.","Khan's Y-category security had been withdrawn after his conviction by a court and subsequent disqualification from the state assembly.

Maharashtra specifies minimum size for fish that can be sold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-specifies-minimum-size-for-fish-that-can-be-sold/articleshow/124512313.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: In a move to arrest netting of juvenile fish that has been adversely affecting their reproduction and eventually depleting the state’s annual catch, Maharashtra government, with the help of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, has officially decided on length as a criterion for fish to be caught or netted for selling in market yards.Catching a fish that is not fully grown and does not attain a minimum legal size (MLS) as decided by the state will now attract action from the fisheries department. For example, the state’s official fish, silver pomfret, and bangda (Indian mackerel) must be 14cm long.Similarly, a prawn should be 9cm long. The length of Bombay duck should be 18cm whereas for surmai, MLS is 37cm. Maharashtra is the second state after Kerala to introduce the fish length criteria.Sources said a stricter ban on juvenile fishing during the recent monsoon led to a sudden rise in the overall catch during the post-monsoon season, prompting the administration to take the decision. “This is because it gave fish enough time to grow and reproduce, eventually making them flourish. Even stocks have improved,” said a senior fisheries official. Sources said in the premonsoon period this year, the state received 995 tonnes of pomfret stock.However, after five months of total control on fishing, the post-monsoon stock has gone up by over four times, with average length much more than what has been decided. “So, the earlier Rs 11 crore business between March and May now stands at over Rs 350 crore and counting,” a source added. Recently, state minister of fisheries and ports Nitesh Rane chaired a review meeting on MLS of fish and the ongoing conservation measures to curb juvenile fishing of Indian silver pomfret (Pampus candidus).Rane emphasised on the need for a large-scale awareness and compliance campaign to ensure the effective implementation of MLS norms, which, he said, were also vital for the sustainability of the species and the livelihood of the fishing community. A poster on sizes of various fish types was released with an aim to create awareness among fishers, traders, and coastal communities about conserving juvenile fish and adhering to MLS guidelines for long-term fisheries sustainability, said an official.","Maharashtra government has officially decided on length as a criterion for fish to be caught or netted for selling in market yards.

Bihar Elections: NDA Announces Seat Sharing Deal; BJP, JDU Get 101 Seats Each; LJP(R) Bags 29 Seats

PATNA: Barely five days left for the close of nominations for the first phase of Bihar assembly polls, a seat-sharing deal continued to elude the opposition INDIA bloc on Sunday as RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav reached New Delhi in connection with a case of alleged irregularities in the award of IRCTC contracts during the former’s tenure as railway minister.The duo, along with former CM Rabri Devi and others, are scheduled to appear before the court on Monday, when the order on framing of charges is likely to be pronounced. The court appearance comes amid efforts to finalise seat-sharing among the INDIA bloc allies, which include Congress , the Left and the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). Tejashwi said the visit to the national capital was solely because of the court summons.Lalu, however, maintained that talks on seat-sharing were still underway. Sources said the issue is stuck as the Congress is unwilling to settle for fewer than 60 seats, while RJD is equally reluctant to concede. In the 2020 assembly elections, Congress contested 70 seats but won only 19, with a strike rate of 27.14%, a key reason why RJD is hesitant to spare many seats. Sources added that Congress became firm in its demand after witnessing large crowds during the fortnightlong Voter Adhikar Yatra last month, which was supported by all INDIA bloc constituents, including RJD and the Left.“The deal has almost been finalised and will be announced soon, as none of us wants to spoil the momentum created by the yatra. But the announcement can happen only after Monday,” a top RJD source said. Former Bihar Congress president Akhilesh Prasad Singh said, “The seat allocation is almost done, but at the last moment, some difficulties arise in all parties. These are there in the NDA as well and here too. Everything will be announced in 1-2 days. ”The VIP has emerged as another challenge for RJD as it has been demanding a significant number of seats and insisting that party chief Mukesh Sahani be named as the deputy CM face. Sources said while RJD is willing to allocate some 15-18 seats to the VIP, it is not prepared to make any commitment on the deputy CM post. Sahani posted on X on Saturday, promising to form a “govt” in Bihar where each community will receive “justice and dignity,” without mentioning the Mahagathbandhan or INDIA bloc.He later posted another message asserting that the “Grand Alliance is united” and stating, “We will write a new story of development and equality in Bihar along with the ideology of social justice of the respected Lalu Prasad.” Meanwhile, in a curious twist, Tejashwi held a meeting with All India Pan Mahasangh president I P Gupta on Saturday evening. The Pan community holds a significant vote share in Bihar and analysts say the move could be intended at countering the aggressive approach of Sahani.The delay in seat-sharing is causing frustration among the alliance partners, as only five days remain before the close of nominations for the first phase of elections to be held on November 6. The last date for filing nomination papers is October 17.","RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav reached New Delhi in connection with a case of alleged irregularities in the award of IRCTC contracts.

Omar Abdullah vacated Budgam after retaining Ganderbal, and BJP legislator Davinder Singh Rana, who represented Nagrota, died in October 2024.The PCC chief said the party has also written to the chief minister Omar Abdullah explaining the party’s stance on the RS polls. “He advised us to forward the letter to Dr Farooq Abdullah, which we did, but there has been no response so far,” Karra said.A senior Congress leader said the ruling NC is trying to please the BJP by ensuring there is no Congress candidate in the Rajya Sabha polls.However, Nasir Aslam Wani, advisor to the CM, said NC has been in discussions with Congress for many days, claiming that the Congress was in a strong position to seat four. “NC has been fighting BJP all along.

NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7. In an eight-page note reportedly left behind, he named eight senior officers, including DGP Kapur and former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, accusing them of harassment and tarnishing his image. The note also mentioned caste-based discrimination.The Haryana government has transferred Bijarniya, replacing him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria.In her complaint to Chandigarh Police, Amneet P Kumar sought an FIR against Kapur and Bijarniya under Section 108 (abetment of suicide) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, demanding their arrest. She also requested amendments to the FIR to include all accused officers’ names.Haryana ministers and senior officials, including chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, recently met the family to persuade them to agree to the post-mortem and cremation.","Y Puran Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7.

Taliban's Diplomatic Signal From Darul Uloom Deoband: Muttaqi Says India-Afghan Ties Look ‘Bright’

What is Darul Uloom Deoband?



The Afghan connection: How Deobandi Islam reached Afghanistan



NEW DELHI: Taliban ’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday, meeting Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani and other senior officials of the seminary.Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the warm reception and optimism about India-Afghanistan ties. “I am thankful to all of you for the warm welcome given to me by everyone in Deoband and the love showered upon me. I will pray to God that India-Afghanistan relations improve further,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The Afghan leader highlighted the significance of educational and cultural ties, noting that no political discussions took place but that historical connections were celebrated.As per news agency ANI, Maulana Arshad Madani emphasised the historical role of Afghanistan in India’s independence struggle and reassured that Afghanistan would not allow terrorists to use its soil against India.This visit is part of a week-long trip to India by Muttaqi, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul since the Taliban took power in 2021.Darul Uloom Deoband, established in 1866 in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is one of South Asia’s most influential Islamic seminaries.It was founded by scholars including Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi and Maulana Rashid Muhammad Gangohi to educate Muslim youth in a rigorous, orthodox understanding of Islam, known as Deobandi Islam.The seminary was originally part of an anti-colonial movement aimed at revitalising Islam and resisting British rule in India. Over the decades, Deobandi schools spread throughout India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of South Asia.While Darul Uloom Deoband is in India, its teachings spread across the border into Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtun communities were instrumental in establishing Deobandi seminaries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, according to The Conversation.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated this process as Deobandi madrassas, supported by Pakistani authorities and funding from Saudi Arabia and the CIA, educated Afghan refugee youth who would join the anti-Soviet resistance.Many of these students later became key figures in the Taliban. The movement’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other Taliban leaders were educated in Deobandi-inspired seminaries in Pakistan, adopting a version of the ideology that included ultraconservative Wahhabi influences, as per NPR.While the Taliban identify as Deobandis, scholars at the original Indian seminary emphasise that their interpretation diverged from classical Deobandi teachings.“The Taliban say they are doing what we did in India. The way we kicked the British out of India, that’s what the Taliban are doing in Afghanistan,” said Maulana Arshad Madani back in 2021 when the Taliban took control over Afghanistan, clarifying that there is no organisational link between the seminary and the Taliban, as per NPR.This visit of Taliban’s foreign minister comes amid efforts to improve India-Afghanistan relations, as Muttaqi emphasised hopes for increased exchanges and cooperation, including in regional projects like the Chabahar port in Iran.The visit reinforces the soft-power and cultural dimension of diplomacy between the two countries while acknowledging the centuries-old educational and religious links that connect them.",Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday.

Emeka Egbuka injury update: Buccaneers fear worst as star rookie’s hamstring issue adds to mounting crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/emeka-egbuka-injury-update-buccaneers-fear-worst-as-star-rookies-hamstring-issue-adds-to-mounting-crisis/articleshow/124514694.cms,"Star rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka suffered a hamstring injury during the Buccaneers' win over the 49ers, adding to the team's extensive injury list. This setback, with key receivers already sidelined, severely depletes Tampa Bay's offensive depth and poses a significant challenge for quarterback Baker Mayfield and head coach Todd Bowles as they face upcoming matchups.

Buccaneers ’ offensive depth takes another brutal hit



Todd Bowles and Baker Mayfield face uphill challenge amid injury chaos

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ injury nightmare just got worse. Star rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka became the latest player to go down, suffering a hamstring injury during Sunday’s win over the San Francisco 49ers. The 21-year-old phenom, who has quickly emerged as one of the top young offensive threats in the NFL , was officially ruled out in the fourth quarter, casting uncertainty over his availability in the coming weeks.The Buccaneers have already been navigating through a minefield of injuries, and Egbuka’s setback couldn’t have come at a worse time. Tampa Bay entered the matchup without their top three wideouts — Mike Evans (hamstring), Chris Godwin Jr. (fibula), and Jalen McMillan (neck). Losing Egbuka left quarterback Baker Mayfield with a depleted receiving corps, forcing the team to lean heavily on depth players and creative play-calling.According to A to Z Sports, the rookie was listed as “doubtful to return” before being officially ruled out later in the game. He’s expected to undergo an MRI early this week to determine the severity of the injury. “We won’t know anything about the extent of Egbuka’s injury until Tuesday at the earliest,” the report noted.If Egbuka misses time, it would be a major blow to the Buccaneers’ passing attack. The Ohio State standout had been in early contention for Offensive Rookie of the Year, impressing fans and analysts alike with his explosive playmaking and maturity on the field.The Buccaneers’ roster has been riddled with injuries across the board, including key starters like Cody Mauch, Luke Goedeke, Calijah Kancey, and Zyon McCollum. Head coach Todd Bowles has managed to keep the team competitive despite the setbacks, guiding Tampa Bay to an impressive 5-1 record behind Mayfield’s MVP-caliber performances.However, if Egbuka’s injury sidelines him for an extended period, Bowles and offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard will need to dig deep into their playbook to keep the offense afloat.With a crucial Monday Night Football matchup against the Detroit Lions looming, the Buccaneers’ resilience is about to be tested yet again and whether Mayfield’s magic can continue without his top weapons remains the biggest question in Tampa Bay.Also Read: Fred Warner injury update: 49ers All-Pro linebacker suffers severe ankle dislocation in emotional scene vs. Buccaneers","Rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka suffered a hamstring injury during the Buccaneers' win over the 49ers.

Connor McDavid’s selfless contract raises a brutal question: Do the Oilers deserve him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavids-selfless-contract-raises-a-brutal-question-do-the-oilers-deserve-him/articleshow/124500451.cms,"Edmonton Oilers fans are relieved by Connor McDavid's contract extension, securing him until 2028. While his value remains immense, the team faces pressure to build a championship-caliber roster around him and Leon Draisaitl. General Manager Stan Bowman is pursuing affordable talent, but goaltending and top-six stability are key concerns. Three seasons remain to deliver a Stanley Cup.

Connor McDavid’s long-term value still defines the Oilers’ identity

Edmonton’s roster needs balance before Connor McDavid’s new deal expires

When Connor McDavid signed a two-year contract extension with the Edmonton Oilers this fall, fans across Alberta breathed a collective sigh of relief. After months of speculation about whether the superstar might eventually test free agency, McDavid’s decision to stay, at a significant discount, felt like both a victory and a warning. The deal secures the NHL ’s most electrifying player through at least the 2027-28 season, but it also shines a spotlight on whether the Oilers have built a roster capable of delivering him the championship he’s long deserved.Connor McDavid’s impact on the Oilers extends far beyond the stat sheet. Since joining the team in 2015, he’s transformed Edmonton’s brand value, led them deep into the playoffs, and solidified his place among the sport’s all-time greats. Analysts continue to describe his contract as one of the biggest bargains in hockey. Even with his scoring rate slightly dipping over recent years, from 1.87 points per 60 in 2022-23 to 1.49 in 2024-25, his production remains elite.Comparing McDavid’s trajectory to Sidney Crosby’s at the same age paints an encouraging picture. Like Crosby, McDavid shows no sign of slowing down as he nears his late 20s, and projections suggest he could maintain his dominance well into his 30s.But the challenge isn’t his endurance, it’s what surrounds him.Under general manager Stan Bowman, the Oilers have made several aggressive moves to strengthen their core, from acquiring veterans like Mattias Ekholm and Jake Walman to bringing in depth pieces such as Jack Roslovic and Connor Ingram. Bowman’s recent spree of European signings and under-the-radar free agents signals a strategy shift: find affordable, high-upside players who can support McDavid and Leon Draisaitl without sacrificing future assets.Still, the holes are clear. Goaltending remains unreliable, and the team’s top-six forward group lacks long-term stability. Veterans like Adam Henrique are aging out, while promising rookies such as Matt Savoie and Ike Howard have yet to prove themselves.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren Kyle gushes over Leon Draisaitl’s wife’s stunning after-party look from their French wedding McDavid’s extension buys Bowman three seasons to deliver the ultimate goal, a Stanley Cup in Edmonton.

Tyreek Hill opens up about surgery, support, and faith during recovery

Tua Tagovailoa’s comeback effort adds optimism to Miami’s future

Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill has given fans a heartfelt glimpse into his recovery after suffering a devastating dislocated knee injury that ended his season. Known for his blazing speed and explosive plays, Hill, fondly nicknamed “The Cheetah”, is now channeling that same determination into his rehabilitation journey.Following reports that Tyreek Hill tore multiple ligaments, including his ACL, the wide receiver underwent surgery and is expected to miss the rest of the 2025 season. Despite the difficult setback, Hill’s recent video message showed optimism and gratitude for the support surrounding him.“I’m doing great, I’m doing fantastic. I’m walking. And God has blessed me to this point, this far. So I would not be in any other position,” Hill shared. “It all happened so fast, but you know, great surgeon, great team, Dolphins. Those guys are taking great care of me and obviously my family, so let’s get the journey started.”That spirit of resilience has been matched by unwavering support from his teammates and coaches. Tua Tagovailoa, De’Von Achane, and Coach Mike McDaniel have all reached out since the injury. “Our thoughts and our prayers are with him,” Tagovailoa said, echoing the team’s shared sentiment.Hill’s family has also been a crucial part of his recovery. The wideout shared heartfelt photos from his hospital bed alongside his mother, captioned “Blessed” and “Love my mom,” a reminder that his strength runs deeper than football.While Hill begins his road back, Tua Tagovailoa is battling his own physical hurdles. The Dolphins quarterback, limited by hip and thumb issues, was cleared for full participation ahead of the team’s clash with the Los Angeles Chargers.“Ultimately, he’s working through stuff for the week, and we’re not overly concerned for Sunday,” offensive coordinator Frank Smith said.Also Read: Indianapolis Colts cheerleader Morgan McLain melts hearts after using sign language to communicate with deaf 8-year-old fan Despite Miami’s 1–4 start, Tagovailoa’s performance; 1,008 passing yards, 10 touchdowns, and a 70.7% completion rate, has reinforced his status as the Dolphins’ leader.

In a Week 6 game on October 12, 2025, the Los Angeles Rams faced off against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. During the second quarter, Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua suffered a foot injury but was able to come back in the third quarter.The Rams went on to win the game 17-3 against the Ravens. Nacua, who was leading the NFL with 52 receptions and 588 receiving yards at the time, raised concerns among fans and the team when he hobbled off the field.In the second quarter, Nacua tried to grab a pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford in the end zone during a third-down play. He jumped up to challenge a 50/50 ball against Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey but landed hard, having trouble getting back up right away. Nacua held onto the lower part of his left leg, first attempting to walk but soon collapsing back onto the ground in the end zone.Trainers were looking after Nacua on the field, concentrating on his lower leg area, which looked like it involved his ankle or foot. He was eventually escorted off the field by two trainers and limped right to the tunnel for further assessment, without pausing at the sideline.Shortly after, the Rams announced that Nacua was questionable to return due to a foot injury.At the moment he exited, the game was tied, and his absence left Davante Adams as the key target for Stafford.Rams running back Blake Corum also limped toward the tunnel shortly after Nacua, who is listed as questionable to return with an ankle injury.Initial assessments from medical analysts indicated that Nacua's injury could be a high ankle sprain or maybe a fibula fracture, based on how his left toes appeared to embed into the turf when he landed. Nacua was also seen momentarily holding his midsection, although the primary concern was reported to be his foot.Nacua made his way back to the Rams' sideline before halftime, wearing his helmet, which showed he was checking his mobility. He got back into the game in the third quarter, much to the relief of both the team and the fans.However, he didn't play much; he was on the field only a little in the second half and didn't make any catches after getting hurt. Even with his limited role, his return helped the Rams keep their offensive flow, leading to their final 17-3 victory.Nacua was back on the sidelines with his helmet on just before the third quarter started. She later clarified that he wasn't on the field for the initial drive of the second half, recommending that people be cautious about expecting him to be fully involved. His toughness was a key point in the reports, which mentioned that even though he returned, he could still be feeling considerable discomfort.Puka Nacua re-entered the game with the Los Angeles Rams during the third quarter.

IDF launches Operation “Returning Home”



All dead hostages may not be back on Monday







Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal but urged citizens to unite ahead of the expected release of hostages held by Hamas under the prisoner exchange agreement.“This is an emotional evening, an evening of tears, an evening of joy, because tomorrow our children will return to our borders,” Netanyahu said in a televised address, quoting a biblical verse. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path - a path of rebuilding, a path of healing, and, I hope, a path of united hearts.”The Prime Minister’s remarks came amid criticism from both sides of Israel’s political spectrum - from families of hostages who accused him of prioritising military goals over their release, and from right-wing members of his coalition who opposed freeing Palestinian prisoners.“This is a historic event that mixes sorrow over the release of murderers with joy over the return of hostages,” Netanyahu said.“I know there are many disagreements among us, but on this day ... we have every reason to put them aside, because together we achieved tremendous victories,” he added.Netanyahu also said Israel was ready to receive the hostages expected to be freed on Monday. “Israel is prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” he said in a separate statement issued Sunday.He added that while Israel had made “tremendous victories” during two years of conflict, the fight was not over: “Together we achieved tremendous victories, victories that amazed the whole world... But at the same time I must tell you, the fight is not over,” Netanyahu said. “Very large security challenges still lie before us.”Meanwhile, the Israel defense forces (IDF) announced the launch of Operation “Returning Home” to bring back the hostages. “In a few hours we will all be reunited - one people, embraced and united,” said Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, Israel’s Chief of the General Staff, in a statement posted on X.He said the operation followed two years of sustained military and diplomatic pressure. “The military pressure we applied over the past two years, together with the complementary diplomatic measures, constitute a victory over Hamas,” Zamir added. “We will continue to act in order to ensure the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians.”An Israeli Military official said that they are expecting that not all dead hostages may return to Israel on Monday.""Unfortunately this is something we anticipate that not all fallen hostages will be returned tomorrow,"" the official told reporters during a briefing late on Sunday.Earlier Sunday, Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for the prime minister's office, had said an ""international body"" would be established to locate the remains of captives not returned as part of Monday's exchange.Israel, however, will not send a representative to the US-led peace summit on Gaza scheduled Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, co-hosted by President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, according to a statement to AFP by Netanyahu’s spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.(With inputs from agencies)",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal.

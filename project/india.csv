"India remains cornerstone of UN peacekeeping, its women peacekeepers indispensable: UN peacekeeping chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-remains-cornerstone-of-un-peacekeeping-its-women-peacekeepers-indispensable-un-peacekeeping-chief/articleshow/118495803.cms,".

India remains a cornerstone of UN peacekeeping and its women peacekeepers have demonstrated that missions with greater female representation improve operational outcomes and contribute to lasting peace, the United Nations peacekeeping chief has said.UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix will visit New Delhi this week to attend the conference 'Enhancing the Role of Women in Peacekeeping: A Global South Experience' being organised by India on February 24-25.""India remains a cornerstone of UN peacekeeping"" and ""Indian women peacekeepers are redefining peacekeeping itself,"" Lacroix told PTI in an exclusive interview here.Noting that it's a ""privilege"" to attend the conference in India, Lacroix said the gathering would bring together women officials from about 50 countries in the Global South to discuss the evolving challenges in peacekeeping and the critical role women play in advancing peace and security.""More women in peacekeeping means a more effective peacekeeping. India has long been a leader in advancing women, peace and security in peacekeeping missions -not only as a top troop and police contributor but also as a pioneer in advancing gender parity, its leadership in training and capacity building and its commitment to increasing women's participation in missions,"" he said in the written interview ahead of the conference.He said the presence of Indian women peacekeepers ""proves that missions with greater women representation build stronger relationships with communities, improve operational outcomes, and contribute to lasting peace.""Moving forward, creating enabling environments, addressing gender barriers, ensuring the mental well-being of peacekeepers, strengthening strategic communication, and countering misinformation must remain priorities. Women in peacekeeping is not just about fairness-it is a strategic necessity for mission success,"" he said.Lacroix said ""India's women peacekeepers have proven to be indispensable in UN peacekeeping, forging trust between our uniformed personnel and local communities in some of the world's most challenging conflict zones.""Their presence contributes to the success of peacekeeping efforts. Through community engagement, they build crucial connections with local women, build trust, contribute to early warning and protection efforts, improve humanitarian outreach and act as role models for women and girls in the communities they serve,"" he said.In Abyei, Indian women peacekeepers have adapted patrol routes and provided targeted support to marginalised groups, ensuring safer environments for women and children.Their ability to navigate cultural sensitivities and build genuine relationships enhances both mission success and community healing, he said.Beyond their on-the-ground contributions, Indian women peacekeepers are ""pioneers"" in gender-inclusive peacekeeping.""Their deployment across various missions highlights how diverse teams lead to stronger, more effective operations. Their courage and commitment inspire not only their fellow peacekeepers but also the local populations they serve,"" the UN peacekeeping chief said.Lacroix noted that India ranks among the top contributors to UN peacekeeping missions with 5,384 personnel, including 153 women, across 10 missions as of September 2024.India deployed the first all-female Formed Police Unit (FPU) to Liberia in 2007. Today, 20.45% of its deployed military observers and staff officers are women. Additionally, India's Engagement Platoons in the United Nations Interim Force for Abyei ( UNISFA ) and UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) ""exemplify"" the impact of women in peacekeeping.He noted that Deputy Commander of the Female Engagement Team at UNISFA Captain Seema Gowdar's team in Abyei has strengthened civilian protection and community trust.Another ""prime example"" of women leadership in peacekeeping is Major Radhika Sen, whose ""outstanding work"" in MONUSCO earned her the 2023 UN Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award.""Her dedication exemplifies how gender-inclusive leadership strengthens peacekeeping and sets the stage for future generations of women in uniform,"" he said.Beyond its deployments, India leads in training through the Centre for UN Peacekeeping (CUNPK) in Delhi, which sets ""global standards"" for pre-deployment and specialized courses. India actively supports efforts to counter misinformation and hate speech, collaborating with the UN to refine policies, command structures, and training.""India's impact goes beyond personnel-it is shaping training, leadership, inclusion, accountability, and strategic communications. As peacekeeping evolves, India's contributions remain essential to mission success, civilian protection, and lasting peace,"" he said.Lacroix said that in 2007, when India deployed the first all-female FPU to Liberia, it set a ""global precedent"" and today the country continues this legacy.He said that the conference, which is being organised by the Ministry of External Aﬀairs in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and CUNPK, serves as a platform to reinforce that commitment while fostering collaboration, peer support, and professional development among women peacekeepers.It also has a special resonance for UN Peacekeeping as it will be an opportunity to reflect on the challenges peacekeeping faces and how best to address them at the peacekeeping Ministerial level meeting in Berlin in May.Against the backdrop of increased attacks on UN peacekeepers who are working in increasingly hostile environments, Lacroix underscored that peacekeeper safety is a shared responsibility.""Troop- and police-contributing countries must hold attackers accountable and strengthen multilateral efforts to protect personnel.""""As conflicts grow more complex, attacks on peacekeepers have increased, making decisive action essential to protect those who serve global peace and security,"" he said.Furthermore, he said that investing in advanced technology and training is key to adapting to modern threats.""AI-driven systems, data analytics, and cyber tools can enhance intelligence gathering, improve mission performance, and strengthen protection in hostile environments.""He however stressed that safety is not just about equipment but relies on coordination and trust. ""Stronger intelligence-sharing and deeper engagement with local communities can provide early warnings and reduce risks,"" he said.He added that women peacekeepers play a vital role in this, fostering trust and gathering critical insights that enhance mission security.""Increasing their leadership and operational roles will further strengthen peacekeeping. By breaking barriers, building partnerships, and equipping peacekeepers with the right tools and support, we can create forces that not only protect but lead the way to a safer, more just world. Their safety is not just about preserving lives-it upholds the very principles of peace and security,"" he said.The UN peacekeeping chief called on UN Member States to increase efforts to nominate women candidates for senior uniformed leadership positions, especially in the military.Currently, of the 11 peacekeeping operations, only one is led by a uniformed woman: Major General Anita Asmah of Ghana recently deployed as Head of Mission and Force Commander of the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).""We need more trailblazing uniformed women like her and we need women nominated at all roles, including in operations and leadership, where they are currently underrepresented.""","UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix will visit New Delhi this week. He will attend the conference 'Enhancing the Role of Women in Peacekeeping: A Global South Experience' being organised by India. India has long been a leader in advancing women, peace and security in peacekeeping missions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118495849,imgsize-39362,width-400,resizemode-4/118495849.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The US President Donald Trump has once again raised concerns over alleged USAID's $18 million funding allocation for elections in India, questioning the rationale behind spending substantial amounts abroad instead of focusing on American voter participation.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump suggested reverting to paper ballots and proposed seeking India's assistance with electoral processes.""18 million dollars for helping India with its elections. Why the hell? Why don't we just go to old paper ballots, and let them help us with their elections, right? Voter ID. Wouldn't that be nice? We're giving money to India for elections. They don't need money,"" US president said.""They take advantage of us pretty good. One of the highest tariffed nations in the world. We try and sell something. They have a 200 per cent tariff. And then we're giving them a lot of money to help them with their election,"" he added.The criticism follows Trump's ongoing scrutiny of alleged USAID funding across various nations. Previously, he alleged US involvement in election results in India.Also Read : '$21 million going to my friend PM Modi': US President Donald Trump fixates on fund to India for third day in a row During his address at the Republican Governors Association, Trump also criticised funding of $29 million to a firm to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.""And $21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter Turnout. We're giving 21 million for voter turnout in India. What about us? I want voter turnout too,"" Trump said.""$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh went to a firm that nobody ever heard of. Got 29 million. They got a check. Can you imagine? You have a little firm, you get 10,000 here, 10,000 there, and then we get 29 million from the United States government. There are two people working in that firm. Two people. I think they're very happy, they're very rich. They'll be on the cover of a very good business magazine pretty soon for being great,"" he added.Trump also called the alleged funding a ""kickback scheme"", noting the lack of transparency in its implementation.On Saturday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed concern over allegations that the $21 million USAID funding for ""voter turnout"" in India.Also Read: 'It's worrisome, if there's something to it, then country should know': Jaishankar on Trump's $21 million fund for 'voter turnout in India' ""Some information has been put out there by the Trump administration people, and obviously, that is concerning...

It's worrisome, and if there's something to it, then the country should know who the people are involved in it,"" said Jaishankar.MEA has also expressed concern over the remarks and termed the matter ""deeply troubling"" and said that relevant departments and agencies are examining the potential implications.""We have seen information that has been put out by the US administration regarding certain USA activities and funding.

Ensure timely completion of works: Verma

NEW DELHI: Newly sworn-in Delhi ministers spent the day on Saturday doing a reality check on the ground by carrying surprise inspections and asking officials to fast-track projects that have been delayed or are stuck.PWD minister Parvesh Verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around Mathura Road and Ring Road, zeroing in on the work on Barapullah flyover's extension, which has got inordinately delayed.""I was told that no minister had visited the project for a decade and no one even cared to get it completed even as the city is grappling with traffic jams,"" he said, adding that all this only made the city air more polluted.""If you delay a project, it also leads to cost escalation. The AAP govt didn't care about these things. I have asked for details of whatever clearances they need, and I will personally ensure that there are no further hindrances,"" he said. ""The road will be opened to the public in the next 12 months. Money is not an issue.""Explaining what plagues Delhi roads, Verma said these were repeatedly dug up by various agencies for laying underground cables or for other work. ""This is not the way to operate. We will have a nodal agency that will ensure all underground work is completed before a road is constructed so that the taxpayers' money is not wasted,"" Verma said. He emphasised the need for better coordination to prevent wastage of funds.Verma also reviewed the progress in construction of the Bhairon Marg underpass, part of the Pragati Maidan tunnel, and the Sarai Kale Khan stretch. He directed officials to ensure timely completion of all work. Emphasising the importance of quality construction, he said, ""We should build a road that lasts for 10-15 years. Though the official lifespan is five years, the quality should be such that it remains in good condition for at least 10-15 years.""He also inspected the Moolchand underpass, which has in the past witnessed severe waterlogging. To address this long-standing issue, he reviewed the upgradation of facilities with Japanese pumps being installed to make the drainage more effective.""I have directed officials to take all necessary measures before the rainy season to ensure that water does not accumulate. Proper drainage systems should be created and maintained, and pumps should be installed in time,"" he said.Verma said these efforts were in line with PM Modi's vision of a cleaner, greener and more developed Delhi. ""We are committed to transforming Delhi into a world-class city with better roads, effective drainage systems and overall beautification,"" he added.Education minister Ashish Sood visited Janakpuri and expressed his dismay over the accumulation of garbage. ""It has been lying scattered over a 1km stretch over the past two and a half years. This is unacceptable. People are hassled about AAP councillors. We are committed to cleaning this up,"" he said.Health minister Pankaj Kumar Singh visited Rao Tula Ram Memorial Hospital in Jaffarpur Kalan along with BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat. ""The conditions here are quite bad. There is a lack of doctors. A building that should have been made before 2020 is incomplete. We have decided with Sehrawat that in 3 months, we will transform this hospital,"" he said. ""We will come back here after three months to show you how well this hospital is functioning.""On the mohalla clinics, he said: ""There are many clinics that do not have doctors or medicines. They were leased out by MLAs in the name of clinics. If these complaints are true, the matter will be investigated,"" he said.","PWD minister Parvesh Verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around Mathura Road and Ring Road.

Das showed his mettle during

and lockdown

Spl post created: Ex-guv of RBI Shaktikanta Das 2nd principal secy to PM

NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as principal secretary-2 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a post that has been created for the first time. The notification was made on Saturday by the appointments committee of the cabinet.The appointment of Das, a 1980 batch IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, would be co-terminus with the term of the PM. PK Mishra, a 1972 batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer, will continue as the current principal secretary to the PM.Mishra, who worked with Modi during his stint as Gujarat CM, was appointed to the post in Sept 2019 and was initially additional principal secretary. Former cabinet secretary PK Sinha also served as additional principal secretary for a short while. The PMO also had two advisers in Amit Khare and Tarun Kapoor, both retired secretaries.Shaktikanta Das, who was the 25th RBI governor, completed a six-year term in Dec after being given the job at a critical time. His predecessor Urjit Patel resigned abruptly after the relationship between the central bank and the govt soured over a raft of issues, including reducing rates to revive growth.A former economic affairs secretary, Das took on the task of repairing the relationship between the central bank and the finance ministry, and unleashed a number of measures which helped both monetary and fiscal policy to work seamlessly and ushered in stability in the delicate relationship.He improved the communication with the markets and helped open the central bank to the wider world with key officials interacting and communicating with all stakeholders, including the media.During his long innings as a civil servant, Das handled many challenges deftly, earning the trust of his bosses.Perhaps the toughest assignment for this soft-spoken bureaucrat was during the 2016 demonetisation drive. Das emerged as the face of the entire exercise and worked tirelessly with his team to ensure order and calm in the markets.He also worked to make sure that the impact of the disruption was minimised and the transition was smooth. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Das used his more than 40 years of experience as a civil servant to ensure that the markets functioned smoothly.Since the national lockdown was announced in late March 2020, a team of more than 200 personnel from RBI and services providers were holed up in four locations to ensure that the financial markets and the system across the country provided uninterrupted services.An alumnus of St Stephen's College in the capital with a master's degree in history, Das has held important positions in the central and state governments in finance, taxation, industries, infrastructure and other sectors.He was also member of the 15th Finance Commission and served as India's sherpa to G20 .","Former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as principal secretary-2 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-give-in-to-blackmail-centre-makes-it-clear-to-tn/articleshow/118490049.cms,"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to TN (Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: In the midst of its escalating political standoff with Tamil Nadu govt over National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre has made it clear that it is firmly committed to implementing the three-language policy at school level. Centre is steadfast in its stance and will not succumb to Tamil Nadu's ""blackmailing"" tactics, govt sources said.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday, criticised the state's opposition to NE, calling it ""highly inappropriate"" and a ""narrow-minded approach"". Pradhan sought to allay concerns raised by Tamil Nadu govt, saying, ""Let me unequivocally state that there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.""NE advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education, while allowing states to choose their own languages within the framework. However, Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two-language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.Despite the state's reservations, Union govt remains firm on implementing NE nationwide. Centre maintains that the policy is designed to enhance educational outcomes and foster multilingual proficiency without infringing upon regional linguistic preferences. Pradhan underscored this in his letter, stating, ""NE upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures that students continue to learn in the language of their choice.""""Apart from BJP-governed states there are multiple non-BJP states which are implementing this language policy. In fact, states like Assam and Odisha, among others, have been following a three-language formula till Class VIII which predates BJP govts there,"" said a senior govt official.The three-language policy, which has been a part of India's education framework since 1968, has been a major point of contention for long. Pradhan argued that its lack of proper implementation over the decades has led to a decline in the systematic teaching of Indian languages and an over-reliance on foreign languages. ""NE seeks to correct this historical oversight by ensuring that every Indian language, including Tamil, receives its rightful place in education while maintaining the flexibility for states to design their own language policies,"" he wrote.Pradhan cautioned that Tamil Nadu's continued opposition to NE could deprive its students, teachers, and educational institutions of the immense opportunities the policy offers.","National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education. Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two- language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.

What the Washington Post report said

NEW DELHI: The Congress party has intensified its attack on the BJP, demanding answers over US President Donald Trump’s claim that he gave $21 million to 'friend' Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost voter turnout in India.At a press conference on Saturday, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera ridiculed the BJP’s silence, calling the controversy “a matter between two friends.” He accused the ruling party of benefiting from foreign funds and questioned where the alleged money went.“Trump’s statement proves he sent this money to Modi to influence elections. Since we have been questioning voter turnout trends, is this increase due to foreign funds?” Khera asked, demanding a White Paper on funds received by political parties and cultural outfits.Citing a Washington Post report debunking claims of US funding for India’s elections, Khera alleged that the RSS-BJP ecosystem has been making ""wild allegations"" against civil society while benefiting from USAID funds. He pointed out that USAID disbursed $650 million to India between FY 2021 and FY 2024 and questioned its purpose.The Congress leader further highlighted past USAID disbursements, linking them to key political developments, including the rise of Modi as BJP’s PM candidate and the formation of AAP. “Who benefitted from these funds?” he asked, urging legal action against those spreading ""fake narratives"" to mislead the nation.The controversy erupted after Elon Musk’s DOGE platform claimed it had canceled a $21 million USAID grant supposedly meant to boost voter participation in India. Trump quickly amplified the claim, alleging that US taxpayer money was being used to interfere in India's 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Despite The Washington Post's findings, Trump has continued repeating the allegations without evidence. He recently remarked, “Why do we need to spend USD 21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they (the Biden administration) were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government.”The Congress has urged that the proposed white paper on foreign funding not be restricted to USAID but should cover all financial assistance from foreign entities operating under law. Congress insisted PM Modi must directly refute what it called ""baseless"" allegations.""The RSS-BJP and their ecosystem are fabricating narratives against credible civil society groups, NGOs, and political parties. These actors must not only be named and shamed but also face legal consequences for misleading the nation,"" said Pawan Khera.Congress also dismissed the BJP’s claims linking a 2012 agreement between the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) to foreign electoral influence.""The IFES was engaged by the ECI to develop a curriculum on election management, not to interfere in Indian elections,"" Khera clarified. ""The training material was used for electoral officials worldwide, not for domestic polls. The ECI’s website states that 69,362 officials from 109 countries have been trained under this initiative.""Earlier, Khera had taken to social media to mock the BJP, saying: “In this latest expose on the so-called US funding to increase voter turnout in India, The Washington Post confirms that no such program existed and no such funding was received. For the BJP and its blind supporters, crow is part of their daily diet. Who else will eat crow after this comedy of errors?”The BJP, on the other hand, has been on the offensive, accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of seeking foreign intervention to unseat Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The party has yet to respond to the Washington Post report dismissing the USAID funding claim.The BJP, however, dismissed the media report as a ""cover-up"" and branded Rahul Gandhi a ""traitor"" for allegedly seeking external influence in India's electoral process. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia alleged that the Congress facilitated foreign interference during its tenure, claiming that over $2,000 million in USAID funding entered India between 2004 and 2013, while only $1.5 million was received under Modi’s rule.External affairs minister S Jaishankar has responded to the controversy surrounding USAID funding in India, calling the allegations concerning and stating that the government is examining the matter. His remarks come amid claims by Trump that $21 million was sent to India to boost voter turnout in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections—a claim dismissed by The Washington Post.“Some information has been put out there by the Trump administration people, and obviously, that is concerning. I think, as a government, we're looking into it. My sense is that the facts will come out,” Jaishankar said.He emphasized that USAID was allowed to operate in India in good faith, but recent allegations from the US suggest otherwise. “USAID was allowed here in good faith, to do good faith activities. Now, suggestions are being laid out from America that there are activities which are in bad faith. It’s worrisome, and if there’s something to it, then the country should know who the people involved are,” he added.On Friday, US President Donald Trump raised the issue of $21 million funding for 'voter turnout in India' for the third day in a row and questioned why such substantial amount was being spent abroad when similar efforts could be made towards boosting voter turnout in United States.Trump, who had earlier hinted that the funds might have been used to interfere in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections without giving any evidence, took the Prime Minister's name in his latest remark. ""And $21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter Turnout. We're giving 21 million for voter turnout in India. What about us? I want voter turnout too,"" Trump said.While the BJP has accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of seeking foreign intervention to defeat Modi, the ruling party has yet to respond to The Washington Post’s report debunking the USAID funding claim. The opposition, meanwhile, is demanding answers from Modi and the Election Commission on the matter.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal expressed concerns over foreign interference, stating that authorities were examining USAID’s financial activities. ""We have seen information put out by the US administration regarding certain US activities and funding. These are obviously very deeply troubling,"" Jaiswal said at a press briefing.Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar voiced concerns over foreign funding’s impact on India's electoral process, urging those responsible to be ""shamed and brought to book."" He called the controversy a ""political Covid"" designed to weaken Indian democracy.According to The Washington Post, the false claim originated when DOGE alleged that USAID had allocated $21 million to India as part of a broader $486 million payment to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS), a USAID-funded coalition of non-profits working on democratic governance and electoral processes. However, the report, citing three officials familiar with US aid initiatives, stated that no such program existed in India.“We were all shocked to see that claim from DOGE. We don’t know anything about elections in India because we have never been involved,” a USAID official told The Washington Post.Another US official suggested that Musk’s department might have misrepresented the numbers from other programs, saying, “They seem to be conflating figures from unrelated initiatives.”Despite these clarifications, Trump has doubled down on his claims, repeatedly questioning why US funds were allegedly being spent on voter turnout in India. Earlier this week, he remarked, ""Why do we need to spend USD 21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they (the Biden administration) were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government.""","Congress demands wider probe into foreign funding, calls out Modi on Trump’s claim that he gave $21 million to 'friend' Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost voter turnout in India.

Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars.

Why are we caring about India turnout? We got enough problems. We want our own turnout, don't we? Can you imagine all that money going to India? I wonder what they think when they get it.

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar alleged that illegal immigrants are influencing India’s electoral process and also stressed the need for public awareness on the issue.Speaking at the 65th convocation of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University on Saturday, he questioned when India would begin deporting illegal immigrants, an action which the US has already taken recently.""Crores of people who have no right to live in India are living here...They are making their livelihood here. They are making demands on our resources. On our education, health sector, housing sector. Now things have gone further. They are intervening in our electoral process,"" Dhankhar said.He urged citizens to create an atmosphere where every Indian is aware of this challenge.Without naming the US directly, the vice president referred to the recent deportation of Indian nationals who had entered the country illegally.""A question should occur to every Indian -- when would we start doing this?"" he asked, adding that the youth should act as a powerful pressure group and question the public representatives and government on their jobs.“Nationalism is our religion and topmost priority,” he said.Touching the issue of religious conversions, Dhankar said that an individual is entitled to follow any religion, however, conversions are happening through temptations. He claimed that such changes in demographics could threaten national stability, citing examples of majority communities being ""finished off"" in certain countries.In a possible reference to allegations of USAID funding efforts to increase voter turnout in India, Dhankhar warned of attempts to manipulate the country’s democratic process. He called for a ""deep, thorough, micro-level investigation"" into these claims.Addressing India's development goals, Dhankhar acknowledged the challenges ahead but remained optimistic. ""We will have to increase our per capita income eight-fold, and therefore all of us must move fast and with commitment. That commitment requires we should believe in our nation.” He further added that commitment to nationalism is non-negotiable as it is directly connected to freedom.Commenting on India’s growth over the last one decade, he said that the country has witnessed ""exponential economic rise, phenomenal infrastructural upsurge, deep digitization and technology penetration,"" adding that no other nation has seen such growth during this period.""This nation is therefore full of hope and possibility. This nation is no longer a nation with potential, but (it is a nation) on rise which is unstoppable.”He said that people have toilets, gas connection, internet connections, road connectivity with infrastructure connectivity is making life easier.“If you have an idea, the government policies will handhold you,"" Dhankhar said.He also praised the rise of start-ups in tier 2 and 3 cities, highlighting that they are emerging from ordinary families rather than traditional business backgrounds.

Though Tharoor had hinted at taking up the responsibilities of Congress' youth wing, Rahul was not ready to accept that.",AICC appears unwilling to adopt a diplomatic stance toward Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

HYDERABAD: Eight people were trapped inside when a portion of the tunnel roof at Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed on Saturday morning near Domalpenta in Telangana's Nagarku-nool district.Sources said 60 workers were on site when the roof suddenly caved in by about 200 metres inside the tunnel, which has a depth of 500 ft. While 52 of them managed to come out to safety, with some of them taken to hospital with injuries, eight workers remained trapped deep inside the tunnel.These included Jaiprakash Associates Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas, both from Uttar Pradesh, four labourers from Jharkhand - Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu and Anuj Sahu - and two machine operators of Robbins India Company - Sunny Singh from J&K and Gurpreet Singh from Punjab.According to sources, no communication had been established with the trapped people till reports last came in. Noises of shifting of boulders were heard till evening, indicating that the roof in collapsed areas was still unstable, the sources said.PM Narendra Modi dialled chief minister A Revanth Reddy to inquire about the mishap and assured all possible assistance from the Centre, including deployment of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel, for the ongoing rescue operation.According to senior irrigation officials, the tunnel roof collapsed due to a sudden leakage of water and soil, covering nearly 13 km of the excavation site. The SLBC tunnel is about 44 km long from the Srisailam dam's left bank.The accident occurred about 13 km from the mouth of the tunnel. An earth fracture on the side of the tunnel wall caused the water and mud to gush in, forcing the workers to scramble to safety.Jaiprakash Associates and Robbins India, responsible for tunnel boring, said the accident took place within 30 minutes of taking up the work at 8 am. Those positioned near the tunnel boring machine managed to escape, while workers in the front section of the tunnel got trapped, representatives of the companies said. The works were immediately halted, and supervisors quickly evacuated as many workers as possible.Officials said the ventilation system inside the tunnel remained functional, ensuring oxygen supply to the trapped workers.

MANGALURU: In an alleged case of medical negligence, a doctor at a Mangaluru hospital left a surgical mop inside a woman's stomach during a C-section, putting her life in danger and requiring an emergency, life-saving surgery at another hospital two months later, after a CT scan exposed the doctor's carelessness. She is still not able to breastfeed her newborn.""We have undergone tremendous stress. We have posted the issue on National Consumer Grievance portal and Department of Consumer Affairs. We have spent lakhs of rupees on her treatment,"" the woman's husband said.Dakshina Kannada district health and family welfare officer Dr Thimmaiah H R said that a thorough probe would be conducted into the complaint.Recounting the ordeal, the husband posted on X that his wife underwent a C-section on Nov 27 at a private hospital, but a week after she was discharged on Dec 2, she developed a high fever and had to be readmitted to the hospital. Concerned about an unusual sensation on one side of her stomach, the couple insisted on an ultrasound scan, which revealed a 10 cm mass.However, the radiologist allegedly refused to disclose its details to the patient or communicate with the treating doctor in their presence. The doctor, in turn, dismissed their concerns, claiming it was a hematoma rather than a foreign object.As the discomfort persisted, the couple requested a CT scan for clarification, but the doctor reportedly disregarded the suggestion, insisting the condition would resolve over time. Although the woman's fever eventually subsided, follow-up ultrasounds showed no reduction in the mass. Meanwhile, she began experiencing severe joint, wrist, and leg pain, making it difficult for her to walk, stand, or even lift her baby to feed.A CT scan later confirmed the presence of a surgical mop inside her stomach. By then, the infection had spread to her lungs, blood, and other organs, putting her life at grave risk, her husband alleged. When the couple confronted the doctor who had performed the C-section, he allegedly refused to take responsibility.Ultimately, an emergency surgery was performed at another private hospital in Mangaluru's Puttur on Jan 25 to remove the mop. She was discharged on Feb 15, though she is still on medication.","A doctor at a Mangaluru hospital left a surgical mop inside a woman's stomach during a C-section, putting her life in danger.

RANCHI/KOCHI: A Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) exam topper whose career got caught in a protracted legal tangle and a CBI probe into the fairness of the selection process was found dead with her IRS officer brother and their mother in a govt accommodation in Kerala's Kochi on Friday, six days after she failed to appear for a court hearing in Ranchi.Shalini Vijay , assistant director in the Jharkhand social welfare department, was on leave since 2020. She and her brother Manish Vijay, additional commissioner of central excise and customs in Kochi, are suspected to have entered into a suicide pact along with their mother Shakuntala.The matriarch's body was found covered in a white cloth with petals sprinkled all over, leading investigators to presume she died before the siblings purportedly took their lives in separate rooms of Manish's official quarters at Eechamukk in Kochi's Kakkanad neighbourhood.Investigators aren't ruling out the possibility of Shakuntala dying of any natural cause before her son and daughter hanged themselves. ""We will know the details for sure, including the time of death, only after the autopsies,"" said assistant CP (Thrikkakara) P V Baby.Manish's colleagues were the first to find the bodies when they visited the house to check on him as he was supposed to resume work the previous day after a period of leave but was incommunicado.Police found a note in Manish' diary, dated Feb 15, with an instruction to hand over some documents to his younger sister, who is currently in Dubai. The note mentions her phone number. ""She will be arriving soon after the autopsies, which most likely will be done on Saturday,"" a police officer said.Shalini was the topper among 64 civil servants recruited through JPSC's first combined exam in 2003.Some candidates who didn't make the cut challenged the recruitment process soon after, pointing out that many of those who cleared the exam were linked to politicians or officials. As the state probe dragged on, Jharkhand HC had the case transferred to CBI in 2022.CBI filed charges against Shalini and the other recruits under sections 420 (cheating), 423 (fraudulent documentation) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC, among other offences, along with 13(2) and 13(1)(D) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

DGCA slaps notice on Air India after it sold broken seat to Chouhan

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister and ex-MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan found himself facing an uncomfortable journey Saturday when he was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight from Bhopal to Delhi. His experience reignited concerns about Air India's service standards, while the airline attempts to improve its operations under Tata Group 's ownership.Expressing his frustration on X, he wrote: ""Today, (Feb 22) I had to come from Bhopal to Delhi... I had booked a ticket on Air India flight number AI 436. I was allotted seat number 8C. I went and sat on the seat, the seat was broken and sunken in. Sitting was uncomfortable."" Chouhan was allotted the seat despite the crew informing the management about the unserviceable seat & requesting it not be sold. ""Is this not cheating passengers?"" he asked.Shivraj Singh Chouhan was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight. The aircraft in question was an Airbus A321 (VT-RTB), just a year old. This raises questions about Air India's maintenance of even its newest fleet.Chouhan further said: ""I had the belief that after coming under Tata management, Air India's service must have improved, but this turned out to be my illusion. After charging passengers the full amount, seating them on a bad and uncomfortable seat is unethical. Is this not cheating the passengers?""Co-passengers offered him their seats, he said. ""But why should I trouble another for my comfort? So, I decided to complete my journey in the same seat...,"" he posted.The incident prompted Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu to step in: ""We spoke to Air India and instructed them to take necessary action. From our side, DGCA will also be looking into details of matter promptly. And I have personally spoken to Shivraj ji also."" DGCA has now sought a report from Air India regarding the issue. This comes after a 2022 directive from the regulator that instructed the airline not to sell unserviceable seats, following complaints from business-class passengers who were downgraded to economy due to unusable seats.Air India responded to Chouhan's post, apologising for the inconvenience. Later, an airline spokesperson issued an official statement: ""This does not reflect the standard of service we strive to provide to our guests, and we are conducting a thorough investigation into the matter to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.""Supply chain constraints have delayed the repair of Air India's older aircraft, with the airline stating that its entire narrow-body fleet, like the one Chouhan flew on, is expected to be revamped this year. However, the overhaul of its aging wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft will take an additional two years.","Shivraj Singh Chouhan was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight.

NAYPYITAW: The Indian Embassy in Myanmar on Friday said that four Indian nationals who were victims of scam operations in Myawaddy have been repatriated.The Embassy advised against accepting such job offers and entry/exit without border immigration in Myanmar and Thailand, which can restrict future entry.In a post on X, the Indian Embassy said, ""We facilitated exit permit by Myanmar authorities for these 4 Indian nationals from Myawaddy compounds and repatriation through' Yangon y'day. We strongly advise against such job offers and entry/exit without border immigration in Myanmar/Thailand, which can restrict future entry.""So far, a total of 36 Indian nationals who were victims of the Myawaddy scam compounds have been repatriated.32 of those were repatriated on April 10, while four were released from Myawaddy cyber-scam networks on April 12.In a statement, the Embassy reiterated its warning against falling for fraudulent job offers and emphasised that unauthorised movement across the Myanmar-Thailand border is illegal and may result in future entry bans.In a post on X, the Indian Embassy in Myanmar wrote on April 10, ""32 Indian nationals, victims of Myawaddy scam compounds, repatriated through' Mae Sot today.

Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain: Dhankhar on discovery of cash at high court judge's house

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday criticised the Supreme Court’s recent judgment that set a timeline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by governors, saying such a directive undermines the constitutional role of the country’s highest office.Speaking to the sixth batch of Rajya Sabha interns at the Vice-President’s Enclave, Dhankhar questioned, “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?”""There is a directive to the President by a recent judgement. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day. President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, becomes law,"" Dhankhar added.""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" he further added.Also read: In a first, SC sets 3-month deadline for President to decide on bills referred by governors He added that the Constitution gives the judiciary the power to interpret the law under Article 145(3), but it does not authorise courts to issue directives to the President.""The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3). There it has to be five judges or more,"" the VP said.His comments come in response to an April 8 judgment by the Supreme Court, which for the first time imposed a three-month deadline for the President to act on bills reserved by state governors. The apex court held that any delay beyond this period must be justified, and urged state governments to cooperate with the Centre on such matters. The ruling followed a constitutional standoff in Tamil Nadu, where Governor RN Ravi had withheld assent to several bills for extended periods, prompting the state to seek judicial intervention.Speaking on the alleged discovery of cash at former Delhi high court judge Yashwant Verma's house, Dhankhar said the President and Governors enjoy constitutional immunity from prosecution, a privilege not extended to other public figures, including judges.Dhankhar said it has been over a month since the issue came to light and “let the worms and skeletons be in public domain”.""It is now over a month. Even if it is can of worms. Even if there are skeletons in the cupboard, time to blow up the can. Time for its lid to go out. And time for the cupboard to collapse. Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain so that cleansing takes place,"" VP Jagdeep Dhankhar said.The Supreme Court, in its ruling, had set aside the Tamil Nadu Governor ’s second round of referring ten bills to the President, calling it legally flawed. The justices clarified that if the President withholds assent, the state government has the right to challenge the decision in court.","Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court's recent judgment that set a timeline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by governors.

The attacks, which lasted nearly 60 hours, were planned and executed with support from individuals operating out of Pakistan.The statement came just days after a Delhi court sent Rana to 18-day custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), stating that there was sufficient material on record to justify custodial interrogation.Special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh observed that the conspiracy involving Rana extended beyond India’s borders and included targets in multiple Indian cities, including the national capital.“The material produced on record reflect that the conspiracy in question travels beyond the geographical borders of India and multiple targets in the form of various places in multiple cities in India, including the national capital, were sought to be identified,” the judge observed.He further said Rana needed to be confronted with witnesses and forensic and documentary evidence seized during the investigation. This included material related to reconnaissance visits conducted by the accused and his accomplices.“This exercise indicates the necessity of custodial interrogation for which time is required,” the court said, adding that a thorough investigation was vital to ensuring national security. The court also noted that the NIA must be given a fair opportunity to uncover the complete picture. “The investigating agency should get a fair chance to thoroughly investigate the matter so as to present before the court complete facts in a holistic manner.”","Tahawwur Hussain Rana is a key accused and close associate of David Coleman Headley.

He called Article 142 a “nuclear missile” in the judiciary’s arsenal which is ""available to the judiciary 24 x 7.""The Vice President also raised concerns over the handling of the case involving Justice Yashwant Varma , following reports of semi-burnt sacks of cash discovered at the judge’s official residence in Delhi.“You cannot direct the President. The only authority under the Constitution to interpret the law lies with a bench of five or more judges under Article 145(3),” he said.Also read: VP takes on SC over deadline for President to decide on Bills ""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" the VP added.Expressing concern over the perceived erosion of the separation of powers , he added: “The legislature, judiciary, and executive must operate within their domains. Any encroachment by one risks destabilising the entire system.”""Time has come for our three institutions, Legislature, Judiciary, and Executive, to blossom. And they blossom best when they operate in their own area. Any incursion by one in the domain of the other poses a challenge, which is not good. It can upset the balance,"" Dhankhar said.Speaking at the valedictory event of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Programme, Dhankhar questioned the absence of a formal investigation in the Justice Verma case, saying that the rule of law must prevail irrespective of an individual's position.""Let me take the incidents that are most recent. They are dominating our minds. An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves: Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation--and ordinary situations define rule of law--things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before. They were in some kind of limbo, deeply concerned and worried at this explosive, alarming expose,"" he said.Dhankhar criticised the lack of a First Information Report (FIR) in the case, noting that while anyone in India can be booked without prior approval, special permission is required to initiate proceedings against judges.He pointed out that this is not a constitutional safeguard, stating that immunity under the Constitution is reserved only for the President and Governors.""An FIR in this country can be registered against anyone--any constitutional functionary, including the one before you. One has only to activate the rule of law. No permission is required. But if it is judges--FIR cannot be straightaway registered. It has to be approved by the concerned in judiciary. But that is not given in the Constitution. The Constitution of India has accorded immunity from prosecution only to the Hon'ble President and the Hon'ble Governors. So how come a category beyond law has secured this immunity? Because the ill-effects of this are being felt in the mind of one and all. Every Indian, young and old, is deeply concerned. If the event had taken place at his house, the speed would have been an electronic rocket. Now, it is not even a cattle cart,"" the VP said.",Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar issues a sharp rebuke to the judiciary for overstepping its mandate.

Further, it told the government that non-Muslims won't be appointed to Central Waqf Councils and State Waqf Boards.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday put a hold on several provisions of the recently enacted Waqf Act for seven days and directed the central government to maintain the status quo till the next hearing.The bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and justices Sanjay Kumar and KV Viswanthan accepted solicitor general Tushar Mehta's assurance that the government will not make appointments to the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards as per the 2025 Waqf Amendment Act and that properties already declared waqf by user and registered under the original 1995 Act will not be disturbed.Further, the apex court also directed the government to file a response to the petitions within a week and allowed petitioners, challenging the amendment Act, to file a rejoinder in five days thereafter.The bench, on the other hand, said it was impossible to deal with a number of pleas on the issue and clarified it would only five of them while asking lawyers to decide among themselves who would argue. The petitioners, the bench said, could file their rejoinders to the Centre's reply within five days of the service of the government's response.Read also: What is 'waqf by user' and why was it flagged by Supreme Court?

US Visa Denial: Indian national’s US visa denied in 40 seconds. What went wrong in 3 questions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-nationals-us-visa-denied-in-40-seconds-what-went-wrong-in-3-questions/articleshow/120376052.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: An Indian national shared their disappointing experience on Reddit of being denied a US B1/B2 tourist visa within 40 seconds of their interview, despite having a steady job and a clear travel plan. The post has since drawn widespread attention, sparking a discussion on common pitfalls in the US visa application process.The user, who planned a two-week vacation in Florida to visit popular attractions like Disney World and Universal Studios, said their visa interview at the US Embassy was cut short after just three questions.“Why do you want to travel to the US?”, “Have you travelled outside of India?”, and “Do you have family or friends in the US?”, these were the only questions asked before the consular officer handed over a 214(b) refusal slip.In response, the user admitted they had no prior international travel experience and that their girlfriend resides in Florida. “I said yes, my girlfriend lives in Florida whom I plan to visit,” they explained. Immediately after this, the officer declared them ineligible.A fellow Reddit user summed up the situation bluntly: “You’re a textbook denial, unfortunately for you. You have zero travel history, and a girlfriend in the US. That’s a strong tie to America and no strong reason to return to India.”Failure to demonstrate strong ties to one's home country is among the most common reasons for visa rejection. These ties can include stable employment, property, or family commitments.In this case, despite the applicant having a steady job in India, the lack of international travel history combined with the mention of a romantic partner in the US may have raised red flags regarding the risk of overstaying.Visa applicants are also advised to ensure clarity and consistency in presenting their travel purpose. Providing incorrect or inconsistent information about travel plans, or failing to adequately explain the purpose of the visit, can raise doubts and lead to denial.While the Redditor was honest about their reasons, others on the thread suggested a more cautious approach. One user advised, “You could have just said, ‘I have a friend.’ There was no need to say girlfriend.” Another recommended building a stronger travel record by first visiting countries in Europe or Asia.Before applying for a US visa, applicants must prepare thoroughly for the interview by familiarising themselves with the purpose of their trip and being able to articulate their travel plans clearly.","An Indian national shared their disappointing experience on Reddit of being denied a US B1/B2 tourist visa.

Delhi is the hub for both these airlines. US carriers will also increase nonstops once the Russia overflying restrictions they face are removed.GMR Airports executive director (south) SGK Kishore said on Wednesday, ""We are looking at a pre-clearance facility for the US.""An airport source said, ""We have asked govt for a US CBP pre-clearance facility at IGIA. This is a govt-to-govt process that will take some time.""

They will just take their bags on arrival and quickly walk out of the airport.""Landing into the busiest US airports like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles or Chicago at peak arrival times means long queues at immigration, especially for the wide majority of passengers in coach. So running out of planes — something seen in India regularly — is common to avoid being too far back in those queues. Just to skip this, many travellers from India fly Etihad via Abu Dhabi, which has a CBP.A CBP at IGIA could see many travellers skip their one-stop connecting flights on foreign airlines with their hubs in the Gulf, Europe or Southeast Asia. It will also help the govt aim of establishing IGIA as a global hub, with US-bound passengers from some nearby countries also opting to fly via Delhi.The US CBP website says pre-clearance is the ""strategic stationing of CBP personnel at designated foreign airports to inspect travellers prior to boarding US-bound flights. With pre-clearance, travellers then bypass CBP and Transportation Security Administration inspections upon US arrival and proceed directly to their connecting flight or destination.""CBP currently has over 600 officers at 15 pre-clearance locations in six countries. For Indian travellers, the closest pre-clearance is at Abu Dhabi and Etihad has been adding US nonstops with an eye on India.

NEW DELHI: India has no intention of getting itself embroiled in a trade war with Bangladesh even though the signalling from Dhaka on trade issues remains far from positive. While Bangladesh has been reported to have blocked yarn imports through land borders from India, Indian government sources maintain that India’s recent withdrawal of the trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh in 2020 was meant to ease congestion at Indian ports and airports.India has ensured that this action does not impact Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan transiting through Indian territory.Amid a series of anti-India statements and also actions by Dhaka that bordered on trade hostilities, PM Narendra Modi had urged Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus in their recent meeting in Bangkok to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere. The Indian side believes that even before the transshipment facility was blocked, the interim government in Bangladesh had taken steps that threatened to disrupt trade ties.The decisions to shut 3 land ports with India and also to block yarn imports were all taken in March. Dhaka’s decision to “tighten vigilance” at the Benapole Customs House in January was also seen as a restrictive move. Bangladesh knitwear manufacturers have already warned the government that the decision to block yarn imports will prove to be suicidal for apparel exporters.While looking to restrict trade with India, the interim government has also resumed direct trade with Pakistan. Bangladesh agreed in February to purchase 50,000 tonnes of Pakistani rice through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP).Amid reports of increasing radicalisation in Bangladesh, the revival of Dhaka’s ties with Pakistan, which India sees as the fountainhead of global terrorism, has been of particular concern to Indian authorities.

Waqf laws in India so far



1913 & 1923: Early laws validated and regulated Muslim endowments .

. 1954 & 1995: The Wakf Acts created State Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council.

2013: Major reforms by the UPA included formal recognition of waqf by user, stricter rules against property misuse, inclusion of women on waqf boards, and expanded lease rights.

2025: The NDA’s amendments aimed at tightening definitions, curbing misuse, and boosting transparency—sparking debate about historical erasure and administrative overreach.



Centre to submit response in 7 days: SC



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday resumed hearing petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta defending the legislation and citing public concern over vast areas being declared as Waqf land. The court granted 7 days to Centre to file a preliminary response.A day earlier, on Wednesday, the Court had questioned the Centre’s move to remove the concept of "" waqf by user "" from the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, warning that the change could potentially erase the status of thousands of longstanding religious properties across India. The Centre, however, opposed the directive and sought a hearing.The top court's bench said, ""The properties declared by courts as waqfs should not be de-notified as waqfs, whether they are by waqf-by-user or waqf by deed, while the court is hearing the challenge to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025 .""The CJI-led bench asked the Centre how waqf properties established through uninterrupted religious or charitable use -- but lacking formal documents - would now be treated. “How will you register such waqfs by user? What documents will they have? It will lead to undoing something. Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also,” the court observed, citing legal precedents that have so far recognised such waqfs.The court also questioned the exclusivity of waqf board membership, mentioning, “All members of the waqf boards and Central Waqf Council must be Muslims, except ex-officio members,” and asked whether Hindus would be allowed to participate in their own religious trusts, highlighting questions of parity in religious administration.A waqf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable property by a Muslim for religious, pious, or charitable purposes recognised by Islamic law. It is typically managed by a 'mutawalli' (caretaker), and cannot be sold or transferred.'Waqf by user' refers to the practice where a property, such as a mosque, dargah, graveyard, or community kitchen, is treated as waqf not because of a formal written deed, but because it has been consistently and openly used for religious or charitable purposes over a long period.This concept was legally recognised through court rulings and codified in the Waqf Amendment Act, 2013, passed by the UPA government.It allowed properties to be recorded as waqf even in the absence of documentary proof, based on community usage and long-standing public acceptance.The idea was to protect heritage structures that predated modern land registration systems.Also read: In 10 big numbers - Waqf and its properties in India According to data available on the Waqf Assets Management System of India (WAMSI) portal, 30 states and Union territories along with 32 Boards have reported a total of 8.72 lakh Waqf properties, spanning over 38 lakh acres. Of these, 4.02 lakh properties are classified as ""waqf by user.""Waqf properties in India form one of the largest networks of religious and community-owned land globally, encompassing a diverse range of assets across the country.These include 1,50,516 graveyards (17%) and 1,19,200 mosques (14%). Commercial properties such as shops (1,13,187) and houses (92,505) contribute to the economic sustenance of the Waqf system. Additionally, 1,40,784 properties are agricultural land (16%), while religious sites like dargahs and mazars account for 33,492 properties.The Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, introduced by the NDA government, removed or majorly limited the concept of 'waqf by user'. It made documentary ownership a requirement, stating that only a ""practising Muslim for at least five years"" who is the legal owner of a property can declare it as waqf.The Centre argued that the 2013 law led to ""misuse and wrongful classification"" of lands -- including government or private property -- as waqf, often without valid proof.Critics, however, fear that the amendment could jeopardise ""centuries-old Islamic institutions"" that lack formal records but have served as religious spaces for generations.The 2025 law does offer some protection by stating that already ""registered"" waqf-by-user properties will remain so -- unless challenged or identified as government property . But concerns remain over thousands of sites that may be ""unregistered or under dispute"".India has a long legislative history concerning waqf, dating back to British rule:The Supreme Court resumed its hearing on Thursday, hearing petitions challenging Waqf Amendment Act. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta defended the legislation, citing widespread public concern over large areas being declared as Waqf land. He requested a week to file a preliminary response.The bench declined to stay the Act but stressed maintaining status quo during the hearing. It also recorded the Centre’s assurance that no appointments would be made to Waqf bodies in the meantime. The matter will be heard next week.","A waqf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable property by a Muslim for religious, pious, or charitable purposes recognised by Islamic law.

NEW DELHI: Protecting the interest of homebuyers, Supreme Court Thursday held that buyers staging a peaceful protest and holding banners at a public place against a realtor without using abusive language wouldn't amount to defamation, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.Observing that right to dissent in a legitimate and lawful manner is an integral part of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and that every individual must respect the right of others to dissent, the court quashed criminal defamation proceedings initiated against some homebuyers for holdinga protest against a builder in Mumbai.The case was lodged by the builder alleging that their action of holding banners against it amounts to defamation.""Right to protest peacefully without falling foul of the law is a corresponding right, which the consumers ought to possess just as the seller enjoys his right to commercial speech. Any attempt to portray them as criminal offences, when the necessary ingredients are not made out, would be a clear abuse of process and should be nipped in the bud,"" Justice K V Viswanathan, who penned the judgement on behalf of the bench also comprising a bench of Justice N Kotiswar Singh, said.SC noted the grievance raised in banner was with regard to civic issues they were facing including not forming society, problems of water, poor lift maintenance, seepage, plumbing issues etc and they used the caption ""we protest for our rights"".""At the outset, what strikes us is that there is no foul or intemperate language employed against the respondent. There is no reference to any expression like fraud, cheating, misappropriation etc. In mild language, certain issues, which the appellants perceived as their grievances have been aired,"" the court observed.SC said that no case was made out for criminal defamation which depends on the choice of words used and to constitute the offence of defamation there should be imputation concerning any person with intent to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person.""Language is the vehicle through which thoughts are conveyed. Had the appellants exceeded their privilege in erecting the banner? We do not think so. As set out earlier, all that the banner depicts is what they thought were their grievances against the respondent with whom they had a business relationship. The banner sets out that one of the issues was ""ignoring grievances"" implying thereby that there have been running issues between the two - something which is bound to occur in a builder-buyer relationship,"" the bench said.",Supreme Court quashes criminal defamation proceedings initiated against some homebuyers.

It coincides with the party's focus to empower district units, and the protests can be the vehicle to assess the enthusiasm of the new heads of the lower rungs of the organisation.Meanwhile, Congress announced Rahul Gandhi will be on a tour to US for a university interaction and public meetings.

Bridge on the river Magai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bridge-on-the-river-magai/articleshow/120397018.cms,"The bridge, likely to be 105ft, has been designed by an ex-Army engineer

When there's a will, there's a way, they say. Residents of Kyampur Chhavni, a village in UP's Ghazipur district, say when there's a will, there's a bridge... not yet, but soon. Tired of waiting for authorities, these villagers have crowdfunded and pooled resources to begin building a bridge on a tiny river - the Magai - that has long stood between them and the rest of the world.The district administration says the villagers were impatient, that they should have waited. Residents say they have waited 58 years - long enough!The Magai is 70ft wide, and the lack of a bridge has had a huge effect on not just the 3,500-odd residents of Kyampur village, but more than 70,000 residents of around 50 villages on either side of the river, who have had to take a 40km detour to cover a distance of less than 10km to reach the district headquarters.Villagers have tried crossing the river to reach Nonahara market, 3km from district hospital and headquarters, but there have been accidents in the past.Things began to look up in June 2022, when the then gram pradhan, Shashi Kala Upadhyay and Kasimabad block pramukh Manoj Gupta started work on an embankment along the river with provisions for a vehicular bridge. But just as villagers started to get hopeful, the project, undertaken under MGNREGS, encountered ""administrative hurdles"".In Jan 2024, Ravindra Yadav, a civil engineer with 55 Engineer Regiment of India Army's Corps of Engineers, came to live in his ancestral house in Kyampur after retirement. ""I served in the Army for three decades and helped build bridges across the country, particularly in remote areas of Nagaland and Manipur,"" says Ravindra, who also served in Border Roads Organisation. ""After retiring, I was disheartened to discover my village still lacking direct connectivity with the district headquarters. I decided to build a bridge, and fortunately received support from villagers and influential individuals, including architects and bridge engineers I met during my service.""Ravindra gave Rs 10 lakh from his retirement funds and offered technical expertise to help build the bridge.""This gesture galvanised local sentiment and gave confidence to locals,"" says Ravindra's elder brother, Kalika.""People chipped in with whatever they could,"" says Ram Naresh Rajbhar, a village elder. ""Contributions as little as Rs 100 were made. Those who had no money offered help in kind - cement, sand, steel rebars and labour, after finishing their regular jobs.""Ravindra readied the design for a 105ft bridge across the river, and the project was ready to be reborn.The ground-breaking ceremony was on Feb 25, 2024. Present at the event was Allahabad HC's Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav. In his short speech, the judge praised the grit and spirit of local residents.""So far, apart from constructing retaining walls on both banks, four pillars have been erected,"" says Kalika, who is account-keeper. ""Slabbing is in progress. We have spent around Rs 65 lakh, and need Rs 30 lakh more to complete girder and slab work and to build a slope up to the approach road.""The villagers' efforts were also noticed by Mohammadabad MLA Suhaib Ansari, who donated Rs 1 lakh and high-mast lights to illuminate the construction site for late-night work.Ansari says when his father, Sibgatullah Ansari was MLA between 2012 and 2017, he had forwarded the bridge construction file to state govt, and upon becoming MLA himself in 2022, Ansari raised the issue in his inaugural speech, requesting immediate funds. .The villagers, however, aren't convinced. They blame their plight on a lack of political will.""Since 1967, villagers have been demanding a bridge on the Magai from public representatives,"" says Kalika. ""Before every election, they used to send junior engineers or other officials with measurement machines. After being voted to office, all promises were forgotten,"" Kalika added.The district administration has also taken note of the under-construction bridge. ""Experts from PWD and UP Bridge Corporation are checking the structures built by the villagers for quality and load-bearing standards,"" says DM Aryka Akhauri. She says the villagers have been asked to halt work until the checks are over. This is important for public safety, she adds, because experts were not involved in the construction, nor were permissions sought for the work.But villagers are not waiting any longer. As dusk descends, they get ready with spades, shovels and a whole lot of resolve - there's a bridge to be built, after all.","Kyampur Chhavni, a village in UP's Ghazipur district, has waited 58 years for a bridge.

NEW DELHI: Vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar Thursday took exception to Supreme Court 's ruling setting a timeline for the President and governors to decide on bills, saying, ""We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?""A ddressing the 6th batch of Rajya Sabha interns at VP Enclave Thursday, Dhankhar said, “Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not.

The court had invoked the article while pronouncing its judgement against Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi.

No SC stay as govt puts key waqf law provisions on hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-sc-stay-as-govt-puts-key-waqf-law-provisions-on-hold/articleshow/120395153.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union govt Thursday pre-empted a looming stay on certain contentious provisions of the recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act by assuring Supreme Court that it will make no appointments to the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards and maintain status quo on waqf properties , including 'waqf by user', already registered or declared under the Waqf Act, 1995.Accepting solicitor general Tushar Mehta's assurance and refraining from ordering interim stay on certain provisions of the Act, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan asked the Centre, states and all waqf boards to file their responses to the 150-odd petitions within seven days.The SG's assurance came after the CJI observed, ""We had said there were some positive things in the law. We have also stated that there cannot be a complete stay. At the same time, we also don't want the situation to change from what is prevailing now."" The CJI flagged the 'waqf by user' provision and the stipulation that a person had to be practising Islam for five years to be eligible to be a waqif but did not elaborate further.The court asked the petitioners, who have challenged the constitutional validity of the changes made to the Waqf Act, 1995, on the ground that these violated Muslims' fundamental right to religion, to file rejoinders in five days after the Centre, states and waqf boards file their responses. It posted further hearing on May 5. As CJI Khanna retires on May 13, it is to be seen whether he will hear the petitions or assign these to another bench.Since the Central Waqf Council has been defunct for the last three years, the assurances made by Mehta not to make any appointment to the council appears to be of little consequence to the Union govt.T he petitioners have questioned the provision for nomination of two non-Muslims to the council and boards as interference in the Muslim community’s fundamental right under Article 26.The Solicitor General clarified that if states nominate members to Auqaf Boards, most of which are continuing as their remaining tenure is protected by the Act, in the next two weeks when SC is seized of the matter, it would be termed void.The assurance to preserve the sanctity of waqfs and ‘waqfs by user’ already registered or notified under the Waqf Act, 1995, is part of the amended Act, which says, “… existing ‘waqf by user’ properties registered on or before the commencement of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, as ‘waqf by user’ will remain as waqf properties except that the property, wholly or in part, is in dispute or is a government property”.What the assurance means is that govt may not reopen ‘waqf by user’ properties, which have been registered prior to the amended Act, even if there is a dispute about the property being govt land. This was one of the major concerns of the petitioners who said the validity of old waqf properties could be reopened by creating a dispute about these being govt properties. This would also mean that undeclared or unregistered waqf properties, including those through ‘waqf by user’, could be subject to scrutiny to identify legitimacy of ownership and whether it was govt land.When the hearing started, the SG said it would be harsh if the court was considering staying some provisions of the Act on taking a prima facie view without a detailed scrutiny of the history of the 1995 Waqf Act from its inception in 1923, joint parliamentary committee deliberations and its report as well as the object behind enactment of the amendment by Parliament.Mehta said govt was answerable to the people and Parliament and pointed out that village after village had been declared waqf property, resulting in thousands of people losing their land. This had weighed with the govt while introducing the bill to amend the Waqf Act, he said, adding that the court must be alive to the fallout of its decision.Given the difficulties in managing the hearing when there was a constant inflow of fresh petitions that resulted in engaging of a greater number of advocates, CJI Khanna said the petitioners must select five petitions as the lead ones and a nodal counsel to coordinate.Rest of the petitions would either be regarded as applications or disposed of and the case list would not be in any individual or organisation’s name but be shown as ‘In Re: Waqf (Amendment) Act’, he suggested.The CJI-led bench was overwhelmed by a courtroom packed with counsel representing over 150 petitioners and many unable to enter the courtroom because of overcrowding. Live webcast of proceedings in the case remained elusive for many lawyers and journalists as it reached maximum capacity much before commencement of hearing at 2pm.On earlier occasions, the SC used to resort to live telecast through its own YouTube channel but, surprisingly, for this nationally important case, the same procedure was not adopted and officials expressed inability to accommodate lawyers and journalists.","Union govt pre-empted a looming stay on certain contentious provisions of the recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act.

Terming the delay ""inhumane"", the court remarked, ""Teachers are human beings... they have a belly. They need to eat too."" The directive followed revelations that despite providing continued service, the college staff did not receive salaries due to the state govt's decision to withhold grants.The institute was denied grant-in-aid status in 2015 on the grounds that it was newly established even though it had consistently demonstrated strong academic performance. Highlighting the school's academic record, the court pointed out that all 294 students who appeared in the 2021 board examinations passed, with 93 securing first division. The school maintained commendable results in 2022 and 2024, achieving an 82.7% pass rate in the most recent academic session. HC noted that the recruitment process had been properly conducted and that staff had diligently fulfilled their duties. However, the education department stalled appointments and withheld grant approval due to alleged irregularities, eventually blacklisting the institution.In 2022, the director of education ordered the cancellation of all appointments made after Oct 25, 2016. HC later stayed this order, observing that the affected teachers were discharging their duties sincerely and that such administrative actions could not justify withholding their rightful salaries.On Wednesday, HC said ""mere procedural lapses in recruitment cannot be grounds to deny salaries to staff who've been working in students' interest"".","B R Ambedkar Inter College, Dehradun, was denied grant-in-aid status in 2015.

The Indian govt reiterated on Thursday that India's recent withdrawal of the trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh in 2020 was meant to ease congestion at Indian ports and airports.India has ensured that this action does not impact Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan transiting through Indian territory. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it's important to look at the developments that have happened on the Bangladeshi side prior to India announcing these measures.The Indian side believes that even before the trans-shipment facility was blocked by India, the interim government in Bangladesh had taken several steps that threatened to disrupt trade ties. The decisions to shut the three land ports with India and also to block yarn imports were all taken in March. Dhaka's decision to ""tighten vigilance"" at the Benapole Customs House in January was also seen as a restrictive move. Bangladesh knitwear manufacturers have already warned govt that the decision to block yarn imports will prove to be suicidal for apparel exporters.""Our announcement regarding trans-shipment in no manner impacts Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan. We do have in mind that regional trade needs to be promoted. We have continued to call for constructive and positive engagement in our relationship with Bangladesh,"" the ministry of external affairs spokesperson added.Amid a series of anti-India statements and actions by Dhaka that bordered on trade hostilities, PM Narendra Modi had urged Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus in their recent meet in Bangkok to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.While looking to restrict trade with India, the interim govt has also resumed direct trade with Pakistan. Bangladesh agreed in Feb to purchase 50,000 tonnes of Pakistani rice through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan.Amid reports of increasing radicalisation in Bangladesh, the revival of Dhaka's ties with Pakistan, which India sees as the fountainhead of global terrorism, has been of particular concern to Indian authorities. To start with, Pakistan is reported to be looking for opportunities to boost its exports to Bangladesh. There has been a dramatic renewal of high-level contacts between the two countries after decades with Pakistan foreign secretary Amna Baloch set to visit the Bangladesh capital on Thursday and foreign minister Ishaq Dar the next week.",India has no intention of getting itself embroiled in a trade war with Bangladesh.

"Bill Aitken, recorder of India's terrain & trains, dies at 90",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-aitken-recorder-of-indias-terrain-trains-dies-at-90/articleshow/120394304.cms,"Bill Aitken

MUSSOORIE: Bill Aitken , the Scottish-born writer who spent more than six decades mapping India's spiritual and geographical life through a body of work that rarely strayed into the abstract, died in Dehradun on Wednesday night. He was 90. Aitken had sustained injuries from a fall at his home in Mussoorie last week and was admitted to hospital in critical condition. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated near the Ganga in Haridwar on Thursday.Born in 1934 in Tullibody, a small town in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, Aitken came to India in 1959 after completing a Master's degree in comparative religion at the University of Leeds. He arrived not by plane but overland - hitchhiking through Europe, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, a route that later became the 'Hippy Trail' for young westerners on spiritual sojourn to the east - carrying with him a curiosity that would later permeate all his writing.Aitken taught briefly at Hindi High School in Kolkata before retreating into the Himalayas , where he lived in the ashrams of Kausani & Mirtola in Kumaon for over a decade. These early years in Uttarakhand, then part of UP, shaped his worldview and the quiet, observational quality that would come to define his work.In 1960s, Aitken moved to Mussoorie, serving as companion and confidant to Prithwi Bir Kaur, the widow maharani of the former Sikh princely state of Jind. In 1972, he became a naturalised Indian citizen. Oakless, the quaint house where he lived for several years along with his pet dogs, remained his homestead till the end. Even though he preferred to lead a restrained - some would say reclusive - life, he warmly welcomed those who sought him out, whether curious locals, or fawning fans. His quintessential Scottish humour ensured that those who met him often returned with a smile.Aitken's literary output spanned spiritual geography , railways, mountain culture, and long-distance travel. His most recognised titles include 'Seven Sacred Rivers', 'Footloose in the Himalaya', 'The Nanda Devi Affair', 'Zanskar: The Hidden Kingdom', and 'Divining the Deccan'. He was not a writer given to sweeping rhetorical flourishes; instead, his sentences unfurled with the deliberateness of someone used to moving through terrain on foot or two wheels. He was, for years, a familiar figure along India's less-travelled roads, travelling by motorcycle, rail, or simply on foot.His relationship with Indian Railways bordered on the archival. Aitken served as president of the Friends of the National Rail Museum in New Delhi and as honorary librarian of the Himalayan Club. In books like 'Exploring Indian Railways' and 'Branch Line to Eternity', he traced not just the routes and locomotives but the sensory experience of train travel - its silences, its halts, and the forgotten dignity of branch lines.Though often classified under travel, Aitken's books were, in spirit, records of residence - documents of immersion, not movement. Even though he had stopped writing for a while, budding writers in the town often sought him out, and he would often entertain their requests for a foreword.Incidentally, Aitken spoke fluent Hindi and Garhwali, which allowed him to blend into environments where outsiders stood out. His last book, 'Sri Sathya Sai Baba - A Life', in 2004, was a reflective biography of the spiritual leader he followed but never idolised.Sunil Arora of Cambridge Book Depot in Mussoorie, where Aitken's books have long held a quiet prominence on the travel shelf, recalled the writer's understated ritual of autographing books with handwritten phrases in Hindi: 'Jai Himalaya' for 'The Nanda Devi Affair' and 'Jai Ganga Maiya' for 'Seven Sacred Rivers'. ""He didn't sign often,"" Arora said, ""but when he did, he always did it with intent.""Ganesh Saili, a fellow writer and longtime resident of Mussoorie, said Aitken's death marked the departure of a kind of chronicler India rarely produces - one who stayed, listened, and wrote without spectacle. ""It is an immense loss to the diminishing number of writers community in Mussoorie,"" Saili said. ""We are deeply saddened.""","Aitken came to India in 1959 after completing a Master's degree in comparative religion.

NEW DELHI: As former Jammu and Kashmir CM Farooq Abdullah cries 'betrayal' over former RAW secretary and 'friend' A S Dulat 's claim in his latest book that the senior Abdullah had privately supported the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, the ex-spymaster has clarified that all that he meant to convey is that Farooq always wanted to be on the right side of Delhi, albeit on his own terms.""If he is saying I have betrayed him, he possibly has not read the book. The book is not a critique but praises Farooq Abdullah for the leader he is. As former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief and my ex-boss M K Narayanan says in the foreword of 'The Chief Minister and The Spy', Abdullah is one of the tallest leaders in Kashmir and the country. And I stand by that,"" Dulat told TOI on Thursday.In the chapter 'Abrogation and its Aftermath', Dulat writes that Farooq Abdullah was terribly hurt by the Modi govt's Aug 5, 2019 decision to nullify Article 370 in J&K. ""Just as the BJP had never hidden its intentions towards Kashmir as far as Article 370 was concerned, so, too, had Farooq been extremely open about his willingness to work with New Delhi. Maybe, he said, the National Conference could even have had the proposal passed in the legislative assembly in Jammu and Kashmir. 'We would have helped,' he told me when I met him in 2020. 'Why were we not taken into confidence?"" wrote the former spy.Farooq, as per Dulat, was however shattered by his house arrest in wake of the abrogation. Dulat's latest account, published by Juggernaut, is replete with rhapsodies of praise for the NC veteran; the writer claims that Farooq and he, sent to Kashmir to head the IB office there, hit if off from the word go and would often set protocol aside to sit and discuss Kashmir affairs over drinks and dinner. IB reports to the Union home ministry.Another interesting revelation by Dulat relates to the abduction of then Union minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed's daughter Rubaiya Sayeed in 1989. Dulat, who was then heading the IB office in Kashmir, said JKLF had initially planned to abduct Safia, eldest daughter of then chief minister Farooq Abdullah, but dropped the idea due to the high security around their Gupkar Road residence. In the meantime, Dulat wrote, V P Singh was sworn in as PM on Dec 2, 1989, and Mufti was made India's first home minister. This is when JKLF got a brainwave: ""Why not pick up Rubaiya?"". Mufti was then seen as Delhi's man, with no real connection to the Valley.Farooq initially opposed the Centre's decision to release militants in exchange for Rubaiya, but eventually acquiesced, having told Mufti earlier ""not to worry"".Farooq had also voiced reservations to the release of Mushtaq Zargar, a Kashmiri militant, as part of the IC-814 hostage swap deal, while being okay with freeing Masood Azhar and Omar Sheikh. However, then governor Gary Saxena convinced the chief minister - over a drink of ""Black Label"" - that it was the only option, given the circumstances.",Former RAW secretary and 'friend' A S Dulat's claim in his latest book that the senior Abdullah had privately supported the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K.

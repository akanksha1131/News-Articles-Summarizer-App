But there should be a big memorial to Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje in Sambhajinagar,” he stated.Athawale’s remarks come amid protests by certain Hindu groups demanding the removal of Aurangzeb’s tomb, alleging that the 17th-century Mughal ruler was responsible for atrocities against Hindus. He, however, pointed out that the site is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).“We have to move forward with the ideology of Sambhaji Maharaj but there should be peace in the country,” he said.Urging Muslims to disassociate themselves from Aurangzeb, Athawale added, “My request to the Muslim community is that you should not associate yourself with Aurangzeb. The Muslims here were Hindus. The Muslims here are not the children of Aurangzeb. They have no relation with him.”Reiterating his stance, Athawale said, “There is a demand to remove the grave of Aurangzeb in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. I think this cemetery is there for the last 500-600 years and it comes under the Archaeological Survey of India... The demand to remove that grave is not right.

FIR against Kamra



Opposition support



NEW DELHI: Comedian Kunal Kamra on Sunday sparked controversy after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde during a show in Mumbai.The incident drew a sharp response from Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) workers who went on to vandalise the venue where Kamra performed.During his stand-up show, Kamra performed a parody of a popular Hindi song from ""Dil To Pagal Hai,"" referring to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). He also made jokes about recent political developments in Maharashtra, including party splits within Shiv Sena and NCP.“Meri nazar se tum dekho to gaddar nazar wo aaye. Haaye,"" Kunal Kamra said during his show.""Shiv Sena first came out of the BJP, then Shiv Sena came out of Shiv Sena. NCP came out of NCP, they gave nine buttons to one voter... everyone got confused,"" he added.According to police officials, Shiv Sena workers vandalized Hotel Unicontinental in Mumbai’s Khar area, where Kamra's show with the 'gaddar' (traitor) jibe at Eknath Shinde was filmed. They also sought an FIR against him.AN FIR was registered against Shiv Sena Yuva Sena general secretary Rahool Kanal and 19 others for vandalising the Habitat standup comedy set under various sections of BNS and Maharashtra Police Act.Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel filed an FIR against Kamra and issued an ultimatum, demanding an apology within two days. Patel threatened to restrict Kamra's movement in Mumbai and promised to raise the issue in the assembly.""We have filed an FIR against Kunal Kamra for his comments against our leader and Maharashtra's DCM Eknath Shinde. We have demanded quick action against him. I want to tell him to apologize to Eknath Shinde within two days, otherwise, Shiv Sainiks will not let him move about freely in Mumbai,"" Patel said.""If he is seen anywhere in public, we will paint his face black... We will take up this issue in the assembly and request our state's home minister to order action against him as soon as possible,"" he added.Party leaders dismissed Kamra as a ""hired comedian"" making comments for money.""Kunal Kamra is a hired comedian, and he is making comments on our leader for some money. Let alone Maharashtra, Kunal Kamra cannot freely go anywhere in India; Shiv Sainiks will show him his place. We feel sorry for Sanjay Raut and Shiv Sena (UBT) that they have no party workers or leaders left to make comments on our leader, which is why they are hiring people like him (Kunal Kamra) for the job,"" Mhaske said.The opposition, particularly Shiv Sena (UBT), defended Kamra and condemned the attack. Aaditya Thackeray called the vandalism an act of cowardice by ""Mindhe's gang"" and questioned the state's law and order situation.""Mindhe's (read Shinde) coward gang breaks the comedy show stage where comedian Kunal Kamra put out a song on Eknath Mindhe, which was 100 percent true. Only an insecure coward would react to a song by someone,"" Shiv Sena-UBT leader and MLA Aaditya Thackeray said.Sena MP Sanjay Raut shared Kamra's video, praising it as ""Kunal Ka Kamal,"" while Priyanka Chaturvedi criticised the justification of violence over disagreement.","Comedian Kunal Kamra sparked controversy after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde.

House of Nagpur riots accused to be demolished today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-of-nagpur-riots-accused-to-be-demolished-today/articleshow/119399810.cms,"NAGPUR: The house of Fahim Khan, alleged Nagpur riots mastermind now in custody, is set to be demolished Monday after he failed to remove the purported illegal structure within a 24-hour civic deadline. The action loomed even as curfew was lifted Sunday from all areas scarred by the March 17 violence.The action by Nagpur Municipal Corporation against Khan's double-storied house in Sanjay Bagh Colony will be the first such razing of a riot accused's property by the civic body. It will unfold two days after CM Devendra Fadnavis asserted that ""bulldozers will run, if the law permits"". He was responding to a query on whether his BJP-led Mahayuti govt would follow UP CM Yogi Adityanath's model of delivering justice.The demolition will unfold months after the Supreme Court imposed a pan-India ban on "" bulldozer justice "".The SC last Nov had held that such demolition of a citizen's house without following due process of law, merely because the individual is a suspect or even a convict, will be ""totally unconstitutional"". The court laid down elaborate procedures for razing illegal structures and ruled that the state could not breach a family's right to shelter only because one of its members is accused of a heinous crime.The demolition of Khan's house is expected to begin around 10am on Monday with heavy police deployments. NMC had issued notice to Khan on March 21 saying the 86.48sqm house, registered in the name of his wife Zahirunnisa, was illegal.NMC officials inspected the house on March 20 and said it violated Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. The officials said no building plan was approved, making the structure unauthorised. Despite complaints from residents about the encroachment, civic authorities had not acted so far. TOI has a copy of the demolition notice.On Saturday, Nagpur police had sealed two shops after a probe found these were used by rioters linked to Khan's Minority Democratic Party (MDP).Meanwhile, curfew was lifted Sunday from riot-affected areas after a nearly week-long turbulence, a day after CM Fadnavis asserted that 80% of the city was unaffected by the March 17 flare-up. While the curbs were done away, security measures were retained in some sensitive pockets. The death of Irfan Ansari, a 38-year-old riot victim, in hospital on Saturday stoked security concerns. The curfew relief has coincided with festive mood setting in with Gudi Padwa and Eid later this month, followed by Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti in April.","Fahim Khan's double-storied house in Sanjay Bagh Colony will be the first such razing of a riot accused's property by the civic body.

Shiv Sena workers vandalize comedy venue

Political leaders' reactions

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske on Sunday issued a stern warning to stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde during a Mumbai comedy show .Subsequently, Shiv Sena members damaged the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar where the performance took place.During his performance at the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai, Kamra addressed the political division in Maharashtra. A viral video on X showed Kamra's subtle dig at Shinde's rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray and the ensuing political developments.""Shiv Sena first came out of the BJP, then Shiv Sena came out of Shiv Sena. NCP came out of NCP, they gave nine buttons to one voter...everyone got confused,"" Kamra said.Kamra also sang a parody song with reference to Thane—Shinde's political bastion—labeling him a ""gaddar"" (traitor) without naming him.The video, uploaded by Kamra, went viral in no time, garnering over 360,000 views.Sena MP Naresh Mhaske from the Shinde group accused Kamra of being a paid performer hired by Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) to criticise Eknath Shinde.""Kunal Kamra is a hired comedian, and he is making comments on our leader for some money. Let alone Maharashtra, Kunal Kamra cannot freely go anywhere in India, Shiv Sainiks will show him his place.

Kunal Kamra will get a befitting reply, and he will come and apologise for his mistake"", he added.Hours after the video came up, Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) workers vandalized the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar, where Kamra's show was recorded. Reports suggest that the workers smashed property and warned of further action if Kamra continued his criticism.Local police verified the incident and are probing the vandalism, but no formal complaints have been registered by the comedy club as yet.Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena UBT MP, publicly backed Kamra by sharing the comedian’s video and wrote, ""Kunal ki kamal, Jai Maharashtra,"" on X.Priyanka Chaturvedi, Shiv Sena UBT MP, also supported Kamra, referencing Voltaire in her defense of free speech. ""Dear Kunal, stand strong. The man and the gang you exposed will go after you... I will defend to death your right to speak your mind,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena, Shinde faction, also responded. Mhaske doubled down on his position, saying that Kamra would receive a ""befitting reply"" and would eventually apologize for his remarks.

CPM trolled as red display picture of party's Bengal unit turns blue on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cpm-trolled-as-red-display-picture-of-partys-bengal-unit-turns-blue-on-social-media/articleshow/119398229.cms,"'It was just a change in the look of the logo': CPM scrambles to downplay controversy

KOLKATA: CPM is no stranger to political storms. But this time, it's a tempest of trolls. A change in the social media display picture of the party's Bengal unit - swapping the iconic red background for a blue sky and white clouds - has set off a social media frenzy, with netizens seeing shades of irony, humour, and even surrender in the move. For the once-dominant force in Bengal politics , the change is as striking as it is symbolic. The new backdrop - uncannily close to the favourite colours of CM Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress - has led to a digital avalanche of jibes, memes and one-liners.Firbe na aar se firbe na (It will not return), posted netizen Soumik Das, borrowing lyrics from a popular Bengali rock song. The message was clear: CPM, which governed Bengal from 1977 to 2011, is struggling to claw back into relevance.CPM's social media reach is still formidable. Its Instagram handle ""cpimwb"" has over 81,300 followers, while its Facebook page boasts 467,000. But the response to the new display picture has been more about ridicule than resonance - 1,100 comments, 448 shares, and a flood of snarky remarks. The party's electoral fortunes have been equally stark. Once a behemoth in Bengal, it won 26 assembly seats in 2016, clinging to 19.7% of the vote share. But by 2024, CPM had slumped to just 5.7% in Lok Sabha polls.Sensing the growing chatter, party members scrambled to downplay the controversy. ""It was just a change in the look of the logo,"" said CPM central committee member Sujan Chakraborty. ""We've changed it eight times in recent years. Our flag remains a vibrant hue of red. We are not wavering from our commitments to end exploitation.""CPM state panel member Satarup Ghosh was more blunt: ""We don't think the sky, or its allusion, is patented by Trinamool."" In fact, the change had served its purpose, he said. ""You don't see anything other than the hammer and sickle on Facebook now.""For a party whose identity has long been tied to its blood-red banner, the absence of even a speck of red in the new display picture is striking. The red flag, a symbol of socialist struggle since the French Revolution, was proudly adopted by CPM - its hammer and sickle etched in the imagination of leftist politics.But blogger Anirban Hati saw a deeper irony. He recalled how former Kerala CMs EK Nayanar and EMS Namboodiripad slammed author Arundhati Roy decades ago for describing a faded red flag in 'The God of Small Things'. ""Decades later, the Left has no hard-line left,"" Hati wrote, noting how Roy's metaphor now seems uncannily prescient.Netizen Sandip Ghosh had a more gastronomic take on the matter: ""The background fits Didi's favourite colour. Fish fry and mutton kasa will be on the menu again.""Whether the red will return - or continue fading into the blue - remains an open question. But for now, the trolls are having a field day.","A change in the social media display picture of the party's Bengal unit has set off a social media frenzy.

CBI closure reports in 2 cases tied to Rajput death filed in Patna, Mumbai

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Four-and-a half years after it began probing the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput , the CBI is learned to have closed the case and given a clean chit to actor Rhea Chakraborty , bringing curtains on a case that had gripped the country, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14, 2020.The probe agency is learned to have filed a closure report in two of the cases it was investigating, sources said. While one case was filed in Aug 2021 in Patna by Rajput's father against Rhea, her kin and others, the other was filed in Sept by Rhea against Rajput's sister and doctor.The closure report in both was filed in a special Mumbai court, sources said.Rhea's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, ""Rhea Chakraborty had to undergo untold miseries and was behind bars for 27 days for no fault of hers until Justice Sarang V Kotwal released her on bail. I salute her and her family for having kept silent and yet suffered the inhuman treatment they were meted out. Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.""Rajput was found dead 6 days after his PR manager Disha Salian fell off the 14th floor of a Malad tower and died.Rajput was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14, 2020, six days after his PR manager Disha Salian died. Mumbai police , which first probed the case, termed it as a case of suspected suicide, although no suicide note had been found. The provisional post-mortem suggested the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging.Coincidentally, on Wednesday, Disha's father Satish Salian alleged his daughter was gangraped and murdered. He has filed a plea demanding a CBI probe into her death, alleging that Rajput was visibly frightened and repeatedly expressed fear that ""those people"" responsible for her death would not spare him and that he would be killed. He has said both deaths are interconnected and part of a larger conspiracy.The CBI FIR in Rajput's case named Rhea and her kin Indrajit Chakraborty, Sandhya and Showik apart from her associates Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi.The FIR, initially filed by Bihar police , had sections of IPC related to criminal conspiracy, abetment of suicide, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, theft, criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal intimidation.After Rajput's cremation at Vile Parle's Pawan Hans crematorium, Mumbai police began their investigation, recording statements from film and casting director Mukesh Chhabra, Rajput's girlfriend Rhea, and his managerial staff. In July that year, producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali was questioned, stating he had offered Rajput four films, but eventually featured in none.Rhea, who confirmed being in a relationship with Rajput on Twitter (now X), demanded a CBI inquiry. Mumbai police also recorded statements of filmmaker Aditya Chopra and three psychiatrists.Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against Rhea in Patna on July 28, and a team of Bihar police reached Mumbai to probe the case.The Enforcement Directorate inquired about the money laundering angle in the case and questioned Rhea but they found no substance against her. Subsequently, the NCB initiated a probe against her along with others on allegations of procurement of drugs for Rajput which led to her arrest. In Aug 2021, the CBI filed an FIR against Rhea and others, and the ED too summoned her for questioning.An AIIMS forensic team was roped in by the CBI on Aug 22, and the ED unearthed a drug angle in the case, involving the Narcotics Control Bureau .In Sept 2021, Rhea filed an FIR against Rajput's sisters and doctor, which was transferred to the CBI as well.This is the second case which has been closed as well, sources said.In Oct, reports emerged that the AIIMS panel had dismissed the murder theory, although the CBI stated they were probing all angles.","CBI closes actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case, clears Rhea Chakraborty.

These goods – Soft Ferrite Cores, vacuum insulated flasks , aluminium foil, Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid , and Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin – were found to be sold in India at prices below normal market value.According to notifications from the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, the duties will be applicable for five years on imports of Soft Ferrite Cores, vacuum insulated flasks, and Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid. A provisional anti-dumping duty, up to USD 873 per tonne, has been levied on aluminium foil imports for a duration of six months, news agency PTI reported.The government has also imposed duties ranging from USD 276 per tonne to USD 986 per tonne on Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid, a chemical used for water treatment, imported from both China and Japan. For Soft Ferrite Cores, used in devices like electric vehicles, chargers, and telecom equipment, a duty of up to 35% of the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) value will be applied.In the case of vacuum insulated flasks, an anti-dumping duty of USD 1,732 per tonne has been imposed, while duties on Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin imports range from USD 89 per tonne to USD 707 per tonne. These duties apply to imports from China, Korea, Malaysia, Norway, Taiwan, and Thailand, and will remain in effect for five years.These measures follow recommendations made by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), the investigation arm of the Ministry of Commerce. Anti-dumping duties are imposed by countries to protect domestic industries from a surge in imports at unfairly low prices, in accordance with the rules set by the World Trade Organization (WTO).India has previously imposed similar duties on various products to counteract cheap imports from countries like China. As both India and China are WTO members, this action reflects India’s ongoing concerns about the growing trade deficit with its neighbouring country, which reached USD 85 billion in 2023-24.","India has imposed anti-dumping duties on five products imported from China.

From 2020 to date, Centre has provided Rs 20,660 crore for road development of Ladakh,” Malhotra told journalists in Leh.The minister showcased progress on Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway project with an Rs 1.31-lakh crore allocation. “At present, the journey from Delhi to Leh takes 40 hours (by road) but after the railway line is ready, it will reduce the distance to 20 hours,” Malhotra said.

NEW DELHI: A CCTV video from the office of controversial preacher Bajinder Singh has surfaced online, showing him physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.The footage was reportedly recorded in February 2025 and has triggered massive outrage, with critics calling for strict action against the self-styled Christian prophet .In the viral video, Singh is first seen throwing a mobile phone at an employee before approaching and slapping him. Moments later, he is seen attacking a woman who had come to his office with her child.As seen in the footage, he first threw a pile of papers at her before pushing her during an altercation. The incident quickly escalated into a heated argument, with others in the office intervening to separate them.The footage comes at a time when Bajinder Singh is already under investigation in a sexual harassment case.As per PTI, a 22-year-old woman accused the pastor of harassment, stating that he took her mobile number and began sending her messages.From 2022, Singh allegedly made her sit alone in a church cabin, where he hugged her and touched her inappropriately. She further claimed that he threatened to have her and her family eliminated if she reported him. The Punjab Police registered a case against Singh on February 28, booking him under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Following the complaint, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed, led by Superintendent of Police Rupinder Kaur, to probe the allegations. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the matter and demanded swift action against Singh.Singh, however, has dismissed the allegations, calling them ""baseless.""Speaking to the media earlier, he said, ""Fake chats can be easily created these days. They should provide proof against me. Everyone in the church knows that she [the complainant] suffered from fits and was troubled by evil spirits. People come here for prayers, and our job is to pray. She is like our daughter"".Singh has a history of controversy. In 2018, he was arrested at Delhi airport over a sexual harassment case filed by a woman from Zirakpur. More recently, a Mohali court issued warrants against him in that case. In 2022, he was accused of taking money from a Delhi-based family for treating their daughter, who later died.The preacher has also been on the radar of tax authorities, with income tax raids conducted at his premises in 2023.Despite these allegations, Singh remains a well-known figure with a massive social media following. His YouTube channel, ""Prophet Bajinder Singh,"" has over 3.74 million subscribers, and his sermons often attract large crowds, both in India and abroad.Celebrities such as actors Chunky Pandey and Aditya Pancholi have previously endorsed him.","CCTV video shows self-styled Christian prophet Bajinder Singh physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.

Speaking at AAP's 'Ek Shaam Shaheedon Ke Naam' event on Sunday, Kejriwal accused both the BJP and Congress of colluding, alleging that neither party values the contributions of national icons Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar .""We consider Bhagat Singh and Baba Saheb Ambedkar our ideals. There are pictures of both of them in our house and in every office of the Delhi and Punjab governments. The first thing the new government in Delhi did was to remove the pictures of both. We were waiting for them (BJP) to announce Rs 2,500 to women. But they removed the pictures of Bhagat Singh and Baba Saheb and put up pictures of their leaders first,"" Kejriwal said.He added, ""When we put up the pictures of these two, Congress protested that Gandhiji's picture was not put up. However, when the BJP removed the photos of these two, Congress did not say anything. There is a collusion between these two.""Kejriwal recalled how Bhagat Singh’s letters from jail were delivered to his comrades despite being critical of the British. In contrast, he alleged that his own letter from prison never reached the Lieutenant Governor and instead led to a show cause notice against him. ""Bhagat Singh had the freedom to write any letter, but I was not even allowed to write two lines,"" he said, calling the BJP ""worse than the British.""""I wrote a letter to LG that I was in jail, so Atishi should be allowed to hoist the flag. There was nothing wrong with this. I gave a letter to the jail superintendent, but the letter did not reach LG, and I got a show cause notice that how dare I write such a letter. Bhagat Singh had the freedom to write any letter, but I could not write a letter of two lines. You (BJP) are worse than the British,"" he said.AAP suffered a major electoral setback in Delhi, losing to the BJP, which secured 48 of the 70 seats. Kejriwal’s return to public life at the Shaheed Diwas event marks a significant moment for the party as it attempts to regain momentum. The event, held at the AAP headquarters, was attended by senior leaders, MLAs, councillors, and office-bearers.Kejriwal’s comments also reflect the deepening rift between AAP and Congress, who were allies in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections but turned into fierce rivals during the Delhi assembly polls. The campaign saw Rahul Gandhi launching scathing attacks against Kejriwal, accusing him of corruption and misgovernance. The Congress had alleged that AAP was responsible for the liquor scam and criticised Kejriwal for failing to maintain the legacy of previous Congress-led governments in Delhi.Also read: Have allies-turned-rivals dealt a deadly blow to opposition's INDIA bloc? The animosity between AAP and Congress had intensified in the run-up to the elections, with Kejriwal frequently hitting back at Gandhi’s allegations.

"India-EU FTA game changer for German industries, investment into India: German envoy Philip Ackermann",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eu-fta-game-changer-for-german-industries-investment-into-india-german-envoy-philip-ackermann/articleshow/119388492.cms,"German ambassador Philipp Ackermann

EU’s most powerful state Germany believes the 2025-end deadline for the India-EU FTA , potentially the largest deal of its kind in the world, can be met, leading to an agreement that would be a game changer for many of its industries while also attracting more investments into India. In an interview to TOI, German ambassador Philip Ackermann said the last round of FTA talks, held after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s visit last month during which the deadline was announced, was “quite fruitful and better than the previous rounds”.As Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz looks to preside over a “sea change” in Germany’s security policy, shunning longstanding austerity measures to dramatically boost defence spending amid fears of a US retreat, the ambassador ruled out any dilution of Berlin’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific, saying it will continue to be actively involved in the region, including through potential joint military exercises. The conservative leader, who is expected to be elected chancellor next month as a new coalition government takes over, is seeking a stronger European focus on defence and more “independence” from Donald Trump’s America.“Progress on the FTA was one of the substantive outcomes from European Commission president’s visit. The end-of-2025 deadline now seems possible. You have to now reach that goal and I understand the last round of talks after the visit was quite fruitful and was better than the previous rounds. I am cautiously optimistic that we will achieve a good agreement. Germany is hugely interested in this agreement. I think it would be a game changer for many of our industries. It would certainly attract more investment to India. We feel that it would change important parts of our economy,’ said Ackermann.Asked about the Indo-Pacific and India-Germany ties under Merz, the ambassador said Germany has been very clear that Indo-Pacific is an important area for security and trade where India has turned out to be a very good partner. “We think along the same lines, and you can be sure that Germany will continue to be committed to the Indo-Pacific. Like you saw last year with the Tarang Shakti air exercise. Germany will continue to be active along with European, American partners and Indian partners. India with common navy and air force exercises is growing closer to European security and armed forces,’’ said Ackermann, adding there’s a clear continuity now in Germany’s India policy and the 2024 ‘Focus on India’ paper will prevail.Asked about Trump’s indifference to Europe and conflicting signals on NATO, the ambassador said there was a clear signal from Washington that it would like to see European countries spending more on defence but added Europe-America alliance isn’t in any imminent danger. Describing Merz as a Transatlanticist, Ackermann said the new government will make a lot of efforts to keep that alliance meaningful.“Outside Europe, America is our closest ally and we don’t see that changing quickly. At the same time, we have to take into account the discourse in Washington is now different from what it was earlier and we have to adapt to that. Europe has to spend more. You have seen von der Leyen’s Rearm Europe programme that means defence production must increase and small countries should pay more. We feel threatened. Russians have shown they have no scruples, or shame in invading other countries. Why should they stop at Ukraine? It’s important to be better prepared,’’ said the ambassador, talking about what he called a sea change in Germany’s defence policy.While backing all efforts to end the war, he said Russia had basically not accepted the ceasefire proposal and it’s important to understand there can be no peace without Ukraine. “And I think Americans also understand that as they have involved Ukraine in the latest talks in Jeddah,’’ said Ackermann.","The 2025-end deadline for the India-EU FTA is potentially the largest deal of its kind in the world.

All calm in Sambhal



NEW DELHI: Shahi Jama Masjid committee president Zafar Ali was arrested on Sunday in connection with the violence that erupted in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on November 24 last year over a court-ordered survey of the mosque.Sambhal Superintendent of Police Krishan Kumar Bishnoi confirmed that Ali had been arrested.“We had gathered evidence that he played an incendiary role during the violence last year. He was picked up by the police from his house in Sambhal Sunday morning and was interrogated at Kotwali police station by senior cops before being finally arrested,” said Kumar.""Ali has been arrested after questioning him ... He was questioned on Sunday, also ... He has been arrested under several sections of BNS and has been sent to jail ... He has also been produced before the court, and whatever the court will direct will be followed ... He has been arrested under criminal conspiracy,"" he added.As he was being escorted away by the police, Ali told reporters: ""I did not incite any violence.""Zafar Ali's elder brother Tahir Ali alleged that the police were ""deliberately"" sending his sibling to jail before his testimony could be recorded before a judicial panel on Monday. The panel has been appointed by the Uttar Pradesh government to investigate the violence.""Around 11.15am, an inspector and the investigating officer (of the case) came to our house, saying that CO (circle officer) Kuldeep Singh wanted to talk. He had spoken with us last night as well.

He had clearly said that the police fired shots, and those who died were killed by police bullets.""Asked what conversation he had with Zafar Ali before being taken away by police, Tahir Ali said, ""He told me, 'No problem, I am ready to go to jail. I will not back down from the truth'.""He accused the Sambhal administration of deliberately inciting public unrest. ""The authorities do not want the tension to ease. We are trying to restore peace, but all police officers and senior officials here are provoking further discord,"" he claimed.Earlier in the day, the Special Investigation Team of Sambhal police had taken Ali into custody to record his statement.The Mughal-era mosque has been at the center of a significant controversy following claims that it was built on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The violence during protests against a court-ordered survey of the mosque resulted in four fatalities and numerous injuries, including among police personnel.The November 24 incident led to widespread unrest, with protestors clashing with police, throwing stones, and setting vehicles ablaze. The police responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd. In total, the SIT has filed a chargesheet exceeding 4,000 pages across six of the twelve cases related to this violence, naming 159 individuals as accused.The chargesheet also revealed that weapons recovered from the scene were manufactured in countries including the United Kingdom and Germany.Reports indicate that Ali was among the first to receive information about the survey, which sparked protests that escalated into violence as locals gathered outside the mosque.Since the initial outbreak of violence, Sambhal has remained relatively calm, with no further incidents reported. In anticipation of upcoming celebrations, including Holi, local authorities have maintained a heavy police presence and conducted flag marches to ensure public safety.During this period, residents celebrated Holi peacefully alongside Friday prayers at the mosque.Circle Officer Anuj Chowdhary had led a flag march along with other police personnel to ensure the law and order situation in the district before Holi. Other than police, paramilitary forces also conducted a flag march in Sambhal, whereas the administration is using drones for proper monitoring of the situation in the district.The act of whitewashing the Jama masjid, a regular affair was also done after a court order.Talking about the whitewashing on March 16, Zafar Ali stated that they will try to complete the whitewashing task as per the court orders. The Jama Masjid Sadar Chief stated that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has undertaken the work and appointed all labour.","Shahi Jama Masjid committee president Zafar Ali was arrested on Sunday in connection with the violence that erupted in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on November 24 last year.

Who was Rana Sanga?



NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday defended his party leader's "" Rana Sanga a traitor"" remark, saying that referring to a page in ""history should not be an issue"".A massive controversy erupted after SP Rajya Sabha MP Ramjilal Suman on March 21 called Rajput warrior Rana Sanga a ""traitor"" and Hindus his descendent.Attacking the rival BJP, Suman argued that ""if Muslims are called the descendants of Babur, then Hindus must be the descendants of traitor Rana Sanga"".During his speech in Parliament, Suman had said, ""Indian Muslims do not consider Babur as their idol. They follow Prophet Muhammad and the Sufi tradition. But I want to ask, who brought Babur here? It was Rana Sanga who invited Babur to defeat Ibrahim Lodi.""So, if Muslims are called the descendants of Babur, then Hindus must be the descendants of traitor Rana Sanga. We criticise Babur, but why don't we criticise Rana Sanga?""As the BJP continued to mount an attack on the Samajwadi leader, Akhilesh Yadav came out in Suman's defence, saying: ""Everyone is flipping through the pages of history. Ask BJP leaders which pages they are turning. What are they debating? They want to talk about Aurangzeb.""""If Ramjilal Suman ji has referred to a page in history that contains certain facts, then what's the issue? We didn't write history 200 years ago,"" the SP chief said, according to news agency PTI.""If BJP continues to flip through history, people will also remember that during Chhatrapati Shivaji 's coronation, no one anointed him by hand. It is said that he was anointed using the toe of a left foot. Will the BJP condemn this today?"" he said.He further added: ""Galileo was punished for his scientific assertion, and centuries later, the Church apologised for its mistake. If the BJP respects Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will they apologise for the fact that he was anointed with a left foot toe?""Hitting back, BJP leader Amit Malviya said Yadav, ""who indulges in appeasement, is supporting his MP Ramji Lal for calling the great warrior Rana Sanga a traitor. This is an insult not only to the Rajput community but to the entire Hindu community"".""The distorted comments being made on the Maha Kumbh were also no exception but are an indication of the petty anti-Hindu mentality of the SP, due to which the people of Uttar Pradesh have pushed the SP to the lowest rung of the state's politics,"" he said.Rana Sanga (1472–1528), also known as Maharana Sangram Singh, was the Rajput ruler of Mewar and a prominent warrior king of medieval India. He united various Rajput clans to resist foreign invasions and expanded his kingdom significantly. Known for his bravery, he fought multiple battles, including against the Delhi Sultanate and the Lodis.His most famous battle was against Babur in 1527 at Khanwa, where he led a massive Rajput alliance but was ultimately defeated due to Babur's superior tactics and artillery. Despite his loss, Rana Sanga remains a symbol of Rajput valour and resistance against foreign rule in India.","Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday defended his party leader's "" Rana Sanga a traitor"" remark.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) closure report in the Sushant Singh Rajput case is of ""no value"" before the law, according to the lawyer of father of Disha Salian, a celebrity manager who had worked with Rajput and died days before the actor's death.The CBIis learned to have filed its closure report in a Mumbai court in two cases related to Rajput's death, on Saturday.Speaking with ANI, advocate Nilesh C Ojha, said, ""This closure report has no value before law.

Opposing her plea, advocate Shashank Singh, appearing for the husband, told the court that she was earning around Rs 60,000 per month and both of them were holding the post of the same grade.But the wife pleaded that she was entitled to maintenance and the wife's earning capacity and qualification cannot automatically absolve the husband of his obligation to provide maintenance. She told the bench that her husband was earning around Rs 1 lakh per month. As there was dispute over their monthly salaries, the court had directed both of them to place before it the salary slip of the last one year.Wife approached the apex court after her plea of maintenance was rejected by Madhya Pradesh HC and a trial court.","A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to grant relief to the woman who is working as an assistant professor and sought maintenance from her husband.

Examination of judge's CDR will need expert help

NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna 's prompt move to order a judicial inquiry into charges of cash being found at Justice Yashwant Varma 's residence notwithstanding, the task ahead for the three-member panel could be tedious and time-consuming as it involves examining many people and requires assistance of experts to analyse the judge's call data records .The panel of Punjab & Haryana CJ Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Anu Sivaraman, all seasoned judges with over a decade's experience in constitutional courts, will have to take out time to list people to be examined.In the list will be the first responders to the fire in the storeroom of Justice Varma's residence on March 14 night, which the police chief claimed mostly remained locked but the judge said was accessed by staff, gardeners and PWD staff.The panel will take the help of forensic experts to verify the authenticity of the video of burnt cash shot by the first responders and also examine whether the place where cash was burnt matched with the storeroom at the judge's residence.Since Justice Varma cited the Delhi fire chief 's ""no cash found at the judge's residence"" statement in his defence, the latter may also be summoned and asked about the basis for his statement and subsequent U-turn.Security personnel who said ""debris and half-burnt"" articles were removed by the judge's staff on March 15 - a charge denied by Justice Varma - will also be examined along with their colleagues who were on security duty at the bungalow on Tughlaq Crescent for the last six months. Staff who worked at Justice Varma's residence, including his personal assistants, will be called as well.Another important aspect of the inquiry is the examination of call data records of the phones used by Justice Varma in his official and personal capacity. The inquiry panel will require assistance of experts in information technology and telecom industries for this. The judge has been asked not to delete any data from his phones.The Delhi Police commissioner had informed Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay on March 15 that ""the storeroom is adjacent to the guard room where Central Reserve Police Force (Battalion 70F) is posted and the storeroom used to be kept locked"". However, the judge in his defence had said, ""The room was being used as a storeroom to keep useless household articles and remained accessible to all and sundry and was not kept locked.""However, the Delhi HC CJ's report said, ""The enquiry conducted by me, prima facie, does not reveal possibility of entry or access to the room by any person other than those residing in the bungalow, the servants, the gardeners and CPWD personnel, if any. Accordingly, I am of the prima facie opinion that the entire matter warrants a deeper probe.""In his explanation, Justice Varma had said, ""I once again make it clear that no one from my house ever reported seeing any currency in burnt form in the room. In fact, this gets further corroborated from there being no cash or currency which we saw when the site was restored to us after the fire personnel and police had left the scene, quite apart from we being not apprised of any recovery or seizure made on the spot. This may also be viewed in light of the statement of the chief of the fire service which I have gathered from news reports.""",Examination of judge's CDR will need expert help from three-member panel.

"At Rs 400 crore per year, Bharthana in Gujarat India's top toll plaza",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-rs-400-crore-per-year-bharthana-in-gujarat-indias-top-toll-plaza/articleshow/119396489.cms,"45,000km of 1.5 lakh km NH network under tolling; FASTag impact visible

How many people would have heard of Bharthana? Not many, for sure. But a toll plaza near this Gujarat village on the Vadodara-Bharuch section of NH-48, connecting Delhi with Mumbai - the busiest route in the country - is the top toll grosser, generating an average of Rs 400 crore annually over the past five years.Given the volume of goods traffic that moves between landlocked states in north India and ports on the country's western coast, it isn't surprising that the toll plaza in Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan - also on NH-48 - garnered the second highest user fee of Rs 378 crore a year.Data shared by road transport and highways ministry in Lok Sabha last week showed that of the 1,063 toll plazas in India's NH network, 14 reported collection of over Rs 200 crore a year. Currently, around 45,000km of the 1.5 lakh km of NHs, including the newly-built expressways, is under tolling.With a large chunk becoming commercially operational over the last five years and the impact of FASTag showing (in checking leakages), annual toll collection doubled from Rs 27,504 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 55,882 crore in the last financial year.Govt data showed that commuters shelled out little over Rs 1.9 lakh crore in toll over the past five years, although it's barely a fifth of the annual budget spent for highway development and maintenance during this period. Govt collects toll only on highways that are of at least two-and-half lanes (two-lane with paved shoulders) and there is a huge thrust to bring more highways under tolling to increase revenue.Data shared in Parliament showed that among the states, 97 toll plazas in Uttar Pradesh reported the maximum collection at Rs 22,914 crore during the past five years. Rajasthan, which has the highest number of 156 toll plazas, recorded a collection of Rs 20,308 crore (see graphic).Typically, toll collection is higher at plazas located on the NHs that connect ports and industrial hubs. ""These plazas get more commercial and heavy goods vehicles, which pay higher toll compared to private vehicles. So, these projects have been viable for private players,"" an official said.","Of the 1,063 toll plazas in India's NH network, 14 reported collection of over Rs 200 crore a year.

'India has potential to play global role in nuclear technology market',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-has-potential-to-play-global-role-in-nuclear-technology-market/articleshow/119396395.cms,"International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi

Rafael Mariano Grossi

, director-general of the

International Atomic Energy Agency

(IAEA), was in India recently and met with top policymakers. In an interview with TOI’s Surojit Gupta, Grossi discussed the situations in Iran and Ukraine and praised India’s

nuclear energy initiatives

. Excerpts:

How do you view the nuclear situation in Iran?

The engagement you talked about... Is there a possibility of that taking place with the top powers to find a solution?

You have made a number of visits to Ukraine. How is the situation there now?

How do you see India's move to use nuclear energy in the country's energy transition plan?

And how do you see the recent announcement of allowing the private sector in the small reactor segment?

We still have a lot of work to do. I have said many times that Iran does not have nuclear weapons at the moment, but they are enriching uranium at almost weapon grade level and that they have not provided clear answers on a number of things to IAEA for quite a long time. We are being fair, but at the same time firm in that we do not want to exaggerate anything, but neither do we want to banalise any situation. Iran has a very important, ambitious, technologically developed nuclear programme and they have to provide the answers. We see that there is a movement around the issue. We have witnessed an important meeting in Beijing recently between Russia, China and Iran. We think it's positive. We see that there has been an exchange or at least a letter sent by US President Donald Trump to the Supreme Leader. Even with the polemic around the contents and the replies, etc it means that there is a recognition that there has to be an engagement of some sort. So yes, it is a global concern for the reasons I explained. At the same time, this should be an incentive for all of us to work together to avoid an escalation which, against the backdrop of what is happening in the Middle east, would be tragic.There is a possibility, but this will not be endless or the time will not be limitless. There should be a sense of finality. We want an issuance which is positive, which is diplomatic and non-violent, but at the same time one that provides the international community with assurances. It's in everybody's interest. This is what I say when I talk to my Iranian counterparts.It continues to be fragile. And for as long as combat continues, it will still be the case. Let's never forget the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on the front line. It's very exposed. It has been targeted in the past. There have been many blackouts, situations where the power supply to and from the station was completely interrupted. You remember one of the cooling towers last summer was up in fire. So it is clearly a target. The presence of IAEA there has mitigated the risks, but not eliminated them. We look with expectation, like everybody else, the possibility of a dialogue and negotiation leading to a ceasefire and possibly and hopefully to peace. But until that happens, our concern is that no nuclear accident takes place.I see this very positively. India has top notch technology which it derived initially from western technology. Then you went into your own indigenous development with very good reactors, 20 of them operating flawlessly. But still nuclear is a minute percentage of the national electricity production. And I was happy to see that govt is aiming at going much, much higher - 100 gigawatts, which is possible. I see India as a country that has enormous internal potential, but also, if I may, I see India playing a role globally. Nuclear technology is being exported. And I don't see why India should not be joining the family of vendors who are active in the global market.That for me is a fundamental piece of the puzzle that shows that govt is adjusting its approach and trying to attune to the realities in the world. Nuclear is capital intensive, and not everything can come from public or public utilities. And when you have the needs that you have in India, you have to explore public-private partnerships or even private ownership of plants, including small modular reactors. I see this change in the legal and policy approach from India as a step, a huge step in the right direction.","Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the.

BJP picks Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar as state president for new Kerala push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-picks-union-minister-rajeev-chandrasekhar-as-state-president-for-new-kerala-push/articleshow/119394140.cms,"T'PURAM: BJP brass has hand-picked businessman and former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar (60) as the party's Kerala unit chief. His selection is believed to have been made by PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah , with a strategic plan to steer BJP in a new direction in the state. His appointment will be officially announced at BJP state council meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday.Leading up to his nomination, Chandrasekhar was reportedly not keen on leading the state unit, citing his lack of political experience. However, sources suggest that his real hesitation stemmed from his preoccupation with his extensive business empire.On Sunday morning, he received instructions to file his nomination for BJP state unit president, just hours before he was scheduled to travel abroad for an international AI conference in Australia. He submitted his nomination following a core committee meeting in Thiruvananthapuram in the evening. The event was attended by incumbent BJP state chief K Surendran, Union ministers Suresh Gopi and George Kurian, former Union minister V Muraleedharan, national executive committee member PK Krishnadas, and Kummanam Rajasekharan.Chandrasekhar's appointment is seen as part of BJP's strategy to reposition the party as an aspirational political force capable of challenging CPM's narrative on development politics. His leadership could also help rein in factional feuds within the state unit. The new role of outgoing president Surendran is expected to be announced in the coming days.In the last Lok Sabha elections, Chandrasekhar gave a tough fight to Shashi Tharoor in the Thiruvananthapuram constituency, winning over a large section of young voters. He was projected as a ""no-nonsense, development-focused"" candidate and a direct representative of Modi.Entering politics in 2006, Chandrasekhar has served three terms in Rajya Sabha, representing Karnataka.Born in Ahmedabad to Air Commodore MK Chandrasekhar and Valli, he has ancestral roots in Palakkad.Chandrasekhar's appointment also signals that BJP wants dedicated full-time politicians, rather than part-time political figures. A similar approach was seen in the case of actor-turned-politician Suresh Gopi, who was made a Union minister despite his preference to continue acting while serving as Thrissur MP.","Chandrasekhar's appointment seen as part of BJP's strategy to reposition the party as an aspirational political force.

Rao alleged that Rajini, in collaboration with her brother-in-law Vidadala Gopi, personal assistant Dodda Ramakrishna, and then Regional Vigilance and Enforcement Officer (RVEO) Palle Joshua, coerced him into paying Rs 2 crore to the former minister. Additionally, Gopi and Joshua allegedly extorted Rs 10 lakh each.Based on the V&E dept's findings, a report was submitted to the state govt on Dec 3, recommending a comprehensive investigation by ACB. The report also suggested disciplinary action against Joshua and legal proceedings against the other accused. In response, the state govt, through a memo issued on Jan 23, directed ACB to conduct a detailed investigation under the Prevention of Corruption Act .On Feb 18, the govt granted ACB permission to probe Joshua and Ramakrishna. However, in a subsequent memo dated Mar 7, 2025, the govt clarified that since Rajini was an MLA at the time of the alleged offense, her actions did not fall under the purview of official duties, making Section 17A inapplicable. Consequently, the govt permitted ACB to proceed with legal action against her under existing lawsV&E Dept's inquiry further revealed that the inspection of Sri Lakshmi Balaji Stone Crushers on Sept 10, 2020, conducted by Joshua and his team, was carried out without any formal complaint or authorisation from the V&E DG.",Andhra Pradesh Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has registered a case against YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) functionary and former minister Vidadala Rajini.

Hospitals asking for money biggest chunk of Ayushman Bharat grievances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hospitals-asking-for-money-biggest-chunk-of-ayushman-bharat-grievances/articleshow/119393977.cms,"An analysis of grievances filed by beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat has shown that the highest number were about hospitals demanding money for treatment. This entailed unexpected out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) though the scheme was meant to provide cashless hospitalisation and bring down out of pocket expenses.A 2023 CAG report too had noted that 75 out of the 121 healthcare providers de-empanelled from 2018 to 2021 were found to be engaged in illegal money collection and other fraudulent practices.According to a paper published by Centre for Health Equity, Law and Policy and the Association for Socially Applicable Research, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand topped the list for grievances related to the quality of hospital services, and Maharashtra, Assam and Bihar led in eligibility and registration issues . Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh had the highest proportion of grievances related to poor behaviour of hospital and programme staff and related to quality of programmatic service.""While the majority of grievances about hospital service quality were due to hospitals demanding money for treatment, most grievances related to eligibility and registration stemmed from problems with the issuance of beneficiary cards,"" stated the study.The paper published in the Social Science Research Network of Elsevier, an open-access online preprint community and repository, examined a total of 1.1 lakh grievances filed by beneficiaries under the AB-PMJAY grievance redress system from Oct 2018 to March 2022 at the national, state and district levels. However, 67% of the grievances were categorised as 'other' and could not be included in the analysis. This was also true of those categorised as 'inquiry' or 'feedback', which were another 3%. ""We filed an RTI with the National Health Authority to find out what 'other' meant, but were told that this was the category chosen by the beneficiary,"" explained Shefali Malhotra, one of the authors of the paper.Though quality of hospital services constituted the highest proportion of grievances analysed, those related to registration and eligibility for the Ayushman card constituted the highest proportion during the Covid years. Within complaints about quality of hospital services, 74% was related to the hospital demanding money. Other reasons included denial of treatment (15%), hospitals holding onto ABPMJAY cards 6%, non-availability of medicines and diagnostics in the hospital (2.2%), and poor quality of treatment (2%).""The incidence of grievances in Assam was markedly higher than in other states and union territories participating in the AB-PMJAY programme, throughout the study period. About 52% of these grievances were associated with eligibility and registration issues under the scheme. Possible reasons for this are highlighted in the 2023 CAG report, which points out considerable delays, 187 days on average, in the approval and rejection of beneficiaries' registration,"" noted the study adding that this could be attributed to the 70% manpower shortage in the state health agency as flagged by the CAG.","An analysis of grievances filed by beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat has shown that the highest number were about hospitals demanding money for treatment.

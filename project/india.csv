India-Afghanistan Dialogue Highlights Pahalgam Attack, Cross-Border Terror And Pakistan Threats

NEW DELHI: A press conference by Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in New Delhi on Friday drew attention not for what was said, but for who wasn’t in the room. Women journalists were not allowed to attend the event, which was restricted to a handful of male reporters.The interaction, held at the Afghan Embassy just hours after Muttaqi’s talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar , appeared to mirror the gender restrictions long criticised under the Taliban regime.According to people familiar with the matter, the decision on which journalists would be invited was made by Taliban officials accompanying Muttaqi.The Indian side, news agency PTI reported, had suggested that women reporters should also be included among the invitees, a recommendation that was evidently not accepted.Former Union home minister P Chidambaram expressed shock over the incident, saying ""men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded"".""I am shocked that women journalists were excluded from the press conference addressed by Mr Amir Khan Muttaqi of Afghanistan In my personal view, the men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited),"" Chidambaram wrote on X.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad, sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's position on the issue and said his ""recognition of women’s rights isn’t just convenient posturing from one election to the other"".""Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India. If your recognition of women’s rights isn’t just convenient posturing from one election to the other, then how has this insult to some of India’s most competent women been allowed in our country, a country whose women are its backbone and its pride,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wrote on X.TMC MP Mahua Moitra said: ""Govt has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.""The Taliban government in Kabul has faced sustained global condemnation, including from the United Nations , for its curbs on women’s rights, education, and participation in public life.When asked about the condition of women in Afghanistan, Muttaqi sidestepped the question. Instead, he maintained that each country had its own systems and values that should be respected.“Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and there should be respect for them,” he said.Muttaqi claimed that Afghanistan’s situation had improved since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, contrasting current conditions with the years before.“Some 200 to 400 people died in Afghanistan every day before Taliban started ruling the country,” he said.“In these four years, there have been no such losses. Laws are in force and every one has their rights. Those who are engaging in propaganda are making a mistake,” Muttaqi claimed.Defending his government’s record, he added: ""Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and works according to those. It is not correct that people are not given their rights. If people were not happy with the system and the laws, why has peace returned?""Even as Muttaqi painted a picture of stability, the absence of women journalists at his own press conference put in light the very issue that continues to define Afghanistan’s global image, a peace built without the voices of half its population.","Women journalists were not allowed to attend the event, which was restricted to a handful of male reporters.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three

books

with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Thagudhi Enavonru Nanre; Pagudhiyaal





Paarpattu Ozhugap Perin.”

(Thirukkural 111)

“To treat all — enemies, strangers, and friends — with equal fairness,

is the highest virtue.”

The Godfather

Manu Needhi Cholan

Aaraichi Mani

Thiruvalluvar envisioned a world where justice was a balance beam, not a weapon — where the ruler, the ruled, and even the voiceless stood on equal ground. But what happens when power begins to decide what is right?The following quote, often misattributed as a dialogue by Marlon Brando in the movie, has always stayed with me:“When you hold a gun and I hold a gun, we can talk about law. If you hold a knife and I hold a knife, we can talk about rules. If we both are empty handed, we can talk about reason. But if you have a gun and I only have a knife, then the truth lies in your hands. The concepts of law and rules hold meaning only when they rest on equality.”It is a chilling reflection — that law has meaning only when force stands equal. Fiction or not, it mirrors reality uncomfortably well.In a case that drew significant public attention, the wealthy accused in a fatal BMW car crash in Delhi was reportedly taken to a distant hospital where her father was a director, instead of a nearby one.Power dislikes being questioned. In a society divided between the powerful and the powerless, rules stop being rules — they become tools for the strong and chains for the weak.I was reminded of this fragile balance a few years ago during a visit to London. Our team was invited for lunch by a wealthy business magnate who later offered to drop us at Heathrow airport. When we stepped outside, a gleaming black Rolls Royce stood waiting — my first ride in one.At Heathrow, where vehicles are allowed to halt barely for a minute, our chauffeur parked calmly, helped us unload, and even offered to walk us inside. I asked, “Won’t the police fine you for waiting here?” He smiled politely and said nothing.I realised how deeply power infiltrates even the most rule-bound societies. When money speaks, rules go silent.And then my mind turned to a story from— one that shows what justice once meant in our land.In the 12th-century classic, among the 63 Nayanmaars stands, a Chola king whose very name became a byword for righteousness. One day, the king’s son was driving his chariot when a calf darted across and was crushed under its wheels. The grieving mother cow went to the palace and rang the— the bell of inquiry the king had installed to hear the cries of those wronged. It was the first time that bell had ever been rung.The minister examined the case and cleverly shifted the blame, declaring that the calf was at fault for straying into the chariot’s path. But the king, the guardian of justice, refused such a convenient solution. “If a mother is grieving in my land, justice demands that I share her pain,” he said and ordered that his own son be given the same fate as the calf. The prince was executed — and legend says divine grace restored both the calf and the prince to life.An ideal society indeed — where the voiceless and the mighty were treated as equals.Today, such stories read like distant echoes. We have laws and law enforcement agencies— yet the truth still bends before status, wealth, or influence. Thiruvalluvar’s call for impartiality remains not merely a virtue, but a test of civilization itself.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124456253,imgsize-45436,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124456253.jpg"
Enforcement Directorate names senior advocate accused in Religare laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/enforcement-directorate-names-senior-advocate-accused-in-religare-laundering-case/articleshow/124467800.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: On June 20, after protests from lawyers representing several bar associations, ED was forced to withdraw summons issued to senior advocate Pratap Venugopal in connection with a money laundering probe against Religare's former chairperson Rashmi Saluja.Four months later, the agency has named Venugopal as one of the accused, along with Saluja, in its chargesheet filed in the Religare Enterprises case before a special court in Mumbai for his role in the alleged conspiracy in illegal allotment of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) of CHIL (Care Health Insurance Ltd), a subsidiary of Religare, in which Venugopal was an independent director and Saluja was non-executive chairperson.When contacted by TOI, Venugopal said he has ""no comments to offer"".Saluja, according to the chargesheet, has been described as the ""principal architect of the conspiracy"", who, in connivance with other former executives of the company Nitin Aggarwal, Nishant Singhal, Pratap Venugopal and Vaibhav Gawli, illegally acquired equity interest in CHIL through ESOPs. ED has termed the ESOPs thus acquired as ""proceeds of crime"" and has claimed that this was done to gain control of the company by subverting regulatory mechanisms.About the role of Venugopal, ED says he was then a retainer in Religare and had sought legal opinion on how to overturn rejection of allotment of ESOPs by regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). ED says, in return for his services, the lawyer was offered an independent director's post in CHIL and a remuneration of Rs 60 lakh.IRDAI had later directed CHIL to revoke or cancel any ESOPs allotted and also imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on CHIL for non-compliance with regulatory directions.The agency said 2.2 crore ESOPs were allotted to Saluja at an undervalued price of Rs 45.3 when the shares were at Rs 110 each. Later, the accused made office assistant Vaibhav Gawli to file an FIR against Burmans of Dabur, who had acquired 51% stake in the company, to prevent them from taking control of Religare.The summons to Venugopal and another senior advocate had generated sharp reactions from various bar associations, including joint pleas filed by SC Bar Association and SC Advocates-on-Record, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Vijay Hansaria before the CJI-led bench of B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran while it was hearing a suo motu case regarding the summons.The bench had said it would frame guidelines for agencies and bar them from summoning advocates for legal opinion or advice rendered to clients facing prosecution.","Pratap Venugopal is one of the accused, along with Rashmi Saluja, in the Religare Enterprises case.

NMC data shows India added just 21 docs in a year when 80k graduated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-data-shows-india-added-just-21-docs-in-a-year-when-80k-graduated/articleshow/124467765.cms,"The health ministry recently told Parliament that the National Medical Commision (NMC) data shows there are 13,86,157 registered doctors in India, a number that is almost identical to the 13,86,136 it cited in the Lok Sabha in Aug last year. So, how could India have added just 21 doctors over the past year despite about 80,000 graduating in that period? Cross-checking the state-wise NMC data given last year with the state councils' rolls shows a glaring mismatch.Delhi had less than 31,500 doctors in NMC data, whereas state council data for 2020 showed more than 72,600. How did more than 40,000 doctors go missing in NMC's data for the city?Last year, NMC submitted that Kerala Medical Council has over 73,000 doctors registered with it. However, a Kerala council member told TOI the number is over 1 lakh, a difference of 36,000.Similarly, while NMC reported under 1.5 lakh in Tamil Nadu, the state council's figures are over 2 lakh.""This is not a clerical slip or a marginal miscalculation. It is a glaring 41,000-doctor gap between what the Delhi Medical Council (DMC) officially recorded and what union health ministry or NMC told Parliament. Placing incorrect, misleading or incomplete information before the Lok Sabha is a breach of Parliamentary privilege.It obstructs Members of Parliament from performing their duties, and as per Parliamentary procedure, such misrepresentation amounts to contempt of the House,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, national general secretary of United Doctors Front (UDF).UDF had filed an RTI asking for data on registered medical practitioners in Delhi. DMC responded that in 2014, the total number of registered voters for the council election was 57,749, and it was 72,636 for the 2020 elections. ""Only those who have renewed their registration can vote for the council election. So, 72,636 is authentic data as of 2020,"" said Dr Kumar. With a few hundred new registrations every year, this number ought to be even higher now.Huge variations between the actual registrations in state councils and what is submitted by NMC skew the calculation of the doctor-to-population ratio. In Delhi's case, NMC's data is over 66% less than DMC's count. In the case of Kerala, it is off by 33%.""For Delhi, a city with one of the highest patient inflows in the country, undercounting by 40,000 doctors distorts the entire healthcare planning process. They are planning to bring in compulsory bond in Delhi medical colleges, claiming doctor shortage. If they cannot get the Delhi data right, one can only wonder about other states,"" said Dr Kumar.In Sept 2020 NMC replaced erstwhile Medical Council of India, which was labelled corrupt and non-transparent in its functioning. However, five years later NMC has failed in its basic function of maintaining an updated medical registry crucial for decision-making.""NMC is totally defunct. Appointments are not made on time. Most posts have been lying vacant for more than a year. They don't even respond to communication from state councils. There has been no process to update their database or to bring in a system by which additions to the state councils will lead to automatic updation of NMC's registry,"" said a Kerala Council member.","The health ministry recently told Parliament that the National Medical Commision (NMC) data shows there are 13,86,157 registered doctors in India.

'Let Them Decide': Trump At Oval Office When Asked About NOBEL PRIZE After Gaza Deal

Will Trump get the Peace Prize?



Also read:

Who are the contenders?







The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The award is considered one of the most anticipated and unpredictable honours.Experts say the committee usually focuses on lasting peace, international cooperation, and the work of institutions that promote these goals.The announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, where the committee will name the laureate who reflects the values of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish industrialist who founded the prize.There has been speculation about the possibility of US President Donald Trump winning the prize, a discussion partly driven by Trump himself. However, experts who follow the Nobel process say his chances are low despite his involvement in several international peace efforts.The announcement comes just hours after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that could help end the two-year conflict in Gaza.While Trump has claimed credit for pressuring both sides to reach the deal, the timing makes it unlikely that the Nobel Committee considered it.The five-member committee held its final meeting on Monday, when it completed the statement explaining its choice, which is usually decided days in advance.""The Gaza deal has absolutely no significance for the choice of the 2025 laureate because the Nobel Committee has already made its decision,"" historian and Peace Prize expert Asle Sveen told news agency AFP.""Trump will not win the prize this year. I’m 100 percent certain,"" he said.A total of 338 individuals and organisations have been nominated for the 2025 Peace Prize, but the list remains secret for 50 years. With no clear favourite, several possible names are being discussed in Oslo.Among them are Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms, a network of volunteers helping civilians during war and famine; Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which monitors elections.The committee could also choose a laureate that signals its position on global issues, even if it invites criticism from the United States.Possible choices include UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres , the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), or international courts such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).Organisations defending press freedom, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or Reporters Without Borders (RSF), are also being discussed as potential winners.Last year’s prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that campaigns against nuclear weapons.The Nobel Peace Prize includes a diploma, a gold medal, and a $1.2 million cash award.The economics prize, to be announced on Monday, will conclude the 2025 Nobel season, which has already seen awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace.","The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

In a significant disciplinary move, the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has cancelled the NEET PG results of 22 candidates for alleged use of unfair means in examinations conducted between 2021 and 2025. The action, announced through an official notification, includes 13 candidates from the NEET PG 2025 session alone.According to the NBEMS, the scorecards and results of all 22 candidates stand null and void. “Producing the said scorecard and/or result of NEET-PG of the respective session for any purposes, including but not limited to, employment, enrolment, registration, or admission to PG courses, shall be unlawful,” the board stated in its notice.The NBEMS further clarified that it will not be responsible for any admissions, employment, or registrations obtained using the cancelled results. “NBEMS disclaims any responsibility or liability arising from employment, admission, or enrolment based on the NEET PG result cancelled herein above,” it added.Of the 22 candidates whose results were invalidated, 13 appeared in NEET PG 2025, three in 2024, four in 2023, and one each in 2022 and 2021.The board’s Examination Ethics Committee took the decision after a detailed inquiry into malpractice incidents reported across multiple sessions.One candidate, Srusti Bommanahalli Rajanna, was disqualified following the disposal of Writ Petition No. 5785/2025 before the Karnataka High Court. The remaining 21 candidates were found guilty of using unfair means by the NBEMS ethics panel.This year’s NEET PG exam saw participation from over 2.42 lakh candidates, of whom 1,28,116 were declared qualified for admission to Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Surgery (MS), and PG Diploma courses. However, the counselling schedule for NEET PG 2025 is yet to be announced, as the exam remains under legal scrutiny over transparency concerns and a pending petition seeking the release of full question papers and answer keys.Alongside NEET PG candidates, the NBEMS has also cancelled the candidature of 11 students who appeared in the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) between 2021 and 2025. These candidates were similarly found to have used unfair means during the exam.The FMGE, which allows foreign-trained medical graduates to obtain a licence to practice in India, reported a sharp decline in pass percentage this year. The June 2025 session recorded a pass rate of 18.61%, down by nearly 11% points from the previous year. Out of 37,207 registered candidates, only 6,707 managed to qualify.The NBEMS has reiterated its commitment to maintaining the integrity of medical entrance and licensure examinations, warning that strict action will continue against any candidate found compromising the fairness of the assessment process.","The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has cancelled the NEET PG results of 22 candidates for alleged use of unfair means.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday backed US President Donald Trump as Hamas and Israel agreed on the phase one of the peace deal brokered by him.Putin said that the Russia supported Trump’s Gaza initiative from the start and hoped that initiatives of the US President will indeed be implemented in practice.""Against the backdrop of the humanitarian tragedy and disaster in the Gaza strip, active efforts are underway to find options for ending the Palestine-Israel conflict,"" Putin said.""President Trump put forward his well-known initiatives, and as you saw, Russia supported them almost immediately.

An agreement is moving forward that could help everyone.""Zelenskyy also voiced hope for the release of hostages and an end to civilian suffering in Gaza.

Hamas responded by highlighting Trump’s promise to secure the release of all hostages in Gaza, a cause he had publicly championed. Trump claimed victory and reposted Hamas’s statement, despite the group not agreeing to all terms.",Putin said that the Russia supported Trump’s Gaza initiative from the start and hoped that initiatives of the US President will indeed be implemented in practice.

NEW DELHI: The landmark visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India Friday saw India declaring it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the level of embassy, while announcing a slew of projects and humanitarian gestures to advance ties with Afghanistan. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said cooperation between the 2 sides contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience, as he announced a formal reopening of the embassy.Muttaqi said after the meeting that India too had agreed to receive Afghan diplomats here, although not at the ambassador level. While not a formal recognition of the regime in Kabul, the upgrade still marks a significant boost for diplomatic ties and ongoing efforts to remove hurdles in further deepening economic cooperation. India shut its embassy in Kabul after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in 2021 but, in June 2022, the government positioned a technical team in the embassy mainly to supervise distribution of humanitarian aid.In the meeting, Jaishankar underlined India’s concerns about cross-border border terrorism, including the activities of Pakistan based terror groups with possible links in Afghanistan, and Muttaqi assured him Taliban won’t allow any group to use the country against others.Without naming Pakistan, both sides unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries in a joint statement, while underscoring the importance of promoting peace, stability, and mutual trust in the region.With the Taliban’s ties with Pakistan going into a tailspin over the activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), Jaishankar also stressed India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan and got the same assurance from Muttaqi.“We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” said Jaishankar in his opening remarks, as he appreciated Taliban’s sensitivity towards India’s security concerns and the solidarity in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack.Muttaqi also invited Indian companies to invest in the mining sector, saying this would help strengthen the bilateral trade and commercial relations. According to a joint statement, India expressed its willingness to assist the Afghan government in reconstructing residential buildings in the earthquake affected areas.The Indian side expressed concern about the plight of forcibly repatriated Afghan refugees, saying their dignity and livelihood is important and agreeing to help construct residences for them and continue providing material aid to rebuild their lives.Jaishankar said India’s longstanding development partnership with Afghanistan, which has seen more than 500 Indian projects spread across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, stood renewed and announced the launch of 6 new projects. “As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,” said Jaishankar.There was also focus on sports, especially cricket, to advance cultural interactions with Jaishankar saying the emergence of Afghan cricketing talent had been truly impressive. He also committed to expanding avenues for Afghan students to pursue studies at Indian universities, citing more Indian visas for Afghan nationals in medical, business and student categories.The minister also announced a gift of 20 ambulances in a goodwill gesture of good, in addition to MRI and CT scan machines to Afghan hospitals and vaccines for immunization and cancer medicines.","India declares it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the level of embassy.

In 1971, Hindus constituted 82% and the Muslim population was 11%, while in 1991, Hindus constituted 81% and the Muslim community accounted for 12.12%, while in 1991, we accounted for 89%, and Muslims accounted for 14.2%. I'm talking about the populations of only two religions because I want to talk about infiltration,"" Shah saidDelivering the Narendra Mohan Smriti Lecture at Sahitya Shrishti Samman ceremony, the home minister said, ""The Muslim population has increased by 24.6 per cent, whereas the Hindu population has decreased by 4.5 per cent. I am telling you this because it hasn't happened because of the fertility rate. It has happened because of infiltration.""""Hindu population decreased in Pakistan and Bangladesh as many of them fled and took refuge in India. And the Muslim population that increased in India wasn't due to fertility, it was because many from the community infiltrated into the country,"" the home minister said.He asked people to recognise the consequences of infiltration to effect demographic shifts for democracy.""I want to say without hesitation that until every Indian understands these three issues, we cannot ensure safety for our country, it's culture, languages, and our independence. These three topics are interconnected,"" he stated and cited censuses from 1951, 1971, 1991, and 2011 to highlight the changing demography.Shah linked the sharp drop in Jharkhand's tribal population to similar incursions, announcing that the Modi govt's high-powered Demographic Mission would examine illegal migration's effects on religious and social fabric, population trends, and border security. He blamed ""vote-bank"" politics for infiltration, and said that it was ironic while Gujarat and Rajasthan have remained secure despite being border states, West Bengal has emerged as an epicentre of the serious threat. ""Some political parties do not see a threat to the nation in infiltrators; they only see a vote bank,"" he remarked, decrying Congress 's role in the religious partition of India as a profound error.Shah defended the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which grants citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, and Buddhist refugees, as fulfilling a national pledge redeemed by Prime Minister Modi. ""Opposition parties spread lies about the CAA; by bringing it, Modi Ji performed atonement for decades of governance errors,"" he asserted. He emphasised that minorities persecuted on religious grounds in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh since independence deserve sanctuary in India. Endorsing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, Shah argued that embedding infiltrators into voters' lists corrupts constitutional integrity. He reiterated that Muslim population growth stems from ""infiltration from Pakistan and Bangladesh and not because of fertility.""Infiltrators' inclusion in voter lists, he warned, taints the political process. ""When you are protecting infiltrators, you are polluting the spirit of the Constitution,"" Shah said, adding, ""We will follow the detect, delete and deport process for infiltrators."" He lambasted Congress: ""Outsiders will not decide who gets to vote whom in India. India's democracy will be run by Indians-not dictated by outsiders or Congress-backed lobbies. """"The opposition is against the SIR exercise because their vote banks are getting cut...It is EC's constitutional responsibility to clean the voters' list. You can go to court if you have any issues,"" he said.","Home minister Amit Shah said infiltration was the main reason for disparity in the rates of growth of numbers of different religious communities.

KOLKATA: Pregnant Bengal resident Sunali Khatun, disowned as an ""illegal immigrant"" in India and incarcerated in Bangladesh for unlawful entry after being identified as an Indian by her Aadhaar card, could be returning soon to where she and her unborn child belong.A judicial magistrate's court in Bangladesh has asked the Indian high commission in Dhaka to initiate diplomatic and legal procedures to ""safely repatriate"" Sunali and five others languishing in a Chapai Nawabganj jail since Aug 22, capping an almost four-month ordeal that began with the group from Birbhum being targeted by Delhi Police and pushed across the international border in Assam on June 26.The Sept 30 magisterial directive specifies that all six jail inmates - Sunali, her husband Danish Sk, their 8-year-old son Sabir, Sweeti Bibi and her two sons - are ""Indian citizens"" with Aadhaar cards in their names.The order came within four days of Calcutta high court slammed Delhi Police for their haste in branding them illegal immigrants and pushing them into Bangladesh. The court gave the Centre four weeks to bring the group back to India.Sunali, who is due any day, her husband and Sweeti were eking out a living as ragpickers in the national capital when they were picked up by a police team engaged in a drive against illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Sunali's father Bhodu Sk, who filed a habeas corpus in Calcutta high court in July, accused police of refusing to acknowledge the citizenship documents of his daughter and the rest of the group.Rajya Sabha MP Samirul Islam of Trinamool Congress , who heads the West Bengal Migrant Workers' Welfare Board, said on Friday that he would request the Union govt to fast-track steps to repatriate the group.An Indian official suggested repatriation might be a lengthier process than expected. ""An Aadhaar card is not proof of Indian citizenship. The identities of all six need to be established first,"" he told TOI.A flag meeting between BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGP) will follow since the latter would need to hand them over to officials on this side,"" the Indian official added.Mofijul Sk, a social worker from Birbhum who has been camping at Chapai Nawabganj to coordinate legal assistance for the jailed six, said he would meet officials at the Indian deputy high commission in Rajshahi, if required, to speed up the process.Mofijul spoke to Sunali over the phone on Friday. ""She was crying and pleaded with me to arrange for the group to return home. She kept asking, 'How long will we have to stay here? What is our fault? Please tell them I have a daughter waiting for me at home',"" Mofijul said.He said Sunali suffered an injury in a fall in jail a week ago but was still to get a precautionary ultrasound to check her baby's health.Lawyer Saikat Thakurata, who represented Sunali's family at Calcutta HC, said he had ""heard"" about a Bangladeshi court directing India to safely repatriate her and the rest of the jailed group. ""Diplomatic issues are involved here. I am not sure when she will return home,"" he said.MP Islam posted on X, ""A Bangladeshi court has not only declared them Indian citizens but even cited their Aadhaar card numbers and residential addresses as proof. The court's order has been officially sent to the Indian high commission in Dhaka, directing that all of them be safely sent back to India. This exposes yet again how the anti-Bengal BJP cruelly targets poor Bengali-speaking people, labelling them as Bangladeshis and deporting them for no other reason than their language.

SC questions TN on nod to Vijay’s party to hold Karur rally

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday questioned the manner in which a single judge of the Madras High Court - principal bench in Chennai - passed an order for a probe by an SIT into Karur stampede, when the petition it was responding to was for framing a standard operating protocol for political rallies.There is also fallacy in the order as the division bench of the high court at Madurai was examining the issue, it said.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria asked why the principal bench entertained the petition related to the incident in Karur which falls within the jurisdiction of the Madurai bench. The court highlighted the procedural fault before going ahead with the hearing on a batch of petitions, including one filed by Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), on the stampede during TVK leader Vijay 's rally that killed 41 people.SC also questioned Tamil Nadu for allowing TVK to hold the rally in Karur when AIADMK was denied permission to hold one there. It also asked how the postmortem of victims of the Karur stampede was conducted at midnight and completed within four hours. The state govt has been directed to respond to the court's queries.Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, appearing for TVK, submitted that the petition filed before the HC was for a limited purpose - to frame SOP for political rallies - but SIT was constituted by the court on the first day of hearing itself.He also said many adverse observations were passed against Vijay which were factually wrong.Subramanium said while the actor was forced by state police to leave the spot, the HC had wrongly said he absconded and abandoned his fans.Expressing apprehension that the SIT, composing of state officials, would not conduct a fair probe in the case, TVK submitted that the investigation must be conducted under the supervision of a retired SC judge. Its plea was, however, strongly objected by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, AM Singhvi and P Wilson who submitted that it was not the state but the HC which had suggested the composition of the SIT. They said that the state govt has no axe to grind against anyone and it was not proper to question the impartiality of the SIT probe. The state also opposed a CBI probe in the case and told the bench that bringing the central agency to investigate the matter would undermine the federal structure.Responding to the court's observation about the speedy conduct of postmortems, Wilson said this was an incident of tragedy and there was a lot of hue and cry because families started demanding the dead bodies and 606 doctors and nurses were mobilised on that fateful day.",Supreme Court questions the manner in which a single judge of the Madras High Court passed an order for a probe by an SIT into Karur stampede.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested 7 seats, winning 4, achieving 0.9% of the vote share and a 32.9% strike rate.","BJP, Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan have 40% chance of retaining power.

Taliban seek opening of India-Pak border for trade with India; government to accept Taliban diplomats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-stand-on-recognising-kabul-regime-will-be-aligned-with-international-communitys/articleshow/124465388.cms,"Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi

Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi backed trade through the Chabahar port route and called for opening the India-Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India. At a press conference in the Afghanistan embassy, following his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Muttaqi also announced that the Taliban will appoint diplomats in India.Pakistan does not allow India to export to Afghanistan via the land route, and the Indian government has used the Chabahar port in Iran for trade and commerce with Afghanistan. The US, however, last month revoked the 2018 sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop the port and access Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.Muttaqi said trade is meant to benefit people and should not be mixed with politics. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all 3 countries,’’ said Muttaqi, addressing a press conference at the Afghanistan embassy for which no woman journalist was invited. He also announced the formation of a trade committee to remove obstacles in commercial ties with India.Muttaqi also reiterated Afghanistan’s position that it won’t allow the US to take control of the Bagram airbase, even as it remains open to diplomatic ties with Washington. Indian government sources later confirmed India had agreed to work with the Taliban to have their diplomats stationed here but added India’s position on formal recognition will remain broadly aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi addressed the media with a small flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Taliban’s name for the country, placed on the table. He told reporters the embassy building, which still flies the flag of the erstwhile Islamic Republic, belonged to the IEA. “The appointment of diplomats will be a step towards normalisation and further improvement of ties,” said Muttaqi. The appointment will not be at the ambassador level, in the absence of formal recognition by India. The diplomats appointed by the Taliban will be allowed to work from the embassy.Asked about women’s rights, a sticking point in the Taliban’s ties with the international community, Muttaqi said all countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected. He was also non-committal on whether girls or women would be allowed to travel to India for studies.""In the recent earthquake in Afghanistan, India was the first responder. Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations. We are ready to create a consultative mechanism of understanding, which helps towards strengthening our relations,” said Muttaqi.The issue of women rights has been flagged by Indian authorities from several multilateral forums. India believes Taliban must work towards the formation of a truly inclusive government and preservation of women, children and minorities.Muttaqi also said he and Jaishankar discussed security concerns in detail. “The IEA has proven in the last four years that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used against others. And it remains committed to that policy that the territory of Afghanistan is not used to threaten others,” said Muttaqi.","Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi called for opening the India- Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India.

Centre in Supreme Court: In talks with J&K government on statehood restoration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-in-supreme-court-in-talks-with-jk-government-on-statehood-restoration/articleshow/124465249.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday informed Supreme Court that it is in consultation with the elected government of J&K - which was divided into UTs of J&K and Ladakh alongside scrapping of the contentious Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019 - on the issue of restoration of statehood without disturbing the UT status of Ladakh.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran that elections were held peacefully in the UT and an elected government is in place. However, restoration of statehood is under consideration of the Union government, which is consulting the UT government. ""The Centre will respond to the pleas for restoration of statehood to J&K in four weeks,"" he said.SC adjourned hearing on a bunch of pleas, including those filed by lecturer Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, sitting MLA Irfan Hafiz Lone, Prem Shankar Jha and Radha Kumar, who was one of the three interlocutors for J&K appointed by the UPA government's Cabinet Committee on Security in 2010.Senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Bhat, said SC while upholding the scrapping of Article 370 had not adjudicated the constitutional validity of stripping J&K of its statehood on the promise of ""their government that it would be restored soon after elections were held to the J&K assembly."" Elections were held more than a year ago and still there is no sign of restoring statehood, which is in breach of the undertaking given by Mehta to the court.He said if the bench finds it appropriate, the issue can be referred to a five-judge bench.Mehta protested loudly at the use of ""their govt"" jibe by Sankaranarayanan and said it is ""our govt"", as much mine as theirs and every Indian's. The use of ""their govt"" shows the petitioner's mindset, he said, adding that there are several considerations, including cross-border terrorism and incidents like the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which must be considered before deciding on restoration of statehood.Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy told SC that stripping a state of its statehood has serious consequences for federalism and informed the court that the J&K cabinet passed a resolution on Oct 18 last year advising the Lt Governor to take steps for restoration of statehood. Senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi said the Centre has the power to dissolve a state government using powers under Article 356 to retain control but it cannot take away statehood.Another counsel appearing for Radha Kumar alleged that there has been a steep rise in suicides and unemployment in J&K after it was reduced to UT and cited a report by a team led by former judge A P Shah. Mehta said these are the people who are using SC as a forum to peddle lies to defame India in the international forum.""There has been substantial all-round development in the state and 99% of the people of J&K treat the Centre as their govt. There are certain events that have taken place, including the killing of innocent tourists by Pakistan-backed terrorists and these must be taken into consideration during a holistic review of situations to ensure national security prior to restoration of statehood,"" he said.",The Centre informed Supreme Court that it is in consultation with the elected government of J&K.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday listed Pakistan sponsored cross-border terrorism as a ""shared threat"" for both India and Afghanistan as he met his Afghanistani counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi in Delhi.In his opening remarks, Jaishankar termed cross-border terrorism as a ""menace"" and said that India and Afghanistan must coordinate efforts to combat. He also called Afghanistan as a ""contiguous"" neighbour to send a strong message to Pakistan over its illegal occupation in Jammu and Kashmir.""As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,"" Jaishankar said.""However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face.

Daesh is a challenge for the region and Afghanistan is at the frontlines of this struggle,"" he said.""Luckily, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, its forces and its strong struggle against it has eradicated it from Afghanistan.

Delhi-bound AI Dreamliner diverts to Dubai; FIP seeks checks on B787s,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-bound-ai-dreamliner-diverts-to-dubai-fip-seeks-checks-on-b787s/articleshow/124457146.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In another technical issue with one of its Dreamliners, an Air India Boeing 787 (VT-ANC) operating from Vienna to Delhi on Thursday night diverted to Dubai following a technical snag. The same aircraft subsequently took off for Delhi after its auto pilot as reset and landed at IGI Airport around noon on Friday.While AI maintains there was no safety issue with the aircraft, this is was the second instance within a week with its Dreamliners. Last Saturday (Oct 4) the ram air turbine (RAT) of an AI Dreamliner had deployed on its final approach to Birmingham. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Friday asked the aviation ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to “ground all B787s in light of continuous electrical problems” and also order a “special audit of AI aircraft maintenance. ” AI maintains its Boeing 787s were found to be perfectly safe to fly after each one of them was checked extensively after AI 171 crash.An AI spokesperson said the Vienna-Delhi flight was diverted due to a technical issue. “The aircraft landed safely at Dubai and underwent necessary checks. All passengers were kept informed of the delay, provided refreshments and the flight, operated by the same aircraft, departed Dubai at 8.45 am (IST) and landed in Delhi at 12.19 pm (IST).At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remain top priority…. there was (no) electrical failure in the said aircraft. ”The DGCA is probing last Saturday’s RAT deployment. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is probing the June 12 AI 171 crash of an AI Dreamliner.The FIP said in its Friday mail to govt: “Since June 16, we have reiterated that all B-787s in the country must be checked thoroughly for electrical systems. On Oct 4, RAT deployed on AI-117 while on approach to Birmingham. On October 9, AI 154 Vienna to Delhi diverted to Dubai which had major technical issues where the autopilot system suddenly failed triggering a series of technical malfunctions. The aircraft experienced failures across critical systems which included Autopilots, instrument landing system and flight control system degradation with no autoland capability. ”“The pilots could not engage the autopilots due electrical malfunctions; thus, pilots were constrained to fly manually at night and divert to Dubai. Moreover, the FD's were not available with degraded flight control systems. The aircraft landed safely at Dubai. We compliment the skill of the pilots to fly the aircraft at night safely to Dubai with limited automation/systems Two incidents of electrical malfunctions in a short span of time are indicators of poor serviceability by AI,” FIP added.Regarding last Saturday’s RAT deployment, Air India said in: “On Oct 4, 2025, the operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham, detected the deployment of RAT of the aircraft during its final approach. The crew had found all electrical and hydraulic parameters to be normal, and the aircraft landed safely at Birmingham Airport. At no point during the flight was there any loss of power or control systems. The aircraft was subsequently grounded for further inspections. Based on the conclusions from our preliminary investigations, the deployment of the RAT was neither due to a system fault nor pilot action.”“The deployment of the RAT was ‘uncommanded’, consistent with similar occurrences with other airlines in the past, as reported by Boeing. Air India had notified the Indian aviation regulator, DGCA, about the occurrence and has submitted the preliminary report to the regulator in accordance with the prescribed guidelines. The aircraft was subsequently cleared for service, and it operated from Birmingham to Delhi on 5 October. At Air India, the safety of all passengers and crew remains our foremost priority,” AI statement added.",An Air India Boeing 787 operating from Vienna to Delhi on Thursday night diverted to Dubai following a technical snag.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court appears set to allow the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi and National Capital Region for Diwali , Gurupurav and Christmas celebrations.While reserving orders on multiple pleas of firecracker manufacturers for allowing manufacture and sale of green crackers, which was supported by Centre and Haryana government, a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said Friday it will pass a detailed order on Monday permitting manufacture and sale of only green crackers, which conform to standards set by NEERI and PESO.""Did the levels of pollution in 2018 (when the SC had permitted bursting of green crackers within the stipulated time window in the evening) worsen as compared to 2024 to warrant imposing a complete ban?"" the bench asked.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday backed the Election Commission’s SIR, and said Hindus from Pakistan and Bangladesh have rights on Indian soil while distinguishing refugees from infiltrators.“I want to ask all citizens, who should decide who becomes the prime minister or chief minister? Should anyone other than the citizens of the country have the right to decide this?” Shah asked at an event in New Delhi, reported news agency PTI.Shah said that Hindus in Pakistan were promised refuge in India under the Nehru-Liaquat Pact after partition, but the successive governments failed to honour that promise, which was finally fulfilled by the Modi government through the Citizenship Amendment Act.“Just as much right I have on the soil of this country, that much right the Hindus of Pakistan-Bangladesh have on this soil. I say this as the home minister of the country,” he said.Shah further explained that refugees come to India to save their religion, while infiltrators cross over illegally for economic reasons.“Those who have not faced religious persecution and want to come illegally for economic or other reasons are infiltrators.If anyone in the world who wants to come here is allowed, our country will become a dharamshala,” he said.The home minister also said no one should interfere with the SIR process, adding that such exercises were also held when the Congress was in power.“The opposition is opposing it because their vote banks are getting cut. It is the Election Commission’s Constitutional responsibility to clean the voters’ list. If you have any issues, you can go to court,” he said.Citing Census data, Shah said the Hindu population fell from 84% in 1951 to 79% in 2011, while the Muslim population rose from 9.8% to 14.2%.“According to the 2011 Census, the growth rate of Muslims was 24.6% and that of Hindus 16.8%.

NEW DELHI: India's all traditionally high-emission industries, including aluminum, cement and pulp & paper, will have to reduce the intensity of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet specific targets by 2026-27 compared to a 2023-24 baseline as the govt has notified rules for the country's first legally binding emission reduction target for carbon-heavy industries.The rules, notified by the environment ministry on Oct 8, make it mandatory for 282 industrial units to reduce GHG emissions per unit of product (emission intensity) beginning 2025-26.These industrial units, spread across the country, will be liable to pay a penalty for non-compliance. The rules are notified under the compliance mechanism of the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023.The highest number of industrial units (186) which will have to reduce GHG emission intensity (GEI) within a specified time-period belong to the cement sector, followed by pulp & paper (53), plants that use chlor-alkali process to extract certain chemicals (30), and aluminium plants (13).GEI targets (in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) for the year 2025-26 have been calculated based on the pro-rata basis for the remaining months of the current financial year. The overall reduction till 2026-27 ranges from about 3.4% in the cement sector to about 5.8% in aluminium, 7.5% in chlor-alkali and 7.1% in pulp and paper, compared to the 2023-24 levels.In case an industrial unit fails to comply with the GEI target or fails to submit the carbon credit certificates equivalent to the shortfall for compliance, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will impose 'environmental compensation' (penalty) for the shortfall.The penalty will be equal to twice of the average price at which the carbon credit certificate is traded during the trading cycle of that compliance year. It'll be paid within the 90 days from the day of the imposition order.According to the notification, the fund collected under the 'environmental compensation' will be maintained in a separate account and utilised for the purposes of the CCTS on the recommendation of the national steering committee for the Indian carbon market.The GEI targets are in sync with India's 'net zero' emission goal of 2070 and will contribute to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) - climate action targets - through the reduction or removal or avoidance of GHG emissions.","India's traditionally high-emission industries, including aluminum, cement and pulp & paper, will have to reduce the intensity of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet specific targets by 2026-27.

Ranganathan has been arrested over the deaths, 20 of them in Chhindwara alone, after allegedly consuming toxic cough syrup, Coldrif, manufactured by his company.By the time the court in Chhindwara's Parasia remanded Ranganathan in 10-day police custody in the evening, he had faced hours of mob fury.In Parasia, an SIT formed to probe the deaths told court that Ranganathan's remand was essential to interrogate him about Coldrif's supply chain. Granting remand till Oct 20, the court cited security concerns and directed that Ranganathan be kept in Chhindwara district jail during questioning.Ranganathan chose to defend himself as lawyers in Parasia decided not to represent him. He told the court he was hypertensive, diabetic and claimed his company supplied medicines to five states but only MP reported adverse effects.Ranganathan has been charged with offences that include culpable homicide and drug contamination, along with sections under Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

On the eve of World Palliative Day, palliative care experts have drawn attention to ""passive violence"" implicit in the dismal access that Indians have to basic pain relief. Forty years after palliative care came to India, it is estimated that barely 4% of citizens have access, reports Rema Nagarajan.Dr MR Rajagopal, founder chairman of Pallium India, a non-governmental organisation working on improving access to palliative care in India, told TOI, ""84% of the world has negligible access to palliative care. Low- and middle-income countries use only 6% of global opioids for pain relief. Guidelines designed for the Global North have failed 84% of the world's population. We need a palliative care strategy specifically for the Global South. ""The theme of World Hospice and Palliative Care Day, observed on October 11, is ""Achieving the Promise - Universal Access to Palliative Care"". By 2030, the world envisioned universal health coverage - including palliative care -for all.""It's rather obvious we're nowhere near that promise. But if we're to achieve it at any point in the visible future, we need realistic plans. Low- and middle-income countries use only 6% of global opioids for pain relief. Is this not passive violence by our healthcare systems? Add the active violence of catastrophic health expenditure and the menace of inappropriate end-of-life care that inflicts suffering,"" said Rajagopal, hailed as the father of palliative care in India.","Palliative care experts have drawn attention to ""passive violence"" implicit in the dismal access that Indians have to basic pain relief.

Tiwari said around 10. The bench then dismissed the PIL, which alleged that though 14 children died in MP in September due to intake of the spurious cough syrup manufactured by a TN-based firm, the Centre and Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation failed to issue an immediate nation-wide recall or ban on the cough syrup which might have allowed circulation of the product in many states.",Supreme Court expresses concern over large number of deaths of children in Madhya Pradesh.

However, according to 'Prison Statistics India 2023' - published by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 73.5% of all prisoners are undertrials, 3.9 lakh out of 5.3 lakh prisoners.Section 62(5) of RP Act provides that ""No person shall vote at any election if he is confined in a prison, whether under a sentence of imprisonment or transportation or otherwise, or is in the lawful custody of police"". However, it did not bar a person under preventive detention to vote.The petitioner has sought a direction to the Election Commission to frame guidelines for preserving the voting rights of persons lodged in prison during the pendency of trial and set up polling booths inside prisons to enable them to cast their votes, or facilitate them to use postal ballots, if they are lodged in a prison which is outside their constituencies or state.The petitioner said convicted prisoners or those arrested for charges of corruption may not be given voting rights. It said undertrials have voting rights in most countries, including Pakistan.""A blanket ban violates the universally-recognised principle of presumption of innocence. In India, over 75% prisoners are pre-trial or undertrial detainees, many of whom remain incarcerated for decades.

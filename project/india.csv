Sign of four: GRAP to squeeze Delhi further

Also read:

NEW DELHI: The toxic haze hanging over NCR for past few days intensified on Sunday and Delhi’s average Air Quality Index deteriorated to the season’s worst of 441 at 4pm, well into the ‘severe’ zone, compared to 419 a day earlier. By 6pm, it had surpassed 450, reaching the ‘severe plus’ category, prompting Commission for Air Quality Management to impose the fourth and most extreme stage of Graded Response Action Plan in NCR from 8am on Monday.CM Atishi posted: “Physical classes shall be discontinued for all students, apart from Class 10 & 12. All schools will hold online classes till further orders.” Grap-4 also gives an option to central and NCR govts to shift to work-from-home for employees.GRAP-IV is clamped when the poison in the air reaches ""emergency' levels with AQI surpassing 450 (on a scale of 500). It primarily focuses on vehicular restrictions to reduce pollution. Under stage 4, entry of non-emergency trucks into Delhi has been barred for non-BS 6 compliant light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered outside Delhi, and BS-4 and below diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles in Delhi. The exemption earlier granted to construction and demolition (C&D) activities in linear public projects such as highways, roads, flyovers, over bridges, power transmission, and pipelines has now been removed.Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that the AQI rapidly surged through the day, as visibility remained poor. Delhi's AQI was 421 at 9am, which spiked to 452 at 6pm and further increased to 468 at 10pm. This was the fourth 'severe' day of the month. Before this, the AQI briefly remained in the 'severe plus' band on Nov 13 when it went up to 454 at 9pm. However, as CPCB considers the day's AQI at 4pm, Delhi on Sunday recorded an AQI of 441, the second highest this year after 447 on January 14.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, ""This is happening because of the combined impact of the deepening of winter inversion and trapping of high local and regional pollution. We need urgent measures to slow down further loading of pollution from the key sources.""The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 stood at 25.2% on Saturday, according to the Decision Support System.No respite from toxic air is expected in the next few days. ""The average AQI for Delhi is expected to remain in the adverse range owing to heavy fog, variable winds, highly unfavourable meteorological and climatic conditions. Forecasts from IMD/llTM indicate a likelihood of the AQI of Delhi to particularly remain in the higher end of the 'severe'/ 'severe+' category in the coming days,"" said CAQM.The measures under GRAP-IV are in addition to the preventive/restrictive actions mentioned under Stage 1 to 3, already in force. Though the ban on construction and demolition activity came into force on Nov 15 under stage 3 of GRAP, linear public projects were included in the exemption. However, the commission on Sunday banned C&D activity in linear public projects.CAQM said govts in Delhi and NCR to take a decision on allowing public, municipal, and private offices to work at 50% strength and the rest to work from home. Centre govt may take an appropriate decision on permitting work from home for employees in central govt offices. ""State govts may consider additional emergency measures like the closure of colleges/educational institutions and closure of non-emergency commercial activities, permitting the running of vehicles on an odd-even basis of registration numbers etc,"" said commission in its order.The Met department said mainly smog conditions with wind speed less than 6kmph from the northwest direction prevailed over the region in the forenoon on Sunday. Winds below 6kmph are unable to disperse pollutants.The lowest visibility on Sunday was 500 metres at Palam between 8.30am and 9am, while it dipped to 300m at 7am at Safdarjung, which is the city's base station, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). Even during the day, with sunlight staying faint, visibility remained low throughout the entire day. A maximum visibility of 900m was recorded at Palam at 5.30 pm and 800 metres at Safdarjung at 2.30 pm.By 11pm at night, visibility at Palam had dropped precipitously to 150m.Even the maximum temperature dipped to 27.2 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. It was the season's lowest maximum temperature. The minimum temperature stood at 15.9 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.IMD has issued an 'orange' alert for very dense to dense fog on Sunday night or Monday morning.","The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 stood at 25.2% on Saturday, according to the Decision Support System.

80-year-old who lives alone in a Uttarakhand ghost village is an unlikely film heroine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/80-year-old-who-lives-alone-in-a-uttarakhand-ghost-village-is-an-unlikely-film-heroine/articleshow/115395647.cms,"Film set 6km away, Devi worried about leaving buffalo alone

PITHORAGARH: Hira Devi, 80, is an unlikely film heroine from one of Uttarakhand's ghost villages, Gadtir, which has several empty houses because of migration. The octogenarian, who is illiterate and has lived in the mountain village most of her life, recently got a chance to star in 'Pyre', a film inspired by a story similar to her own, which will have its world premiere on Tuesday (Nov 19) at the 28th Tallinn Black Nights International Film Festival in Estonia.When she was invited to attend the festival, Devi had one concern - leaving behind her constant companion, her buffalo, since the-re is no one in the village to care for it.Produced by filmmaker Vinod Kapri, 'Pyre' tells a poignant love story of an elderly couple in their 80s. It is the only Indian entry selected in the 'Official Competition' category at the prestigious festival held annually in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.The film (Pyre) is based on a true tale from a village in Munsyari. Filmmaker Vinod Kapri wrote the screenplay and dialogues in 2018 after getting to know the story from a friend. Sudhir Rathor, a member of the production team, said they wanted to cast local villagers for the lead roles and were looking around the area to see who could fit the bill.Padam Singh, a former Army man from Munsyari and a regular performer in local Ramlilas, was cast as the male lead. While scouting around for the female lead, Kapri met a few local women carrying fodder from the forest who recommended Hira Devi for her cheerful and expressive nature and ability to sing.Initially, Devi was hesitant to take up the role as the filming location was 6km away from her home, and she didn't want to leave her buffalo alone for too long.A widow, she lives alone in the village and says that her buffalo serves as her primary companion. Her daughter is married and resides in Barani, while her two sons work in Delhi. She eventually agreed after her elder son, who was acquainted with Kapri, convinced her to go ahead.When the film was selected for Tallinn festival and she was asked if she could attend the premiere, Devi once again hesitated, with her primary concern being the buffalo again. However, with persuasion from the filmmakers, she asked her daughter to care for it in her absence.On Sunday, after her daughter arrived in the village, Devi, along with Kapri and Padam Singh, left for Tallinn to represent the film on the global stage, happy that the animal will be well cared for in her absence.","Hira Devi, 80, is an unlikely film heroine from Uttarakhand's ghost villages, Gadtir.

RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh Waqf board in a bid to let mosques in the state stay clear of controversy and undertake an image makeover has directed all Mutawallis (caretakers) at mosques and imams to seek approval on the topic of sermons to be delivered before the prayers every Friday. A circular to this effect was issued by the board on Sunday""Yes, Chhattisgarh is first state to have taken such a decision because mosques have become a centre of politics where Mutawallis serve and impose their own political will and inclination on people by issuing 'fatwa' about whom to vote and not. This leads to disturbing the communal harmony in the society. The decision for approval on subjects of sermons to be sought for, is purely legal and as per the Waqf Act,"" Salim Raj , Chhattisgarh Waqf Board chairman told TOI.Raj announced the decision during his visit to Jagdalpur where he had gone to look into the alleged financial irregularities being committed at mosques by Mutawallis. He added that as per the Waqf Act, Mutawallis' job and the meaning of this word is 'caretaker' of the mosque and they are supposed to be confined to their work as a caretaker, instead of indulging in other activities that disturb peace and communal harmony.""I have issued the order on a WhatsApp group as of now and will officially send it to all Mutawallis in mosques of the state. A mosque is a religious place of prayer and worship, not a political adda. The Jumma Namaz (Friday sermon) speeches should not have any political inclination or discussion or deliverance. The mosques should confine themselves to religious sermons and not a source of issuing fatwas for and against political parties,"" said Raj.The order will be effective from the coming Friday (November 22) across all mosques in the state, he said. There are several complaints of financial irregularities by Mutawallis while many of them have never presented accounts since 1997, Raj said, adding that he's going to lodge FIRs against such offenders soon.Reacting to the decision, Asaduddin Owaisi took to X stating, ""The Waqf Board of the BJP government in Chhattisgarh wants that before delivering the Friday sermon, the Khatib should get his sermon checked by the Waqf Board and should not deliver the sermon without the permission of the Board. Now the BJP people will tell us what is Deen (path)? Now do we have to take permission from them to follow our Deen? The Waqf Board does not have any such legal power, even if it had, it would still be against Article 25 of the Constitution.""",The Chhattisgarh Waqf board has directed all Mutawallis (caretakers) at mosques and imams to seek approval on the topic of sermons to be delivered before the prayers every Friday.

The bill proposes that holders of certain offices of profit will be exempted from being disqualified from becoming, or being, members of Parliament (MPs).The bill has incorporated certain recommendations made by joint committee on offices of profit (JCOP), then headed by Kalraj Mishra in the 16th Lok Sabha. The committee has suggested that MPs nominated in various flagship schemes and programmes, such as Swachh Bharat Mission , Smart City Mission and Deen Dayal Upadhyay-Grameen Kaushalya Yojana, should be saved from incurring disqualification.The ministry said the 1959 Act was enacted to declare that certain offices of profit under govt shall not disqualify the holders thereof for being chosen as, or for being, an MP. The JCOP undertook a comprehensive review of the Act and submitted recommendations, which included comprehensive definition of 'offices of profit'; insertion of provision to resolve the conflict between the Act and certain other statutes; omit the obsolete entries in the schedule; and amend the Act in a time-bound manner.""Keeping in view of the aforesaid recommendations of the JCOP, it is felt by the legislative department to repeal and re-enact the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959. Accordingly, ""A draft bill has been prepared on lines of the recommendations made by the JCOP,"" the law ministry said. Besides rationalising section 3 of the existing Act, doing away with negative list of offices provided in the schedule, the draft bill proposes to remove conflict between the existing Act and certain other statutes, which have a provision for not to incur disqualification.The draft bill also proposes to omit section 4 of the existing law relating to ""temporary suspension"" of disqualification in certain cases, and in its place, empower the central govt to amend the schedule by issuing a notification.","Law ministry has invited comments on draft legislation Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Bill, 2024.

"Ahead of Maharashtra, Delhi polls, Centre & city gas companies spar over CNG price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-maharashtra-delhi-polls-centre-city-gas-companies-spar-over-cng-price/articleshow/115394895.cms,"NEW DELHI: A cut in supply of government-controlled natural gas from legacy fields has sparked a fencing match between the oil ministry and city gas network operators who want to raise CNG prices to at least cover the higher cost of imported fuel being used to meet market demand.Government reduced legacy gas allocation for the city gas sector by 21% in October and 20% in November following a natural decline in production from old fields. This is pinching margins of companies such as Delhi-NCR's IGL, Mumbai's MGL and Adani Total Gas , which operates in Gujarat and other markets, as they are making up the shortfall with costlier gas from new fields or imported LNG (liquefied natural gas).Technically, govt doesn't control CNG or PNG prices. But, an upward revision in CNG prices, which impacts auto, taxi, bus and transport operators, at this point is politically untenable for Centre in view of assembly polls in Maharashtra and Delhi that are served by MGL and IGL, which are promoted by govt-run oil firm.People in the know told TOI a senior ministry official checkmated operators at a recent interaction by asking the executives to prove claims of loss by sharing their cost break-up, which they declined. This prompted the official to hit back, saying, ""How is it IGL posts a net profit of Rs 1,748 crore on a revenue of close to Rs 16,000 crore in 2023-24. That is a margin of 11%. MGL had a profit of about Rs 1,300 crore on a revenue of Rs 7,000 crore. Contrast this with Indian Oil Corporation, also a retailer. It posted its best-ever profit of Rs 39,617 crore on a revenue of Rs 8.7 lakh crore, implying a margin of 4.5%.""The official said they should be able to absorb the small increase in operating costs from their ""hefty"" margins. ""There cannot be a situation where you insist on getting low-cost input but refuse to reveal the buildup to the final product price,"" sources quoted another official as saying.","Government reduced legacy gas allocation for the city gas sector by 21% in October and 20% in November.

Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers as smog reduces visibility

Despite Delhi's air quality index (AQI) hitting a severe level of 428, Delhi Airport assures passengers that flight operations remain normal. Low visibility procedures are in effect, and travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight updates. The India Meteorological Department predicts stronger winds will improve air quality to a 'very poor' level.

Watch: Ghazipur landfill vanishes! Season's first fog deepens smog in Delhi, lowering visibility

Delhi woke to its first thick fog of the season, reducing visibility to zero in some areas and shrouding landmarks like the Ghazipur landfill. This severely impacted air travel, with flights diverted from Delhi Airport due to near-zero visibility. The fog also aggravated respiratory issues for residents already grappling with 'severe' air quality, as reported by the IMD and CPCB.

BATHINDA: There was little respite in air quality in Punjab on Friday as compared to the previous day — amid visibility at the lowest ebb — even as smog and fog remained comparatively for less time in the morning.The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for fog on Saturday.Though it was less hazy than Thursday, the sun was not visible throughout the day.For most part of the day, the AQI stayed under the ‘poor’ category and ‘moderate’ at times.Zero visibility was recorded at Amritsar and Chandigarh airports till 8.30 am.The visibility was recorded at 10 metres in Patiala, 50 metres in Halwara and Faridkot, 100 metres in Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Ludhiana.The worsening air quality is forcing people to remain indoors which is also impacting the election campaigning in Barnala and Gidderbaha.A number of functionaries, belonging to different political parties, said they had to reach out to people at their doorsteps or business establishments with very few people attending public meetings amid worsening air quality.The activity time in the day has shortened as the day starts after 9am and thick smog or fog starts descending early in the evening especially in the rural and outer areas.Advisories have been issued asking older people to avoid venturing out.Commuters have been asked to travel during the day and reach their destinations early in the evening.","Air quality index (AQI) hits a severe level of 428 in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Sunday directed the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Jharkhand to ensure the removal of the contentious post from the BJP's official social media platforms following complaints from the Congress and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.In addition to the takedown directive, the EC issued a notice to BJP Jharkhand, seeking an explanation for the alleged violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). The CEO was instructed to expedite the removal of the objectionable content in coordination with the state's designated authority under Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act.The video in question reportedly depicts a JMM supporter’s house adorned with party banners and a poster resembling Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, bearing the caption: ""Pure Jharkhand ka kaya palat kardenge"" (We will completely transform Jharkhand). The footage then shows individuals from a specific community entering the house unannounced, allegedly with the intent of forcibly residing there.The INC and JMM have claimed that the video is riddled with baseless allegations and falsehoods, accusing BJP Jharkhand of attempting to influence voters by fomenting hatred and enmity against JMM leaders.The controversy in Jharkhand comes amid heightened scrutiny over MCC violations during the ongoing Assembly polls. On Saturday, the EC sought responses from BJP president JP Nadda and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge regarding complaints against their respective star campaigners.The BJP has filed complaints against Rahul Gandhi, while the Congress has raised objections to remarks made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah during campaign speeches. Both party leaders have been asked to respond to the allegations by 1 pm on Monday, November 18, 2024.The EC reminded the party presidents of its advisory from May 2024 during the Lok Sabha elections, urging them to ensure that their star campaigners and leaders uphold public decorum and adhere to the MCC in letter and spirit.Jharkhand has completed voting for the first phase of its Assembly elections, covering 43 out of 81 seats. The remaining 38 seats, alongside Maharashtra's 288 constituencies, will go to the polls on November 20.

GUWAHATI/SILCHAR: The bodies of an unclothed woman and a girl child stuffed into a gunny sack washed ashore in the Barak river in south Assam Sunday, hours after neighbouring Manipur convulsed in mob mayhem over the discovery of six corpses - suspected to be of the three women and as many children reported missing from a relief camp for the displaced in violence-ravaged Jiribam.News of two more bodies being found, one at Chirighat in Assam's Cachar and the other at Singerband III in the same district, came after nightlong arson and mob attacks targeting the homes of 13 MLAs - nine of them from BJP - in the Imphal valley. Just as violence seemed to have ebbed, a mob demanding to meet BJP MLA Kongkham Robindro vandalised his ancestral house in Imphal West Sunday evening, police said.Another house belonging to the legislator in the district had been attacked the previous evening. The homes of PWD minister Govindas Konthoujam at Ningthoukhong, BJP MLAs Y Radheshyam and Paonam Brojen at Langmeidong Bazar and Thoubal respectively, and Congress legislator Th Lokeshwar in Imphal East were among those either vandalised or burned down.One group of protesters assaulted NPP’s Kakching MLA Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh, sources said.Police have arrested 23 people for ransacking and arson amid an indefinite curfew and internet ban in Imphal East, Imphal West and Bishnupur districts. A .32 pistol, seven rounds of ammunition, and eight mobile phones were seized from them.Eight civilians were injured in the crackdown on vandals as the Army and Assam Rifles flag-marched through areas ravaged by violence. CRPF DG Anish Dayal Singh arrived in Imphal to supervise the security response.In Jiribam, where the current spell of unrest started with armed intruders allegedly raping a tribal woman and burning her to death on November 7 and CRPF killing 10 Hmar “militants” on Nov 11, Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum alleged that at least five churches, a school, a fuel pump and 14 Kuki-Zo homes were set ablaze late Saturday.Police officials also found a man’s body in the restive district, but details about how he died weren’t immediately available.Around noon on Sunday, Lakhipur police station in Assam’s Cachar reported that the body of an unidentified girl child inside a sack flowed downstream from Manipur. Less than four hours earlier, Banskandi police outpost had been alerted about the decomposed, naked body of a woman being found floating in the Barak at Chirighat.Cachar SP Numal Mahatta said that both the bodies have been sent for autopsy to Silchar Medical College and Hospital.NDTV quoted Laisharam Herojit, a family member of the six missing inmates of the relief camp in Jiribam, that his worst fears had come true.He said his wife, two children, mother-in-law, sister-in-law and nephew were all dead, murdered in captivity by suspected tribal militants after they were taken hostage during the melee last Monday following the gunfight in which security forces killed 10 “militants”.Kuki-Zo and Hmar groups say the slain men were “volunteers” tasked with safeguarding their villages from intruders.","The bodies of an unclothed woman and a girl child stuffed into a gunny sack washed ashore in the Barak river in south Assam.

So did Jharna Marandi, an Adivasi, who lived there. ""Mohabbat hoye gechhilo amader (We fell in love),"" said Ashraful, who married Jharna, now pradhan of Nartanpur village.Jharna and Ashraful married following Adivasi customs , she never changed her surname, did not convert to Islam. While he offers namaaz five times a day and keeps roza during Ramzan, Jharna follows tribal customs.In nearby Kasila village in Pakur, Sanat Marandi didn't know what to do with his large tract of land. He did not have the wherewithal to put it to use, neither could he sell it as tribal land is non-transferable under the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act. Then, like many others, he found a middle path - to give away a part of the land for a lower price - known as 'Daan Patra' (gift deed) transfer. Shabbir Sheikh, a resident of nearby Sangrampur, ""bought"" a piece of land from Sanat and is running his business.Sanat continued to remain the legal landowner as his land is non-transferable and deposited annual rental to the govt, which in turn is paid to him by Shabbir.As Pakur, which is closest to the Bangladesh border in Jharkhand, heads to polls on November 20 amid a high-pitched campaign revolving around ""ghuspethiyas"" (infiltrators) crossing the border to ""grab land, livelihoods and even Adivasi women"", Jharna, Ashraful, Shabbir and Sanat have suddenly become Pakur's poster boys, the face of what residents called an age-old parampara that is now a part of the social fabric of Santhal Parganas and is also taking care of the region's socio-economic crisis.The issue, which has both NDA and INDIA bloc trading charges and counter charges in Pakur, a Muslim-dominated district which has a history of Mughal settlement, seems to have left residents in pain.""We follow Islam, we speak Bangla and are historically too poor to own any landed property. But we are not Bangladeshis,"" said Muzaffar Sheikh, who runs a mobile phone repair shop in Kasila. Hindus and tribals echo the sentiment.There's fear too after Muslims reportedly pelted Hindu homes with stones in the Taranagar-Ilami area of Pakur in July, after a Muslim boy was beaten up by a mob following reports that he had recorded a video of a Hindu girl and had intended to upload it on social media. The incident found mention in Lok Sabha, with BJP MP from Godda Nishikant Dubey saying Hindus have begun fleeing the area.While allegations of infiltration fly high and thick, locals say people from Bangladesh, who have valid visas, come to India to buy stuff cheap or meet relatives. ""The hazards of crossing over doesn't make it viable,"" said Samir Saha, a traffic assistant with Dhuliyan Municipal Corporation, in Murshidabad district of West Bengal that shares a border with Pakur.Fencing has come up across the border, 90% of which is complete, with the western-most point of Bangladesh - Manakosa Union in Rajshahi division - protruding into Sovapur panchayat.""Dada, amra ki Bangladeshi? (You think we are Bangladeshis?)"", asked Sanjay Saha, a shopkeeper at Dhuliyan ferry ghat, with a chuckle.Narendra Singh, assistant commandant at BSF's Sovapur outpost, said there have been five infiltration attempts in the last two years. ""The last such attempt was nine months ago,"" he said. Singh said people are more interested in smuggling goods than crossing the border to settle. ""People from both countries live close to the border, and they have to venture across the fence sometimes, but we keep their identity cards at the checkpost,"" Singh added. ""Allegations of infiltration and branding locals as foreigners are tearing apart the centuries-old, close-knit social fabric,"" said former MLA Aquil AkhtarKey NDA partner AJSU Party, which has fielded its candidate in Pakur, did not include the issue of infiltration in its manifesto.","Pakur, closest to the Bangladesh border in Jharkhand, heads to polls on November 20.

NEW DELHI: At a rally in Solapur’s Madha, NCP (Sharad Pawar) supremo Sharad Pawar delivered a fiery message to his detractors, urging voters to decisively defeat those who rebelled under his nephew Ajit Pawar ’s leadership. Recounting a decades-old betrayal, the 83-year-old leader underscored his resilience and the importance of standing firm against political backstabbing.Pawar recalled an episode from 1980, when a defection within his party caused him to lose the post of Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly . ""When I returned from abroad, I discovered that 52 of the 58 MLAs from my party had switched sides under then-Chief Minister AR Antulay. I lost my position as LoP,"" he said.Rather than react immediately, Pawar strategized. ""For three years, I traveled across the state and worked hard. In the next elections, I fielded young candidates against all 52 defectors . The people of Maharashtra ensured that all 52 were defeated,"" he stated.Addressing the crowd, Pawar emphasized the importance of teaching defectors a lesson. ""Don’t just defeat them—defeat them big,"" he urged, as supporters cheered loudly, completing his paused statement with chants of his name.The rally comes amidst heightened tensions within the NCP, which split in July 2023 after Ajit Pawar and eight MLAs aligned with the Shinde government. The Election Commission subsequently awarded Ajit Pawar’s faction the party name and ‘clock’ symbol, while Sharad Pawar’s faction was designated NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) with the ‘man blowing tutari’ symbol.In a symbolic battle within the Pawar family, Sharad Pawar’s faction has fielded Yugendra Pawar, his grandnephew, against Ajit Pawar in Baramati. Ajit Pawar’s wife Sunetra Pawar also faced defeat in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, losing to sitting MP Supriya Sule, Sharad Pawar’s daughter.With Maharashtra’s political landscape in flux, Sharad Pawar’s rally set the tone for what promises to be a fierce electoral battle.","Sharad Pawar urges voters to decisively defeat those who rebelled under his nephew Ajit Pawar ’s leadership.

House panel on OBCs likely to push for 'equivalence of posts',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-panel-on-obcs-likely-to-push-for-equivalence-of-posts/articleshow/115394493.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a key parliamentary panel preparing to nudge Centre to ""correct"" the ""flawed"" implementation of "" creamy layer "" for OBCs in certain categories, the focus is set to fall on protracted absence of "" equivalence of posts "" which is at the root of the controversy.Sources said the panel on OBC welfare is likely to push government to ensure ""equivalence"" across its institutions. ""Equivalence of posts"" refers to categorising posts in PSUs, banks, universities, etc, as Group A, B, C, D, like in the government.BJP government had in 2017 announced with much fanfare that ""equivalence"" will be established across government departments and bodies, pending since 1993. But it is understood there is no news about ""equivalence"" having been done by most of the bodies, besides perennial disagreements about ""equivalence"" letters issued by states.Also, while department of public enterprises (DPE) and department of financial services (DFS) did come out with ""equivalence"" for central PSUs and banks in 2017, the categorisation has been mired in controversies.It now emerges that the parliamentary committee , in a special report on ""rationalisation of creamy layer in employment of OBCs"" submitted in March 2019, had questioned ""equivalence"" done by the two key departments.""The committee (members) have felt reverberations of dissatisfaction being experienced on account of 'equivalence' established both by DPE and DFS. The public opinion is, by and large extent, against it. They, therefore, recommend that equivalence set by DFS and DPE should be revisited in letter and spirit of expert committee report and DoPT OM of 1993,"" it noted. However, the government later defended it in the action taken report (ATR) to the committee.The government includes ""salary"" in computing ""income"" of candidates of PSU background, which is contrary to 1993 OM of DoPT that lays down that ""income"" will not include ""salary"" & ""agricultural income"".

"Amid global race, India tests its first hypersonic missile",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-global-race-india-tests-its-first-hypersonic-missile/articleshow/115394765.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant development amid the frenetic race among China, Russia and the US to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, India has tested its first long-range missile that is manoeuvrable mid-flight and flies over five times the speed of sound to evade enemy missile defence systems.The hypersonic missile, designed to carry various payloads for ranges over 1,500km, was ""successfully flight-tested"" from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha at 6.55pm on Saturday, a defence ministry official said.The missile, which flew at Mach 6 speed, was tracked by various range systems deployed in multiple domains. ""The flight data obtained from down range ship stations confirmed the successful terminal manoeuvres and impact with high degree of accuracy,"" the official added.Describing it as ""a historic moment and stupendous achievement"", defence minister Rajnath Singh said the flight-trial has propelled India into a group of select nations that has the capability to develop such ""critical and advanced military technologies"".Former DRDO chairman G Satheesh Reddy told TOI the missile is ""a gamechanger"" with multiple applications in Army, Navy and IAF. ""A missile of this range with hypersonic velocities will provide a decisive edge to India.""The missile, with the speed of a ballistic missile as well as the manoeuvring capability of a cruise missile, of course, will have to be fine-tuned with several tests over the next few years before it is ready for production and deployment. The naval version will be geared towards destroying enemy warships at long ranges with pinpoint precision, an official said.With their capability to defeat existing missile and air defence systems due to super-fast speeds, high-manoeuvrability and low altitudes of flight, hypersonic weapons have become a major focus area for major military powers. The two main types of hypersonic weapons are cruise missiles that are powered by air-breathing engines or ""scramjets"" during their entire flight and ""glide vehicles"" that are launched atop ballistic missiles before gliding to their targets at speeds over Mach 5.China and Russia are ahead of the US in designing aerodynamically manoeuvrable hypersonic weapons for use with nuclear warheads. In July 2021, for instance, China's test of a nuclear-capable missile carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle and warhead had sent shockwaves around the globe.In June 2019, DRDO for the first time tested a hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV), which was to serve as a crucial building block in the development of long-range hypersonic weapons. But the flight trial failed.A second test in September 2020 was successful to the extent that the scramjet-powered ""cruise vehicle"" or HSTDV flew for 22-23 seconds at Mach 6 speed after separation from the ""launch vehicle"" of solid rocket motor of an Agni-I ballistic missile at 30km altitude. While another HSTDV test was conducted in Jan last year, trials of a much longer duration are needed on this front, as reported by TOI earlier.Parallelly, there was a plan to develop a hypersonic version of the already-inducted conventional (non-nuclear) ramjet-powered BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which fly at Mach 2.8 speed with a 450-km strike range, developed with Russia. But this will be an expensive proposition and is not on the cards at present, an official said.","India has tested its first long-range missile that is manoeuvrable mid-flight and flies over five times the speed of sound.

Continuous running of life-support devices led to Jhansi hospital fire: Probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/continuous-running-of-life-support-devices-led-to-jhansi-hospital-fire-probe/articleshow/115393664.cms,"LUCKNOW/JHANSI: Preliminary investigations revealed that excessive electrical load caused by overcrowding and the continuous operation of life-support equipment led to a short circuit that sparked a fire in an oxygen concentrator and flames soon engulfed the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Maharani Laxmibai Medical College in UP's Jhansi Friday night. The devastating blaze claimed the lives of 10 newborn babies - three girls and seven boys.According to witnesses, the overheated oxygen concentrator leaked oxygen, accelerating the spread of the flames. ""We are examining other safety lapses, and another team from a different department is looking into management negligence,"" chief fire officer Raj Kishore Rai said, while emphasising the need for better safety measures, such as the inclusion of two doors - one for entry and one for exit - in wards.The ward, designed to accommodate 18 babies, was reportedly overcrowded with 49 infants at the time of the fire. The infants were suffering from conditions such as jaundice and pneumonia.To maintain optimal conditions, equipment like warmers and monitoring devices were running continuously. This placed additional strain on the equipment and led to the fatal overheating. Experts said these devices require periodic shutdowns to prevent overheating, a protocol that was allegedly overlooked by administrators of the govt-run hospital.The autopsies, conducted by three specialised teams of doctors and pathologists, confirmed that all the infants suffered over 80% burns and died within minutes. Soot particles were found in their airways, indicating they inhaled smoke. The bodies were handed over to the grieving parents Saturday, amid demands for accountability and justice.Kapil Yadav, a father who managed to rescue his newborn, alleged that while two staff members stayed to assist, the rest escaped through a rear door.","Overcrowding and the continuous operation of life-support equipment led to a short circuit that sparked a fire in an oxygen concentrator.

"NMC charges Rs 2L one-time fee to hike MBBS seats, PG intake up 450 so far",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-charges-rs-2l-one-time-fee-to-hike-mbbs-seats-pg-intake-up-450-so-far/articleshow/126406660.cms,"ANI Photo

NEW DELHI: The National Medical Commission has introduced a non-refundable one-time registration fee of Rs 2 lakh plus 18% GST for institutions seeking to start new MBBS colleges or increase undergraduate seats from the 2026–27 academic year. It has also cleared around 450 additional postgraduate (PG) medical seats for 2025–26 through the appeal process and removed the cap that limited MBBS seat expansion applications to 100 seats at a time.Explaining the new fee, Dr M K Ramesh, president of the Medical Assessment and Rating Board, said the move is aimed at ensuring serious intent and accountability, stressing that establishing a medical college cannot be treated as a routine business decision. He said the registration fee is separate from the existing application fee of Rs 5 lakh for 50 MBBS seats, which rises with higher intake, and only partly offsets the cost of inspections, including travel and stay for three to five assessors conducting multi-day assessments.“The fee applies equally to government and private colleges, generates a unique registration number for tracking applications, and is payable again only if an institution applies in a subsequent academic year, as reapplication is not permitted within the same year,” he said.On MBBS expansion, Dr Ramesh said the earlier 100-seat cap was withdrawn because it had no explicit backing in existing regulations and could not be legally sustained. While the cap was intended to prevent sharp jumps from 50 directly to 250 seats, it was removed after being found unsupported in law. The official said new medical colleges can apply for up to 150 MBBS seats, while existing colleges with 150 seats can expand up to 250, with applications considered on an all-or-nothing basis. Inspections will be intensified for institutions seeking large, single-cycle expansions.On postgraduate admissions, he said PG seat approvals by the first appeal committee are cumulative and ongoing. While earlier notices cited 171 and later 262 additional seats, the total PG seats cleared through appeals so far is around 450, with further additions possible. The additional PG seats—mostly incremental increases of one to four seats per programme—span high-demand specialties including general medicine, radiodiagnosis, dermatology, paediatrics, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry and general surgery, across medical colleges nationwide.According to the available list, most of these seats have gone to private medical colleges, though some government institutions are also included.The MARB has directed counselling authorities to include the newly sanctioned PG seats without waiting for individual Letters of Permission (LoPs), treating the consolidated list uploaded on the NMC website as a valid document for counselling. Officials said publishing consolidated appeal approvals online was introduced to speed up admissions and improve transparency.",The National Medical Commission has introduced a non-refundable one-time registration fee of Rs 2 lakh plus 18% GST for institutions seeking to start new MBBS colleges.

NEW DELHI: Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission — on Monday (January 12) at 10.17 am from the first launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport. The rocket will launch an advanced earth observation satellite EOS-N1 (codenamed ‘Anvesha’), another ‘eye in the sky’ that will boost India’s surveillance powers from space. Besides the primary payload EOS-N1, PSLV will also be carrying an European demonstrator satellite and 17 other satellites belonging to Indian and foreign agencies.EOS-N1 is a hyperspectral imaging satellite developed primarily for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It is capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance. It will help India secure its borders because of its advanced remote sensing capabilities and will also be used in various fields such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Besides EOS-N1, 18 secondary payloads, including Europe’s Kestrel Initial Demonstrator (KID), will piggyback on the primary satellite and will be placed in space. The KID mission will feature an experimental re-entry of a small capsule in collaboration with a Spanish startup, with a planned splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Other secondary payloads are cubesats from Indian startups and universities, including OrbitAID's AayulSAT, CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace is set to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT aims to extend satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.The upcoming PSLVC62 mission is also seen as a comeback for the PSLV programme following the earlier setback with PSLV-C61 in May 2025. The earlier PSLV-C61 mission had failed to launch EOS-09 earth observation satellite due to a technical issue in the rocket's third stage, specifically a drop in chamber pressure, preventing the satellite from reaching its intended sun-synchronous polar orbit. While the first two stages performed normally, the anomaly in the third stage led to the mission failure.",Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission.

NEW DELHI: Members of a parliamentary committee on Wednesday debated whether opposition parties, which have refused joining their panel formed to study a bill aimed at ""decriminalisation"" of politics, should be invited to offer their views on the proposed law and if the leader of opposition can be removed from office under its provisions.Law Commission of India chairperson Dinesh Maheshwari was among the key figures who shared their views with the Joint Committee of Parliament scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill and two related bills, which seek removal from office of PM, CMs and ministers if they are under arrest for 30 days and more on serious criminal charges.A BJP MP, sources said, flagged a scenario when the governing party refuses to name the replacement for PM and CMs in case they are removed from office due to their detention and said amendments should be made to plug this loophole to rule out such a possibility that can cripple governance, especially in times of crisis in the country or a state.If such a case arises, then the president of the country or the governor of a state should be legally empowered to use their discretion if a replacement of the arrested head of govt is not forthcoming, he suggested.Congress and most other opposition parties have refused to join the committee, which is headed by BJP's Aparajita Sarangi, as they have slammed the bill as unconstitutional and politically motivated.The committee has only two MPs from the opposition among its members-Supriya Sule of NCP(SP) and AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi.When one of them suggested that opposition parties should be invited to offer their views on the bill, several MPs questioned the proposal noting that they had ignored repeated suggestions by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to join the panel.Some members also wondered if the leader of opposition can be removed from office under the bill's provisions.Though the two LoPs in Parliament, and LoPs in state assemblies enjoy certain govt protocols, they are not considered part of the executive and are not covered under the current provisions of the bill.Sources said Maheshwari and Hyderabad-based National Academy of Legal Studies and Research's VC Sri Krishna Deva Rao agreed with the idea behind the bill's aim for decriminalisation of politics amid several suggestions made by them and committee's members.","Law Commission of India chairperson Dinesh Maheshwari was among key figures who shared their views with the Joint Committee of Parliament scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill.

""Our opposition to Nehru is not personal but on principles. His letters underline how scary and dangerous his ideas were.We are not tarnishing his image. We are merely unmasking it as Congress continues to follow the same principle,"" BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said.Modi will offer prayers at the temple and pay tributes at the statue of Sardar Patel outside its precincts. He is also scheduled to attend a roadshow and Shaurya Yatra, dedicated to those who laid down their lives defending the temple from invaders, and address a large public gathering.""The year marks 1,000 years since Mahmud Ghazni's attack on the Somnath temple in 1026 AD, while also completing 75 years of Sardar Patel's historic resolve to rebuild the shrine. To mark this rare convergence, the festival has been planned to honour Somnath's legacy of resilience and valour,"" Gujarat minister Jitu Vaghani said. Highlighting the key attractions of the festival, the Gujarat minister said a mega drone show featuring 3,000 drones - the largest of its kind - will depict the history and grandeur of Somnath in the night sky.Prime Minister Modi's visit on Jan 11, which marks 1,000 years of the temple's destruction by Mahmud Ghazni, and his projection of its revival as a tribute to India's cultural resilience coupled with Nehru's wariness of the revered temple's rebuilding have provided a fresh ballast to BJP's campaign to paint Congress as indifferent if not outrightly hostile to the country's Hindu heritage but being rather sensitive to interests of minorities, especially Muslims.Nehru wrote over 17 letters to question the need for Somnath temple's reconstruction, including to the then president, vice president, cabinet ministers and chief ministers, and asked public broadcasters to minimise its coverage.He said Nehru prioritised ""external appeasement over internal self-confidence"". ""Somnath was plundered by Mahmud Ghazni and Khilji in the past, but in independent India, Pandit Nehru harboured the greatest hatred towards Lord Somnath,"" he alleged.","BJP launches fresh attack on Congress for its opposition to the reconstruction of the revered temple.

Varma: Jt probe panel needed for removal motion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/varma-jt-probe-panel-needed-for-removal-motion-sc-disagrees-with-justice-varmas-stand-on-rs-notice/articleshow/126404603.cms,"SC disagrees with Justice Varma over RS notice



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday asked Justice Yashwant Varma, facing a removal motion in the Lok Sabha, how he was prejudiced by the Speaker constituting a panel to inquire into the charges of cash being found at his residence as he pleaded that it should have been done in consultation with the Rajya Sabha chairman.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that as per the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, if the motion for removal is presented in both Houses on the same day, the inquiry committee was to be constituted jointly by the Speaker and the Chairman. However, the Speaker unilaterally constituted the panel. tnnRohatgi, aided by senior advocates Sidharth Luthra and Sidharth Agarwal, argued on behalf of Justice Varma for little over an hour raising three issues - that then RS Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar had found the motion moved by more than 50 MPs in the Upper House to be in order, RS deputy chairperson had no authority to reject the motion on Aug 11, and that the inquiry committee should have been constituted jointly.The bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma said it prima facie disagreed with the arguments on two points and posted the hearing for Thursday to hear Rohatgi on how the constitution of the inquiry committee by the LS Speaker vitiated the process.Responding to Justice Varma's charge that the law stipulated only the RS Chair to admit or reject a notice for removal motion, solicitor general Tushar Mehta was able to convince the court that when the post of Chairperson was vacant, which was when Dhankar resigned on July 21 hours after receiving the removal motion, the deputy chairperson is constitutionally capable of discharging all the duties.He said the RS Chairman had neither scrutinised the motion nor taken a decision to admit it as is being wrongly projected by Justice Varma. ""The secretary general of RS undertook scrutiny of the motion presented by 62 MPs and notice of the motion was presented before the RS deputy chairperson along with the report of the secretary general showing that the motion was defective on many counts,"" he said.In any case, the very purpose of the MPs who moved the motion in RS was to initiate proceedings under section 3 of the Act for removal of Justice Varma, which is fully satisfied due to admission of similar motion by the LS Speaker, Mehta said.On Justice Varma's plea that reference to the CJI-constituted in-house committee, which found him liable, in the Speaker's order has rendered the inquiry biased against him, the LS secretariat in its affidavit said the Speaker merely mentioned the in-house inquiry report and it would not be correct to say that the Speaker had relied on it.The Speaker-constituted inquiry panel headed by Justice Aravind Kumar has already supplied to Justice Varma the memo of charges along with the evidence, mainly comprising of the videos of the burning cash recorded by Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel on the night of March 14-15 while dousing a fire in a room inside the judge's Lutyens Zone bungalow.It has permitted Justice Varma to respond to the charges by Jan-end.",Supreme Court asks Justice Yashwant Varma how he was prejudiced by the Speaker constituting a panel to inquire into the charges of cash being found at his residence.

Donald Trump Says PM Modi 'Not Happy With Me' Over Higher Russian Oil Tariffs

US President Donald Trump has said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “not that happy” with him because of the tariffs Washington has imposed on India over its purchases of Russian oil, linking trade pressure directly to New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.Speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, Trump referred to his interactions with the Indian leader while discussing US defence sales and tariffs.He claimed India had raised concerns over delays in receiving US military hardware and said the issue was now being addressed. “India ordered 68 Apaches,” Trump said, adding that India had told him it had been waiting for five years for the helicopters, as per PTI.During his remarks, Trump said he shared a good relationship with Modi but acknowledged the strain caused by tariffs. “He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil, but they are — they’ve now reduced it very substantially, as you know, from Russia,” Trump said, according to PTI.Trump has imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India, which includes a 25 per cent levy linked specifically to India’s purchases of Russian oil, PTI reported. He also used the platform to defend his tariff policy more broadly, claiming the US was benefiting financially from the measures.The comments come amid repeated warnings from Trump to New Delhi over its continued oil trade with Russia.Earlier, Trump said the US could raise tariffs further if India does not “help on the Russian oil issue,” directly tying the threat to the Russia–Ukraine war.He has accused India of strengthening Moscow by buying discounted Russian crude and has cited this as the reason for sharply higher duties on Indian goods.Trump has also portrayed the tariff pressure as a tool to influence India’s behaviour, saying New Delhi knew he was unhappy and wanted to keep trade relations on track.At the same time, he has sought to position himself as a potential mediator in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, holding talks with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though without any concrete breakthrough.India, for its part, has previously rejected Trump’s claim that PM Modi had assured him New Delhi would stop buying Russian oil, clarifying that no such conversation took place.","US President Donald Trump says PM Narendra Modi is 'not that happy' with him.

Understanding quiet firing

Workplace Anxiety Linked to Rising Health Issues Among Employees

Why is it becoming more visible now

Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace report (June 2024)

What quiet firing looks like in practice

Trend or tactic?

The human cost

Why organisations should be concerned

So, what is quiet firing really?

The silence in a workplace can sometimes say more than a formal warning letter ever could. When emails go unanswered, meetings move ahead without you, and your role begins to shrink without explanation, it may not be a coincidence. Increasingly, it is being recognised as something more deliberate, quiet firing.At first glance, the term sounds like another addition to the growing lexicon of workplace buzzwords. But beneath the phrasing lies a practice that is neither new nor harmless. Quiet firing reflects a deeper shift in how organisations manage exits, accountability, and discomfort, often at the cost of employee dignity.Quiet firing refers to a managerial practice where an employee is not directly terminated but is gradually pushed out of the organisation. Instead of formal performance conversations or clear decisions, managers withdraw responsibility, opportunity, support, and visibility until the job becomes untenable. The employee, drained and demoralised, eventually resigns.Unlike layoffs or firings, quiet firing operates in the shadows. There is no clear moment of rupture, no written explanation, and no closure. The ambiguity is the strategy.This approach has gained renewed attention in recent years, particularly as organisations navigate economic uncertainty, remote work, and legal complexity.Direct terminations involve severance, documentation, and risk. Quiet firing avoids all three.Workplace disengagement has created fertile ground for this phenomenon. According to, a significant share of employees worldwide report feeling unsupported, disconnected, and emotionally detached from their organisations. Quiet firing does not just exploit this disengagement; it actively produces it.As work becomes more distributed and communication more asynchronous, it is easier for managers to disengage without appearing overtly hostile. Silence replaces confrontation. Inaction replaces leadership. This is why quiet firing often goes unnamed until the damage is done.Quiet firing is rarely about a single act. It is a pattern built over time. Feedback stops, both positive and corrective. Career conversations vanish. Access to key projects, meetings, or decision-making is quietly withdrawn. Resources dry up. Responsibilities are reassigned without explanation, and pay stagnates.Basically, the company continues to pay the employee, but the latter has no real role or function. The message is not directly stated, but it is absolutely clear: your existence is tolerated, not appreciated. As a leader, this is undoubtedly a failure to handle performance in an open and honest way. Leaders who can't be bothered to set expectations or confront issues directly resort to using ambiguity as a way of exerting pressure.Calling quiet firing a “trend” risks understating its seriousness. While the term itself may be new, the behaviour is not. What has changed is its scale and normalisation.In earlier workplace cultures, avoidance was often limited by physical proximity and hierarchical clarity. Today, remote teams, matrix structures, and platform-based communication allow exclusion to happen quietly and systematically.The danger lies in how easily quiet firing can be rationalised, as pragmatism, cost control, or managerial discretion when it is, in effect, a way to transfer organisational discomfort onto individuals.For employees, quiet firing is psychologically destabilising. The lack of clarity makes it difficult to respond, improve, or even defend oneself. Confidence erodes, self-doubt replaces certainty. Many begin to internalise the silence as personal failure.Unlike formal termination, which at least offers finality, quiet firing prolongs uncertainty. It keeps employees suspended between hope and rejection, often for months.Teams notice too. When colleagues see someone slowly erased without explanation, trust weakens. Silence becomes instructive. Speaking up feels risky.While quiet firing may appear convenient in the short term, it carries long-term consequences. It undermines psychological safety, damages employer reputation, and signals a lack of ethical leadership.More critically, it reveals a deeper organisational problem: an inability to handle difficult conversations. Healthy workplaces do not avoid discomfort; they manage it. Performance issues, role mismatches, and changing priorities require clarity, not quiet withdrawal.Quiet firing is not just a passing workplace trend. It is a persistent organisational behaviour that has serious implications. It shows underlying issues with accountability, power, and risk. Quiet firing is a symptom of a lack of leadership and the presence of ambiguity, in which no one seems to make decisions.While employee well-being, transparency, and ethical management become more and more topics of discussion, quiet firing is still there, as a contradiction, silent, strategic, and deeply consequential. The question, in fact, should not be whether quiet firing exists. Why so many workplaces still find it easier to be silent than to be honest is the real issue.","Quiet firing refers to a managerial practice where an employee is not directly terminated but is gradually pushed out of the organisation.

NEW DELHI: The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in poll-bound West Bengal mocked Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya after he mispronounced the name of Kolkata-based football club Mohun Bagan during a press conference.In the clip, Mandaviya was seen struggling to pronounce “Mohun Bagan” correctly, eventually uttering a word that sounded like “baigan”, the Hindi term for eggplant. The mispronunciation quickly became the subject of online trolling.West Bengal’s ruling party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), on Wednesday also reacted to the clip, using it to mock the Union minister and point out the error in his pronunciation.""The Union Sports Minister has, once again, revealed the deep-seated contempt the BJP harbours towards Bengal. He mangled the names of our most revered football institutions, referring to the legendary Mohun Bagan as ""Mohan baigan"" and the iconic East Bengal as ""East baigan"".The party further wrote: ""For Bengalis, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are symbols of identity and pride. We have lived and breathed this beautiful game for over a century, celebrating victories with the same fervor as festivals and mourning defeats as personal loss.""Accusing the rival BJP of viewing Bengal through the ""lens of Bangla-Birodhi arrogance"", the TMC claimed that for the saffron party, anything associated with Bengal ""merits only mockery and dismissal.""""Yet, those who view Bengal through the lens of Bangla-Birodhi arrogance cannot even extend the basic courtesy of pronouncing these sacred names correctly. Why would they? In their eyes, anything associated with Bengal merits only mockery and dismissal,"" the TMC wrote on X.Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday said that the Indian Super League (ISL) will start from February 14. The minister also noted that all 14 clubs have agreed to play the ISL this season.""We have decided that the ISL will start on February 14, Saturday, and all of our clubs will participate in it,"" Mansukh Mandaviya told the reporters.""In the country, football has progressed.

13 More Satellites



BENGALURU: India’s first space mission for 2026 will launch a defence satellite built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), a satellite for ministry of external affairs (MEA) to be used by Nepal, test on-orbit refuelling technology of a Bengaluru-based startup, aside from 13 other satellites, including foreign ones from UK, France and Brazil.The launch of PSLV-C62 mission, Isro said, is scheduled for January 12 at 10.17 am from the first launch pad (FLP) of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Sriharikota. The main satellite the mission will launch is DRDO’s Anvesha, also called EOS-N1.EOS-N1 is designed to provide the Indian military with advanced, unprecedented surveillance advantages over adversaries. The hyperspectral imaging payload can analyse light in hundreds of wavelengths to identify the materials an object is made of, a capability beyond the human eye.While this satellite is expected to bridge the gap in strategic surveillance to some degree, the mission will also launch AyulSAT, built by Bengaluru’s OrbitAID Aerospace, which if successful will be the first step towards India demonstrating the crucial on-orbit refuelling technology which will have far-reaching benefits.OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar Ramachandran terms AayulSAT more than a mission. “...It’s the foundation of the on-orbit economy,” he says, while the company says: “Years from now, this won’t be remembered as a launch but as the moment India made space serviceable. From India to the world!”A third important satellite will be Munal, built by Nepal’s Antharkshya Pratishtan with help from India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA).It is intended to carry an Earth observation payload to support environmental monitoring and capacity building, marking another step in Nepal’s entry into space-based applications.Aside from these three, the mission will put into orbit 13 more satellites, including five — CGUSAT, DSUSAT, MOI-1, LACHIT and DR-1 — by Indian startup Dhruva Space. They will demonstrate or validate multiple technologies, including indigenous satellite bus capabilities and subsystems, communication and payload subsystems in low Earth orbit, multi-payload integration and operational performance of larger CubeSat platforms, basic satellite operations and communication links, etc.Foreign satellites on the mission include five satellites by Brazil’s AlltoSpace, Theos-2 from SSTL, UK, and KID Capsule by RIDE, France. The five satellites from Brazil are EduSat, Uaisat, Galaxy Explorer, Orbital Temple, and Aldebaran-1. The last is a CubeSat called Sanskarsat by Laxman Gyanpith, India.All satellites have been contracted through Space PSU NewSpace India Limited (Nsil), the commercial arm of the department of space.","The launch of PSLV-C62 mission is scheduled for January 12 at 10.17 am from the first launch pad (FLP) of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Sriharikota.

JAMMU: A gun battle broke out between security forces and terrorists in the forests in the upper reaches of Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, on Wednesday, where a group of two-three ultras was suspected to be hiding. Around 4pm that evening, locals had reported spotting a terror suspect in Kamad Nallah area.“On being alerted, a joint team of security forces, including SOG Kathua and CRPF personnel, rushed to the area and launched a massive search operation. Holed-up terrorists opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter. As the firefight erupted, the ultras ran into the forest,” an official said.IGP (Jammu Zone) Bhim Sen Tuti, in an X post, stated that the troops were relentlessly engaging the terrorists despite “darkness, thick vegetation and treacherous terrain”. Officials said the area had been cordoned off. The operation remained in progress till late Wednesday.Earlier this month, a village defence guard (VDG) fired warning shots in the air on Jan 2, upon observing suspicious movement near his house in Dessa village, Doda district, following which security forces launched an anti-terror operation in the area. On Dec 31, 2025, a similar operation was carried out in Dali village in Rajouri district’s Kalakote area based on a VDG’s report about suspicious movement.A string of counter-terror operations has been underway in the upper reaches of Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts in Chenab region, and the border areas along Udhampur and Kathua districts, to track and kill ultras on the move. Such operations were also continuing in the two frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch, and Reasi district, which shares a border with Rajouri-Ramban in Jammu division and Kulgam in south Kashmir.","A gun battle broke out between security forces and terrorists in the forests in the upper reaches of Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, on Wednesday.

India Knows Pakistan Will Not Abandon Terrorism, Jaishankar Says Delhi Has Policy To Deal With It

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday took a dig at the western hypocrisy during India's military response under Operation Sindoor , declaring India does not need the West's free advice. ""Why don't you look at your own region for levels of violence?"" he remarked.Speaking to members of the Indian community in Luxembourg, Jaishankar recalled that several nations offered unsolicited advice to the country during Operation Sindoor, India's military response launched in May 2025 after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.""Sometimes you hear people say, like it happened during Operation Sindoor. Now if you ask them, say, ""oh really you're worried, why don't you look at your own region? And ask yourself, what are the levels of violence there.""""How much risks have been taken, how much worry the rest of us have about what you are doing. But that's the nature of the world. People, what they say is not what they do,"" he added.Jaishankar further underlined that India will engage differently with different actors. ""So those who are willing to work with us and be helpful, positive, we have to deal with them in that way,"" he said, adding ""those who do the kind of things which Pakistan does, we have to deal with it in a different way.""Jaishankar also took a jibe on how the western countries often advise others on handling their internal or regional conflicts, suggesting such commentary is frequently detached from ground realities and offered without much thought.""Now, to what extent do the developments in the rest of the world affect it? It's hard to say. People sitting far away will say things, sometimes with application of mind, sometimes not, sometimes with self-interest, sometimes carelessly. That will happen.""""I can tell you, whatever you might say, in this day and age, countries are more, I don't want to say they become more selfish, but they will do things only if it is of direct benefit to them. They'll offer you free advice. If something happens, say, no, please don't do that. It worries us if there is tension,"" he added.US President Donald Trump had repeatedly claimed that Washington mediated the May 2025 India-Pakistan ceasefire, an assertion India has rejected.New Delhi has maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations to his Indian counterpart, not third-party intervention.Further on the Venezuela crisis , Jaishankar said India's primary concern is the safety of the people following US military operations there.""We are concerned about the developments, but we would really urge all the parties involved to now sit down and come to a position which is in the interest of the well-being and safety of the people of Venezuela, because at the end of the day, that is our concern,"" Jaishankar said.""We would want Venezuela as a country with whom, over many, many years, we’ve had very good relations. So we would like the people to come out well, whatever the direction of events,"" he added.His remarks came after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country during a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar took a dig at the western hypocrisy during India's military response under Operation Sindoor.

'No Strategic Sense': Ex-NSA John Bolton Slams Trump Over India Tariffs

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of ""surrendering"" under ""pressure"" and contrasted his leadership with that of former prime minister Indira Gandhi Gandhi’s remarks came a day after US President Donald Trump , speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, claimed that PM Modi had sought an audience with him. “Prime Minister Modi came to see me, ‘Sir, may I see you please’. Yes,” Trump said.Trump also referred to India facing steep tariffs, saying New Delhi was ""paying a lot of tariffs now"" and had ""reduced"" the purchase of Russian oil ""substantially"".Gandhi shared a video message on X with the caption ""Fark samjho sirji"".“I know these BJP–RSS people very well now. Put a little pressure on them, give them a little push and they run away in fear,” Gandhi said. “As soon as Trump signalled from there, they picked up the phone and said, ‘What are you doing Modi ji?’ Narendra surrendered and with ‘yes sir’, Narendra Modi ji followed Trump’s signal.”Drawing a comparison with the 1971 war, Gandhi said India had once stood firm despite US pressure.“You might remember a time when the phone call didn’t come — the Seventh Fleet had come. In the 1971 war, the Seventh Fleet came, weapons came, an aircraft carrier came. Indira Gandhi ji said, ‘I will do what I have to do.’ This is the difference,” he said, referring to the United States Seventh Fleet.Trump has imposed tariffs totalling 50% on Indian exports, including a 25% levy linked to India’s procurement of Russian oil.“I have a very good relationship with him. He’s not that happy with me because they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil — but they are, they’ve now reduced it very substantially,” Trump said.The tariffs, imposed in August, have triggered multiple rounds of trade talks and at least four conversations between the two leaders, but have yet to yield a bilateral trade deal.Separately, Trump also said in his remarks that India had flagged delays in the delivery of Apache helicopters, claiming New Delhi has been waiting for the aircraft for five years.","Gandhi shared a video message on X with the caption ""Fark samjho sirji"" Gandhi’s remarks came a day after US President Donald Trump claimed that PM Modi had sought an audience with him.

"Medical college row: Omar says Jammu’s loss, blames protesters for ‘destroying’ students’ future; BJP & Hindu groups celebrate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-college-row-omar-says-jammus-loss-blames-protesters-for-destroying-students-future-bjp-hindu-groups-celebrate/articleshow/126401866.cms,"SRINAGAR: BJP and Hindu groups on Wednesday celebrated the National Medical Commission’s decision to withdraw permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi, Jammu, to run an MBBS course from 2025-26 academic session, while J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.As activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti — a conglomerate of Hindu social and religious organisations that led an agitation against the admission of non-Hindu students to the shrine board-run medical college — held victory marches in Jammu, burst crackers and danced, Omar on Wednesday evening said it was unfortunate that people were celebrating the “closure of a medical college”. “In other parts of the country people fight to get such institutions,” he said. “If you are happy to destroy the future of our children, then go ahead and burst crackers.”The Sangharsh Samiti had been protesting since Nov against the admission of 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, in the first batch of 50, with only seven Hindus and one Sikh among the selected candidates. Its contention was that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students and those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi.CM Omar said within two years, the institute’s intake capacity would have risen to 400, of which about 250 would have come from Jammu. “Now, no one will get those seats because the college has been closed in the name of religion,” he said. Students who fail to secure admission in medical colleges in future should remember the role played by the Sangharsh Samiti in closing this institute, he added.On Tuesday, barely an hour before the NMC order, the CM had said the medical college was not worth running given the religious politics played around it, and had suggested shutting it down. “In the given scenario, I don’t feel the students themselves would like to study there. We request GoI and the health ministry to adjust these children in other colleges. Had I been a parent of these students, I wouldn’t send them there,” Omar had said.Although NMC stated that the Letter of Permission was being withdrawn as an inspection found non-compliance with minimum standards, the Sangharsh Samiti claimed it was a result of its prolonged agitation. “This is our first major victory,” its representatives said at a news briefing, adding, “Our current protest has ended but there are more issues, like the Shrine Board Act which needs amendment.”BJP’s J&K president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma, too, welcomed the NMC decision, and thanked LG Manoj Sinha and Union health minister J P Nadda, for withdrawal of permission while safeguarding the interests of selected students.Kashmir-based parties, however, slammed the decision, terming it Jammu’s loss, and blamed BJP. NC minister Javed Rana said admissions in educational institutions shouldn’t be sought on the basis of religion. He accused BJP of “communalising” the issue of admissions in SMVDIME.PDP called it “a ruthless setback” for Jammu region, and blamed BJP. “People of Jammu must wake up to the reality that religious polarisation only sabotages their future. This entire episode was cynically engineered by BJP for narrow political gains in the name of religion, and it is Jammu that has been made to pay the price,” PDP youth wing president Aditya Gupta said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.

It was then bifurcated into Ladakh and J&K. Those who split J&K state now want to divide it further and desire to make even Kanak Mandi a state,” minister for jal shakti, environment and tribal affairs Javed Rana said, taking a veiled dig at BJP. Kanak Mandi is a historic wholesale market in Jammu city.BJP legislators were free to raise the issue of separate statehood for Jammu, but there was no such demand from large parts of the region, including Pir Panjal areas of Rajouri and Poonch and the Chenab Valley, said Rana talking to reporters. “Instead, I believe that the day is not far when Ladakh will again become part of J&K,” he added.BJP MLAs, especially former minister Sham Lal Sharma, have renewed calls for a separate Jammu state. Sharma said the demand was not new and that he had raised it way back in 2010, when he was a minister in then Congress govt. Sharma claimed the people of Jammu are more “nationalistic”, while Kashmir, he alleged, has been politically unstable due to the rhetoric of political parties like National Conference that says J&K only acceded to India and did not fully merge with it.Sharma alleged that Jammu was facing discrimination at the hands of “Kashmir-based rulers”. He also called for a Hindu chief minister.On Jan 5, BJP spokesperson Rajni Sethi said Jammu was suffering because of what she described as “fundamentalists in Kashmir”. “When people from Jammu travel outside J&K, they are treated with suspicion and their identity is questioned. People assume Jammu is also influenced by extremism,” she said.Rejecting the charges, NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said: “BJP has no politics except tarnishing Kashmiris and their image.” The govt would not allow BJP members to create a rift between Jammu and Kashmir,, he said, adding: “We believe in equitable development of both regions. The restoration of Darbar Move is an indication of Omar govt’s commitment towards development of Jammu.”","Omar Abdullah govt rejects demand of statehood for Jammu region, calling it ‘unviable’ Minister for jal shakti, environment and tribal affairs Javed Rana said it was time for Ladakh to be reunited with Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126402055,imgsize-949450,width-400,resizemode-4/minister-of-jal-shakti-environment-and-tribal-affairs-javed-rana.jpg"

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory.

"I-T department flags crypto risks, opposes entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-t-department-flags-crypto-risks-opposes-entry/articleshow/126402100.cms,"NEW DELHI: The income tax department on Wednesday flagged major risks associated with virtual digital assets (VDA), such as cryptocurrency , joining the Reserve Bank of India in opposing the entry of these instruments.In a presentation to the parliamentary standing committee of finance, the tax authorities flagged as to how anonymous, borderless and near-instant value transfer made it possible to move funds through a system without regulated financial intermediaries, a person familiar with the discussions told TOI.Besides, offshore exchanges, private wallets and decentralised platforms made it very difficult for the authorities to detect taxable income and also made the holdings opaque since the beneficial owners were not easily known.Jurisdictional limitations with offshore VDA activity were also flagged as multiple jurisdictions may be involved, with little ability to check flows, making verification and recovery of tax dues virtually impossible. Although there have been efforts in recent months on sharing of information, it remains difficult, inhibiting the ability of tax officials to undertake proper assessment and reconstruction of transaction chains.India is among a group of countries which have so far been reluctant to allow cryptocurrency and stablecoin despite intense lobbying and pressure from some govts. Earlier, on multiple occasions, RBI had flagged its concerns, including the lack of any underlying asset making it a risky bet for investors, and even enforcement agencies are wary especially due to VDAs being instruments that can be used for money laundering and terror financing.The tax department said that since crypto platforms operate overseas, enforcement action may be tough, including issuing summons, or TDS collection. Many of the exchanges are also unregistered with the Financial Intelligence Unit and are outside the ambit of the tax department.Indian tax authorities have sought to build in safeguards, including TDS, to track beneficiaries and have also mandated registration of entities dealing in crypto and other VDAs.","In a presentation to the parliamentary standing committee of finance, the tax authorities flagged as to how anonymous, borderless and near-instant value transfer made it possible to move funds through a system without regulated financial intermediaries.

India Reveals First Vande Bharat Sleeper Offering Faster Overnight Travel On Kolkata-Guwahati Line

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to flag off 13 trains next week, including the country’s first Vande Bharat sleeper train. Ten of these will be flagged off from poll-bound West Bengal and the remaining three from Assam, which is also going to the polls.TOI has learnt that on Jan 17, Modi will flag off Vande Bharat sleeper train from Howrah to Guwahati and six Amrit Bharat trains from Malda, where he will address a public event as well. The next day, he is scheduled to flag off two Amrit Bharat trains from Assam and three more from West Bengal.Officials said this is the first time in recent years that so many trains will be flagged off from West Bengal in such a short span of time. “The Amrit Bharat trains from West Bengal will be for all parts of the country — north, south and west. Amrit Bharat trains are the most affordable for the poor and the middle class, offering best comforts to passengers,” said an official.As per the plan, one Amrit Bharat train will operate between Guwahati and Rohtak (Haryana) and another between Dibrugarh and Lucknow. The Amrit Bharat trains from West Bengal are New Jalpaiguri-Nagercoil, New Jalpaiguri-Tiruchirappalli , Alipurduar-Bengaluru, Alipurduar-Panvel, Balurghat-Bengaluru, Radhikapur-Bengaluru, Santragachi (Kolkata)-Tambaram, Howrah-Anand Vihar (Delhi) and Sealdah-Banaras.“The focus is on running more Amrit Bharat trains as these cater to a large share of long-distance passengers. The zonal railways will soon notify the fares for each service,” said a railway official.So many modern trains being flagged off from West Bengal is being seen as a message that Centre is keen to improve transport infrastructure in the state.","PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to flag off 13 trains next week, including the country’s first Vande Bharat sleeper train.

The project will connect the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway with the Bundelkhand Expressway and will pass through parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed this to TOI on Tuesday. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by Gadkari on Monday evening and was attended by MP CM Mohan Yadav and two Union ministers — Bhupender Yadav and Jyotiraditya Scindia.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build the 6-lane access-controlled corridor. Officials said the alignment of the project was reworked after the earlier plan faced some issues. “The new alignment falls outside forest and wildlife areas, and also outside the Chambal ravines (beehad). After major modification in the alignment, the environment clearances have been obtained. The project will benefit aspirational (backward) regions in all the three states,” said an official.The access-controlled corridor will connect Kota in Rajasthan with Etawah in UP and cities in MP, including Morena and Bhind. This will reduce both travel time from 10-11 hours at present, to only 5-6 hoursOfficials said the corridor will also provide connectivity to Agra-Jhansi, Kota-Jhansi-Kanpur and Agra-Kanpur highways. They added that the corridor is envisioned as a critical infrastructure aimed at improving connectivity and facilitating faster movement of goods and passengers across the region.","The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore.

As the dust settles on 2025, Parliament carries forward unfinished business, unresolved disputes,t and reforms still searching for their final shape.The Winter Session restructured key pillars of governance, but several high-stakes bills were deferred, diluted or sent for further scrutiny.The Budget Session of 2026 is expected to move beyond diagnosing problems to implementing solutions — laying out the governing blueprint for the government’s vision of “Viksit Bharat”.With a focus on higher education reforms, electoral synchronisation, capital market restructuring and insolvency resolution, the Budget Session of 2026 sets the stage for high-stakes legislative action.While the government pushed through several landmark reforms during the Winter Session, many bills were formally introduced but ran into procedural hurdles.Several were referred to Joint Parliamentary Committees or held back for further refinement, effectively shifting the legislative battleground to the Budget Session of 2026.Hailed by the government as a “constitutional moment” for India’s financial markets, the bill seeks to streamline three major laws governing investors and market regulation.For over three decades, investors and companies have navigated three separate laws — the SEBI Act (1992), the Depositories Act (1996) and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (1956).Given its scale and potential impact on trillions of rupees in market wealth, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Finance in late 2025 for detailed scrutiny, before it returns to Parliament in 2026.Critics argue that merging these laws risks turning SEBI into “judge, jury and executioner”, with sweeping enforcement powers.The government, however, has argued that unified regulation is essential to reduce overlap, regulatory arbitrage and compliance confusion in a rapidly expanding market.The bill seeks to fine-tune India’s corporate bankruptcy exit framework.The bill aims to make the resolution faster so that companies do not lose the value of their assets during long legal proceedings. It also introduces a ""Cross-Border Insolvency"" framework to help banks recover money from defaulting companies that have hidden or kept assets in foreign countries.Critics argue that banks take big losses in recovering a very small percentage of the original loans, and that the bill does not hold the big promoters accountable enough.They also highlight the pending judicial cases in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) due to vacant judges' seats for the proceedings.Opposition has also flagged delays caused by vacancies in the National Company Law Tribunal, arguing that legislative fixes alone cannot address systemic capacity gaps.The One Nation One Election (ONOE) reform proposes to hold simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, consolidating the voting process to occur at the same time instead of staggered intervals.The government initiated this plan in late 2024 with the introduction of the Constitution 129th Amendment Bill. While the bill gained majority votes in the Lok Sabha, it was not passed. This is because amending the Constitution requires a special majority where at least two-third of the members present in the House must vote in favour of the bill.The Lok Sabha approved a motion to refer both the two bills that shall pave the way for ""one nation one election"" to a 39-member Joint Parliamentary Committee. This committee has been granted an extension to submit its report until the first day of the last week of the Budget Session 2026.The primary objective of the bill is to conduct simultaneous elections—initially for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, and later potentially for local bodies—to reduce election expenses and prevent the repeated imposition of the Model Code of Conduct.The opposition rejected the bill as a ""heinous conspiracy"" against federalism, arguing it assaults the Constitution's basic structure and undermines regional autonomy.The bill is the main part of the government’s plan to modernise higher education by bringing several regulators under one system.It was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 15, 2025, and was later sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee, the report of which is expected to be presented by the last day of the first part of the Budget Session 2026.The bill proposes setting up the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan, or VBSA, as a single umbrella regulator, meaning one main authority that will replace UGC, AICTE, and NCTE. The government has described this system as one with fewer controls but strict enforcement, in line with the National Education Policy 2020.The opposition, however, argued that it gives too much power to the Union government and could weaken the independence of universities, especially because the power to give financial grants will shift from the regulators to the ministry.Although the Digital Personal Data Protection Act was passed in 2023, it came into effect only in late 2025, when the government notified the detailed rules needed to put it into practice.The rules were officially notified on November 14, 2025, after wide public consultation.With implementation now underway, parliamentary oversight is expected on regulatory amendments, institutional capacity and funding for the Data Protection Board.Also, while the law itself was already in force, civil society groups and opposition voices focused their criticism on the rules, especially the 18-month compliance period, which they felt was too long and delayed real protection.One of the most socially and politically sensitive legislations in recent sessions, the bill was first introduced in August 2024 and was swiftly referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee following widespread protests.The committee, chaired by Jagdambika Pal, submitted its final report in late January 2025 after several contentious meetings. The report recommended mandatory registration of all Waqf properties on a centralised online portal and proposed 44 amendments to the original Waqf Act of 1995.The legislation introduces multiple legal changes, including renaming the Waqf Act as the UMEED Act — the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 2025.While the bill is not formally listed on the agenda for the Budget Session of 2026, its implementation, set to begin this year, is expected to trigger renewed uproar.At its core, the legislation seeks to overhaul the governance and management of Waqf properties across the country.If Parliament were a 75-year-old house, the 2025 session resembled a noisy renovation. The government did not limit itself to cosmetic changes: labour laws were reworked, nuclear policy rewired, welfare delivery redesigned and decades-old statutes discarded. The result was a modernised legal framework — albeit amid sustained protest.With debates over worker rights, accountability and foreign participation dominating proceedings, the session concluded with several laws passed, but left many political and social questions unresolved as Parliament heads into 2026.Replacing MGNREGA, the VB–G RAM G Bill — Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) — was tabled on December 15, 2025, and passed three days later through a voice vote amid opposition demands for a recorded division.The law increases guaranteed workdays from 100 to 125 annually but introduces fixed, state-wise allocations, replacing MGNREGA’s demand-driven funding model. Critics argue this risks weakening the programme’s role as a distress buffer.The removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name became a major flashpoint, alongside concerns over the use of AI and biometric attendance systems that could exclude workers in low-connectivity areas.Passed by voice vote in both Houses, the SHANTI Bill replaces the Atomic Energy Act (1962) and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (2010), allowing private and foreign participation in nuclear power generation.The law grants statutory status to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and clears the path for small modular reactors. Opposition parties staged a walkout, objecting to diluted supplier liability provisions and warning that public risk would shift to the state in the event of an accident.Passed on December 16, 2025, the bill raises FDI limits in insurance from 74% to 100%, aiming to achieve universal insurance coverage by 2047.While the government argues this will deepen penetration and reduce costs, critics warn of foreign dominance, reduced focus on rural markets and potential pressure on domestic players like LIC.Unanimously passed, the bill introduces a capacity-based cess on pan masala manufacturing machinery to fund public health and national security needs.By taxing production capacity rather than declared sales, the law aims to curb under-reporting. Manufacturers, however, argue the model is inflexible, especially during machinery downtime, while opposition parties flagged concerns over Centre–state fiscal balance.Marketed as a clean-up exercise, the bill repeals 71 obsolete laws, some dating back to the 19th century, including the Indian Tramways Act (1886).While the government said this would simplify compliance, the opposition criticised the bulk repeal approach, arguing that several laws enacted as recently as the last decade were removed without adequate scrutiny.Though passed earlier, the four labour codes entered operational phase in November 2025, consolidating 29 laws into four frameworks covering wages, social security, industrial relations and workplace safety.The new 50% basic wage rule strengthens retirement benefits but reduces immediate take-home pay. Trade unions argue the codes tilt the balance in favour of employers, while the government maintains they modernise labour regulation for a changing economy.Several issues dominated debate without resolution.The opposition accused the Special Intensive Revision exercise in nine states and three UTs of selectively deleting voters. A 10-hour debate ended in deadlock, with no changes to election procedures.Despite repeated demands, Parliament saw no dedicated discussion on Manipur, where President’s Rule remains in place. Political blame-trading replaced consensus on a peace roadmap.Acknowledged as a national health emergency, air quality was debated but left without legislative follow-through or a national clean air framework.As Parliament heads into the Budget Session of 2026, the legislative record of the past year offers both momentum and caution. Several reforms have been passed, others deferred, and many now enter the more difficult phase of implementation. Whether the coming session delivers clarity, consensus and course correction — or repeats the disruptions of 2025 — remains to be seen.","The Budget Session of 2026 is expected to move beyond diagnosing problems to implementing solutions.

New Delhi: The Union home ministry Wednesday formally notified the timeline for the first phase of Census 2027 — involving housing and houselisting operations — declaring that it shall be conducted over a 30-day period, to be specified by each state or Union territory, between April 1 and Sept 30 this year.Invoking its powers under Sections 3 and 17A of the Census Act, 1948, read with 6A and 6D of Census Rules, 1990, and in supersession of the notification dated Jan 7, 2020, “except as respects things done or omitted to be done before such supersession”, the Centre declared in the notification that the houselisting operations of Census 2027 shall have an option for self-enumeration, “which shall be conducted in 15 days’ time just before the start of house-to-house houselisting operations of 30 days”.The release of schedule for first phase of the exercise formally kickstarts what was a decennial exercise, before the Covid outbreak delayed Census 2021. It shall be conducted in two phases - houselisting and housing census followed by population enumeration - between April 1, 2026 and Feb 28, 2027, with 00:00 hours of March 1, 2027, as the reference date (except for UT of Ladakh and snow-bound areas and non-synchronous areas of J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand).On Dec 12 last year, the Union cabinet chaired by PM Modi had approved the proposal for conducting Census of India 2027 at a cost of Rs 11,718.2 crore. The population enumeration phase of the latest census will also capture caste identity.About 30 lakh field functionaries will be involved in the Census, the largest administrative and statistical exercise in the world. Being the first digital census, it will involve the use of mobile app for data collection and a central portal for monitoring purposes, ensuring better quality data.The govt had last month stated that Census data dissemination will be much better and done in a user-friendly way so that all queries on required parameters for policymaking are available at the click of a button.Census-as-a-service (CaaS) will deliver data to ministries in a clean, machine-readable and actionable format.The Census process involves visiting each and every household and canvassing separate questionnaires for houselisting & housing census and population enumeration.The enumerators, generally government teachers and appointed by state govts, will do the Census fieldwork in addition to their regular duties.A dedicated portal, namely Census Management & Monitoring System (CMMS) portal, has been developed for managing and monitoring the entire process on a real-time basis. Public can self-enumerate through the Census app or portal in the 15-day period before start of the 30-day houselisting phase in their state/UT. Suitable security features have been provisioned for the digital census.","Census 2027 will be conducted over a 30-day period, to be specified by each state or Union territory.

He was chargesheeted for attempt to murder and other offences under IPC. The wife had also filed for divorce and sought maintenance.Facing incarceration for the grave offence, the man approached his wife, showed repentance and persuaded her to settle for a compromise, following which she withdrew the divorce petition. Soon, the man moved the Himachal high court for the quashing of charges on the ground that the couple were now living together peacefully. The HC refused to quash the charges, terming them grave in nature.Advocate Sukumar Pattajoshi, appearing for the man, pleaded Wednesday with an SC bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and S C Sharma, citing the the welfare of the young couple, who got married in 2020, and said the compromise was reached through the elder’s intervention.The state counsel opposed the plea, but the bench said, “No doubt it is a grave offence, but the couple’s wishes to stay together and give their married life a fresh chance should be respected. Sending the man to jail would not be in the interest of the family.”It issued a stern warning and asked him to give a written undertaking that he would take good care of his wife and child and not do anything detrimental to their interests and safety. Pattajoshi said he had agreed to appear for the man only after he gave an undertaking to that effect.Adding a caveat that it was quashing the criminal charges given the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case,it accepted the man’s written undertaking for amiable behaviour towards his wife and child and warned him of drastic consequences if he breached the undertaking.“If you do anything to the wife and child, you will be sent to jail straight away.

Govt considers raising EPFO monthly wage cap to Rs 25k-30k; current Rs 15k ceiling fixed in Sept 2014,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-considers-raising-epfo-monthly-wage-cap-to-rs-25k-30k-current-rs-15k-ceiling-fixed-in-sept-2014/articleshow/126403263.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move that could significantly enhance the coverage of Employees Provident Fund Organisation, a proposal to increase monthly wage ceiling beyond the current Rs 15,000 is back on the table amid suggestions that it should be raised to Rs 25,000-30,000 a month.The wage ceiling refers to the salary threshold up to which it is mandatory for a worker in an establishment covered under EPFO to make monthly contributions.Govt had earlier discussed a proposal to increase the threshold to Rs 25,000 - but it was put on the backburner due to reluctance of employers, who wanted the limit to be retained, with some suggesting that a higher cap should come with lower contribution. Some of the employee unions, however, had demanded a Rs 30,000 cut-off.The current ceiling was fixed over a decade ago, in Sept 2014, making it optional for anyone earning over Rs 15,000 to be part of EPFO. Since then, salaries have gone up significantly, and minimum monthly wages in many states even for unskilled workers are now above this threshold. This leaves many low wage or minimum wage earners outside the ambit of the social security organisation. Earlier this week, Supreme Court asked the labour ministry to review the cap within four months.The move will widen EPFO's subscriber base and bring more workers, especially in the unorganised sector, under the ambit of the retirement fund body. It comes at a time when the new labour codes have been notified, being likely to be implemented in the next few months with a clear focus to ensure that an employee's wages add up to at least 50% of the total remuneration, with the remaining being allowances.Officials said by clearly defining wages, the labour codes would reduce disputes over eligibility. They also said at the current cap, the bulk of contributions amount to around Rs 15,000 and increase will push up the level, helping workers have a larger pool of money at their disposal when they retire, especially with the role of compounding playing out. Recently, EPFO had mandated a minimum 25% balance in a subscriber's corpus while easing rules for withdrawal.Data available till FY24 has pegged the number of active contributing members under EPFO at nearly 7.4 crore, while nearly 32 crore member acco-unts exist under the retirement fund body, which include a mix of active and past contributors.","The wage ceiling refers to the salary threshold up to which it is mandatory for a worker in an establishment covered under EPFO to make monthly contributions.

Manipur gang rape: CBI court frames charges against 6,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur-gang-rape-cbi-court-frames-charges-against-6/articleshow/126403020.cms,"GUWAHATI: A special CBI court in Guwahati has framed charges against six men and ordered their trial over one of the most brutal crimes of Manipur's ethnic violence, in which three women were stripped naked and paraded before a mob, two of them gang-raped in broad daylight, and two relatives of one them killed on May 4, 2023.It is the first case investigated by CBI in the Manipur violence to move to trial. The central agency has taken over 27 FIRs linked to the unrest - 19 involving crimes against women, three armoury loot cases, two murders, and one each of rioting, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy.Last Friday, special judge Chatra Bhukhan Gogoi ruled that all six accused ""be tried by this court"". Appearing through video-conferencing from Manipur, the accused pleaded not guilty after charges were read out and explained.CBI prosecutor Swayamjeet Sharma told the court the investigation had yielded sufficient material and a strong prima facie case. Defence lawyers argued the evidence did not warrant charges for all offences listed in the chargesheet.The court ordered four accused - Huirem Herodash Meitei, Ningombam Tomba Singh alias Tomthin, Yumlembam Jiban Singh alias Naocha alias Sana and Pukhrihongbam Suranjoy Meitei - lodged at Manipur central jail in Sajiwa, to be shifted to Guwahati for physical production and for signing the charges on Jan 16.Two others - Arun Khundongbam alias Nanao and Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei - who are on bail, were directed to appear in person on the same date ""without fail"".""Since the question of identification of the accused persons during the course of trial is involved, the physical production of the accused persons is necessary for convenience and fairness of trial,"" the judge said.Charges include promoting enmity between Kuki and Meitei communities, molestation, sexual assault, gang rape, physical assault, criminal conspiracy, violations under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and damage and looting of property.","A special CBI court in Guwahati has framed charges against six men and ordered their trial over one of the most brutal crimes of Manipur's ethnic violence.

The decision was taken by the Bihar unit of all india jewellers and gold federation at a meeting with the district jewellers' associations on Tuesday, citing security reasons as gold and silver prices have been on the rise, federation president Ashok Kumar Verma said.Patna jewellers have already started putting notices to this effect outside their shops. Verma said the decision is not against any community or group, but only a pre-emptive security measure.The federation's president, Pankaj Arora, said on Wednesday the decision will gradually be implemented across the country. ""Customer's face must be visible. He or she will not be allowed to enter a jewellery shop in any kind of veil, be it 'hijab', full helmet or 'pagdi/safa' (turban). There is no restriction on 'burqa' as such but no veil,"" he said.Arora said a similar decision was taken by Jhansi jewellers a few days ago following the incidents of theft in shops. ""But Bihar is the first to implement it across the state. Even police question us about the identity in case of loot or theft as the person with face covered is not identified in the CCTV cameras.""Asked if it would affect business or what if a customer refuses to abide, Verma, who was in Delhi to attend the CAIT (Confederation of All India Traders) meeting, said any genuine person will cooperate.""Only anti-social elements will resist. But we will politely refuse to serve them. In case of any trouble, we will inform the police. After all, a 10gm gold chain costs around Rs 1.41 lakh and silver is over Rs 2.5 lakh/kg. We can't take any risk as jewellers are the soft target of criminals,"" he said.Minister and LJP(RV) neta Sanjay Singh said the move will act as a deterrent.""

Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list.

MUMBAI: A day after Congress and BJP councillors in Ambernath unveiled an alliance for the local municipal council, Congress state brass condemned the decision and suspended its partymen while CM Devendra Fadnavis said he would recommend action against the local office-bearer.BJP had forged a post-poll understanding with Congress and Ajit Pawar's NCP, securing a majority of 31 seats, even though Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena was the single largest party with 27 members. The formation was named Ambernath Vikas Aghadi.Congress has suspended its local block chief, Pradeep Patil, along with all 12 elected councillors and issued show-cause notices. In a letter to Patil, the party informed him its block unit had been dissolved.State party president Harshwardhan Sapkal said, ""We are against any alliance with BJP. We will decide on further action."" AICC secretary Sachin Sawant blamed BJP for wooing its councillors into an opportunistic alliance. ""BJP is hungry for power. It has also now tied up with its B-team, AIMIM, in another place (Akot) to get the council post."" BJP has won the most number of president posts in municipal councils in the state.However, since resolutions or proposals would need the majority's approval in the General Body, councillors have been forging alliances across the political divide in order to control the civic body's functioning. In Akot, BJP members formed Akot Vikas Manch with AIMIM, besides support from Shiv Sena UBT, Shiv Sena, NCP, Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) and Bachchu Kadu's Prahar Janshakti Party. The alliance's strength stood at 25.""I am making it very clear that any alliance with Congress or AIMIM will not be accepted. If any local leader has taken such a decision on their own, it is wrong in terms of discipline and action will be taken,"" Fadnavis said, adding that instructions had been issued to scrap such alliances.Patil said he had informed party seniors about the tie-up forged after the elections. He claimed the leadership had suspended the councillors without hearing their side. Patil said he plans to meet the BJP state chief and the CM and will make efforts to join BJP.Patil said, ""We increased the Congress tally from 8 to 12 corporators in a traditional Shiv Sena-BJP stronghold, but no MLA, MP, or state-level leader has even made a courtesy call since our victory."" He also alleged that Sapkal demanded Rs 1 crore from him in exchange for the post of block president, but he had refused to comply, after which Congress leader Mukul Wasnik facilitated his appointment. Patil alleged that his refusal to pay was the real reason behind the suspension.Another senior Congress leader said the suspended councillors would be considered as expelled as they are in the process of joining BJP for ""money and power.""",Congress state brass condemned the decision and suspended its partymen.

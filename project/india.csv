'Political black comedy at its darkest': MK Stalin slams Yogi Adityanath over 'hate' remark amid language row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-black-comedy-at-its-darkest-mk-stalin-slams-yogi-adityanath-over-hate-remark-amid-language-row/articleshow/119569568.cms,"MK Stalin (left), and Yogi Adityanath

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Thursday hit out at Yogi Adityanath , after the UP CM criticised Stalin over the three-language row and delimitation, saying that Tamil Nadu CM was trying to create divisions based on region and language.""Tamil Nadu’s fair and firm voice on two-language policy and fair delimitation is echoing nationwide—and the BJP is clearly rattled. Just watch their leaders’ interviews,"" Stalin said in a post on X.He added, ""And now Hon’ble Yogi Adityanath wants to lecture us on hate? Spare us. This isn’t irony—it’s political black comedy at its darkest.""In an interview with the news agency ANI, UP CM Yogi said that Stalin was trying to create divisions based on region and language because he felt his vote bank was at risk.Adityanath questioned why Hindi should be ""hated"".On being asked about the opposition to the Hindi language in Tamil Nadu, Yogi said, ""The country should not be divided on the basis of language or region. We are grateful to Prime Minister Modi ji for organizing the third generation of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam in Varanasi. Tamil is one of the oldest languages in India, and its history is as ancient as Sanskrit. Every Indian has respect and reverence for Tamil because many elements of Indian heritage are still alive in the language. So, why should we hate Hindi?""Adityanath had also dismissed Stalin's concerns about delimitation, calling it a ""political agenda.""""Look, the home minister has said this very clearly on this matter. This is Stalin's political agenda under the guise of the meeting. I believe that after the home minister's statement, no questions should arise on this issue,"" he said.On February 22, the first Joint Action Committee (JAC), led by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, urged the central government to ""not penalise"" the states that have effectively implemented the population control program.Replying to Adityanath's statement, Stalin wrote, ""We don’t oppose any language; we oppose imposition and chauvinism. This isn’t riot-for-votes politics. This is a battle for dignity and justice.""Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has accused the Union government of trying to impose Hindi and has refused to implement the three-language formula under NEP. Tamil Nadu's refusal to adopt the three-language policy under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has revived the long-standing debate on language.The debate over NEP is focused on its three-language formula, which Tamil Nadu fears may lead to the introduction of Hindi in the state. Stalin has raised concerns that the policy gives more importance to Hindi over regional languages, which he believes affects the state's linguistic identity and autonomy. The central government, however, says that NEP encourages multilingualism and allows flexibility in language education.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied that Hindi is being imposed, saying that states have the freedom to choose their languages under the policy.The dispute grew after the central government withheld Rs 2,152 crore meant for Tamil Nadu’s Samagra Shiksha scheme, citing the state’s refusal to implement NEP. Tamil Nadu has historically opposed the three-language formula, considering it a step toward promoting Hindi, while the central government argues that the policy is intended to help students access job opportunities in different regions.",Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin hit out at Yogi Adityanath after the UP CM criticised Stalin over the three-language row and delimitation.

Mahadev app scam: CBI raids carried out 'to generate content for PM Modi's speech' says Bhupesh Baghel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahadev-app-scam-cbi-raids-carried-out-to-generate-content-for-pm-modis-speech-says-bhupesh-baghel/articleshow/119567613.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: Former Chhattisgarh chief minister and senior Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel said late on Wednesday that the CBI raids at his premises were politically motivated . He alleged that the action was meant to create material for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech during his visit to the state on March 30.Baghel claimed he had not received any prior notice about the searches at his official residence in Raipur and said that he was not responsible for ""whatever the CBI had planted there.""The CBI conducted searches at Baghel’s residences in Raipur and Bhilai on Wednesday in connection with the alleged Rs 6,000 crore Mahadev app scam . Officials said the houses of senior police officers and individuals associated with the former chief minister were also searched.Baghel said that the CBI took documents related to his assets and seized his mobile phones from his residence in Bhilai. Among those whose premises were searched were Congress MLA Devendra Yadav in Bhilai, former political advisor Vinod Verma, and IPS officers Anand Chhabra, Abhishek Pallava, Arif Shaikh, and Prashant Agrawal. State police service officer Sanjay Dhruv was also among those whose homes were raided, according to sources.After the search at his Bhilai residence, Baghel said, ""The raids were politically motivated. The action was carried out just to generate content for the PM's speech during his upcoming visit to the state on March 30. There was no other reason.""He also claimed that the CBI had a search warrant for his Bhilai residence but did not inform him about the raid at his official residence in Raipur.""I didn't receive any notice about raids in Raipur's official residence. I learnt about the raids after I came out of the house. Whatever they had planted there, I will not be responsible for it because neither I, nor my family members were there. This is their (CBI's) conspiracy,"" he said while talking to reporters.Baghel said the previous Congress government had acted against the Mahadev betting app.""During (previous) Congress government in the state, around 74 FIRs were lodged in connection with Mahadev betting app and more than 200 people were arrested and over 2000 bank accounts related to it were freezed.""We took action against the app, but they (government agencies) claim we protected the app and took money. How will the one who takes action accept the protection money? Protection money is taken where there is a double engine (government) and betting is still functional,"" he claimed.He further said that the Congress government had requested the Centre to issue a lookout notice against the app’s promoters, Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal, and to arrest them abroad.""But (religious guru) Pradeep Mishra, who praises the BJP, visited Dubai by becoming a guest of Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal.""If CBI officials have courage, they should ask Pardeep Mishra whose programme is currently underway in the home district of Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai in Jashpur about his relations with Saurabh Chandrakar and Pradeep Mishra,"" Baghel said.He also claimed that while the promoters of the app had been seen in photos with BJP leaders, no action was being taken against them, whereas Congress leaders were being investigated.Baghel mentioned that he was supposed to attend a drafting committee meeting in Delhi for the AICC session in Ahmedabad but was unable to go due to the raids.""The CBI entered my house at around 7.30 am and left at 9.15 pm despite the search ending at around 4.15 pm. Fifteen days ago, the ED had raided my house. What they (CBI) will get by raiding?"" he asked.He said the ED had taken photocopies of his property-related documents, while the CBI took away the original papers.""I told the CBI to leave photocopies because IT and EOW will follow them. Otherwise what they will recover in the name of action?"" he said.Baghel also said that although the ED’s raid was linked to an alleged liquor scam and the CBI’s action was related to the Mahadev app, both agencies were investigating his assets.""The previous Raman Singh-head BJP government had got my assets probed. The state's EOW did the same. I invite all agencies to come together and do an investigation at once. The actions are aimed at defaming and harassing me,"" he said.He alleged that the BJP was frustrated after he was made Congress in-charge of Punjab and was recently cleared by the court in a seven-year-old (sleaze) CD case.Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Arun Sao said the Congress should not connect the CBI searches to politics and should cooperate with the investigation.Last year, the state government handed over 70 cases related to the Mahadev scam to the CBI, including one registered with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW).The Enforcement Directorate, which is also probing the case, has alleged that its probe revealed the involvement of several top politicians and bureaucrats from Chhattisgarh.The app was an umbrella syndicate arranging online platforms for illegal betting websites to enrol new users, create user IDs and launder money through a layered web of 'benami' bank accounts, it claimed.",Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel says CBI raids at his premises were politically motivated. He alleged that the action was meant to create material for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech during his visit to the state on March 30.

The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, is still to be delivered. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.These 220 jets, along with another 108 Tejas Mark-2 variants with more powerful GE F-414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, are critical for IAF. The force is down to just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorised 42.5 to tackle the twin challenge from China and Pakistan.HAL and GE, of course, are now conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.","HAL will, of course, also have to resolve other developmental issues like the pending test-firing of the Astra air-to-air missile from the single-engine Tejas Mark-1A.

According to the legend, sage Medhavi was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, who performed strict penance in the forest of Chaitraratha. Once the apsara ""Manjughosa"" tried to seduce sage Medhavi but was unsuccessful in her attempt due to the power of the sage's celibacy. Manjughosa became restless and started singing seductively, Lord Kamadev became excited and threw his powerful magical bows towards Medhavi.Sage Medhavi lost his purity of mind and later got married to Manjughosha. After a couple of years Manjughosa lost her interest in the sage and decided to abandon him. For which the sage felt cheated and cursed her to become an ugly witch. Sage Medhavi later returned to his father Sage Chyavana’s ashram and observed a fast on Papamochani Ekadashi, upon his father's recommendation. Sage Chyavana assured sage Medhavi that his sins will be removed by observing fast on this particular day. Medhavi observed the fast and got relieved from the sins. Manjughosha also observed the Papmochani Ekadashi fast and regretted her wrong deeds. She was also relieved from her sin.1. Before starting the puja rites, get up early and take a bath.2.

Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru. Therefore, alongside 'Make in India,' India must also move forward with 'Make AI in India ,'"" the AAP MP said.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris, where he said AI could help improve sectors like health, agriculture, and education.",Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha raised concerns about India's position in artificial intelligence.

The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, is still to be delivered.

On Bulldozer action



'Jitne bhi honge sab dhundenge'



'Unfortunate... law should take action': Adityanath on Kunal Kamra row



Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath , in an exclusive interview with news agency ANI, addressed critical issues spanning politics, governance, and religious matters while taking strong positions on several topics.The interview covered significant ground, from allegations of foreign interference in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections to the state's contentious bulldozer policy.The chief minister also expressed his stance on the ongoing row over remarks made by comedian Kunal Kamra during his show in Mumbai.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister affirmed that people from all religions are safe in the state, emphasising that communal harmony is maintained when Hindus feel secure. He said, ""If Hindus are safe, then Muslims are also safe. In Uttar Pradesh, Muslims are the safest. Before 2017, riots would see both Hindu and Muslim properties burning. After 2017, riots stopped.""""A Muslim family is the safest among a hundred Hindu families. But can 50 Hindus be safe among 100 Muslim families? No. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are examples,"" Yogi said.Speaking about Sanatan Dharma , he called it the world's oldest religion and said, ""Sanatan Dharma followers have never sought to convert others or establish dominion over them. We see the world as a family.""""A Muslim family is the safest among a hundred Hindu families. They will have the freedom to practice all their religious deeds. But can 50 Hindus be safe among 100 Muslim families? No. Bangladesh is an example. Before this, Pakistan was an example. What happened in Afghanistan? If there is smoke or someone is being hit, we should be careful before we get hit. That is what needs to be taken care of,"" Yogi said, while adding that he treats everyone equally.Yogi accused the opposition of using foreign funds to influence the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, with the Congress and INDIA bloc being directly involved. He accused NGOs, social media platforms, and digital media of being used to spread false propaganda against the BJP.He pointed to billionaire investor George Soros as one of the figures allegedly involved in financing these efforts and warned that further revelations would expose more details.""Congress and opposition parties did propaganda and they had not only spread propaganda, but foreign money was also involved in it. George Soros had already announced it... Many facts will come to light. Through NGOs, social media platforms, digital media, they spread propaganda on a large-scale propaganda in various parts of the country that BJP will change the constitution, if PM Modi will come, they will bring a new constitution, all kinds of things they have said,"" CM Yogi Adityanath told ANI.""I am saying that foreign money was involved in the Lok Sabha elections throughout the country in which Congress and other parties of the INDIA bloc were directly involved in it and through that, they tried to influence the elections. This action falls under the category of treason. You are taking money from a foreign power and influencing the country's elections,"" he added.Yogi Adityanath strongly defended ' Maha kumbh ' amid opposition criticism, particularly from West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee , who labelled it ""Mrityu Kumbh"" following a stampede incident that claimed lives of .....""Every day from Bengal, from January 13 to February 26, 50,000 to 100,000 devotees used to come to Prayagraj. The West Bengal Government got scared to see the crowd as their railway stations and airports were filled with people heading to Prayagraj... Whether it is the West Bengal Government, the Congress, the RJD, or the Samajwadi Party, whatever they have said about the Mahakumbh is an example of their appeasement. It is an example of insulting the faith of India. But the Mahakumbh has proved that it was a Mrityunjay Mahakumbh,"" the UP CM stated.He further mocked Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, branding it as ""Bharat Todo Abhiyan"", and accused him of tarnishing India’s image on foreign soil.""Rahul jaise kuch namune rehne chahiye jisse ek rasta hamesha ke liye saaf hota rahe aur acha rahe"", Adityanath said, suggesting that Gandhi’s political presence ultimately benefits the BJP.Responding to criticism over his government's ""bulldozer action,"" Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath defended the policy, stating that those who take the law into their own hands will face consequences within the legal framework.""Those who believe in justice, justice is done for them. Those who take justice and law into their own hands, they are taught a lesson within the framework of law. It should be explained in the language they understand,"" Adityanath said.Justifying strong action against criminals, he said that if someone resorts to violence, the government must respond accordingly. ""If someone comes as a violent person to attack us, should we stand in front of him? No, if he comes as a violent person, we will have to respond to his violence there,"" he added.Yogi Adityanath vowed to revive as many temples as present in Sambhal. He said that the authorities have till now identified more than 54 pilgrimage sites in the city, and efforts are underway to locate the remaining ones.""Jitne bhi honge, sab dhundenge. Jo Bhagwan ne aankh di hai, wo dekhe ki Sambhal mein kya hua. Sambhal satya hai,"" he declared. He also questioned the legitimacy of mosques built on ruins of vandalised Hindu temples arguing that Islam itself does not recognise places of worship constructed by destroying others.Regarding the Mathura mosque dispute, Adityanath maintained that the state government is abiding by the court’s directives but hinted at potential action, saying, ""Who knows what could have happened by now?""In relation to Kunal Kamra's recent remark on Eknath Shinde, Yogi Adityanath said that the freedom of expression does not mean that individuals can use it to attack someone else, adding that law should take action against such people ""who are creating differences in the country.""""Freedom of expression is in the realm of law. It should be in the realm of constitutional values. And in that realm, there is freedom of expression. The freedom of your personality cannot be used to attack someone else. It is unfortunate that some people have considered the freedom of this individual as their birthright to divide the country and increase the division. And I feel that the law should take action against such people who are creating a difference in the country,"" CM Yogi said.","Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath addressed critical issues spanning politics, governance, and religious matters in an exclusive interview with news agency ANI.

"‘Santosh’, UK’s Oscar entry, blocked in India?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/santosh-uks-oscar-entry-blocked-in-india/articleshow/119558852.cms,"Censors’ decision disappointing and heartbreaking: Suri

Santosh, the UK’s official entry in the Oscars’ international feature category and a Bafta nominee for best debut feature, has been blocked by Indian film censors, according to a report in UK daily Guardian.Written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri , the film was made in India and is in Hindi. According to the Guardian report, Central Board of Film Certification refused to clear the film over concerns about its negative portrayal of police — “depicting deep-rooted misogyny, discrimination against Dalits and the normalisation of mistreatment and torture by police officers.”Several CBFC board members TOI spoke to said they were unaware of reasons behind uncertainty over the release in India. “The film also grapples with the issue of sexual violence in India , particularly against lower caste women, and the rising tide of anti-Muslim prejudice in the country,” adds the report.Author and CBFC board member Ramesh Patange said, “I attend movie reviews once a month, and my role is limited to that. Only the chairman is privy to the board’s day-to-day functioning.” Other board members declined to comment, saying only CBFC chairperson Prasoon Joshi would speak on the issue. Efforts to contact Joshi were unsuccessful at the time of going to press.CBFC board member and filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri told TOI from Puducherry that he was unaware of any issues with the film.“In my personal capacity, not as a representative of any organisation, I feel deeply distressed that a society which considers itself the spiritual leader of the world is so insecure that it resorts to censorship. Only an insecure society censors art in any form Art, creativity, and literature form the soup that nourishes society. Without it, a society cannot grow,” said Agnihotri.The Guardian report says Sandhya Suri descibed the censors’ decision as “disappointing and heartbreaking”.It also quotes her as saying the censors had demanded a list of radical cuts so lengthy and wide-ranging that they would be impossible to implement, adding that the list of cuts demanded went on for several pages, and included concerns about themes relating to police conduct and wider societal problems “which are deeply baked into the film”.“It was very important to me that the film is released in India so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work. But in the end it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision,” the Guardian report quoted Suri as saying.","Santosh, the UK’s official entry in the Oscars’ international feature category and a Bafta nominee for best debut feature, has been blocked by Indian film censors, according to a report in UK daily Guardian.

Waqf divide in Bihar NDA? Catch-22 situation for BJP and allies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-divide-in-bihar-nda-catch-22-situation-for-bjps-allies/articleshow/119547674.cms,"Nagpuriya

Tum To Dhokhebaaz Ho, Wada Karke Bhul Jate Ho

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: It's a catch-22 situation for the BJP allies in poll-bound Bihar. The anti-Waqf Amendment Bill protest in Patna on Wednesday set the stage for a fierce political showdown in the state as elections approach. While the RJD and other opposition parties have come out strongly against the proposed Bill claiming that it targets the minorities, the BJP has backed the amendments, saying it will benefit the poor sections of the Muslim community.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board ( AIMPLB ), which is leading the nationwide protests, has alleged that the NDA government at the Centre is trying to seize Waqf properties that were dedicated by their forefathers for the welfare of the people. They claimed that the government is unlawfully attempting to take control of these properties.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav , who is leading the opposition's charge against the ruling NDA in Bihar, joined the AIMPLB protest, accompanied by his father Lalu Prasad. At the protest, Tejashwi asserted that his party would use its full might to oppose the Bill that was ""unconstitutional"", ""dictatorial"" and inspired by the ideology of the RSS (""""). The Congress, the Left parties and the latest entrant in Bihar politics - Prashant Kishor all have opposed the Waqf Bill.However, it is the BJP-led NDA that faces a dilemma on the Waqf issue - which has the potential to polarise the voters of the state. While the BJP is firm in its backing of the amendments, its allies are guarded in their response.Chief minister Nitish Kumar 's JD(U), Union ministers Chirag Paswan's LJP have always found support of minorities in the state in their pockets of influence. These leaders, who are known to hold grand Iftar parties over the years, have already faced the heat over the issue in the form of boycotts from some outfits this year. It will be interesting to see how they position themselves vis-à-vis the Bill amid the opposition's attacks.At today's protest, Tejashwi called Nitish power-hungry. ""There are some who are supporting the Bill because of their greed for power. I am proud that I have in my veins the blood of Lalu ji, who has come here despite his body having been worn down by a kidney transplant and heart surgeries,"" Tejashwi said at the protest site.Interestingly, an ailing Lalu was brought to the protest site perhaps to remind the minorities about the incident when the RJD supremo had famously stopped the Ayodhya Rath Yatra on its tracks by getting BJP patriarch L K Advani arrested in Bihar.The RJD has already dropped enough hints that it will go all out to corner the JD(U) on the issue of Waqf Bill. Last week, the party had put up a poster targeting Nitish Kumar over his stance on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The poster, which was displayed outside the residence of former CM and RJD leader Rabri Devi at 10 Circular Road, Patna, depicted CM Nitish greeting a Muslim cleric. The message on the poster read, "","" accusing Nitish of being a ""cheater"" who forgets his promises. The poster, placed by RJD leader Sanju Kohli, also contained a scathing message: ""I will take your vote but not stand with you on NRC and Waqf Bill with you.""While the JD(U) and Nitish Kumar are yet to clear their stand on the issue, the party has countered RJD's poster attack by releasing a new poster titled 'Bhoolega Nahi Bihar,' (Bihar will not forget). The poster highlights the ""atrocities of the jungle raj"" and carries the message 'Bhoolega Nahi Bihar.'LJP chief Chirag Paswan, who has objected to announcements of boycotts of his Iftaar parties, has blamed the Congress and RJD for the plight of Muslims, claiming that the community was treated as a ""vote bank"" by these parties.Recalling the much talked about political move of his father late Ram Vilas Paswan in 2005, the LJP(RV) president said, ""I shall continue to follow in the footsteps of my father, who had put his own political career at stake by promising his party's support to whoever made a Muslim the chief minister of Bihar"".However, another key NDA ally - Jitan Ram Manjhi targeted the Waqf protesters and used objectionable words for them.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to introduce reforms such as digitization, enhanced audits, improved transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties. The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that Waqf properties are utilized for their intended purposes, benefiting both the Muslim community and the country as a whole.As the election in the state approaches, the attacks and counterattacks over the issue will get more sharp and shrill. The RJD and the Congress will try to maximise their political gains by raising the pitch and putting the NDA allies on the defensive. Any polarisation over the issue may end up helping them and also perhaps the BJP, which has already made massive gains in the state.","The anti-Waqf Amendment Bill protest in Patna on Wednesday set the stage for a fierce political showdown in the state as elections approach.

NEW DELHI: The United States is cracking down on “bots” blocking substantial visa interview appointment dates in India, leaving many applicants with no option but to pay agents about Rs 30,000-35,000 per person to get the same in time for their proposed visit.The US embassy in India said on Wednesday on X: “Consular Team India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots. We have zero tolerance for agents and fixers who violate our scheduling policies. Effective immediately, we are cancelling these appointments and suspending the associated accounts’ scheduling privileges (sic).”“We will continue our anti-fraud efforts. We have zero tolerance for frauds,” the post added. It is an open secret in travel industry that while there’s a long wait for appointment dates for US visas — business & visitor B1/B2 & student — paying an agent magically secures a slot within a month or so.“We tried to get a visa interview date on our own for our child who had to join an American university last fall but nothing was available in the timeframe to do so. We paid an agent Rs 30,000 and got the same in time,” a person said on condition of anonymity. Similarly, the wait for a B1/B2 is over six months but paying Rs 30-35,000 could mean getting one within a month or so.Sources say agents use bots to block appointment dates due to which no near-term availability is visible when applicants want to book one on their own. When the wait for B1/B2 appointments was near the 999-day mark in 2023, the US had to open appointments for Indian applicants at its consulates in Frankfurt and Bangkok, among other places.India had also taken up the issue of long visa wait times with the US 2-3 years ago. The US took a series of steps to cut waiting times. Now, with US cracking down on bots, the situation might improve further.","The US embassy in India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots.

Punjab Police’s stand

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army has called for a transparent and time-bound investigation into the alleged assault of Colonel Pushpinder Singh Bath by Punjab Police personnel in Patiala.Stressing the need for accountability, senior Army officials said those responsible should face strict legal action to maintain trust between the military and civil administration, according to the news agency PTI.Following the incident, Colonel Bath has moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court, requesting that the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or another independent agency.He argued that an impartial probe under the Punjab Police was unlikely.The Army has vowed to pursue the case until justice is served. “A fair and honest investigation must be conducted in a transparent and time-bound manner to ensure the guilty are punished,” said Lt Gen Mohit Wadhwa , Chief of Staff, Army Western Command.Punjab director general of police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav reaffirmed the force’s respect for the Army, assuring that those responsible would be held accountable. “Anyone found guilty of assaulting a serving Army officer will face strict legal action,” he said.To ensure a thorough probe, Punjab Police has suspended 12 personnel and set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by a senior officer. The SIT has been instructed to expedite its investigation, according to ANI.According to Col. Bath’s complaint, he and his son were attacked by Punjab Police officers outside a dhaba in Patiala on the night of March 13-14. The Army was informed the next day, and Col. Bath was transferred from a civil hospital to the Command Hospital in Chandimandir for further treatment.On March 22, the Civil Lines police station in Patiala registered an FIR against the officers named in the complaint. The implicated personnel were immediately suspended and transferred out of Patiala.Lt. Gen.

Subsequently, Tharoor informed the press that the discussion primarily centred on Bangladesh relations, describing it as thorough, and noted the committee's adoption of its diaspora report.The ministry revealed that Bangladesh's army chief publicly acknowledged the risks posed by internal conflicts. It noted recurring instances of mob violence, property destruction, and offences against women and minorities.According to the PTI sources, the committee was informed that Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and associates dismissed reports of minority persecution as media hyperbole, characterising them as ""political killings"" of Awami League members rather than communal violence.The ministry also indicated that working-level engagement with Bangladesh facilitates bilateral cooperation whilst addressing strategic concerns. It emphasised the importance of Bangladesh considering regional security matters whilst pursuing mutual interests.Officials stressed Bangladesh's stability as crucial for regional security, highlighting the significance of maintaining constructive bilateral relations for border safety.

What Supreme Court said:



The top court said: ""In normal circumstances, we are slow in granting stay at this stage. But since the observations in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 are totally unknown to canons of law and depict total insensitive and inhuman approach, we are inclined to stay the said observations.""

Referring to the high court's observations, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""This is one judgement I take a very serious exception.""

""It is a very serious matter,"" Justice Gavai said, ""exhibiting total insensitiveness on the part of the judge.""

""We are sorry to use such harsh words against the judge,"" the bench added.

""We have perused the order (of the high court). We are at pains to say that some of the observations made in the impugned order and particularly in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 depicts a total lack of sensitivity on the part of the author of the judgement,"" the bench added.

""The registrar general is forthwith communate the order and place before honourable chief justice of Allahabad HC and take such matter as deemed appropriate,"" it added, according to news agency PTI.

The Allahabad HC's ruling



Family relieved after Supreme Court order

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Allahabad high court 's controversial order, which stated that ""grabbing the breast and breaking the pyjama string"" were not sufficient grounds to charge an accused with rape or attempted rape.During the hearing, a bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and AG Masih criticised the high court judge for displaying ""total insensitivity"" in handling the case.The apex court remarked that while it regretted using harsh words for the judge, the matter was serious, and the order was not issued impulsively.A few days ago, the high court passed an order in connection with a case involving two men, Pawan and Akash, who allegedly grabbed the minor’s breasts, tore her pyjama string, and attempted to drag her under a culvert while she was walking with her mother.Initially, they were charged under Section 376 of the IPC (rape) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. However, the Allahabad HC ruled that their actions did not qualify as rape or an attempt to rape but instead fell under the lesser charge of aggravated sexual assault , punishable under Section 354(B) IPC and Section 9(m) of the POCSO Act.The high court’s ruling was based on the argument that ""an attempt to commit rape must go beyond the stage of preparation and actual attempt to commit an offence consists chiefly in the greater degree of determination.""""The specific allegation against Akash is that he tried to drag the victim beneath the culvert and broke the string of her pyjama. It is also not stated by witnesses that due to this act of the accused the victim got naked or got undressed. There is no allegation that accused tried to commit penetrative sexual assault against the victim,"" the court observed in its order.In view of this, the court opined that the allegations levelled against the accused and facts of the case hardly constituted an offence of attempt to rape in the case. Victim's family relieved after SC order.The family of the minor girl, who was the victim of an attempted rape in Kasganj district, has expressed relief after the Supreme Court stayed the high court's ruling in the case.Advocate Rachna Tyagi, who represented the family in the apex court, shared the update, stating that the survivor's mother is ""extremely relieved."" Meanwhile, the government advocate representing the survivor in the Allahabad High Court was unavailable for comment.Speaking to PTI, Tyagi said, ""The survivor's mother is extremely relieved because ever since the incident in November 2021, her FIR was not being registered. In January 2022, she had to approach the district court under Section 156(3) to file a complaint.""""Since then, for over three-and-a-half years, neither the trial court nor the high court ordered the FIR to be registered. Attempted rape is a cognisable offence and an FIR must be filed in such cases,"" she added.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Allahabad high court's controversial order.

"Defence ministry inks mega Rs 6,900 crore deal for indigenous heavy-duty artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defence-ministry-inks-mega-rs-6900-crore-deal-for-indigenous-heavy-duty-artillery-guns/articleshow/119542878.cms,"NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday inked the around Rs 6,900 crore contract for production of 307 advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) and 327 high mobility 6x6 gun-towing vehicles with private sector companies Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems , in the first-ever deal for such indigenous heavy-duty howitzers.With the signing of the deal for the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS designed and developed by DRDO, the total value of capital procurement contracts inked by MoD in the ongoing fiscal stands at Rs 1.4 lakh crore. The PM-led cabinet committee on security had cleared the ATAGS deal on March 19, as was first reported by TOI.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh felicitated the project director of ATAGS -- which has a strike range of up to 45-km depending on the ammunition -- from DRDO’s Pune-based Armament Research and Development Establishment during the ceremony on Wednesday.“The procurement of this gun system marks a significant milestone in the modernization of the Army’s artillery regiments, enhancing their operational readiness along the borders with China and Pakistan. Renowned for its exceptional lethality, the ATAGS will play a crucial role in bolstering the Army's firepower by enabling precise and long-range strikes,” an official said.Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns because it had emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%. “ATAGS will replace outdated 105mm and 130mm guns. Over 65% of its components are sourced domestically, including key subsystems such as the barrel, muzzle brake, breech mechanism, firing and recoil system, and ammunition handling mechanism,” another official said.Officers say ATAGS have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, longer maintenance-free reliable operations due to their “all-electric drive technology”, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","The defence ministry on Wednesday inked the around Rs 6,900 crore contract for production of 307 advanced towed artillery gun systems.

The two exercises will be conducted simultaneously — the census in three phases over a three-and-a-half-year period and the increasing of green cover over four years.The census will help track tree populations area-wise and check illegal felling. The court took this step in view of the fact that Delhi witnesses felling of five trees per hour on an average. A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan allowed FRI to go ahead with the exercises but asked it to try to complete the tasks in a shorter span and also reduce budget.The court also accepted the submission of additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati that the money to undertake census should be released from the CAMPA fund. She assured that all necessary help would be provided to the institute but said the exercise should be concluded in a shorter time.As per FRI, the exercise will be carried out in three phases, with the first phase aiming at standardising the methodology for tree census — it will take 15 months. The second phase is about development of an action plan that will be done in three months, and the final phase is implementation, which will take two years.“FRI proposes an estimated budget of Rs 443 lakh for the execution of phase one and phase two on standardisation of methodology and pilot trial for the development of action plan for implementation in phase three,” the institute said in its affidavit.It said the Tree Authority and the Delhi forest department will undertake the census, and FRI will provide technical support and capacity building to the department’s officials in undertaking the exercise besides monitoring and evaluation. The final report will be submitted to the court by the authority.It said the institute will design and develop a web portal and a mobile app for the census.

A three-judge bench rejected the petition filed by activist Binay Singh, a Jharkhand resident. Singh had sought a court-monitored investigation or a probe led by a retired SC judge. The top court questioned the relevance of the plea, asking: “You are a resident of Jharkhand. Why are you bothered about what’s happening in that state? They are competent enough to take care of this.” The petitioner’s counsel, Barun Kumar Sinha, argued that the allegations were serious and posed a threat to judicial independence . “We are concerned about the independence of the judiciary,” the counsel said. Sinha argued that media reports on the matter merited a thorough probe. But SC was unconvinced. “Why should they fall into a honeytrap? If someone sets up a honeytrap and you fall into it, you are inviting trouble for yourself,” it observed, adding that the judiciary had concerns more pressing than political disputes. Cooperation minister KN Rajanna had claimed on March 20 that there had been attempts to “honeytrap” him and that at least 48 politicians across parties had fallen prey to similar schemes. “People say that there is a CD (compact disc) and pen drive factory in Karnataka.

SC: Insurers can deny claims for alcohol use non-disclosure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-insurers-can-deny-claims-for-alcohol-use-non-disclosure/articleshow/119565595.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court has held that an insurance company is entitled to deny a claim if a policyholder did not disclose alcohol consumption at the time of purchasing the policy.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta upheld the Life Insurance Corporation 's decision to deny a claim over hospitalisation of a policyholder under the 'Jeevan Arogya' scheme on the grounds that he had furnished false information regarding his habit of alcohol consumption.In this case, the man had purchased the 'Jeevan Arogya' policy in 2013, under which he was to get benefits such as Rs 1,000 per day for non-ICU hospitalisation and Rs 2,000 per day for ICU hospitalisation. He was hospitalised a year after with severe abdominal pain, and a month thereafter he passed away.LIC rejected the claim filed by the policyholder's widow on the grounds that the deceased had withheld information about his chronic alcoholism.Referring to Clause 7(xi) of the Jeevan Arogya Plan, LIC said the policy excludes coverage for ""self-inflicted injuries or conditions (attempted suicide) and/or the use or misuse of any drugs or alcohol and complications arising from it"".The deceased's wife had moved the consumer forum, which directed LIC to reimburse the medical expenses. However, SC disagreed with the order of National Consumer Disputes Resolution Commission.The court said that the deceased's ""alcoholism was a long- standing condition, which he knowingly suppressed while subscribing to the policy"". ""Given this suppression of material facts, the appellant was justified in repudiating the claim under the exclusion clause,"" it said.","A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta upheld the Life Insurance Corporation's decision to deny a claim over hospitalisation of a policyholder.

Reacting strongly to the party’s move, 60-year-old Yatnal accused “vested interests” of orchestrating his removal. “The party has rewarded me for ‘calling a spade, a spade’. Certain vested interests have played their part in furthering their agenda successfully,” he said in a post on X. “The decision to expel me will not deter my fight against corruption, dynasty politics, the development of north Karnataka and Hindutva,” he added.Yatnal was informed of his expulsion through a letter signed by Om Pathak, secretary of BJP disciplinary panel.Despite receiving the show-cause notice last month, Yatnal remained defiant and continued with his diatribe against Vijayendra and Yediyurappa.

Withholding funds in PM SHRI row unfair: Parliament panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/withholding-funds-in-pm-shri-row-unfair-parliament-panel/articleshow/119565102.cms,"Bengal, TN, Kerala, suffering due to fund delays, says panel

NEW DELHI: Non-allocation of funds to states that have not signed MoUs to implement the PM SHRI scheme is unfair, a parliamentary panel has said, recommending that the education ministry reconsider its policy regarding the release of grants under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan .The committee on education, women, children, youth and sports, chaired by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, has stressed that no state should be placed at a disadvantage for not implementing NEP or SSA. The non-binding recommendation comes amid the row between Centre and TN over stoppage of Rs 2,152 crore in funds, following the state’s refusal to adopt National Education Policy 2020 and its three-language formula.The panel acknowledged that 33 out of 36 states and UTs have signed MoUs and are implementing the PM SHRI scheme, which aims at creating uniform assessment and curriculum standards at the national level. However, the committee deemed it unfair to penalise the remaining states by halting SSA grants.“The committee takes serious note of the non-release of SSA funds to certain states which have not signed MoUs for implementing the PM SHRI scheme. The total pending funds under this scheme are substantial, with over Rs 1,000 crore owed to West Bengal, Rs 859.63 crore to Kerala and Rs 2,152 crore to Tamil Nadu,” said the panel’s report tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. The panel said states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Bengal, which boast gross enrolment ratios above the national average, are suffering due to the delayed release of SSA funds.“Underfunding and delays have constrained advancements in school infrastructure, teacher training, and student support in these states,” the report said.Tamil Nadu was allocated Rs 3,586 crore for FY 2024-25, with Rs 2,152 crore as the central govt’s share. Because of the TN govt’s refusal to implement NEP, the amount has not been disbursed, severely impacting salaries of teachers, RTE reimbursements and transportation for students in remote areas. The committee recommended immediate release of SSA funds, warning that delays could disrupt school operations and salaries.","Non-allocation of funds to states that have not signed MoUs to implement the PM SHRI scheme is unfair, a parliamentary panel has said.

The Liberals had never revealed why they barred the three-term Liberal MP from the party’s recent leadership race or from running again in Nepean constituency, the paper said.Citing the source, the daily reported that the Canadian security intelligence service had briefed the govt about Arya’s “alleged close ties to the govt of India, including its high commission in Ottawa.”Liberal Party officials who have security clearances and had received a general CSIS briefing on foreign interference also had concerns about Arya, a Liberal source said. The decisions to remove Arya as a candidate for the leadership and Nepean nomination were solely made by the Liberal Party and were not on the advice of CSIS, sources said.Party officials, in charge of monitoring foreign meddling, found troubling inconsistencies in information that Arya had put in a confidential questionnaire, the second source said.Arya rejected the allegations that he has been influenced by India. “As a MP, I have engaged with numerous diplomats and heads of govt, both in Canada and internationally. Not once have I sought — nor been required to seek — permission from the govt to do so,” he told The Globe. At no point did former PM Trudeau or any minister raise concerns about my meetings or public statements, he said. Arya said he believes he was removed from Nepean nomination because he’s spoken out against the Khalistan movement in Canada. Last week, Arya released a letter from the Liberal Party informing him of the decision to disallow his Nepean nomination.","Indian-origin MP Chandra Arya’s bid to run for the party leadership and his nomination in his own Ottawa Nepean constituency was revoked.

Bangladesh plan to redefine ‘muktijoddha’ yet again stirs a debate in West Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-plan-to-redefine-muktijoddha-yet-again-stirs-a-debate-in-west-bengal/articleshow/119563249.cms,"KOLKATA: Fifty-four years after the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out on the night of March 25, 1971, deliberations are on to modify the definition of “bir muktijoddha (valiant freedom fighter)”, raising a debate. According to media reports, only battlefield fighters could be recognised as valiant freedom fighters, while others could be classified as ‘Liberation War Associates’.Kolkatans with ancestral links to Bangladesh or professional experience across the border have a nuanced approach towards the deliberation. The definition of muktijoddhas has been altered over 10 times by now.“During the Awami League’s tenure, many fake freedom fighters were enlisted. Communist and Leftist freedom fighters did not receive recognition. The National Freedom Fighters’ Council even decided to revoke Ziaur Rahman’s ‘Bir Uttam’ title in 2021,” said Arka Bhaduri, an independent journalist who has been writing on contemporary Bangladesh affairs.“Amid numerous fake claims of being muktijoddhas, there have been instances of genuine people being ignored and not granted this recognition as many were reluctant to publicise their contributions,” said Abhijit Dasgupta, director of ‘Invincible Bravura’ on the Indian Navy’s formation of the first ‘Nau Commando’ that included eight Bengali escapees from a Pakistani submarine in 1971 during the war.Dasgupta called the amendment “after so many decades” an attempt to “deliberately confuse the contemporary youth”. Bhaduri believes all those who participated in the struggle are “freedom fighters”. “Mujib’s role in the post-1971 era was problematic, but it is undeniable that although he did not physically participate in combat, the war was fought in his name. Calling him or Tajuddin Ahmad mere supporters would be a distortion of history,” he said.Cultural activist Subha Prasad Nandi Majumdar, who is from a refugee family of 1947, described it as a “ploy to subvert the real essence of liberation struggle”.", deliberations are on to modify the definition of ‘bir muktijoddha (valiant freedom fighter)’ Kolkatans with ancestral links to Bangladesh or professional experience across the border have a nuanced approach towards the deliberation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119563382,imgsize-969744,width-400,resizemode-4/119563382.jpg"

'White collar terror module': ED raids Al-Falah University; searches at 25 locations across Delhi-NCR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-car-blast-central-agency-raids-al-falah-university-in-faridabad-probe-intensifies/articleshow/125399642.cms,"Multiple IEDs, 32 Vehicles: Agencies Uncover Plan For Serial Car Explosions In Delhi Blast Probe

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate launched raids against the Al-Falah University in Faridabad along with its office in Okhla and the university's promoters on Tuesday morning, PTI reported citing sources. Initial probe reveal discrepancies regarding UGC and NAAC recognition.The central agency has been conducting raids since 5am at 25 different places across the national capital, intensifying the Delhi car blast probe, ANI reported citing sources.Nine shell firms connected to the group, each registered at the same address, are now under scrutiny. Preliminary inquiries have revealed several red flags typical of shell operations, such as: no actual office space or noticeable utility usage at their listed locations; the same phone number and email ID being used for multiple companies and accounts; no EPFO or ESIC filings despite the scale of business they claim; repeated overlap in directors or authorised signatories with poor KYC documentation; very limited salary payments made through formal banking channels and no HR records; and a pattern of companies being incorporated in a coordinated manner using identical contact details, the news agency reported.The investigation focuses on a “white-collar” terror network that appears to involve both medical professionals and individuals connected to the university. Authorities have recovered key evidence, including a vehicle tied to the blast and significant amounts of explosive material, pointing to a deeper, more organised operation.This comes a day after the brother of the Al-Falah University chancellor was arrested from Hyderabad in connection with 25-year-old fraud cases.Al Falah University has come under scrutiny after the arrest of several doctors in connection with the November 10 high-intensity blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, which killed 13 people and injured many others.The prime accused, Dr Umar Un Nabi, was a former student of the university. In response, the institution issued a statement condemning the attack and affirming its commitment as a responsible educational body aligned with national interests.As part of the investigation, Delhi Police have issued two summons to the university’s chancellor, citing the need to resolve inconsistencies in the institution’s functioning and clarify the roles of certain individuals linked to it.Investigators are probing possible connections between the university and multiple suspects associated with the blast, including examining institutional records, financial transactions, and administrative decisions as part of a broader inquiry into the alleged Faridabad terror module.","The Enforcement Directorate launched raids against the Al-Falah University in Faridabad along with its office in Okhla.

'Endured what happened to me but my sister ... ': Tej Pratap slams Jaichands for 'insulting' Rohini; Lalu family feud escalates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/endured-what-happened-to-me-but-my-sister-tej-pratap-slams-jaichands-for-insulting-rohini-lalu-family-feud-escalates/articleshow/125399285.cms,"In a passionate outburst, Tej Pratap Yadav took aim at family members and RJD associates whom he branded as 'betrayers' for disrespecting his sister, Rohini Acharya. This vehement reaction came on the heels of Rohini's retirement from the political arena and ongoing family turmoil.

NEW DELHI: Tej Pratap Yadav on Monday again launched a strong attack on individuals within his family and RJD, accusing them of acting like “traitors” and warning that he would not accept any insult directed at his sister.His remarks come days after RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s daughter Rohini Acharya announced her exit from politics and severed ties with the family, a move followed by three of her sisters reportedly leaving the Patna residence amid the escalating dispute.In a post on X, the Janshakti Tej Pratap wrote: “We will not tolerate any insult to our sister under any circumstances; the traitors will surely have to pay the price for this misconduct!”“The abuse that was done to our Rohini di by Jaichand, this incident has shaken my heart to the core. What happened to me, I have endured, but what happened to my sister — that insult is absolutely unacceptable under any circumstances. Listen, Jaichand, if you attack the family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you,” Tej Pratap added in his post.This marks the latest development in months of turmoil within the Yadav family, which saw Tej Pratap himself expelled from both the RJD and the family following a bitter dispute over his personal life.Earlier, on Sunday, following Rohini Acharya’s announcement, Tej Pratap shared an emotionally charged post on his party’s Instagram account, warning those he described as “traitors” and appealing directly to his father.“Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances. Listen, traitors— if you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away,” he wrote.He also accused them of influencing his brother Tejashwi’s political judgment.“These few faces have even clouded Tejashwi’s judgment. The consequences of this injustice will be extremely grave. Time’s reckoning is harsh,” he added.Also read: Nitish Kumar resigns as Bihar CM: Cabinet backs assembly dissolution; oath ceremony on Nov 20 The JJP chief also urged Lalu Prasad Yadav to intervene: “Father, give just one signal… just one gesture, and the people of Bihar themselves will bury these traitors. This is not a fight of any political party — it is a fight for the family’s honour, for the dignity of daughters, and for the self-respect of Bihar.”The controversy comes in the wake of Rohini Acharya’s social-media post on Sunday in which she alleged humiliation, abuse and expulsion from her parental home.She claimed she was “disgraced, abused, and even hit” after questioning the leadership over RJD’s poor performance in the Assembly elections.Rohini had named responsible for the family rift, claiming their actions prompted her decision to quit politics and leave her parents’ home.","In a passionate outburst, Tej Pratap Yadav took aim at family members and RJD associates whom he branded as 'betrayers' for disrespecting his sister, Rohini Acharya.

45 Indians on pilgrimage to Mecca die after bus collides with oil tanker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/45-indians-on-pilgrimage-to-mecca-die-after-bus-collides-with-oil-tanker/articleshow/125398417.cms,"PM Modi Condoles Families as 45 Indians Feared Dead in Saudi Bus Crash

Telangana govt to send team to Saudi to coordinate relief

Eighteen members of a family were among at least 45 Umrah pilgrims from Hyderabad charred early Monday in a bus inferno triggered by a highway collision with a fuel tanker while travelling from Mecca to Medina in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed Shoeb, the lone pilgrim to survive, escaped because he was seated beside the driver when the bus burst into flames after ramming into the tanker around 1.30am (11pm IST). Both men broke through a window and jumped.Hyderabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the 46 passengers were part of a 54-member group that flew from the city to Saudi Arabia on Nov 9. They were to return on Nov 23 after visiting Islam's holiest site. ""Four members of the group hired a car to travel to Medina after completing Umrah rituals. Another four stayed back in Mecca,"" Sajjanar said.The victims include 22 women and 11 children. Shoeb, whose brother also travelled to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage but wasn't on the bus, remains in intensive care at Saudi German Hospital with injuries to his arms and legs.""I spoke to Shoeb. Going by what he said, some passengers were asleep during the crash.He was lucky to be in the cabin with the driver,"" his sibling, Mohammed Sameer, told TOI over phone.""It is unclear if the tanker hit the vehicle while it was moving or was stationary.”Sameer and his family landed in Jeddah three days after the rest of the pilgrims and are yet to finish their Mecca rituals. PM Modi condoled the deaths in a post on X. “Deeply saddened by the accident in Medinah involving Indian nationals. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. I pray for the swift recovery of all those injured. Our embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,” he wrote.Telangana govt has decided to depute a team, led by its minorities welfare minister Mohammad Azharuddin, to Saudi Arabia to coordinate relief efforts. Announcing ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of those who died, the govt said it would help arrange the funerals of the deceased in Saudi in accordance with traditions. Two members of each affected family would be flown to Saudi, it said. “The bodies were charred beyond recognition. DNA tests are also likely to be conducted to identify the victims,” said Azharuddin, adding a control room had been set up at Haj House (numbers 79979 59754/99129 19545) to provide more information to families of victims. The minister reaffirmed the state govt, in coordination with the foreign ministry and Saudi authorities, was making all possible efforts to provide assistance, guidance, and necessary support to the families. Police and govt officials, who are in contact with authorities in Saudi, said the Al-Makkah Travels-owned bus was about 25km short of its destination when the fatal crash occurred.Saudi authorities have started investigating the circumstances that led to the accident. In a 2023 report, the UN pointed out that Saudi had a high road fatality rate compared to other high-income countries. Transporting worshippers around Saudi’s holy sites has frequently proven dangerous, particularly during Haj, when roads can be chaotic with buses creating interminable traffic jams, sources said.","At least 45 Umrah pilgrims from Hyderabad charred early Monday in a bus inferno triggered by a highway collision with a fuel tanker.

BENGALURU: Metro services on the Yellow Line were disrupted for over 30 minutes Monday morning after a group of passengers halted a train at RV Road station, demanding that BMRCL start operations at 5am on the newly opened corridor.The incident occurred at 6am, when 10-15 commuters allegedly stood between the doors of a departing train, preventing them from closing and allowing the train to leave the station.Based on a complaint from BMRCL, an FIR was registered against unidentified passengers for obstructing services. While operations on Purple and Green Lines begin around 4.30am Mondays, Yellow Line — connecting RV Road to Bommasandra — currently starts its first service at 6am.Officials said this mismatch left early officer-goers frustrated and airport-bound commuters waiting at RV Road station. When train ID02 arrived at 5.55am, a group of passengers is said to have confronted staff, questioning why the service hadn't commenced earlier. Despite explanations that Yellow Line services cannot operate before 6am due to limited availability of trainsets, passengers continued to argue.Instead of boarding, they stood between the coach doors, preventing them from closing each time the loco pilot attempted to start the train. This led to a cascading delay of nearly 35 minutes, affecting subsequent schedules and inconveniencing hundreds of passengers during early-morning rush.A senior official said BMRCL is currently operating Yellow Line with all available trainsets, leaving no spare rakes to be deployed for earlier services. ""Passengers disrupted operations, causing delays across multiple trains. We had to call police to resolve the situation,"" the official said.Later to make up for the disruption, BMRCL ran a short-loop service up to Silk Board.In an official release, the corporation warned that obstructing Metro operations is a punishable offence under Metro Railway (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, and could attract imprisonment, fines, or both. ""Such actions compromise safety and inconvenience thousands,"" the statement read.It also highlighted recent improvements since Nov 1 — after adding the fifth trainset, Yellow Line start time was advanced from 6:30am to 6am, and peak-hour headway was reduced from 19 minutes to 15. More improvements are expected as additional trains are inducted into the service, it said.","Metro services on the Yellow Line were disrupted for over 30 minutes Monday morning.

(With inputs from Manoj Badgeri, Richa Pinto, and B B Nayak)

MUMBAI: A day after the damage to a gas pipeline in Chembur, several Mumbaikars faced the inconvenience of not getting autos, taxis, private cabs, and school buses on Monday as operations of several CNG refuelling stations in MMR remained shut.The situation may worsen on Tuesday as 44% of the BEST bus fleet running on CNG could be off the roads too, thereby crippling the city's road lifeline. This is apart from several autos and taxis being unavailable, said transportation sources. The crisis also affected owners of the more than 500,000 private CNG cars in the region.An MGL spokesperson said domestic PNG (cooking gas) would not be impacted though. ""Currently, out of MGL's total 389 gas stations, 225 are operating. The rectification work is in progress, and the restoration of gas supply is expected by Tuesday noon,"" she added.BEST operated its fleet of CNG buses on Monday as they refuelled at Anik depot on Sunday night, but there was no more fuel left for buses on Monday night, an official said. Most aggregator cabs such as Ola and Uber had the option to switch to dual fuel and run on petrol, but riders were impacted by surge fares as high as 2x in many areas.The CNG crisis began Sunday afternoon after ""third-party damage"" to the gas pipeline of GAIL India Ltd at RCF terminal, Chembur, resulting in the supply to Mahanagar Gas Ltd's (MGL) station in Wadala being disconnected.School Bus Owners' Association president Anil Garg said 2,000 school buses in MMR ply on CNG and they were off the roads, due to which students suffered. Several school buses have switched from diesel to CNG in recent years. Andheri resident Suheil Merchant said, ""My wife had a harrowing time dropping my little one to the class, as she had to walk back from Vile Parle West to Andheri West. The school van operator also cancelled today's pick-up and drop for the afternoon school. """"Share autos operating for Bandra-Kurla Complex from Kurla and Bandra stations were fleecing us with exorbitant fares of Rs 50-60 per passenger, citing the CNG crisis,"" said Vijay Bhandari, an office-goer. Autos and taxis, which were plying, demanded excess fares while those outside pumps waited in 1-2 km long queues with other CNG vehicles, with drivers uncertain when refuelling would resume. ""I have been waiting since 5:30am outside a Bhandup pump and it is 1pm, and there is so much confusion, with nobody telling us the timeline when services will restart,"" said Ashwin Surve, an auto driver.Aditi Chatterjee from Chembur said she was among several commuters unable to get an auto on Monday, and she walked 1.5km from where she got public transport. In the absence of autos, the BEST buses ran packed, but many were unable to catch these buses and people walked. ""I stay 7km away from the station and depend on autos for travel. Tuesday morning will be painful with no autos,"" said Mukul Tiwari, a Thane resident.Petrol Dealers' Association president Chetan Modi said on Sunday, gas supply was restored at 70% of pumps around 9-10pm. ""We had a long queue outside our pump after which the police were called and the supply was stopped at midnight. We resumed supply in the morning for some time, but the pressure of gas was low and had to shut completely,"" he said.Mumbai Rickshawmen's Union president Thampy Kurien said the MGL should have arranged for alternate gas supply such as one from Mahape so that in such a crisis situation, they can switch to the second line and keep autos, taxis, and other vehicles running across the city. ""We had demanded this through our petitions in the past."" He added that there was a daily loss in earnings of Rs 400 to Rs 1,500 per driver for autos-taxis, with the city having nearly 20,000 taxis and 300,000 autos in Greater Mumbai alone.Mumbai Autorickshawmen's Union leader Shashank Rao said the crisis affected peak hour commuters the most and the issue may worsen if it prolongs on Tuesday, and may lead to law and order problems outside pumps. Police were deployed in a few areas to keep check at pumps.In Thane, as only one of the four MGL-operated pumps in the city at Khopat was operating, many motorists queued up with few complaining of having waited for several hours with no luck. The Thane municipal transport fleet that has around 25-30% fleet operating on CNG said the situation would be manageable till Tuesday morning.Navi Mumbai faced a major disruption in CNG supply, causing significant inconvenience for motorists over the past two days. Satyam Upadhyay, a cab operator from Ghansoli, said he was unable to work since Sunday while monitoring news about supply restoration. The shortage resulted in serpentine queues at filling stations across the city, leaving many drivers without business.","The situation may worsen on Tuesday as 44% of the BEST bus fleet running on CNG could be off the roads. This is apart from several autos and taxis being unavailable, said transportation sources. The crisis also affected owners of the more than 500,000 private CNG cars in the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125400228,imgsize-1969511,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/cng-crisis-disrupts-public-transport-causes-commuter-inconvenience-in-mumbai.jpg"

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial- killing episodes.

""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

PATNA: A visibly emotional Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who has been publicly accused by sister Rohini Acharya of misbehaviour and attacked by elder brother Tej Pratap, on Monday told RJD MLAs that they were free to elect someone else as their legislative party leader before his father and party patriarch Lalu Prasad quickly intervened to say he should continue to lead the party in the Bihar assembly, according to a legislator who was present at the meeting.Soon thereafter, the newly elected RJD MLAs chose Tejashwi as their legislative party leader. Apart from Lalu Prasad, his wife and former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi and their eldest daughter and party MP Misa Bharti also attended the meeting.

He gave us the option to elect anyone else as RJD legislative party leader,"" the legislator said, adding that he also launched an indirect attack on Rohini, saying he had been asked to deny ""someone"" a ticket, but he refused to do so. ""What to do? Do I see the party? Or the family?"" he asked. The meeting also discussed the party's poor performance, with particular emphasis on seats lost by narrow margins.Senior RJD leader Jagadanand Singh, speaking after the meeting, blamed EVMs for RJD's disastrous performance. ""Till the time machine (EVM) is there, democracy will be mocked. These machines were misused,"" said Singh.Another RJD MLA, Bhai Birendra, echoed the charge while speaking to the media.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: India remained the largest source of international students in the US in 2024-25, with 3,63,019 students registered on American campuses - a 10% rise over last year. The increase is slower than 2023-24's dizzying 23% jump.Tougher visa scrutiny, longer appointment queues and jitters over work-visa routes have done little to dent India's presence on American campuses.

Isro is set to launch seven more satellites, including the liftoff of a PSLV rocket made entirely by the industry in the current financial year.The Isro chief said the Chandrayaan-4 mission will be India's most complex lunar endeavour yet. “We are targeting 2028 for Chandrayaan-4,” he said. Chandrayaan-4 is also called LUPEX (Lunar Polar Exploration Mission) and is a joint programme between Isro and Japan's space agency Jaxa. The LUPEX project is aimed at exploring the Moon for water and other resources and gaining expertise in exploring the surface of the Moon. “Acquiring technologies needed for rovers and landers to operate in the harsh lunar environment is very important for pursuing space exploration,” said Jaxa.Narayanan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed Isro to work towards sending Indian astronauts to the lunar surface and bringing them back safely by 2040. India’s planning for a manned lunar mission comes against the backdrop of the US gearing up to send crewed missions to the Moon under the Artemis programme, most probably next year, and China setting a 2030 target for its first crewed landing on the Moon.On the Gaganyaan mission, Narayanan said only the timeframe for uncrewed missions has been shifted, and there is no change in the manned mission schedule. “The uncrewed mission was targeted for 2025. The crewed mission was always planned for 2027, and we are holding on to that date,” he said.Narayanan said Isro has also begun work on Bharatiya Antariksha Station, targeted for completion by 2035. “The first of the five modules will be placed in orbit by 2028,” he said. The mission, if successful, will make India the third country to operate a space station -- the US-led multi-country station ISS is nearing the end of life and will be deorbited in year 2030 and China's Tiangong station is moving into full gear.",The Chandrayaan-4 mission will be India's most complex lunar endeavour yet.

NEW DELHI: The smallest member of Mahagathbandhan in Bihar has made its presence felt in an otherwise trainwreck of an election for the opposition. In a state crowded with sub-regional satraps who are identified with their castes, I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.Gupta (55) won from Saharsa by defeating his BJP rival by over 2,000 votes, marking a successful electoral debut for his party which had contested three seats as an MGB constituent.It was an outcome that eluded better-known parties helmed by much bigger names. Jan Suraaj Party of Prashant Kishor and Vikashsheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, the latter an RJD ally like Gupta, are two such examples. While Kishor fielded candidates in over 235 seats, VIP contested 12. Both parties drew a blank.Gupta quit Congress in 2023 to champion the cause of Tanti-Tatwa which falls under Extremely Backward Classes and is estimated to be 1-2% of the population, and pushed for a separate quota for them along with members of the Paan community. He blamed the state's NDA govt for the Supreme Court verdict that had overturned the move to grant SC quota to Tanti-Tatwa (historically weavers) and put the community back in the EBC category.He showed a knack for mobilisation by organising a successful rally in Patna's huge Gandhi Maidan in April, coming to the notice of parties of all hues in the election year. He said he was contacted by formations from across the political spectrum, from NDA to AIMIM and MGB, before he reached a deal with the opposition alliance. He held meetings with Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav and accused NDA of trying to sabotage his politics while holding talks with him.An engineer who ran a business before plunging into politics, Gupta's stock is likely to rise in a state where mobilisation along caste lines is central to political shifts.","I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

High votes, low wins: The big contradiction



Contest more seats



NDA's math clicked, MGB's math cracked



JD(U)'s comeback flipped the story



BJP grows bigger than ever



MGB slipped because allies didn't deliver



Jan Suraaj and AIMIM changed the margins



So, what really happened?



NEW DELHI: Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi Yadav 's RJD turned out to be the party with highest vote share in the state, yet it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the NDA kept the power with landslide victory, clinching over 200 seats in 243-member assembly, keeping the Mahagathbandhan far from the seat of government.RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 per cent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. So the striking question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish with so few seats?The answer lies in how votes were spread. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes. It remained popular, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.In simple terms, RJD got votes but not victories. This is no surprise in India's electoral mechanism of 'First Past the Post System.'RJD contested 143 seats this time, the highest among all parties across both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Lalu-led party had fielded one more candidate, contesting 144 seats.Contesting widely helped the party accumulate more total votes, contributing to the highest vote share. But losing candidates also add to vote share totals.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) fought on 101 seats each. They contested fewer seats but converted their votes efficiently into victories. That is why their seat count shot up, even with a lower vote share than RJD.A major turning point this election was the return of Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas) to the NDA camp. In 2020, the LJP had hurt the NDA's chances by cutting into its votes, but this time its support helped strengthen the alliance instead of splitting it.In the previous election, LJP (RV) was unhappy with the NDA's seat-sharing formula in Bihar. Even though it was part of the alliance at the Centre, Chirag Paswan chose to go solo in the state and contested 134 seats, which ended up damaging NDA numbers—especially Nitish Kumar 's JD(U).Similarly, Upendra Kushwaha's party contested 104 seats independently in 2020, further cutting into votes that could have benefitted the NDA.This time, with both LJP (RV) and Kushwaha’s RLM back in the NDA fold, the alliance appeared far more united, organised, and prepared. The result: NDA outperformed the Mahagathbandhan by a wide margin.One of the biggest turnarounds happened in seats where RJD and JD(U) were in direct fight.In 2020, RJD dominated these contests. But in 2025, JD(U) turned the tables and won 50 out of 59, almost wiping out RJD in head-to-head battles. JD(U)'s vote share also jumped from 15.39 percent in 2020 to 19.25 percent this time, helping it win 85 seats from the tally of 43 last time.RJD simply failed to see this drastic reversal coming.The BJP crossed 89 seats, its highest tally ever in Bihar, marking a historic leap for a party that once had almost no grassroots base or ideological legacy in the state. By staying aligned for years with ""sushasan babu"" and steadily expanding its footprint, the saffron party has now grown into Bihar's biggest political force.With this mandate, the BJP has effectively redrawn the political map of Bihar. It now sits at the centre of power, holding the strongest bargaining position in the alliance. For years, Nitish Kumar played the ""big brother"" to the BJP, but for the second election in a row, the BJP has outperformed the JD(U), this time doing so with its best-ever numbers.The shift isn't just about arithmetic -- it's psychological. For decades, Bihar's political story revolved around the Lalu–Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s weight, influence and negotiating power.Unlike NDA, the Mahagathbandhan struggled with coordination and clarity.Congress contested on 61 seats as compared to last time's 70, but won only six. The Left parties, which surprised everyone in 2020, could not repeat their performance either. Seat-sharing disagreements and confusing ""friendly fights"" meant votes did not transfer smoothly within the alliance.The opposition was visible but not united -- and unity decides tight contests.Prashant Kishor's much-talked about startup -- Jan Suraaj did not open its account, but it made a strategic dent, in at least 35 seats, its vote share was higher than the winning margin, influencing outcomes for both alliances.Meanwhile, AIMIM repeated its strong Seemanchal performance, winning five seats with 1.85 percent of votes and signalling a shift in political thinking among Muslim voters.The traditional Muslim–Yadav (MY) vote base of the RJD showed signs of fragmentation, with Muslim voters exploring alternative platforms in multiple constituencies, leading to a near wipeout of the Mahagathbandhan in Seemanchal, barring one Congress candidate who scraped through.Mayawati's BSP also registered a presence, securing 1.62% of the total vote share with one seat in the west.RJD did not lose popularity, but lost positional advantage. It remained a strong choice for many voters but could not cross the finishing line often enough. High vote share created the impression of strength, but seats reflect actual power -- and that is where NDA towered above everyone.","RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 per cent, just few decimals down from 2020. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes.

SRINAGAR: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) announced Monday the arrest of a Kashmiri college student from Srinagar linked to Delhi suicide bomber Dr Umar Un Nabi, hours after the suspect's father died in hospital of burns suffered in a purported immolation attempt outside their home in Anantnag district's Qazigund.Jasir Bilal Wani, aka Danish, had been detained four days ago for interrogation along with his paternal uncle Nabeel Wani, a physics teacher.The family said Jasir's father Bilal Ahmad Wani, 55, was summoned by police last Saturday and he returned home ""distressed"".

LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Investigators are racing to close the arc of a Jaish-e-Mohammed project they said was years in the making - one that turned a campus doctor into ""Madam Surgeon"" of a cross-border terrorist blueprint.The alleged architect linking these threads is 43-year-old Dr Shaheen Shahid - ""Madam Surgeon"" in the underground lexicon of the JeM module of medics accused of the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast and preparing coordinated terrorist strikes on six cities, investigators said.Investigators described Shaheen, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset. Seized digital evidence, handwritten diaries and planning notes - now central to the case - describe a plan for a Dec 6 strike aimed at ""avenging"" the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition The papers outline ""D-6 Mission"", target lists, recruitment pitches, fund movements and secure communication protocols. Investigators also identified roles assigned to Kashmiri doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Umar Un Nabi, alongside Shaheen, who allegedly joined a deeper JeM-backed structure in 2021.The probe has allegedly uncovered an Rs 20-lakh hawala channel routed through a JeM handler for operational use by Umar, Muzammil and Shaheen - money suspected to have funded recruitment, safe houses, secure phones and reconnaissance.Agencies have begun an audit of Shaheen's financial footprint, scrutinising every high-value transfer, cash withdrawal and unexplained deposit across her three Kanpur accounts, two Lucknow accounts and two Delhi accounts. The hunt: any tie to the foreign-funded module.Teams are also reconstructing Shaheen's movements in Kanpur, especially at GSVM Medical College, where she worked until her unexplained disappearance. Officials are collecting entry logs, duty rosters, visitor lists and details of where she stayed between Jan and Oct 2025. Colleagues remembered a soft-spoken doctor from Lucknow who rarely took leave, brought her young child to duty because there was ""no one at home"", and avoided speaking about her divorce. She lived in an L-Block campus residence, maintained cordial ties with women co-workers, and vanished in Dec 2013 after handing over HOD responsibilities, promising to return by Jan 4, 2014. She never did. For nearly a year, official letters went unanswered. In 2016, two staffers sent to her registered address found it incorrect. She was formally dismissed in 2021.Interrogations showed that in March 2022, the module travelled to Turkiye for a meeting with ISI handler Abu Ukasha, allegedly securing a ""green signal"" for the Dec 6 plan. The timeline under reconstruction spans 2010 ideological drift, 2015-16 induction into JeM circles, and structured planning from 2021 as part of a project backed by Pakistan-based handlers.A former GSVM staffer recalled her transformation beginning around 2010 after contact with an Indian-origin doctor abroad who shared ideological videos and literature. She soon adopted new attire, including a hijab, and repeatedly spoke of relocating overseas.According to officials, her ideological shift was unmistakable by 2021. When confronted by a relative about abandoning her marriage, job and family, she allegedly said: ""I have lived enough for myself. Now, it's time to repay the debt of my community.""","Investigators describe Dr Shaheen Shahid, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset.

India Sends Strong Warning To Pakistan As Army Chief Says The Real Movie Begins After Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday delivered a strong message to Pakistan and terror outfits operating from its soil, declaring that India’s recent counterterror offensive, Operation Sindoor , was “just a trailer” and that the country is fully prepared for future challenges.His clear warning to Pakistan comes days after a car blast in the vicinity of historical Red Fort in New Delhi.Addressing the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, the Army chief said India would deal equally with terrorists and those backing them. ""When a country encourages state-sponsored terrorism, it becomes a matter of concern for India. India talks about progress. If someone creates obstacles in our course, then we will have to take some action against them.""""When we talk about the new normal, we have said that talks and terror can't go together. All we are asking is to adopt a peaceful process, which we will cooperate with. Until then, we will treat terrorists and their sponsors alike. We will respond to those who encourage terrorists. Today, India is so accomplished that it is not scared of any blackmail attempts,"" he said.Speaking about Operation Sindoor, he added, ""Operation Sindoor was just a trailer which ended in 88 hours.We are prepared for any circumstances in future. If Pakistan gives a chance, we will teach it how to behave responsibly with a neighbouring nation...""The Army chief further noted that modern conflict requires coordination across several platforms, saying, ""In today's time, battles are multi-domain. We cannot say how long it will last. We have to ensure we have supplies to last long.""Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the Pakistan-backed Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which claimed 26 lives in Anantnag district, Jammu and Kashmir. India later launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, destroying multiple terror hubs and air bases across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The standoff eased only after Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations initiated talks for a peace agreement. However, India has maintained that the operation is in a paused state, not fully terminated, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi having warned that any future ""act of terror"" would be treated as an ""act of war.""","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi delivered a strong message to Pakistan and terror outfits operating from its soil.

The SR will involve mandatory house-to-house (H2H) verification but differs from the special intensive revision (SIR) in that it will not seek documentation from any elector to prove their eligibility to vote.The state poll machinery would ensure that every eligible person who fulfils the criteria under Article 326 of the Constitution - being a citizen of India, not less than 18 years, and an ordinary resident not disqualified under any law or of unsound mind - is included in the roll.As regards 'doubtful' voters, or 'D' voters - suspected illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, classified as such by EC in 1997, who remain on the rolls but are not allowed to vote - EC said their particulars will be carried forward to the draft electoral roll without any change. ""Any modification, including removal or deletion, shall be made only upon receipt of any order from the competent foreigner tribunal or an appropriate court of law,"" ordered the poll panel.The pre-revision activities for the SR exercise in Assam shall begin on Tuesday, followed by actual revision from Nov 22 to Dec 20. An integrated draft electoral roll will be published on Dec 27, followed by the filing of claims and objections from Dec 27 to Jan 22, 2026. These will be disposed of by Feb 2, and the final roll will be published on Feb 10.Explaining the rationale behind not ordering a SIR in Assam, a senior EC functionary said the legal criteria to determine citizenship, including the cutoff date, is different for Assam vis-a-vis the rest of the country. Also, while a national register of citizens (NRC) was prepared for Assam in 2019, the final data is yet to be published, and Supreme Court is seized of the matter. Conducting a SIR at this juncture would have led to a conflict between SIR and NRC data. In any case, over 10,000 citizenship challenges are still pending before foreigners tribunals, the functionary said.On use of the nomenclature ""special revision"" and not the usual ""annual or special summary revision"", the EC officer said that Section 21(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, terms any roll revision by EC with a different procedure as ""special"" revision. EC also avoided the term ""summary"" revision as it signifies a non-serious exercise not necessarily covering H2H verification. ""This exercise will require the mandatory three H2H visits by BLOs to get the forms signed by each elector,"" said the officer.During the field verification, BLOs will be given a pre-filled register listing the existing electors. They will collect information on voters who are dead, registered at multiple places or permanently shifted, as well as roll corrections in Statement 1, on unenrolled eligible citizens in Statement 2, and on prospective electors in Statement 3.","Assam due for assembly polls next year, with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date.

The suspension takes effect on November 22, 2025, from when Indian nationals will be required to obtain a visa to enter or transit through Iran.The move follows multiple incidents in which Indian nationals were allegedly lured to Iran on false job promises or assurances of onward travel to other countries.According to the MEA, several Indian nationals were deceived with fake job offers or promises of onward travel to third countries and were encouraged to use Iran’s visa-free entry to make the journey. Once they arrived, many were reportedly kidnapped for ransom.""The attention of Government has been drawn to several incidents of Indian nationals being lured to Iran on false promises of employment or with assurances of onward transit to third countries.

On arrival in Iran, many of them were kidnapped for ransom,"" the MEA said through a statement.In response, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has halted the visa-free entry provision to prevent further misuse.The MEA has strongly advised Indians planning to travel to Iran to ""remain vigilant"" and to avoid any agents offering visa-free entry or transit arrangements via Iran.Earlier this year, a 26-year-old man from Karala in northwest Delhi was reportedly kidnapped and held in Iran. The victim, Himanshu Mathur, was detained for a week and released after his family paid a ransom of Rs 20 lakh.Mathur was reportedly kidnapped and held in Iran after being lured with promises of a job and Australian work visa. He initially contacted Aman Rathi, who convinced him to complete a 15-day course in Noida and later arranged for him to travel to Jakarta and then Tehran. Instead of proceeding to Australia, Mathur and Rathi were abducted in Chabahar and held by a gang.In a separate case, a young man from Amritsar, who had hoped to move to the United Kingdom, reportedly fell victim to an international visa scam and was held hostage in Iran. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of Rs 50 lakh for his release. Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Granthgarh village in Ajnala Tehsil, had travelled to Iran on September 14, believing a UK visa would be arranged for him from there.","The suspension takes effect on November 22, 2025, from when Indian nationals will be required to obtain a visa to enter or transit through Iran. The move follows multiple incidents in which Indian nationals were allegedly lured to Iran on false job promises or assurances of onward travel to other countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125392228,imgsize-236865,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"
No Escape: Amit Shah warns culprits of Delhi blast — ‘Even from the depths of the netherworld’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-escape-amit-shah-warns-culprits-of-delhi-blast-even-from-the-depths-of-the-netherworld/articleshow/125390531.cms,"'Message to world': Amit Shah vows strictest punishment for Delhi Terror Attack culprits

NEW DELHI: Reiterating the “collective commitment” of the Narendra Modi government to eliminating terrorism from its root, home minister Amit Shah on Monday said culprits of the Nov 10 car bomb blast in Delhi shall be traced from the depths of the netherworld, produced before the judicial system and handed the strictest possible punishment.Addressing the 32nd meeting of the northern zonal council (NZC) in Faridabad, Haryana — attended by chief ministers, Lieutenant Governors and administrators of several northern states — Shah said the zonal councils, which are sub-groups of the Inter-State Council that meet from time to time to resolve inter-state and Centre-state issues, have played an important role in realising Prime Minister Modi’s vision of strong nation made up of strong states. These zonal councils, he underlined, are extremely important for dialogue, cooperation, coordination, and ‘policy synergy’.During the meeting, Shah, along with the chief ministers of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Rajasthan and Delhi; LGs of J&K, Delhi and Ladakh; and the administrator of Chandigarh, observed two minutes' silence as a tribute to the victims of the Delhi car bomb blast and the recent explosion at Nowgam police station in J&K.Emphasising the continued need for all-out efforts to ensure speedy justice in crimes against women and children and also eradicate malnutrition and stunting, Shah called for speedy investigation in cases of sexual offences and rape under the POCSO Act, besides seeking an increase in the number of fast-track special courts.Referring to the implementation of the three new criminal laws, the home minister said that their enforcement has yielded very positive results. He requested all the state/UT governments to employ technology to boost investigation and forensic analysis and achieve online linking of courts.The home minister said that while the original spirit and role of zonal councils is advisory, they have been accepted over the past decade as action-oriented platforms that have delivered results.Shah said that, as compared to 2004–2014, the number of zonal council meetings has risen two-and-a-half times from 25 in 2014 to 64 in 2025. He said this jump reflects “PM Modi’s concept of TEAM Bharat”. He credited the states, UTs, central ministries and departments and the Inter-State Council for having discussed 1,600 issues and resolving 1,303 issues (81.43%) thus far.Among the issues of national importance taken up by the northern zonal council on Monday are urban master planning, power supply system, strengthening of primary agricultural credit societies (PACSs), eliminating malnutrition in children, reducing school dropout rates, and participation of public hospitals in the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.","Home minister Amit Shah said culprits of the Nov 10 car bomb blast in Delhi shall be traced from the depths of the netherworld.

Space firm Dhruva to launch 1st commercial satellite on SpaxeX rocket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/space-firm-dhruva-to-launch-1st-commercial-satellite-on-spaxex-rocket/articleshow/123086937.cms,"Space firm Dhruva to launch 1st commercial satellite on SpaxeX rocket

BENGALURU: Indian spacetech firm Dhruva Space is set to launch its first commercial satellite mission, LEAP-1, in the third quarter of 2025 aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9.Confirming the development Monday, the firm said the mission brings together payloads from Australian firms Akula Tech and Esper Satellites, hosted on Dhruva’s indigenously developed P-30 satellite platform. It marks the Hyderabad-based company’s transition from technology demonstrator to full-fledged commercial player in the global Space market.“LEAP-1 mission will carry two payloads: Akula Tech’s Nexus-01, an artificial intelligence module for on-orbit data processing and re-training, and Esper Satellites’ OTR-2, a hyperspectral imaging system. Both are designed to support applications in defence, disaster response, agriculture, and environmental monitoring,” Dhruva said.Following its successful in-orbit qualification of the P-30 bus during the LEAP-TD mission on Isro’s PSLV-C58 in Jan 2024, Dhruva Space now expands into commercial operations. The mission will also include Ground Station-as-a-Service and real-time operations via the firm’s Integrated Space Operations & Command Suite (ISOCS).“This is a major milestone for us and for Indo-Australian collaboration in Space,” said Sanjay Nekkanti, CEO and Co-founder of Dhruva Space.“We are seeing increasing global traction from partners in Europe and Asia, and missions like LEAP-1 prove that affordable, scalable satellite solutions can come from India.”Akula Tech’s AI system aims to place autonomous, adaptive intelligence directly in orbit. “This launch will give flight heritage to five of our AI software products. It will allow AI/ML models to retrain onboard and provide real-time insights, effectively putting a geospatial analyst in Space,” Nishq Ravindranath, Chief AI Officer, said.Esper Satellites, launching its fourth mission, sees this as validation of its low-cost approach. “We’ve delivered an entire campaign for under $1 million,” said Co-founder Shoaib Iqbal. “That’s cutting-edge Earth Observation at a fraction of traditional costs.”Dhruva said that the LEAP-1 patch, revealed alongside the announcement, symbolises the strategic triad of India, Australia, and the United States—reflecting a broader shift in commercial Space collaboration.Dhruva Space, crediting early support from Isro, IN-SPACe, and the Australian Space Agency, whose engagement in 2022 helped build a long-term commercial bridge, said: “With interest now coming from firms in Italy and France, the LEAP programme is growing into a recurring platform for hosted payload missions. LEAP-1 is not just a technological deployment, it signals Dhruva’s entry into global Space services at scale. ”","Indian spacetech firm Dhruva Space is set to launch its first commercial satellite mission, LEAP-1, in the third quarter of 2025 aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Kamal Haasan advocated for education, terming it as a necessity to break the chains of ""dictatorship and Sanatan"". He warned against using any other means, emphasizing that without education, it's impossible to truly win, as ""majority fools"" could still make one lose.""Education is the only weapon that can break the chains of dictatorship and Sanatan,"" ANI quoted the Rajya Sabha MP saying on Sunday. He was addressing a gathering at the Agaram Foundation event in Chennai.""Don't take anything else in your hands, only education. We cannot win without it, because the majority can make you lose. Majority Fools (Moodargal) will make u lose; knowledge alone will seem defeated. That's why we must hold on to it (Education) firmly,"" he added.Earlier this year, Haasan had faced backlash for his remark on Kannada language during the promotion of his movie Thug Life, for which the actor refused to apologise. The move had attracted Karnataka HC's intervention for not issuing an apology.The Supreme Court then intervened and ruled that the Karnataka HC was wrong to demand an apology from Haasan over his Kannada remarks.","Rajya Sabha MP Kamal Haasan advocates for education, terming it as a necessity to break the chains of ""dictatorship and Sanatan"" He was addressing a gathering at the Agaram Foundation event in Chennai.

'Would you worship Bhagwa terrorist?': Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand says 'don't link terrorism with colour'; questions failure to find Malegaon blast culprits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/would-you-worship-bhagwa-terrorist-shankaracharya-avimukteshwaranand-says-dont-link-terrorism-with-colour-questions-failure-to-find-malegaon-blast-culprits/articleshow/123085236.cms,"Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand

NEW DELHI: The debate over the use of the term 'Saffron Terror', that resumed after the July 31 verdict in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, has refused to die down. Commenting on the term, Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati Maharaj said that colour should not be linked with terrorism. He said those who associate a colour with terrorism are supporting terrorism.The Shankaracharya said, ""A terrorist is a terrorist...What does colour mean with the word terrorism? Terrorism is terrorism, and a zero-tolerance policy should be adopted against it... The Malegaon blast happened, but you could not find the person who committed it...Those who look for colours in terrorism are supporters of terrorism.""The term 'Bhagwa Aatank' or 'saffron terrorism' was first used after the 2002 Gujarat riots, as per a report by the news agency ANI. It was later used again after the 2008 Malegaon blasts. Some political leaders and parties used the term in their statements. The term was also mentioned by then home minister P Chidambaram in an official meeting with police officials. Congress leader Digvijay Singh also used the term in reference to the blasts.The Hindu pontiff also raised questions as to why the government is still unable to catch the culprits of the Malegaon blast case. ""We do not wish to comment on the court’s proceedings; whatever was done in court, we believe, must have been correct. If these people were found innocent in the court’s view, then it is right they were acquitted. But the bigger problem is that the blast did not happen on its own — someone must have done it. Who was it? Where is the Government of India, the state government failing, that someone comes, carries out a blast, and leaves, and despite having vast resources and plenty of time, we are still unable to catch the culprit? This is a big slap on our capability that we cannot apprehend the guilty,"" he said.On July 31, a special NIA court in Mumbai acquitted all seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case. The court said that the prosecution could not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. The court also directed the Maharashtra government to pay Rs 2 lakh compensation to the families of the people who died in the blast, and Rs 50,000 to those who were injured.The seven accused were former MP Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, Ajay Rahirkar, Sudhankar Dhar Dwivedi (also known as Shankaracharya), and Sameer Kulkarni.""All bail bonds of the accused are cancelled and sureties are discharged,"" the court said.The court examined 323 witnesses from the prosecution and eight from the defence before giving the verdict. All seven were acquitted of charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the Arms Act, and other related charges.The blast occurred on September 29, 2008, near a mosque in Bhikku Chowk area of Malegaon. An explosive device placed on a motorcycle went off, killing six people and injuring 95 others. Initially, 11 people were named as accused, but charges were framed against seven.The lawyer representing the victims’ families has said that he will challenge the acquittal in the high court.Earlier, on the eve of the judgment in the Malegaon blast case, Union home minister Amit Shah had said in Parliament that no Hindu can ever be a terrorist. ""I am proud to say, no Hindu can ever be a terrorist,"" Shah had said in Rajya Sabha.Meanwhile, after the NIA court judgment, former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan also spoke on the matter last week and said that he does not support the use of the term ""saffron terror."" ""Don’t use the term 'Saffron terrorism'. If you want to describe such acts, use 'Hindu fundamentalist' or 'Hindu terrorism' instead.""",Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati Maharaj said that colour should not be linked with terrorism. He said those who associate a colour with terrorism are supporting terrorism. The term 'Bhagwa Aatank' or'saffron terrorism' was first used after the 2002 Gujarat riots.

I don't know that sanctions bother him,"" he added.While talking with reporters, Trump said that in both the countries Russia and Ukraine a lot of people are being killed. He claimed that in Ukraine the number of deaths are lower than Russia.""Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed. They had a number that just came out that a tremendous number of Russian soldiers are being killed. And likewise Ukraine, a lower number, but still thousands and thousands of people. And now we're adding towns where they're being hit by missiles. So it's a lot of people being killed in that ridiculous war,"" Trump said.Trump again took the credit for stopping the war between India and Pakistan which Indian officials have already denied in all the public platforms.However, Trump seems to stick to his claims. He not only took the credit for India-Pakistan war, but also said that he stopped Cambodia Thailand, and Congo-Rwanada.""And, you know, we stopped. We stopped a lot of countries from war. India and Pakistan, we stopped a lot of countries. And we're going to get that one stopped, too, somehow. We're going to get that one stop. That's a really horrible war. You heard about Cambodia and Thailand. We got that one done. We got the Congo, which was going on for 31 years. Rwanda, that one's done. We stopped a lot of wars,"" Trump said.""This is the one we seem to be mission be the easiest to stop. And it's not. I mean, Rwanda and Congo were going on 31 years, and I got it stopped. Eight million people dead. At least that's what they have. But I think the number is much higher. And the leaders of each country, Rwanda and the Congo, they were great. They were great and they wanted it stopped. 31 years it went on. We stopped a lot of wars. Serbia, Kosovo was going to be happening, and I don't believe it will now. So we stopped. That would do,"" he added.Since May 10, Trump has claimed multiple times that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire after US-mediated talks. However, officials have firmly denied any US involvement in the recent ceasefire.Even in the Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar refuted Trump's claims and said that there was no foreign mediation.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested a new way for Russia to avoid the sanctions, and that is to get a deal ""where people stop getting killed"" Trump again took the credit for stopping the war between India and Pakistan which Indian officials have already denied in all the public platforms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123085075,imgsize-35076,width-400,resizemode-4/123085075.jpg"

According to Forbes, nine out of these ten billionaires are American, showcasing the dominance of the US in wealth creation, while Bernard Arnault represents Europe’s luxury empire. From Elon Musk’s space ambitions to Jeff Bezos’s e-commerce revolution and Warren Buffett’s legendary investing style, their wealth-building stories are remarkable examples of vision, execution, philanthropy, and global impact. They influence policies, drive innovation, create jobs, and set trends in markets worldwide. Check the full updated list of the world’s top 10 billionaires influencing markets, industries, and future innovations.Elon Musk stands as the world’s richest individual, owing his fortune to groundbreaking ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. He holds about 12% of Tesla, the electric car pioneer valued at hundreds of billions, and owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, a leader in commercial space technology.Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter (renamed X) for $44 billion further solidified his influence in social media and AI-driven communication. Known for his ambitious projects, such as Neuralink and The Boring Company, Musk’s vision revolves around sustainable energy, interplanetary travel, and integrating AI into human life.Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corporation, built one of the most successful software companies in the world, specializing in databases and enterprise solutions. He owns 40% of Oracle’s shares, which drive most of his wealth. In addition to technology, Ellison is known for his real estate ventures, most notably his purchase of 98% of Lanai Island in Hawaii for $300 million. A board member at Tesla until 2022, Ellison continues to influence the tech industry with his investments and strategic vision. His lifestyle and property holdings place him among the wealthiest tech moguls globally.Jeff Bezos revolutionized retail through Amazon, transforming it from a humble online bookstore into a global e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2021, Bezos retains significant wealth with a 9% stake in Amazon and ownership of Blue Origin, a space exploration company. Recently, he married Lauren Sánchez, marking a new personal chapter. Bezos also focuses on philanthropy, investing in climate change initiatives and education. His success story is a prime example of how innovation and risk-taking can create unprecedented wealth.Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, a social media platform that became an integral part of global communication.

His leadership and strategic direction have positioned Nvidia as one of the most valuable tech companies, crucial to the growth of AI and cloud computing industries.Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), oversees more than 70 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora. He is the only non-American on this list, representing the luxury fashion and goods sector. Arnault’s five children also play active roles in the family business, ensuring continuity in leadership. His fortune showcases how luxury goods and global branding can rival tech industry wealth.Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company during his tenure (2000–2014), significantly expanding its software and enterprise services portfolio.

Poll Do you agree with R Ashwin's criticism of Shubman Gill's captaincy? Yes, he lacks experience. No, he will improve over time. Partially, he needs to adapt. Not sure.

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Bad light and subsequent rain forced stumps to be called early on Day 4 of the fifth Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy Test at The Oval on Sunday. With the stage set for a thrilling Day 5, England need just 35 more runs to win, while India require four wickets for a miraculous victory.""Coming back to the topic of spinners not being used, I have felt in this series that there has been a lack of game awareness and, in many ways, our tactical acumen — both on and off the field. This is the main reason why England are ahead in this series and India are behind. We haven't been the sharpest,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.“I feel Shubman Gill will get much better as a captain. He will learn. But sometimes, if you feel that you can play spin really well, you might not bring spinners into the attack. And when you miss the right moment to introduce spinners in these conditions, they become a defensive option,” he added.Rain forcing the match into the fifth day means every Test of the riveting five-match series has now gone into the final day. England looked all set to complete the chase of 374 on Day 4, thanks to Joe Root hitting his 39th Test century — 105 off 152 balls — paying a fitting tribute to Graham Thorpe.His fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook struck a stunning 111 off 98 balls — his tenth century in the longer format — and made the most of a crucial reprieve on 19, dropped by Mohammed Siraj. Root and Brook shared a brilliant counter-attacking stand of 195 runs, giving England real hope of completing their second-highest run chase of all time — and the highest ever at The Oval.“When Harry Brook started taking it on, after 20 runs, you could have brought on the spinner to choke the run flow. From the other end, a pacer could have bowled. With all this in mind, Washington Sundar could have been introduced earlier into the attack,” Ashwin said.“Making these mistakes creates a huge gap. We don’t know whether the message is going from outside to the middle. We don’t know what’s being discussed in the dressing room. But in today’s day and age, these mistakes can definitely be avoided,” he added.","Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Bad light and subsequent rain forced stumps to be called early on Day 4 of the fifth Test at The Oval. England need just 35 more runs to win, while India require four wickets for a miraculous victory.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123085607,imgsize-151790,width-400,resizemode-4/123085607.jpg"

Note:

August is often a busy month for students across India, filled with academic schedules, Independence Day activities, and mid-term assessments. But it also offers a series of public holidays and regional observances that can bring a much-needed pause.August stands out because it includes national celebrations like Independence Day, along with various state-specific observances and religious festivals. While some holidays are limited to specific regions or communities, others bring long weekends that are useful for both rest and preparation. Whether you're planning a study break, or simply catching up on assignments, here’s a list of school holidays in August 2025 to help you plan better.Here are the major holidays that apply across most schools in India:Raksha Bandhan is widely celebrated in northern and central India to honour the bond between siblings. Schools in many states, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, usually declare a holiday on this day.Observed mainly in West Bengal, Odisha, and parts of eastern India, Jhulan Purnima celebrates the divine swing festival of Radha and Krishna.Some regional schools may remain closed during this period.Independence Day is a national holiday across all Indian states. Most schools observe the occasion with flag hoisting and cultural programs, followed by a day off.Janmashtami, marking the birth of Lord Krishna, is a public holiday in many states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Depending on regional tradition, schools may declare a holiday either on August 16 or the preceding/following day.Onam is Kerala’s biggest harvest festival, celebrated with cultural events, pookalam (flower rangoli), and traditional feasts. Schools across Kerala typically remain closed for multiple days, especially around Thiruvonam, the festival’s main day.Ganesh Chaturthi is an official holiday in states like Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Telangana. Schools in these regions remain closed to allow students to participate in rituals, home celebrations, and public processions.In addition to national holidays, several region-specific observances may apply based on your state’s academic calendar or school board guidelines.Yes, students may get a long weekend from August 15 to 17 if schools remain closed on Saturday, August 16. Additionally, if your school observes Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami holidays in succession, you could see shorter study weeks during mid to late August.While holidays are ideal for rest, many students also use this time to revise, complete pending assignments, or prepare for upcoming exams. If you're in senior secondary classes, this could also be a good time to begin short-term courses, practice mock tests, or explore college options if you’re in Class 12.Younger students can use the break for hobby classes, reading, or short family trips, depending on how your school has scheduled internal assessments.Check with your school’s official holiday calendar or circular, as some private and state board schools may differ in observance dates based on local declarations or weekend policies.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

'Jaw broken, spine injured': SpiceJet staff attacked by Senior Army Official; Video Goes Viral

NEW DELHI: An Army official allegedly “grievously assaulted” four SpiceJet employees at Srinagar Airport on July 26, 2025, after they asked him to pay for excess cabin baggage he was carrying on a flight (SG 386) to Delhi. The airline says its staff members “suffered a spinal fracture and serious jaw injuries after being attacked with punches, repeated kicks and a queue stand.”The passenger, an army officer, “was carrying two pieces of cabin baggage weighing a total of 16 kg, more than double the permitted limit of 7 kg.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Sunday fact-checked Congress MP P Chidambaram 's allegations of voter shift and migrant inclusion in Tamil Nadu, calling them ""misleading and baseless.""Responding strongly to Chidambaram 's allegations, EC said, ""There is no need for political leaders to spread false information with respect to the SIR exercise being conducted by ECl at national level.""The poll agency added that such information is being ""deliberately peddled in the media with a view to obstruct the exercise.""""As far as voters who have permanently shifted from Bihar to other states and are ordinarily resident in those states, the exact figures can be known only after the SIR has been conducted,"" it added.""The Constitution of India read with RP Act 1950 envisages the Enrollment of voters with respect to the constituency in which they are ordinarily resident.

While 65 lakh voters are in danger of being disenfranchised in Bihar, reports of ""adding"" 6.5 lakh persons as voters in Tamil Nadu is alarming and patently illegal.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Sunday issued a notice to RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav after it was found that he allegedly has two different EPIC numbers, RAB0456228 and RAB2916120. It clarified that the EPIC number, RAB2916120, which the RJD leader mentioned in his press conference, was not officially issued and asked him to hand over the card for further investigation.Taking cognisance of his allegations, the ECI in its letter said, ""Upon verification, it was found that your name is recorded at serial number 416 of polling station no. 124 (located in the library building of Bihar Engineering University), and the EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) number is RAB0456228.""Also Read: 'This means he had two EPIC nos': BJP on Tejashwi Yadav's 'missing name' claim; asks did he have two voter IDs?

Operation Akhal: Indian Forces Gun Down Terrorist In Kulgam Amid Rising Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: The 'Janaza-Ghaib (funeral in absentia)' of Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir - a second confirmation that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 incident in which 26 civilians were killed.Videos and pictures posted on Telegram channels show the elderly of Khai Gala in Rawalkote gathering for the final prayers for the former Pakistan Army soldier and Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. But the funeral took an unexpected turn when local LeT commander Rizwan Hanif tried to be part of it. Tahir's family explicitly barred LeT members from attending the funeral but Hanif insisted, leading to a confrontation.Tahir's association with LeT and his role in the Pahalgam attack had made him a wanted category 'A' terrorist. His killing during Operation Mahadev in Srinagar last week along with two others was a major breakthrough for Indian security forces.During the funeral, a source said, ""Lashkar operatives threatened mourners with a gun, sparking outrage among villagers. The residents of Khai Gala, who have long been wary of radicalisation, are now planning a public boycott to oppose terror recruitment.""This development is significant as it not only highlights the growing resistance among POK residents against Pakistan's state-sponsored terror machine but also confirms that the impact of Operation Sindoor - conducted as a response to the Pahalgam attack - is being felt across the border.""A Lashkar commander facing public backlash and being forced to flee is a testament to the changing dynamics in the region,"" the source added.Tahir's past includes his association with the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) and the Student Liberation Front (SLF) before joining the Pakistan army. The Sadozai Pathan community, to which Tahir belonged, has a rich history of resistance, having migrated from Afghanistan in the 18th century and playing a key role in the Poonch Rebellion. This also led to Tahir getting the alias of 'Afghani' with which he was known in intelligence records.","Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

'Detonate It At Once’: Rajnath Singh Dares Rahul Gandhi Over 'Atom Bomb’ Vote Theft Claim

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , calling him 'anti-national' and accusing him of supporting only Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan, as reported by news agency PTI.Speaking to reporters during a election campaign meeting in the Bodoland Territorial Region, Sarma also claimed that the Congress party does ""not respect icons of Assam"", such as the Kamakhya temple and spiritual reformer Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva.""Rahul Gandhi is an anti-India person. He is only with Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslims. He is not with Indian Hindus, not even with Indian Muslims. Rahul Gandhi is an anti-national personality,"" Sarma alleged.He did not provide any specific reasons for labelling Rahul Gandhi, the current Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, as anti-national.Just days before, Rahul Gandhi had criticized CM Sarma during his visit to Guwahati. Speaking at a party event in Chaygaon, Gandhi accused the Assam chief minister of acting like a 'king' and predicted that he would eventually end up in jail due to corruption charges.“He thinks he is a ‘raja’, but he will not be in power for long.He will end up in jail — not because Congress wants it, but because the people of Assam will send him there for corruption.”In response, Sarma dismissed the allegations with a strong reply with words and a hand gesture ""Thenga"" during a late-night press briefing. He stated that unlike Gandhi, he is a true son of Assam, raised by its soil and people. He accused the Congress of being stuck in outdated thinking and added, “The joke is on him.”","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma called Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 'anti-national' Sarma accused Gandhi of supporting only Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan.

However, NMC’s ethics section has been rejecting all patient appeals claiming that the NMC Act prevails over the 2002 ethics regulation.The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions. Referring to this, the ethics section has been dismissing all appeals filed by patients claiming that only doctors can file an appeal, even though it is against the law.The NMC Act itself clearly states that “the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder”.Since the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 has not been replaced, it still stands. Clause 8.8 of the 2002 ethics regulation states: “Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council”.Yet, over 162 appeals of patients have been rejected by the NMC.In the reply to Parliament, minister of state for health Anupriya Patel stated that “to ensure that the NMC functions in a transparent and fair manner”, the central government appoints the chairperson and presidents of four autonomous boards as per the NMC Act 2019. However, there is no transparency as even the minutes of the meetings of the NMC and its autonomous boards are not available in the public domain as used to be the case with the erstwhile Medical Council of India. Moreover, all autonomous boards including the posts of presidents are currently almost entirely vacant with the government having failed to make appointments for over 10 months.The few minutes of commission’s meetings accessed using RTI show that most non-doctor ex-officio members hardly ever attend meetings and hence most decisions are taken by commission members, almost most of whom are doctors. Of the 33-member commission, about 20 are doctors.“I have complained to the health ministry and the law ministry by registered post about NMC rejecting patient appeals and hence I have proof. So, the health ministry cannot claim to have not received any complaints,” said Gokul Aneja, husband of a victim of alleged medical negligence, who appealed against the decision of the Punjab state medical council, only to have his appeal rejected twice.","The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday refused to comment on Rahul Gandhi ’s endorsement of US President Donald Trump ’s remark calling the Indian economy ""dead."" Tharoor said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha may have had his ""own reasons"" for saying so, but stressed that maintaining economic ties with the US is vital for India.When asked about Rahul Gandhi's statement, Tharoor said, ""I don't want to comment on what my party leader has said. He has his reasons for saying so. My concern is that our relationship with the US, as a strategic partnership and economic relationship, is important for us. We are exporting around 90 billion worth of goods to America. We can't be in a position to lose that or have it diminish significantly.""He added, ""We must wish our negotiators strength to get a fair deal for India. We should also be talking to other regions for exporting our goods. Then we could make up for some of what we might lose in the US. We have to support our negotiators.""Tharoor’s response came after Rahul Gandhi, on Thursday, agreed with Trump’s description of the Indian economy. Gandhi had said, ""Yes, he is right. Everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact. The entire world knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. BJP has finished the economy to help Adani. ""Trump had made the comment on Wednesday through his social media platform, Truth Social. In that post, he announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and warned of additional penalties in response to India importing oil from Russia.","'He Has His Reasons...': Shashi Tharoor Reacts To Rahul Gandhi's Remark On Trump Tariffs.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs.The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far.Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales.Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place.Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks.Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates.At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.","Government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' regulation isn't applicable to EVs.

Philippines eyes buying more defence equipment from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-eyes-buying-more-defence-equipment-from-india/articleshow/123082592.cms,".

NEW DELHI: As the Indian govt prepares to host Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, Manila has expressed interest in purchasing more defence equipment from India.Defence, security and maritime cooperation are among the key pillars of the relationship and will top the agenda of Marcos' bilateral engagement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, along with trade ties.Ahead of the president's visit, the chief of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Romeo Brawner, said the Philippines is looking to purchase more weapon systems from India, citing the quality and affordability of Indian defence equipment.Talking about the ongoing delivery of BrahMos cruise missiles to Manila, Brawner also said two sets of the India-Russia jointly developed missile systems will arrive in the Philippines in the next few years. The Philippines' maritime dispute in the South China Sea (SCS), or what Manila calls the West Philippine Sea, has seen it scaling up defence cooperation with countries like India and Japan to blunt Chinese aggression and ensure peace and stability in the contested waters.India will also join the Philippines this week for a joint patrol in the South China Sea. In the middle of its own border tensions with China, India in 2023 joined Manila in explicitly asking China to abide by a 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing's expansive claims over SCS waters.Modi and Marcos are also expected to discuss India's offer for concessional Line of Credit to meet Philippines' defence requirements, acquisition of naval assets, and expansion of training and joint exercises on maritime security.According to Manila, six agreements in a range of areas like science and technology, law and culture are expected to be signed.The Modi-Marcos meeting, however, takes place in the middle of efforts by both India and China to rebuild their relationship and it will be interesting to see how much play the South China Sea issue can get in the meeting. During Marcos' recent visit to the US, President Donald Trump reportedly told him he wouldn't mind if Manila got along with China.The two countries will also discuss efforts to enhance trade ties, as they both look to conclude a bilateral trade deal with the US to avoid getting caught in the cross hairs of Trump's trade war.While the US president has announced 25% tariffs on imports from India, he has slapped Manila with a 19% levy.Bilateral trade crossed $3 billion for the first time in 2022-2023 and the two sides have agreed to commence negotiations for a bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement.According to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), development cooperation is another crucial aspect of bilateral relationship.""India is implementing six Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) in the areas of agriculture, disaster risk reduction & management, health-care and livelihood support, in the Philippines, under an MoU on Indian Grant Assistance for the implementation of QIPs, signed on Feb 7, 2023,"" said an official.","Defence, security and maritime cooperation are among the key pillars of the relationship.

"Delay hits Scorpene retrofit to boost stealth, endurance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delay-hits-scorpene-retrofit-to-boost-stealth-endurance/articleshow/123082184.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has once again missed the boat to enhance the underwater operational endurance and stealth of its latest Scorpene or Kalvari-class conventional submarines, with the already delayed air independent propulsion (AIP) system developed by DRDO still not ready for integration with the vessels.The first Scorpene submarine to be built at the Mazagon Docks (MDL) with French collaboration, INS Kalvari, which was commissioned in Dec 2017, will now complete her ongoing maintenance refit at the Mumbai naval dockyard without being retrofitted with the AIP plug as was originally planned, defence ministry sources told TOI.""The fuel cell-based AIP system developed by DRDO's Naval Materials Research Lab, which has L&T as the prime industry partner, is still not yet operationally available. Hopefully, it should be ready by the time the second Scorpene (INS Khanderi) comes for her scheduled normal maintenance refit in mid-2026,"" a source said.The Navy after a long delay has inducted six diesel-electric Scorpene submarines, constructed by MDL in collaboration with the French Naval Group under Project-75 for over Rs 23,000 crore, with the sixth INS Vagsheer being commissioned in Jan this year.There is major concern about the continuing delay in the indigenous AIP project, which was originally slated for completion by June 2017 after being sanctioned in 2014 at an initial cost of Rs 270 crore.Amid the delay, MDL and Naval Group signed an agreement for the integration of the indigenous AIP energy system plugs on the Scorpenes only on July 23. Under it, each submarine will undergo a complex project called ""jumboisation"", involving precision cutting of the hull, safe insertion of the AIP plug and then rejoining the structure to ensure the vessel is fully operational again.Unlike nuclear-powered submarines, which have unlimited underwater endurance, diesel-electric boats must surface or snorkel every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries. Those fitted with AIP, however, can stay submerged for around two weeks to significantly boost their stealth and combat capabilities.With Pakistan on course to induct eight Yuan or Hangor-class conventional submarines with AIP from China in a major capability jump, India's depleting conventional underwater combat arm has become a major worry. China, of course, now has the world's largest navy, which includes over 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines.Apart from the six French-origin Scorpenes, India has seven very old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW diesel-electric submarines at present. It also has two operational SSBNs (nuclear-powered submarines armed with nuclear ballistic missiles) in INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, with the third to be commissioned as INS Aridhaman this year, as reported by TOI earlier.The long-pending projects to build three additional Scorpenes for Rs 38,000 crore and six new-generation diesel-electric submarines, with both AIP and land-attack cruise missiles, for Rs 70,000 crore under Project-75-India at MDL, are also yet to be finalised and inked.","India has inducted six diesel-electric Scorpene submarines, constructed by MDL in collaboration with the French Naval Group under Project-75 for over Rs 23,000 crore.

INDIA bloc planning march to EC office

NEW DELHI: As the month-long monsoon session of Parliament enters its third week on Monday, another round of deadlock is not ruled out even as the govt has no option but to seek passage of several crucial bills, amid opposition's determined bid to carry on with its protests over the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls.Opposition parties have been demanding a discussion on the SIR exercise, which the govt has rejected because it cannot make a reply on behalf of the Election Commission, an independent constitutional body not represented by any department. Besides, the govt has cited a ruling of former speaker Balram Jakhar that Parliament can't discuss the administrative work of constitutional bodies like EC.The govt is likely to remain firm on its stand and has more reasons for it as it will cite the ""double voter ID"" held by Bihar opposition leader, RJD's Tejashwi Yadav. Yadav had said that his name from the voters' roll had been omitted, a claim promptly rejected by EC, which disclosed the voter roll number and sought a reply from him for holding two EPIC cards.The govt's confidence to negate the opposition's claims has further grown as the analysis of SIR figures has shown no systematic targeting of Muslims. Figures released Friday also show that migrants have not been affected and the number of deletions in constituencies where BJP-led NDA candidates won is not higher than in those taken by the opposition 'Mahagathbandhan' in Bihar.With more reasons to assert that there are no irregularities in the SIR exercise, the govt is likely to push the passage of a key sports bill in Lok Sabha. The Lower House has listed the National Sports Governance Bill, which envisages greater transparency in the functioning of sports bodies, including BCCI, for consideration and passage.Rajya Sabha has listed for passage on Monday a resolution from home minister Amit Shah on the extension of President's Rule in Manipur by another six months with effect from Aug 13.Except for a two-day discussion on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor in both the Houses, parliamentary proceedings have been all but a washout since the session began on July 21 as the SIR has ignited vociferous protests from opposition parties.INDIA bloc, which has in previous sessions often spoken in different voices, has joined ranks over the issue, alleging that EC's exercise is aimed at removing voters sympathetic to its agenda and boosting the prospects of NDA.EC has said it will roll out the exercise nationally to ""protect"" the integrity of electoral rolls to ensure only eligible voters are allowed to cast votes. However, leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi has accused EC of ""vote chori (stealing votes)"" and has been fiercely critical of the poll body. EC in a statement Saturday rejected Rahul's allegations as ""baseless"", ""unsubstantiated"" and ""misleading"".INDIA bloc is mulling a march to the EC office on Friday to protest the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and the exercise being planned nationally. The march, if finalised, would come a day after the opposition alliance meets for a dinner discussion on Thursday. The meeting has been called to discuss the Bihar SIR exercise, but Rahul Gandhi may give a presentation to allies on the “deep dive” in a sample seat — Bangalore rural LS — that Congress has done which, he claimed, has unearthed irregularities in the voters’ list. He has called it the modus operandi of how voters’ lists are being manipulated all over states.",The month-long monsoon session of Parliament enters its third week on Monday.

NEW DELHI: The opposition may field a strong ""ideological"" face as candidate in the vice-presidential election, as it looks to portray a strong contrast with the governing BJP's nominee to send out a political message across the country.Ahead of discussions on picking a candidate, it is felt that since winnability is an uphill task due to opposition's weaker numerical strength in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, INDIA bloc should use the vice-president (VP) contest to send out an unambiguous signal to its core constituencies of marginalised sections, including backwards and minorities, farmers, and intellectuals and the civil society.INDIA bloc is scheduled to meet Thursday (Aug 7), where Bihar assembly election is likely to be an issue as also the special intensive revision of the state's electoral rolls. The meeting, sources said, may also initiate a preliminary discussion on the likely candidate for the VP polls.At the meet, Rahul Gandhi may give a presentation on Congress 's ""research"" on voters' lists which he has said proves beyond doubt that the rolls are being tampered with to help BJP.The VP election has come prematurely after the controversial resignation by Jagdeep Dhankhar last month following an alleged confrontation with the govt over his decision to accept the notices to remove Justices Shekhar Yadav and Yashwant Varma.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge Saturday alleged that Dhankhar was biased against the opposition, but he took one independent decision and it led to his downfall, as he accused the Modi govt of pressuring constitutional authorities.The opposition has been accusing the governing BJP of attacking constitutional values, secularism, fair elections, marginalised sections, besides weakening the economy and endangering the future of the youth. Some feel that an ideal VP candidate from the opposition camp should be able to represent these issues and send out a strong message.Such a move by the opposition, insiders argue, will hammer home the ideological distinction between BJP and the opposition parties, and help rally the base as the latter looks to build upon its gains in the 2024 LS polls.However, ensuring unity with a consensus candidate will also be a challenge for the opposition camp, where many partners compete against each other and are antagonistic.In the first vice presidential election held after BJP assumed office in 2014, Congress and opposition had fielded Mahatma Gandhi's grandson and known intellectual Gopal Krishna Gandhi to take on BJP's M Venkaiah Naidu in 2017. However, when the opposition witnessed fissures in its ranks in 2022, there was a paucity of candidates and Congress was forced to field a party leader in Margaret Alva to take on BJP candidate Dhankhar.","Opposition may field a strong ""ideological"" face as candidate in the vice- presidential election.

Tejashwi Yadav's 'Name Missing' From Bihar Draft List Claim Prompts Forgery Probe By EC

‘EPIC cited by Tejashwi not used in 10 yrs’

NEW DELHI: A day after top RJD functionary Tejashwi Prasad Yadav claimed that a search of Bihar's draft electoral roll with his EPIC No. RAB2916120 had found his name missing, only to be ""fact-checked"" by the Election Commission that his name and actual EPIC No. RAB0456228 were very much included in the voter list, the poll panel on Sunday said it had failed to find any EPIC No. RAB2916120 issued by its authorised officers in its records.On Sunday, the electoral registration officer (ERO) concerned wrote to Tejashwi, saying that upon preliminary investigation, it appears that EPIC No. RAB2916120 flashed by him at a press conference in Patna on Saturday was not officially issued. The ERO asked the RJD scion to share the the EPIC card he cited at the press conference in original for a ""thorough investigation"".If found to be fake, there may be legal consequences, including an FIR.Sources told TOI that Tejashwi has been using EPIC No. RAB0456228 issued to him on March 18, 2014, which also appears in the latest draft electoral roll. It was this valid EPIC No. that he cited in his nomination papers/affidavit filed during the 2015 and 2020 assembly polls in Bihar.EPIC No. RAB2916120, which Tejashwi Yadav cited as ‘missing’ on Saturday, has not been used by him, at least for the past 10 years, said an EC source.In another case, EC has found that CPI(ML) Liberation MP Sudama Prasad’s wife Shobha Devi was registered as an elector from two different assembly constituencies (ACs) in Arrah, Bihar. The Left party is one of petitioners in the special intensive revision (SIR) case being heard by Supreme Court.Devi, as per documents seen by TOI, was registered with EPIC No. RGX3264140 at Lavarish Seva Kendra polling station in Arrah AC and under EPIC No. WVA0308544 at Samudayik Bhawan polling station in Agiaon AC.

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump once again on Sunday repeated his claims of brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, along with ending several other global conflicts.In post on Truth Social, Trump responded to radio host and author Charlamagne Tha God saying the host knew “nothing” about his achievements, including “just ending 5 Wars, including a 31 year bloodbath between Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, where Seven Million people have died, and there was no end in sight.”Trump added, “He didn’t know that, or India and Pakistan or, wiping out Iran’s nuclear capabilities, or closing the horrendous open Border, or creating the greatest economy.”Speaking to Newsmax a day earlier, Trump claimed to have “settled a lot of wars,” including India and Pakistan.“One of the wars—India, Pakistan, nuclear,” he said. He also cited conflicts in Thailand and Cambodia, and Congo and Rwanda, saying many were resolved through trade pressure, reported PTI.“I said ‘listen, you guys are going to fight. You can fight all you want. I mean, just fight your hearts out. But we’re not doing a trade deal’.All of a sudden they end up not doing a war.”Trump added, “I settled a lot of wars. I think I settled averaging about a war a month. But, you know, we’re saving millions of lives.”Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt supported Trump’s claim, saying he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. “Trump has now ended conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia,” she said at a briefing.She claimed Trump has “brokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month” in his six months in office.Since May 10, Trump has claimed multiple times that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire after US-mediated talks.However, officials have firmly denied any US involvement in the recent ceasefire. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Parliament that no foreign leader urged India to stop Operation Sindoor, launched in response to the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said there was “no third-party intervention” and dismissed any link between the ceasefire and trade.“Prime Minister Modi and Trump did not have any phone calls between April 22, when the Pahalgam terror attack took place, and June 16,” Jaishankar said in the Rajya Sabha as quoted by PTI.","US President Donald Trump claims to have brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

An 80-year-old Agra-born adventurer-cum-businessman, Arvinder ‘Arvi’ Singh Bahal, lifted off to the edge of space aboard Blue Origin’s NS-34 mission along with five other crew members on Sunday. The suborbital flight lifted off from the company’s Launch Site One in West Texas at 6:00 p.m. IST, marking another milestone in private human spaceflight.Bahal was part of Blue Origin’s 14th human flight to suborbital space. The flight, lasting 11 minutes, carried a six-member crew to the Kármán line — the internationally recognised boundary that separates Earth's atmosphere from space. Bahal was accompanied by tech entrepreneur Justin Sun, Turkish businessman Gokhan Erdem, Puerto Rican meteorologist Deborah Martorell, British teacher Lionel Pitchford and venture capitalist JD Russell.Describing Bahal, Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin wrote, “Arvi is a real estate investor born in Agra, India, and now a naturalised US citizen. A lifelong traveler and adventurer, Arvi has visited every country in the world, the North and South poles, and skydived Mount Everest and the Pyramids of Giza”. The 80-year-old holds a private pilot’s licence and also flies helicopters.The India-born adventurer lives in Beverly, Massachusetts and has been a naturalised US citizen since 1979.Bahal, who grew up near the Taj Mahal, had joined the National Defence Academy in 1962 but left due to a polo accident that caused him partial hearing loss. Later, he worked on a Scottish-owned tea plantation in Darjeeling for nearly four years. By 1970, he ventured into the garment manufacturing business near Delhi. He later migrated to the US.Besides setting up Bahal Properties — a real estate company he has led since 1975, Bahal has built successful ventures in fashion, sportswear and hospitality over the past 45 years. He recently wrote his first book, Tireless Traveler, and plans to write many more travel books.","Arvinder ‘Arvi’ Singh Bahal was part of Blue Origin’s 14th human flight to suborbital space.

NEW DELHI: A charter aircraft flying Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma from Delhi to Phalodi on last Thursday (July 31) landed on a “wrong” airstrip at its destination. While the Falcon 2000 was to land at Phalodi Air Force Station, it landed at a civil airstrip of the city. Sources say the pilots realised their mistake and then took off from the civil airstrip to land the jet at the IAF station. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing this case and has taken the pilots off flying duty pending investigation.“The CM flew from Delhi to Phalodi on July 31 at 3 pm. The aircraft landed at the civil airstrip in Phalodi. The pilots immediately took off from the wrong airstrip and then landed at the Phalodi IAF station, which was the scheduled airport for it and about 5 km away from the former. The CM alighted there and a couple of hours later flew the aircraft to Jaipur. The Falcon 2000 then flew back to Delhi the same night,” said people in the know.The charter company filed a voluntary report on the “wrong airport landing incident” with the DGCA. The civil airstrip and the IAF station in Phalodi are about 5 km apart and both the facilities have similar geographical positioning. “Both the runways have similar orientation and visual characteristics.The flight crew misidentified the intended runway during approach. Seemingly there was inadequate pre-flight briefing about the presence of two airfields in close vicinity. Pilots must get proper pre-flight briefing and that is something operators need to work on to ensure such things don’t happen,” say sources. The Dassault Falcon 2000 is a French business jet that can carry 8-10 passengers with a range of upto 6,000 km.This case has raised concern as an aircraft supposed to land at the civil airstrip by mistake entering the restricted military airspace could have legal and safety consequences. “The civil airstrip may not support the aircraft’s weight category, compromising landing safety. Also, military-civil coordination may be lacking during such mis-landings, increasing response time for corrective action,” they add.The headquarters for the eponymous district, Phalodi is also called the “salt city” due to the salt industry in Rin. Phalodi is in the buffer zone of Thar Desert and close to Bikaner, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer.",Charter aircraft flying Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma from Delhi to Phalodi landed on a “wrong’ airstrip at its destination.

HAL & critics slugfest over continued ALH grounding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hal-critics-slugfest-over-continued-alh-grounding/articleshow/120222734.cms,"330 `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs)

NEW DELHI: Amid the continuing grounding of 330 `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) after a crash three months ago, which has hit operations in the armed forces, Hindustan Aeronautics on Friday publicly lashed out at some serving military officers, former pilots, “so-called defence analysts” and “arm-chair critics” for spreading “malicious” and “speculative” narratives on the indigenous 5.5-tonne chopper.“These stories are written without offering HAL’s perspective, and arguments are one-sided and biased. HAL would like to reiterate it’s working with all its customers including IAF and is confident of handling the critical issues that are innate to the defence aeronautics and complex flying platforms,” the defence PSU said, in a statement.Critics, in turn, were quick to respond and demand complete transparency on flight safety issues . “The interests of your (HAL) stakeholders are best served if you welcome criticism, work with greater transparency, stop shooting messengers and hallucinating about malafide intent. Your worst critic is not your enemy; just as a sycophant is not your best friend. Learn to differentiate,” former naval aviator and test pilot Commander K P Sanjeev Kumar (retd) said.HAL has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters as well as the grounding of all the twin-engine ALHs, designed and produced by the PSU, since the crash in Porbandar on Jan 5.As was first reported by TOI, the armed forces had immediately suspended flying operations of all their 330 ALHs after the crash, in which the two Coast Guard pilots and a diver were killed, to ensure proper safety checks. HAL is yet to conclusively establish what led to the “swashplate fracture” in the ill-fated helicopter that made the pilots lose control of the machine.","HAL has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters.

Eid congregation was moved to Red Road in 1919: Judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eid-congregation-was-moved-to-red-road-in-1919-judge/articleshow/120222675.cms,"Eid congregation was shifted from Shahid Minar to Red Road back in 1919, when Shahid Minar got waterlogged, Justice Tirthankar Ghosh said.The judge wanted to know whether a Hanuman Chalisa recital had ever been organised on Red Road. ""The main thrust of your argument is that permission was given to another community, and hence it should be given to you,"" Justice Ghosh told the petitioner's counsel. Advocate general Kishore Datta pointed out that the puja carnival was part of National List of Heritage Programmes and linked to a festival with a Unesco heritage tag .He cited a 1994 SC judgment in which it said permission to organise prayers in a public place was subject to the site's religious significance. ""I do not have the right to worship or offer prayers at any and every place. The petitioner must show that the place has religious significance integral to the religion,"" Datta said.When counsel for the petitioner next moved division bench of Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice Chaitali Chatterjee (Das), the former initially declined to admit the plea. ""I don't want to hear petitions on Hanuman Jayanti and Ram Navami anymore,"" Chief Justice Sivagnanam said.Although the organisation was allowed to file the petition, the division bench declined to overrule the single judge bench's order. ""For establishment of a right to hold any religious practice at a public place for the first time, the right has to be established before the court of law through the exchange of affidavits,"" Justice Ghosh said.The bench kept the matter open for adjudication and directed that it be included in the list of cases slated for July.","Eid congregation was shifted from Shahid Minar to Red Road back in 1919, Justice Tirthankar Ghosh said.

NEW DELHI: IMD expects the relief from heat to continue on Saturday as well, after a powerful thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit Delhi on Friday evening, disrupting flights, traffic, and power supply while offering a sharp drop in temperature.The storm caused widespread disruption—grounding flights, toppling trees, cutting power lines, and jamming traffic across several parts of the capital. At the airport, 35 incoming flights were diverted and more than 100 others delayed as air traffic control halted operations for nearly 30 minutes.Roads were no better. Uprooted trees choked busy stretches like Mathura Road, Lodhi Road, Janakpuri, Okhla, Najafgarh and Dwarka, with vehicles damaged in some areas, including one incident in Janakpuri where a van was crushed by a fallen tree. NDMC and MCD received numerous complaints about trees being brought down across areas such as Jor Bagh, Hanuman Road, Mohan Singh Place, and Shahdara.Wind speeds varied across the city—touching 84 kmph in southwest Delhi, 74 kmph near IGI Airport, and 70 kmph at Pragati Maidan. Weather stations recorded light showers: 5mm in Narela and 2.5mm in Pitampura.The storm brought down the maximum temperature at Safdarjung from 39.6°C on Thursday to 35.8°C on Friday, while Lodhi Road saw a sharp dip from 31°C to 24°C in just 30 minutes post 6.15pm.According to IMD scientists, the thunderstorm was triggered by a western disturbance that caused dry mid-level winds to collide with moist lower-level winds from the Arabian Sea—a perfect recipe for thunderstorm formation.Power supply was hit in several areas after tree branches damaged power lines. BSES and Tata Power-DDL said their teams were deployed promptly to restore electricity, with some delays in areas like Narela, Bawana, Badli, and Mangolpuri due to safety concerns.In Gurgaon, a gantry on the Dwarka Expressway collapsed during the storm, landing on a moving car. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries or damage. The structure was quickly removed, and traffic has since resumed.","Thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit Delhi on Friday evening.

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Rana (64), one of the main plotters of the 26/11 Mumbai attack , is being kept on "" suicide watch "" in a highly secure cell within National Investigation Agency (NIA) headquarters here after a special court granted his 18-day custody to the anti-terror agency.The Pakistani-Canadian, who was brought here on Thursday evening following his extradition from the US, is under 24/7 human and CCTV surveillance. The NIA HQ on Lodhi Road has been blanketed in multi-layered security. ""Rana has been kept in a 14x14 cell on the ground floor. He will be allowed only a soft-tip pen to write so that he can't harm himself,"" a source said.On Friday, NIA began questioning Rana to unravel the larger conspiracy behind the terror strike. The interrogation is likely to focus on, besides his connection with ISI, involvement with sleeper cells in India, particularly those linked to his associate, David Coleman Headley , alias Daood Gilani. Headley is suspected to have recruited sleeper cells in Pushkar, Goa, Delhi and other places, sources said.On a day Mumbai terror attack accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana was extradited from the US to India, Congress said Modi govt did not initiate the process and in fact benefited from the ""mature, consistent and strategic diplomacy"" that began under UPA.In a statement, former union minister P Chidambaram said that ""while Modi govt is rushing to take credit for this development, the truth is far from their spin.""""This extradition is not the result of any grandstanding, it is a testament to what the Indian state can achieve when diplomacy, law enforcement, and international cooperation are pursued sincerely and without any kind of chest-thumping,"" Chidambaram said. He added, ""It is the culmination of a decade-and-a-half of painstaking diplomatic, legal and intelligence efforts initiatedby UPA govt in close coordination with the US.""""The coursework began on Nov 11, 2009, when NIA registered a case in New Delhi against David Coleman Headley (US citizen), Rana (Canadian citizen), and others involved in the 26/11 conspiracy. Canada's foreign minister confirmed collaboration with Indian agencies, thanks to UPA's effective foreign policy,"" he said.In 2012, external affairs minister Salman Khurshid and foreign secretary Ranjan Mathai took up the matter of Headley's and Rana's extradition with US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and under secretary Wendy Sherman, , which Chidambaram called a ""textbook example"" of handling international justice through diplomacy.Even after the change in govt in 2014, it was the institutional efforts already in motion that kept the case alive, he added. Chidambaram said that in Feb 2025, PM Modi and US President Trump "" tried to take credit for what was essentially the result of years of UPA-era groundwork"".","Tahawwur Rana (64), one of the main plotters of the 26/11 Mumbai attack, is being kept on "" suicide watch "" in a highly secure cell within National Investigation Agency (NIA) headquarters.

Visuals from the area showed flames and smoke billowing from burning vehicles as security forces were deployed to restore order.The Bengal Police said the situation in the Suti and Samserganj areas of Jangipur was now “under control”. Security has been heightened, and large contingents of police have been stationed in sensitive pockets of the district.The latest unrest follows violent protests on Tuesday at Umarpur in the same district, where nine people, including four policemen, were injured during clashes. Protesters, who had blocked NH-12 in Jangipur demanding withdrawal of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, pelted stones at the police and set two police vehicles ablaze. “Strict action will be taken against those who resorted to violence. Legal action will be initiated against rumour mongers trying to spread misinformation,” the police had said in a statement.Prohibitory orders remain in force around the Raghunathganj and Suti police station areas, with internet services suspended in Jangipur subdivision to curb the spread of rumours. “The situation is calm, peaceful and under control. There has not been a single untoward incident. Prohibitory orders will remain in place till 6 pm on April 10 (Thursday), and the internet suspension will continue till 6 pm on April 11 (Friday),” said a senior officer.Governor C V Ananda Bose condemned the violence and demanded accountability from the state government. “Attempts to disturb the law and order situation should be put down with an iron hand. The peaceful passage of Ram Navami festivities shows the camaraderie among the people of Bengal and the competence of the administration. Any attempt to frustrate that needs to be curbed,” he said.However, the state government faced criticism from multiple quarters. Mass education minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury said, “Even during the Left rule, police never baton-charged minorities. If someone has resorted to violence, action must be taken. But resorting to lathi charge on a rally is unacceptable.”The BJP accused Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of failing to maintain law and order. “West Bengal, once safeguarded by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, is now bleeding under Mamata Banerjee,” said state BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar, labelling her “India’s most failed CM”.The Waqf (Amendment) Act, which triggered the protests, was passed by the parliament last week.","The Bengal Police said the situation in the Suti and Samserganj areas of Jangipur was now “under control’ The latest unrest follows violent protests on Tuesday at Umarpur in the same district, where nine people, including four policemen, were injured.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120222547,imgsize-5068198,width-400,resizemode-4/Watch-Vehicles-torched-security-stepped-up-as-Waqf-Act-protest-turns-violent-in-Bengals-Murshidabad.jpg"

The comments came amid confirmation that key members of Trump team - Vice-President J D Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz - would visit Delhi.Although the visit of Vance and his Indian-origin wife Usha was planned a few weeks ago, his arrival, likely on April 21, has taken on a different dimension, given Trump's tariff offensive. India would expect Vance, though he is himself a tariff warrior, to smoothen the wrinkles which may be holding up progress in talks.While PM Modi is expected to host Vance and his family for a meal, his visit is said to be mainly private in nature. He's expected to visit Agra and Jaipur. Waltz, who will travel to India around the same time to participate in India-US Forum organised by Ananta Centre, is expected to hold talks with NSA Ajit Doval and foreign minister S Jaishankar.

"La Nina over, India unlikely to see drought or extreme rain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/la-nina-over-india-unlikely-to-see-drought-or-extreme-rain/articleshow/120221899.cms,"NEW DELHI: La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in India have ended, the US govt agencies declared late Thursday, with the world’s largest ocean likely to stay in ‘neutral’ phase till winter. This could be good news for India’s monsoon, as it reduces the probability of drought or excess rainfall in the season, but it’s also likely to make monsoon forecasts trickier, experts said.Adding to the difficulty of forecasters, conditions in the Indian Ocean too are likely to be ‘neutral’ till at least Aug, as per the latest Australian weather bureau update. Along with the Pacific, surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean play a major role in India’s monsoon, with the ocean’s ‘positive’ phase — when waters in western Indian Ocean are warmer than those in the east — generally boosting rains.For the Pacific, the US’s Climate Prediction Center said in a release that there was more than a 50% chance that neutral conditions will stay till Sept. Its probability of persisting till the year-end was also higher than those of La Nina or El Nino, it said.If this forecast holds true, this would be the first time in 12 years that the monsoon peri od, or the months immediately preceding or following it, won’t have presence of either El Nino or La Nina. These two opposite Pacific Ocean conditions are seen as most important among large scale weather features that determine how much rain India gets during the June-Sept period.“When Pacific Ocean conditions are neutral, all scenarios are open for the Indian monsoon. However, the chances of a drought or a flood year are small. Generally, under neutral Pacific conditions, we don’t expect unwanted monsoon outcomes,” said M Rajee van, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.During neutral conditions in the Pacific, also known as ENSO neutral phase , surface water temperatures in the ocean’s eastern and central equatorial regions are neither abnormally warm (El Nino conditions, which weaken Indian monsoon) nor too cool (La Nina). While this is said to be the ocean’s natural state, neutral years aren’t that common.“Monsoon is more difficult to predict under such conditions. Forecasters have to be more careful and look closely into factors such as the state of the Atlantic Ocean. Internal dynamics can also play a role,” said Rajeevan, who is also IMD’s former monsoon forecaster.As per the first monsoon forecast this year, made by private agency Skymet, total monsoon rainfall in India is likely to be 103% of the long period average, at the higher end of the normal range.","La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in India have ended.

All our trade talks are progressing well, in the spirit of India First, and to ensure our pathway to Viksit Bharat @ 2047 in the Amrit Kaal,"" Goyal said speaking on the sidelines of the Italy-India business, science and technology forum.""We never negotiate at gunpoint. Favourable time constraints motivate us for quicker talks, but till the time we are not able to secure the interest of our country and our people, we do not hurry,"" he added.Donald Trump had, on Wednesday, announced a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition including 26% on India, except China.""Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers , Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump had declared.""Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,"" he said, exempting China from the pause period.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar remarked that India's trade negotiations were quite complex, noting that the United States had high expectations and the global environment has changed significantly compared to a year ago.""This time around, we are certainly geared up for a very high degree of urgency. I mean, we see a window. We want to see stuff. So our trade deals are really challenging. And we are really, when I look at the trade deals, I mean it's not my direct credit, but we have a lot to do with each other. I mean, these are people very much on top of their game, very ambitious about what they want to achieve,"" he said.""We talked for four years during the first Trump administration. They have their view of us, and frankly, we have our view of them. The bottom line is that they didn't get that. So if you look at the EU, often people say we've been negotiating for 30 years, which is not entirely true because we had big blocks of time and nobody was even talking to each other. But they have tended to be very protracted processes,"" he added.India is taking a measured approach to the matter, with the government actively pursuing the US-India trade agreement that was announced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States earlier this year. While the 26% tariff imposed on India is higher than what many experts expected, it remains lower than the rates imposed on other countries. For instance, China initially faced a combined tariff of 54% (20% plus a 34% discount), which has now been raised to 125% following its retaliatory actions."," commerce minister Piyush Goyal said that India would ""never negotiate at gunpoint"" Donald Trump had, on Wednesday, announced a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition including 26% on India, except China.

However, this is highly improbable as the post will to go to someone with years of experience.Annamalai could also be be tasked with working for the BJP in his home state, where it has traditionally been a weak player. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP contested 23 of the state's 39 seats but drew a blank. However, it recorded a vote share of 11%, up from 7.5% in the 2019 polls. The improved show came under Annamalai, who, however, lost from the Coimbatore constituency, where he was the runner up to Ganapathi Rajkumar of the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.He recently said, ""I am in politics for the sake of a single man, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ...whatever may be his command, I will follow that.""",K Annamalai was appointed head of Tamil Nadu BJP in 2021.

Lawyers’ reply changed his demeanour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-trial-be-over-in-a-year-asked-rana-lawyers-reply-changed-his-demeanour/articleshow/120222143.cms,"NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his re mand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.",Tahawwur Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security.

NEW DELHI: Is BJP planning Nitish Kumar 's 'honourable exit' from Bihar politics ? Is BJP looking to reposition him in a different role? As the NDA in Bihar gears up for year end elections speculations are rife that the BJP may stake claim to the top post in the state post elections and find another important role for Nitish Kumar. In such a scenario, Nitish Kumar's son, who has dropped hints for a political debut, may be accommodated at the sate level.It is in this light that senior BJP leader and former Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey floated a possible ""plan"" in place for a smooth transition of power.""It is my personal wish that he be made the deputy Prime Minister . If the wish is granted, Bihar will see the second son of its soil, after Babu Jagjivan Ram, rising to the office,"" Choubey, who was also once a minister in Nitish's cabinet, said.""Nitish Kumar's contribution to the NDA is tremendous. He has been strengthening the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by playing the role of an anchor in the coalition,"" he added.Political analyst Kumar Vijay while speaking to TOI.com said that BJP is likely to remove Nitish from the chief ministerial post in Bihar and relocate him in the central cabinet or any other constitutional post.""Now, BJP wants to dominate the politics of Bihar and become a senior partner in the alliance. It is very likely that BJP will give Nitish Kumar an 'honourable exit' from Bihar by placing him in the central cabinet,"" Vijay said.He further said that the ""BJP would attempt to maintain its alliance with the JD(U) by offering Nitish Kumar's son, Nishant, the position of deputy chief minister.""Ashwini Choubey's proposition was, however, quickly snubbed by the JD(U) which cited Union minister Amit Shah 's earlier remark and reiterated that ""all NDA partners acknowledge the chief minister as the coalition's leader for the upcoming assembly polls"".""We have nothing to do with who says what. Union minister Amit Shah has already announced that the NDA will fight the next assembly polls under the leadership of Nitish,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar told reporters.(People are hopeful of Nitish's rule),"" he added.Earlier in February, Bihar government expanded its cabinet ensuring that the two main NDA partners in the state - the BJP and the JD(U) - have representation in the ministry proportional to their numbers in the assembly. The BJP, which won 74 seats in the 2020 assembly elections now has 21 ministers while JD(U), which won 43 seats, has 13 including the chief minister.In 2020 assembly elections, dynamics between JD(U) and BJP underwent a change after the saffron party, the junior partner in NDA, overtook the JD(U) in the numbers game.

Annamalai's comment on Jayalalithaa and BJP-AIADMK breakup

NEW DELHI: One has a past with AIADMK, and the other made a contentious remark on Jayalalithaa. For Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take on its biggest critique - Tamil Nadu's ruling government DMK - it needed a working regional alliance with AIADMK. And thus, Nainar Nagendran seems to be a fair choice.BJP on Friday announced its reunion with AIADMK for the upcoming 2026 assembly elections and Union home minister Amit Shah said that the NDA would contest under the leadership of Edappadi Palaniswami. This comes after EPS had declared that the DMK was his party’s ""sole enemy"" and expressed willingness to form alliances with any like-minded parties.The event was followed by Nainar Nagendran, who was formerly with AIADMK, submitting his nomination for Tamil Nadu BJP state president, a post previously held by K Annamalai.Annamalai made it clear that he was not in the race for the party's top post.""The nomination for the post of Tamil Nadu BJP State President has been received only from Mr @NainarBJP. As the Tamil Nadu BJP President, Mr @annamalai_k has made commendable achievements. Whether it is taking the policies of Prime Minister Mr @narendramodi to the people, or taking the party's projects village by village, Mr. Annamalai's contribution is immense. The BJP will utilize Mr Annamalai's organizational skills in the party's national structure,"" Amit Shah informed.Nainar Nagendran is a BJP legislator who represents Tirunelveli constituency in Tamil Nadu. He had already given a hint of the alliance earlier this year when he had said that ""there was no need to intimidate the AIADMK to get the party agree to an alliance with the BJP and a dialogue with EPS was enough for stitching an alliance with the AIADMK.''Annamalai, who was then the BJP president, had distanced himself from the statement and said that Nagendran's remarks were misinterpreted. He had later clarified his stance on the possibility of an alliance saying that he was ready to serve as a ""BJP cadre."" ""I have already said that I am even ready to work as a BJP cadre. I have not entered politics for power. I wanted to work for a better TN,'' he said.He served as a cabinet minister under AIADMK from 2001 to 2006, hence, he is well suited to be a bridge between the newly formed alliance.The freshly formed alliance, which would remain ""permanent and wouldn't change"" as assured by Amit Shah, has had its share of tumultuous past after the saffron party's outgoing chief Annamalai made a remark on late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, that did not go down well with AIADMK.""It took time because this alliance is now permanent,"" Shah said on the question of delay in forming an alliance.The BJP and AIADMK were allies in the 2021 state elections, where the BJP secured four seats. However, tensions between the two parties arose after Annamalai made a contentious remark about the late AIADMK leader and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s conviction in a corruption case.Senior AIADMK leaders had criticized Annamalai for undermining the alliance’s spirit and not acknowledging the AIADMK’s leadership role within the state coalition.Amit Shah, however, this time, categorically said that the BJP wouldn't interfere in the internal matters of AIADMK. ""AIADMK has no conditions and demands... We will have no interference in the internal matters of the AIADMK. This alliance is going to be beneficial to both NDA and AIADMK,"" he said.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, both parties contested independently with separate alliances, which ultimately weakened their position, as the DMK-led coalition won all the seats in Tamil Nadu.","BJP on Friday announced its reunion with AIADMK for the upcoming 2026 assembly elections.

Amid the continuing grounding of 330 ‘Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) after a crash three months ago, which has hit operations in the armed forces, Hindustan Aeronautics on Friday publicly lashed out at some serving military officers, former pilots, “so-called defence analysts” and “armchair critics” for spreading “malicious” and “speculative” narratives on the indigenous 5.5-tonne chopper.“These stories are written without offering HAL’s perspective, and arguments are one-sided and biased. HAL would like to reiterate it’s working with all its customers including IAF and is confident of handling the critical issues that are innate to the defence aeronautics and com plex flying platforms,” the defence PSU said.Critics were quick to respond and demand complete transparency on flight safety issues. “The interests of your (HAL) stakeholders are best served if you welcome criticism, work with greater transparency, stop shooting messengers and hallucinating about malafide intent. Your worst critic is not your enemy; just as a sycophant is not your best friend. Learn to differentiate,” former naval aviator and test pilot Commander K P Sanjeev Kumar (retd)said.HAL has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters as well as the grounding of all the twin-engine ALHs, designed and produced by the PSU, since the crash in Porbandar on Jan 5.","HAL has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters.

Kerala HC ordered Friday a CBI investigation against CM Pinarayi Vijayan ’s chief principal secretary K M Abraham for allegedly amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.Justice K Babu’s order came on a petition by activist Jomon Puthenpurackal, challenging the dismissal of his complaint against Abraham by the inquiry commissioner and special judge of Thiruvananthapuram.The court directed the SP of CBI’s Kochi unit to register an FIR against Abraham and the Vigilance and AntiCorruption Bureau (VACB) to hand over the case files to the central agency.Puthenpurackal’s petition alleged that between 2000 and 2015, Abraham acquired three properties –– an apartment in Mumbai valued at Rs 3 crore, another at Thycaud in Thiruvananthapuram worth Rs 1 crore, and a three-storey shopping complex at Kadappakkada in Kollam, estimated atRs 8 crore.Abraham, who is also CEO of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, was previously the state’s chiefsecretary.VACB’s preliminary report said it didn’t find sub stantive evidence to support the allegations. The special court accepted the bureau’s contention and dismissed the complaint against Abraham.HC found “prima facie evidence” suggesting Abraham had acquired assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. It noted that during the preliminary inquiry, the investigation officer deliberately excluded from consideration “a substantial immovable asset” acquired by Abraham by curtailing the check period.Given the fact that Abraham currently holds a cabinet-rank post as chief principal secretary to CM, to whom the directorate of vigilance reports, the court said a VACB investigation would not inspire confidence.To ensure a fair, independent and credible investigation — the court held the pribe must be conducted by CBI.","Kerala HC ordered Friday a CBI investigation against CM Pinarayi Vijayan ’s chief principal secretary K M Abraham.

justice for 26/11 victims

: Rubio

NEW DELHI:“Indians deserved it,” an exultant Tahawwur Rana told fellow jihadi David Coleman Headley aka Daood Gilani, his words dripping with venom, as he spoke about the 26/11 carnage. Unsurprisingly, the remark celebrating the massacre of 166 innocent civilians found mention in the US justice department’s statement explaining his extradition to India.Justice department also released photographs of Rana being handed over by US Marshals to NIA in Los Angeles. The photos show Rana in prison browns, shackled with chains around his waist and legs.“In an intercepted conversation with Headley, Rana allegedly commended the nine LeT terrorists who were killed committing the attacks, saying they should be given Nishan-e-Haider — Pakistan’s highest award for gallantry in battle, which is reserved for fallen soldiers,” the statement further said, something which served to underline yet again the nexus between Lashkar-e-Tai ba terrorists who traumatised Mumbai and Pakistan’s military-intelligence complex.It was perhaps due to Rana being such a high value asset for Pakistan that the aircraft transporting him from the US steered clear of Pakistani airspace. Sources said the plane flew over Iran to come to India.Even in NIA’s custody, Rana hasn’t shown an iota of remorse, a source said. “He has been calm and composed, without any tantrums,” he added.The prosecution by India is not a first for Rana who has been accused of conspiring to commit violent acts of terrorism. In 2013, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison following his conviction in the Northern District of Illinois, US, for conspiring to provide material support to LeT and to a foiled LeT-sponsored terrorist plot in Copenhagen, Denmark.“As part of those same criminal proceedings, Headley had pleaded guilty to 12 federal terrorism charges , including aiding and abetting the murders of six Americans in Mumbai and later planning to attack a Danish newspaper, and was sentenced to 35 years in prison,"" the US justice department statement said.The US extradited Tahawwur Rana to India to face charges for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack , secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Friday. “Together, with India, we’ve long sought justice for the 166 people, including six Americans, who lost their lives in these attacks. I'm glad that day has come,” he said on X.His counterpart S Jaishankar responded, appreciating the counter-terrorism cooperation between the countries. “This is indeed a big step in ensuring justice for victims of 26/11 attacks ,” he said.The state department said, “The US has long supported India’s efforts to ensure those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice. As President Trump has said, the US and India will continue to work together to combat the global scourge of terrorism.” TNN","The US extradited Tahawwur Rana to India to face charges for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. “Together, with India, we’ve long sought justice for the 166 people, including six Americans, who lost their lives in these attacks.

NEW DELHI: The NIA team, led by the agency’s deputy inspector general Jaya Roy who is also the chief investigating officer in the Tahawwur Rana case , aims to extract information about his contacts and activities during his India visits, particularly between Nov 8 and Nov 21, 2008, and is likely to follow through any lead closely with various state Anti-Terrorism Squads (ATS) to take action based on Rana’s testimony.“Rana will remain in NIA custody for 18 days, during which time the agency will question him in detail in order to unravel the complete conspiracy behind the deadly 2008 attacks, in which 166 peo ple were killed and over 238 injured,” said a statement issued by the probe agency soon after the court’s order.Rana’s security during his remand as well as future judicial custody is the biggest challenge for the agency. He has been kept on “suicide watch” which requires him to be under 24/7 human and CCTV surveillance.Only a handful of officers, authorised by NIA chief Sadanand Date, are permitted inside his cell. Date, a Maharashtracadre IPS officer, was posted as additional commissioner of police in Mumbai during the 2008 attack and had received serious injuries fighting the terrorists.Special guards are keeping a watch on Rana on rotation basis and no conversation between them is permissible, a source said.

While Ajmal Kasab was hanged, there was “still a burden on our hearts about those who conspired to attack Mumbai,” he said, adding that the Centre has now succeeded in getting the conspirators to face the Indian justice system.TNN & AGENCIES","NIA and MHA will lead the 26/11 probe, and Mumbai police will assist in the investigation into the role of Rana, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said Friday.

Just as the sun scorches the boneless creature,

So does virtue burn those without love.

Recently, I visited an old teacher of mine who had been hospitalised. Her children had made the heart-wrenching decision to admit her to a palliative care centre. With quiet resignation, he told me, “She has become immobile—her bones are too weak. Caring for her has become difficult.”As I looked at her, my eyes welled up. I could still hear the echo of her footsteps as she did the rounds in the corridors of our school—that struck fear and respect in equal measure.To now see her curled up in a bed, frail and still, was painful.My mind wandered back to her voice as she brought Julius Ceaser’s fall to life for us—“ O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I, and you, and all of us fell down.”Those words, once recited with such power, now felt prophetic.As people live longer, we seem to be shifting our gaze fromto. The question is no longer, but. At the heart of this lies the quiet strength of bones and muscles.Medical professionals and evolutionary scientists alike regard bones—particularly the spine—with reverence. The moment the human species stood upright, something shifted in the great story of evolution. The feat freed our hands for creating tools and crafting civilizations.Our skeleton does far more than give us shape—it shields, supports, and enables. And unlike what many think, bones are not static. They are in a constant dance of regeneration—replacing themselves every decade, keeping us upright, quite literally, in body and spirit.I find it deeply poetic is that Thiruvalluvar, the sage of profound brevity, refers to bones in the chapter on(love). And it wasn’t poetic convenience of rhyming(love) and(bone).Valluvar , the master craftsman of thought, equated bones to the soul's scaffold, just as love gives shape and meaning to human existence.“The unloving belong only to themselves. But the loving belongs to others—to their very bones.”Commentators often draw on the tale of Rishi Dadhichi, who gave up his bones to forge the divine weaponthat defeated evil. The very design of India’s Param Vir Chakra—our highest military honour—bears the mark of this ultimate sacrifice.In another verse, Valluvar says:“The throb of life is love. Without it, humans are but skeletons draped in skin.”And my favourite couplet,Here, he paints a haunting image: a boneless creature, like a worm, writhing under the harsh sun—symbolic of those without love being consumed by the very ethics they fail to uphold. In his verse, ethics is not a code—it is the omnipotent God that can destruct, and love is the only shelter.As I sat beside my teacher, soon to be left in the care of strangers, I couldn’t help but wonder—are we slowly becoming a spineless society? One that cannot bear the weight of its own elders? Have we let love become so brittle that it fractures under the demands of convenience?Perhaps that’s the reason Valluvar tried to connect bones and bonds – not once but thrice, in his chapter on love.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120199254,imgsize-46060,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/120199254.jpg"

CM mourns ‘irreplaceable void’ in Bengal politics

From Left stalwart to Trinamool minister

NEW DELHI: Former West Bengal minister and veteran leader Abdur Razzak Mollah passed away at his ancestral home in South 24 Parganas on Friday morning.The 80-year-old Trinamool Congress leader, who had been ailing due to age-related complications, breathed his last at his residence in Bankri village in the Bhangar area, party sources confirmed.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed deep grief over Mollah’s demise, recalling his contributions to Bengal’s rural and agrarian landscape.“I am saddened and shocked by the passing of my colleague, Abdur Razzak Mollah. He was my colleague in the state cabinet. I respected and honoured him,” Banerjee said on X.“His knowledge and experience in Bengal's rural life, agricultural economy and land reform were well-known. That's why, even though he once practised politics of a different ideology, it was easy and natural for him to join the 'Ma-Mati-Manush' government,” she said, calling his death an “irreplaceable void in the political life of Bengal.”Mollah served as the Minister for Land and Land Reforms during the Left Front regime and represented the Canning Purba seat from 1977 to 2011. In 2014, he was expelled from CPI(M) over “anti-party activities” and soon floated the Bharatiya Nayabichar Party (BNP).He was later expelled from the BNP as well for aligning with the ruling Trinamool Congress. Ahead of the 2016 assembly elections, Mollah officially joined TMC and won the Bhangar seat, following which he was inducted as the Minister for Food Processing.Mollah's decades-long political journey spanned ideological shifts, but his deep connect with rural Bengal and his role in land reforms remained a constant thread in his public life.He is survived by his family, and condolences have poured in from across the political spectrum.",Former West Bengal minister and veteran leader Abdur Razzak Mollah passed away at his ancestral home in South 24 Parganas on Friday morning.

"Tahawwur Rana arrested on arrival in India, appears before NIA court, sent to 18-day custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-arrested-on-arrival-in-india-appears-before-nia-court-sent-to-18-day-custody/articleshow/120177280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , who played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives, was arrested by NIA here on Thursday after his arrival from US on a special flight.The Pakistani-Canadian terrorist was produced before special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh, who held an in-camera hearing on NIA counsel and special public prosecutor Narender Mann's plea for a 20-day remand. Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives.

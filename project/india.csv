Saif Ali Khan’s condition

NEW DELHI: A man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was arrested on Sunday in Thane, news agency ANI reported quoting Mumbai Police. The incident took place early Thursday morning at Khan’s Bandra residence, where the actor was stabbed by an intruder wielding a knife.The suspect, identified as Vijay Das, also known by multiple aliases such as Bijoy Das and Mohammed Iliyas, was detained after a manhunt. Earlier, the Mumbai Police coordinated with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and had apprehended a 31-year-old while he was travelling on the Jnaneswari Express in Durg, Chhattisgarh, in connection with the attack. Das was brought into custody and will face further investigation.Police have recovered part of the weapon used in the attack at Khan’s residence.The arrested suspect, Vijay Das, reportedly operated under several aliases, including Bijoy Das and Mohammed Iliyas, the report said. Das worked as a waiter at a restaurant.The accused, Vijay Das, was apprehended by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) in a swift operation while travelling on the Jnaneswari Express in Chhattisgarh. Acting on a tip-off from Mumbai Police, RPF officers tracked the suspect’s mobile location and detained him at Durg railway station. His identity was confirmed through a photograph shared with the authorities.Authorities are investigating whether the stabbing was a botched burglary attempt or a premeditated assault on the actor. Early reports suggested the intruder may have been familiar with the building’s layout and security lapses, leading to speculation about his intent.Investigators relied heavily on CCTV footage, which showed the suspect moving through the building and later buying earphones at a nearby shop. Statements from the actor’s staff and neighbours also helped police piece together the suspect’s movements on the night of the attack.The horrifying incident unfolded at around 2.30am in Khan’s Bandra apartment. The intruder allegedly entered the premises unnoticed and confronted the actor’s son’s nanny, Philip, near the child’s room.Philip recounted in her statement that the man threatened her to stay silent and attacked when she resisted, injuring her hands and wrists. Saif Ali Khan intervened to protect his family but was stabbed multiple times during the altercation.The actor sustained serious injuries, including a 2.5-inch blade lodged in his thoracic spine, and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital. His wife, Kareena Kapoor, and staff member Geeta also suffered minor injuries during the chaos.Mumbai Police had mobilised 20 teams to investigate the incident, including officers from the Crime Branch and Bandra Police Station. No signs of forced entry were found, suggesting the intruder exploited a security lapse.The Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) has written to the Mumbai Police Commissioner requesting enhanced security for the actor.Doctors at Lilavati Hospital successfully removed the knife shard from Khan’s spine. The actor underwent emergency surgery and has since been moved from the ICU to a regular room. Neurosurgeons also treated deep wounds on his neck and hand, which required plastic surgery.Dr Niraj Uttamani, Chief Operating Officer of the hospital, said, “Saif is stable and recovering well. He remains under observation but is expected to make a full recovery soon.”","The suspect, identified as Vijay Das, also known by multiple aliases such as Bijoy Das and Mohammed Iliyas, was detained after a manhunt.

AGRA: Ex-Army jawan Manoj Kumar , 50, was sentenced to death by a court in Aligarh on Saturday for the murder of his wife Seema Devi , 38, son Manvendra Singh , 6, and neighbour Shashibala, 40, in 2014. The court relied heavily on the testimony of the convict’s 13-year-old daughter, Usimita Singh, who was critically injured in the incident, ADGC Mape Singh said.On July 12 that year, after a verbal spat with his wife, Manoj, in a fit of rage, took out a rifle and a revolver from his cupboard and shot her in the chest. Hearing gunshots, their neighbour Shashibala rushed in and the ex-Army jawan shot her in the head. Manoj then targeted his children. Manvendra, terrified by the gunshots clung on to his legs, pleading to spare his life, but he was also shot in the head. All three died. His daughter, a student of Class 8, was shot in the face but survived to narrate the horrific details before the court.Manoj was overpowered by neighbours and handed over to the police, and Seema’s brother Dilip Kumar later filed a complaint at Banna Devi in Aligarh.In his police complaint, Dilip stated that he was about to visit his sister’s place when he noticed a lot of commotion on the road. Soon, he came to know that Manoj had “attacked several people”. When he stepped into the house, Dilip saw his brother-in-law shooting at the 13-year-old girl. He further stated that Manoj was ill-tempered and used to often beat his wife and children. Police registered a case against the ex-Army man under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder).","Manoj Kumar was sentenced to death by a court in Aligarh for the murder of his wife Seema Devi, 38, son Manvendra Singh, 6, and neighbour Shashibala, 40, in 2014.

CUTTACK: If a husband doubts his wife’s chastity without proof, she is “perfectly justified” to live separately and is also entitled to maintenance, Orissa high court ruled recently.Justice Gourishankar Satapathy noted this while upholding a Baripada family court order directing a man to payRs 3,000 monthly maintenance to his estranged wife. The husband had moved HC challenging the family court order.The couple had wed on May 5, 2021, but the wife left her marital home on Aug 28, 2021, allegedly because her husband raised doubts about her character. Claiming that his wife wasn’t entitled to maintenance as she had left him without sufficient cause, the petitioner (husband) questioned her chastity while alleging that she was in a relationship with another individual.While noting that the chastity of a woman is not only dearest to her but also her priceless possession, Justice Satapathy stated in his Jan 9 order: “When her husband raises doubt about her character, she is perfectly justified to refuse to live with her husband. In this case, without producing any proof about the infidelity of his wife, the husband has simply made character assassination of his wife, which itself is a ground for the wife to refuse to live with her husband.” While rejecting the man’s petition, HC said: “The plea of the husband in this case about the wife not staying with him without any sufficient cause is liable to be rejected and merits no consideration.”","Orissa high court upholds family court order directing a man to payRs 3,000 monthly maintenance to his estranged wife.

Poll Do You Believe Government Employees Should Have Higher Salaries Than Private Sector Employees? No, Private Sector Should Be Paid More Yes, They Should Be Compensated More

8th Pay Commission: How much salary hike to expect?

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor?

The fitment factor serves as a multiplication coefficient employed to determine the revised compensation for central government staff and retirees. It represents an essential element of the Pay Commission, utilised when implementing salary and pension increases following new commission guidelines.

The variation in grade pay assessment and irregular spacing between pay bands directly influences the quantum of fitment benefits. This inconsistency led numerous stakeholders to advocate for the implementation of a uniform fitment factor applicable across all employee categories.

The 7th Pay Commission established a standard fitment benefit of 2.57 applicable to all central government employees. This factor resulted in raising the minimum basic pay to ""Rs 18,000"" monthly from the previous ""Rs. 7,000"" (2.57 times the basic remuneration under the 6th Pay Commission).

A practical demonstration helps explain how public sector workers can determine their revised salary using the fitment factor set by the 8th Pay Commission. Consider a scenario where your current basic pay is Rs 40,000 monthly, and let’s assume that the 8th Pay Commission suggests a fitment factor of 2.5. This calculation would raise your basic salary to Rs 1 lakh per month.

Initially, dearness allowance remains excluded, as per typical pay commission guidelines. The dearness allowance component gets incorporated into the salary structure during subsequent years, following pay commission recommendations. Additional allowances might undergo modifications based on the pay commission's directives.

8th Pay Commission latest news : In good news for central government employees, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission. With this, central government employees can look forward to a salary hike.PM Modi shared on X: ""We are all proud of the efforts of all Government employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on the 8th Pay Commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption.""The decision comes months after the dearness allowance for central government employees crossed 50% of central government employees' basic salary. From July 1, 2024, central government staff and pensioners have been receiving 53% of their basic pay as dearness allowance/relief, with the next adjustment scheduled for January 2025.The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines implemented from January 1, 2016, will be updated after the 8th Pay Commission recommendations. ET consulted experts regarding potential salary increases, considering historical pay commission recommendations.Krishnendu Chatterjee, TeamLease Vice President, was quoted as saying, ""The Last Pay Commission was established in 2016, which recommended the minimum pay jump from 7,000 per month to 18,000 per month with a fitment factor of 2.57 times of basic pay. The maximum ceiling is 2.5 lakhs per month. Considering the inflation factor, there are indications that the fitment factor may stay between 2.5- 2.8 times, which will give a significant boost to employee salaries between Rs 40,000 and Rs 45,000. There are also suggestions of Performance based pay hike which are still under deliberation.""Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: Cabinet approves constitution of 8th Pay Commission; central government employees eye pay hike According to Rohitaashv Sinha from King Stubb & Kasiva, ""Pay commissions are in most cases established every 10 years to assess and provide changes to the remunerations of central government employees. The last pay commission, i.e. the 7th pay commission took effect in January 2016 and gave a raise on the minimum basic pay from Rs 7000 to Rs 18000 using the fitment factor 2.57. In the 8th Pay Commission, it is believed that the increase the minimum basic pay will be an astonishing 186%. This may make the minimum basic pay to INR 51,480 per month. It seems that the fitment factor for it is 2.86. The changes are likely to be implemented through the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2025 and may lead to enhanced pension and other retiral benefits such as EPF, Gratuity etc. and recommend changes in salary structures for government employees.""SKV Law Offices' Senior Associate Nihal Bhardwaj explains that historical data suggests central government staff might receive a 25-30% pay rise under the 8th Pay Commission. The 6th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2006, covering the period 2006–2016) utilised a 1.86 fitment factor, delivering a 40% increase in wages, whilst the 7th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2016, covering the period 2016–2026) employed a 2.57 fitment factor, yielding approximately 23-25% higher salaries.Staff associations are currently pushing for a fitment factor between 3.0 and 3.5, which could potentially elevate the minimum basic salary from Rs 18,000 to roughly Rs 25,000–Rs 26,000. Such adjustments would result in substantial improvements across all pay grades, he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

Fasting farm leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Saturday agreed to take medical aid in what appeared to be a flicker of hope towards a breakthrough in a year-long standoff.Farmer leader Sukhjit Singh Hardojhande confirmed to news agency PTI that Dallewal agreed to take medical aid, even as the central government extended a proposal to protesting farmers.Dallewal, the convener of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political), has lost 20 kg during his fast and is in critical condition. Refusing medical intervention, he has become the symbolic face of the protest, which centres on demands for a legal guarantee of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops.Adding urgency to the situation, 10 more farmers joined the hunger strike on Saturday, raising the total number of fasting protesters to 121. Kotra reported that one of the strikers vomited blood, highlighting the dire state of their health.Earlier, Kaka Singh Kotra, another farm leader, confirmed receiving the proposal, saying, ""Leaders of both forums are discussing it, and we will respond soon."" However, the contents of the proposal remain undisclosed.This development follows a two-hour meeting between Union agriculture ministry officials, led by joint secretary Priya Ranjan, and farmer representatives. Ranjan also visited the ailing farmer leader, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, whose indefinite hunger strike has now entered its 54th day. “We urged him to accept medical aid and break his fast to participate in the February 14 meeting in Chandigarh,” Ranjan told reporters.Farmers under the banners of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha have been camping at the Punjab-Haryana border since February 13, 2023.

KOLKATA/MALDA: A 25-year-old murder accused , absconding after shooting two policemen escorting him to jail on Wednesday, was shot dead in an encounter while trying to flee to Bangladesh near the border in Chopra in West Bengal ’s North Dinajpur on Saturday morning.Sajjak Alam , being escorted back to Raiganj prison from an Islampur court where he was facing a murder trial, had requested ASI Deban Baishya and constable Nilkanta Sarkar to stop the prison van at Panjipara under Goalpokhar police station, claiming he needed to relieve himself. When the vehicle stopped, he fired four shots at the policemen and fled. An investigation revealed that the gun had been supplied to him by Abdul Hossain, a Bangladeshi criminal, on the court premises.Sajjak, carrying a 2-lakh bounty on his head, was intercepted by an eight-member police team led by DIG Sudheer Kumar Neelakantam at 7 am. He was asked to surrender but he responded by firing “three to four rounds” from his 9 mm pistol, prompting retaliatory firing. He succumbed to his injuries an hour later while undergoing surgery at a local hospital.The encounter occurred 48 hours after DGP Rajeev Kumar had said, “If someone fires at cops, we can fire back four times.” Kumar had rushed to Siliguri to visit the injured officers a day after Sajjak’s escape.ADG (Law and Order) Jawed Shamim said, “We are professionals. We are tough on criminals. Every officer, from constable to DGP, knows the risks when entering service. We are trained to respond appropriately. This is not the first time an encounter has occurred in Bengal. A Punjab gangster was also gunned down in New Town.”The ADG confirmed that four officers, including the officer in charge and others responsible for its security, have been suspended pending further investigation.","Sajjak Alam, 25, shot dead in an encounter while trying to flee to Bangladesh near the border in Chopra in West Bengal ’s North Dinajpur on Saturday morning.

'Deleting names a bid to fight

caste prejudice

'

NEW DELHI: The Haryana government has asked the Centre to remove certain caste names from the state list of Scheduled Castes because they are “objectionable”, a reference to the caste appellations that are widely viewed as pejorative and also serve as slurs from supremacists.The names sought to be deleted are ‘Chura’ and ‘Bhangi’, which are mentioned at serial no. 2 of the SC list, and ‘Mochi’, which is listed at serial no. 9 of the SC list.Sources said the state, in a letter this month, has argued that the names are “not only objectionable but have lost relevance as well”.The letter states that Haryana reviewed the list of SCs and zeroed in on the three names as worthy of being deleted.It is learnt that Haryana (social justice, empowerment, welfare of SCs and BCs, and Antyodaya department) has claimed that it had sent a similar request in Aug 2013, but its fate is not known. Sources, however, said there is no record of the earlier letter having been received by the ministry of social justice and empowerment . The fresh letter is being examined by the ministry, sources added.From the state’s perspective, the move appears designed to remove from official and public parlance names, which, though rooted in traditional occupations identified with social groups, have turned into convenient instruments of prejudice. When hurled with a negative and derisive connotation, they often form part of caste prejudice complained about under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, that carries stringent provisions of punishment.However, for such a request for deletion to be carried out, the Centre will have to amend the Constitution (SCs) Order, 1950, as is done for inclusion and exclusion of castes from the lists of SCs and STs.","The Haryana government has asked the Centre to remove certain caste names from the state list of Scheduled Castes.

Modi blames earlier governments for people not having land deeds

NEW DELHI: Legal property cards under Svamitva scheme will unleash the economic power of land parcels, sometimes referred to as ‘dead capital’, since these can be monetised to get loans for business and education, and help in poverty alleviation, PM Modi said on Saturday as he virtually distributed over 65 lakh such cards to people.Property cards were distributed to beneficiaries across more than 50,000 villages in 10 states — Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, MP, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, UP and two UTs of J&K, and Ladakh — in a single day. Referring to a famous economist, the PM said that he had referred to property as “dead capital” because people could not monetise them.Property rights is a major challenge across the world. Years ago, United Nations had held a study, which revealed people did not have legal documents for property rights in several countries. UN has said property rights are important for poverty alleviation,” Modi said.The PM said India was also impacted by this challenge and people in villages had property worth lakhs of crores of rupees, but they did not have papers for it. “There were disputes, powerful people would take control illegally, and even banks did not provide loans,” he added.Lashing out at earlier governments, Modi said no sensitive government could leave its villagers in such distress. “Previous governments should have taken steps to do something about it but nothing much was done,” he said.Modi said after receiving legal documents under the Svamitva scheme, which started five years ago, lakhs of people have taken loans from banks based on their properties and started small businesses in their villages. Earlier, the PM had interacted with some of the beneficiaries and all of them had highlighted how getting a loan based on the property document was easy and they could use this for their business and higher education of their children.The PM said many such people are farmers, for whom this property card is a guarantee to financial security. He added that once property cards are issued in all villages, the scheme will unlock economic activities worth over Rs 100 lakh crore. Modi said the digitisation of land records, which is now around 98%, will minimise land disputes and corruption. Later, in a post on X, he said rural land digitisation is “furthering rural empowerment by leveraging the power of technology and good governance”.Panchayati raj minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’ said property rights cards are issued in many states in the name of women as main or co-owners, which is empowering for them.","Property cards were distributed to beneficiaries across more than 50,000 villages in 10 states.

Poll How do you feel about the distribution of property cards under the SVAMITVA Scheme? Advances the Use of Technology in Rural Areas Improves Rural Property Management and Ownership

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday distributed over 65 lakh property cards under the SVAMITVA Scheme to property owners in over 50,000 villages. These villages span more than 230 districts across 10 states and 2 UTs.PM Modi virtually addressed the event held in Ahmedabad and also interacted with the beneficiaries. BJP national president and union minister JP Nadda was also present at the event.The scheme was launched on April 24, 2020 (On National Panchayati Raj Day) by PM Modi, to provide a ""Record of Rights"" to property owners in rural Abadi areas using drone and GIS technology.Addressing the event, PM said, ""Today is a very historic day for the villages of the country and for the rural economy of the country. Around 2.24 crore people in villages will now have Svamitva property cards after 65 lakh cards are distributed today”.Speaking on the importance of the scheme, PM said, “We desire the development and trust of everyone, which is why we launched the SVAMITVA scheme. We decided that with the help of drones, we would map the land of homes in every village. Villagers will receive documents of their properties”.“Today, as we see the benefits of this scheme, it brings satisfaction to know we have been able to serve the villages and the poor...The joy, contentment, and self-confidence seen on the faces of the beneficiaries is truly heartwarming. I consider this a great blessing”, PM further added.PM Modi also highlighted the critical issue of property rights, emphasising its impact on global poverty reduction. Citing a United Nations study, he noted that many countries lack proper legal documentation for land ownership, creating disputes and diminishing the value of properties.He stated that India, too, faced similar challenges, with rural properties often lacking clear legal titles, leading to conflicts and exploitation by influential individuals.PM also underscored the need for robust property rights to unlock economic potential, reduce disputes, and ensure equitable ownership, framing it as a key step toward addressing poverty and fostering development.Under the initiative of SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas), the Government is providing accurate property ownership data, with clear ownership records in hand, thereby, land disputes have been reduced.The program also assists in the monetisation of properties and allows for institutional financing through bank loans. It also aids in minimising property-related conflicts; enhances the evaluation of properties and property taxes in rural regions, and supports thorough planning at the village level.BJP president Nadda also shared his thoughts on the event and said, ""Before discussing the SVAMITVA plan, we should keep one thing in mind in a holistic approach under the leadership of PM Modi, the program of empowerment of the common man has been given great importance. When we talk about empowerment, our focus has been on villages, the poor, the Dalits, the exploited, the afflicted, the deprived, the youth, women, farmers etc... All programmes have been planned to keep all these in mind. Under the leadership of Modi ji, work has been done keeping in mind the mantra of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas',"" he said.The program has achieved complete saturation in the regions of Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tripura, Goa, Uttarakhand, and Haryana.

NAGPUR/MUMBAI: An SECR RPF team Saturday said it has detained a suspect in last week’s attack on actor Saif Ali Khan from the LTT-Shalimar Jnaneswari Express at Durg railway station in Chhattisgarh . Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Mumbai police officials said there were reports of a person resembling the attacker shopping for headphones in a Dadar shop and later loitering outside the railway station.Nagpur railway police said the suspect, Akash Kannaujiya , 31, was caught in Durg after they missed him by a whisker at Nagpur, where the SECR headquarters reportedly received a precise tipoff on his location inside Jnaneswari Express, which crossed the station at 9.40am. His cellphone tower location again resurfaced when the train was heading to Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh. According to SECR sources, the RPF team scoured the train at Rajnandgaon station at 12.42pm, but failed to track him during its one-minute halt.Mumbai police had been intermittently receiving his tower location in Vidarbha, Nagpur RPF officials said. The cyber sleuths finally zeroed in on Jnaneswari Express, which had chugged out of Mumbai on Friday evening. Kannaujiya is suspected to have intruded into actors Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan’s Bandra home early on Friday and knifed Saif 6 times. A precise alert was sent to SECR headquarters, said Nagpur RPF sources, adding Kannaujiya changed trains over the past 48 hours, before boarding Jnaneshwari Express.Two RPF teams at Durg led by senior inspector S K Sinha, boarded the train in civvies after it reached the station at 1.35pm. “We started scouring the train for the suspect based on photos shared by Mumbai police. Constables Shriram and Nirmala were in the general coach. They had the images of the suspect on their mobile phone. Soon, cops in plainclothes noticed the suspect inside the general coach and he was nabbed and de-boarded,” said Sinha, adding Kannaujiya's image matched with the photographs sent by Mumbai police. “Mumbai police confirmed the suspect after a video-conferencing with us,” said Sinha.Sources said Kannaujiya was being questioned at the RPF thana at Durg.The actor was attacked around 2.30am last Thursday. According to the FIR, the intruder—described as a man in his late 30s with a slim build and dark complexion—was first spotted by stay-at-home nurse, Eliyamma Phillips, outside Saif’s son’s bedroom. Phillip said the intruder warned her to stay silent and demanded Rs 1 crore. As he attacked her with a knife, causing minor injuries, her screams woke up the son’s nanny Junu, who called out for help, prompting Saif and wife Kareena Kapoor Khan to come rushing. He then stabbed Saif.","Nagpur railway police said the suspect, Akash Kannaujiya, 31, was caught in Durg after they missed him by a whisker at Nagpur.

Preparing with

Maha Mantra

Sounds Of Isha - Aum Namah Shivaya | Chant | 1 Hour Version

Does Taking a Dip at Mahakumbh Wash Away Sins?

As the holy Mahakumbh draws millions of devotees, Sadhguru , speaking amidst the vibrant energy of Prayagraj , urged Indians not to miss this once-in-a-lifetime event.“There is no place like this on the planet. What is happening here is a phenomena beyond logic. It is a civilizational phenomena. It is something that everybody should see, everybody should experience. It doesn’t matter if you’re religious, not religious, spiritual, not spiritual, you are seeking liberation or you like bondage – it doesn’t matter what! Still, as a civilizational phenomena, it is too fantastic to be in Bharat and to miss it! Don’t do that!”“Just come for half day, experience this whole exuberance. Being born in India you can’t miss an event which happens once in 144 years!” emphasized Sadhguru.Explaining the significance of this year’s Mahakumbh, Sadhguru highlighted its celestial importance and said, “This is definitely more significant because Kumbh is our planet’s relationship with the Sun and particularly Jupiter. This is the time, by January 23 or so, when seven celestial objects will be lined up in the sky for us to see. They all have lined up after 144 years.”“When water bodies meet with a certain force at specific latitudinal positions during certain times of the year, it creates a massive possibility of life. Two-thirds of your body is water. If you are in spaces where water is in a certain dynamic, it impacts the body tremendously. Especially once in every 12-year solar cycle, a moment comes when it has maximum impact. This is the Maha Kumbh,” explained Sadhguru in another video about the profound impact of Mahakumbh.As millions of devotees gear to take a dip, Sadhguru has encouraged devotees to chant the Maha Mantra —“Aum Namah Shivaya”—for 21 minutes each morning and evening, ideally for 21 days before attending the Maha Kumbh. He guides practising this during before the sun rises above a 30-degree angle and in the evening twilight after the sun dips below 30 degrees.“So, you’re going to Kumbh, Maha Kumbh, which has gone on for many millennia. And at least go prepared. Before the sun rises over thirty-degree angle and also in the evening, after the sun goes below thirty degrees, twenty-one minutes in the morning, twenty-one minutes in the evening, just sit in a cross-legged posture, put yourself with great involvement, just do Mahamantra,” he says.Addressing the common belief, Sadhguru explained, “Definitely certain cleansing is happening. One day’s dip is not the thing. Today you are going like a tourist, (but) you must stay there for one mandala– forty-eight days. If you stay there, do the right kind of practices and use the water as a way of enhancing your system, then the water within you– seventy-two percent, or two-thirds of the body which is water– if this water behaves the way you want, suddenly you will be a fantastic human being.”“The entire process of yogic sciences has come from the fundamental or the foundation that we call as Bhuta Shuddhi, that means cleansing these five elements. So what you are calling as Kumbh Mela is also one expression of Bhuta Shuddhi process, which is a foundation of the yogic system.”The Mahakumbh is not just an event—it is a profound cosmic phenomenon that has stood the test of time, celebrated for millennia through a deep Yogic understanding of the interplay between celestial forces and human life. Devotees can maximize its transformative power by approaching it with awareness and devotion.Sadhguru’s guidance, throws an opportunity for every seeker to align with these sacred energies, making their experience at the Mahakumbh not just memorable but personally transformative.","The holy Mahakumbh draws millions of devotees.

Academic pressure, love affairs behind suicides: Minister

(With inputs from PTI)

KOTA: A 16-year-old JEE aspirant allegedly hanged himself at his grandparents’ house Saturday, 48 hours after an another aspirant from Odisha killed himself in his hostel room in Kota. This is the fourth case of suicide in the city this year.According to police, Manan Jain, a Class XII student, had been living with his maternal grandparents’ to prepare for JEE for past three years. Cops received information about the incident at 9.15 am Saturday and sent the body for a autopsy, ASI Jawahar Singh said.The officer said Manan had studied with his cousin until midnight Friday. When he did not respond to calls in the morning, his cousin peeked into the room and found him hanging from the iron railing of the room’s window. He said no suicide note was recovered and the reason behind the suicide is yet to be ascertained.Meanwhile, the body of Abhijeet Giri , who died by suicide on Thursday, was handed over to his family after autopsy.Following suicides by four IIT-JEE aspirants in Kota in a span of 18 days, Rajasthan education minister Madan Dilawar on Saturday cited “romantic relationships”, apart from academic stress, among reasons for students taking such extreme steps, even as he urged parents to be watchful and avoid putting pressure on their children beyond their natural interests and abilities.Dilawar stressed that every student had unique interests and abilities, and when forced to pursue goals against these natural inclinations, failure often led to depression.The minister remarked that coaching institutes had minimal role in this and it was peer influence that played significant role because of constant remarks from other students about a student’s ranks.","Manan Jain, a Class XII student, had been living with his maternal grandparents’ to prepare for JEE for past three years.

After the recent tensions over the Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun murder plot, the Biden administration looked to sign off on a positive note with India as outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti Thursday welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case, saying the investigation delivered 2 of the things that the US sought – accountability and systemic reforms .Garcetti told TOI in an interview that while the probe was not an end in itself, and the US would look forward to more steps, the outcome helped prove wrong the sceptics who believed there’s no way India and the United States would be able to navigate this issue and that what India was doing was mere “window dressing”.The ambassador admitted that Trump’s tariff threat could undermine the positive agenda of the relationship, but expressed confidence the relationship would continue to grow, saying he saw Trump’s tariff focus as an invitation for dialogue on the issue, and not as a threat to start a trade war.“My assessment is it’s ( Pannun probe ) a really positive first step. We welcome it. It delivered what the private interactions I had with Indian officials promised. We said changes should be made to ensure this doesn’t happen again and people should be held accountable. It’s not the destination though. The report would be first to say that. It says it’s recommending a process for prosecution. And just like in our system, facts come out and things happen. But this is substantive. It moves the ball forward and we look forward to steps in the future,"" said Garcetti, when asked about the outcome of the probe which suggested the plot might have been a ‘lone wolf’ operation.On Canada’s ongoing probe into similar cases and alleged Indian involvement, which it has linked to higher-ups including the Indian home minister, Garcetti said he didn’t have any knowledge about it at all. “I believe both of our countries have independent criminal justice systems, which are outside our intelligence systems and have to pursue facts that can hold up in a court of law. I don’t want to speak for Canada. I know it to be the case in America. My friends in Canada would say they have a similar system. I think often we see connections that don’t exist,’’ said the ambassador.Garcetti said the fact that Trump has close ties with PM Narendra Modi and the fact that he has appointed people considered pro-India as NSA and secretary of state augurs well for ties. He described Biden as the most pro-India president in US history and Modi as the most pro-US PM. “And when President Biden said this is the most important country to me when he asked me to take this position…I think he proved it. Things like ICET, envisioning IMEEC…or the work we are doing in Fiji, or southeast Asia or Africa is not just additive but also multiplicative. That legacy will be an amazing foundation for the Trump administration to further build on but will also stand on it as the brightest chapter,’’ he said.Trade war doesn’t help anybody, said Garcetti when asked about Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on India and others. “If we want to outcompete our main competitors…want to have a China plus one strategy, It’s not enough to have good intentions. We have to reduce tariffs further. We have to create a corridor that is trusted between our technologies. The way I hear it from the president-elect, it’s an invitation to sit down at the table, not a threat to start a trade war,’’ he said.On the US focus on human rights, minorities and freedom of speech, Garcetti said both India and the US needed to guard against misinformation and to ensure a sense of belonging for all, but added US wasn’t looking to teach or preach. “That’s for the Indians to determine. India says we will not comment on you and please don’t comment on us. America says we are going to comment on you, please do comment on us. We have a slight difference there. There have been moments when I have been blown away by the vibrancy of the Indian democracy. There are fair, free elections that are an example for others,’’ he said.Asked about some of the most challenging issues he faced during his tenure, including India’s ties with Russia and the murder-for-hire case, Garcetti said there was nothing the 2 sides could not overcome even though there were conversations that weren’t easy. “Sometimes we have to disagree on things. But we resolved our trade disputes. We are navigating through criminal cases – both what happened to Indian diplomats in San Francisco and in terms of what happened to American citizens like in the Pannun case. Democracies are complex, diverse populations are difficult to manage but it reminds me of America a few decades ago. If we put our minds together, there’s nothing we can’t do,’’ he said.","Outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case.

AGARTALA: Two hearts are breaking on either side of the India-Bangladesh border. One is a man, Atikur, a Bangladeshi, and the other is his meandering pachyderm, Chandratara.For Atikur, life without Chandratara is unimaginable. Not a single day would pass that they didn’t see each other. But Atikur is now fighting a legal battle to bring her back from a foreign country.Chandratara, a captive elephant who Atikur claims is his, had inadvertently crossed over to a border village near western Kailashahar , in Tripura’s Unakoti district, through an unsecured area on Sept 11 last year. Forest officials took custody of the elephant, sparking a legal battle for ownership between Atikur and two other claimants from India.“After being informed by BSF that an elephant was roaming along the border, we rescued her. Immediately, two villagers claimed ownership, but weren’t able to give proof. We took the elephant into custody after that,” a senior Indian wildlife official said.Atikur has sent photographs and ownership documentation to BSF and Tripura forest department through his Indian relatives. In a video message, he said, “India is a great country and I have immense respect for the law of this land. I trust the legal complexities will soon be resolved, and I will be reunited with my elephant.” He said Chandratara likely became disoriented and crossed the border while searching for food. Atikur has also filed a general diary at Kamalganj police station in Bangladesh and submitted a grievance to Border Guard Bangladesh. His relative has initiated legal proceedings in Unakoti district court.A wildlife official said the case will be heard on Jan 21.","Chandratara, a captive elephant who Atikur claims is his, had inadvertently crossed over to a border village near western Kailashahar.

I’ve been framed, culprits allowed to go free, says Roy, claims involvement of IPS officer

KOLKATA: A Sealdah court found former Kolkata police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy guilty of raping and murdering a 31-year-old resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year, delivering the verdict during a 12-minute session Saturday after a 66-day in-camera trial, which began on Nov 4 and heard 50 witnesses.“The allegations against you say the victim was sleeping when you attacked her. You strangled and smothered her and she died. You assaulted her sexually. You are proven to be guilty based on witnesses’ accounts and documents placed before the court. You are convicted of the crime,” Judge Anirban Das said. Roy, 35, stood expressionless as the judge read out the verdict.The court will hear Roy and his lawyer before pronouncing the sentence Monday. Judge Das informed Roy that the death penalty was an option under BNS sections 64, 66, and 103(1).“It may be a life term or even death, given the way you throttled and killed the victim,” he said.The victim’s father, present in court, broke down. Addressing judge Das with folded hands, he said: “The faith we had in you has been completely vindicated today. Our heartfelt gratitude to you.”Kolkata police arrested main accused Roy a day after the crime. CBI assumed charge of the case three days later.On Oct 7, the central agency submitted a 45-page chargesheet detailing evidence against the civic volunteer—a contractual worker who assisted police, typically with minor tasks. He was sacked after the crime.The crime, marked by its brutality and audacity, triggered widespread protests. The largest demonstration occupied Kolkata’s streets on Aug 14-15. It also prompted a 10-week agitation by junior doctors, culminating in a 16-day hunger strike, which was called off on Oct 21.CM Mamata Banerjee met the striking doctors four times during this period.On Saturday, the Sealdah court complex was heavily guarded with nearly 300 policemen and officers as hundreds of citizens gathered outside. Roy was brought from Presidency Jail under a police escort.The media was permitted to witness the courtroom proceedings when the judgment was delivered.The proceedings commenced at 2.30pm. Standing in the witness box, Roy stayed silent for the most part. He maintained his innocence and repeated that he was being framed when the judge asked whether he had anything to say.“I have not done this. Those who have done this have been allowed to go free. I wear a rudraksha mala; it would have been torn had there been any scuffle,” Roy said, while alleging the involvement of an IPS officer.Judge Das assured Roy he would be allowed to speak again on Monday before the sentence was pronounced.Concluding the session, Judge Das mentioned the involvement of former RG Kar medical college principal Sandip Ghosh and other officials in the investigation, adding that their actions raised some questions.“I have taken the entire chain of events point by point. Some activities (of the officials) created some confusion in my mind. That has been explained in the judgment,” he said.",Former Kolkata police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy found guilty of raping and murdering a 31-year-old resident doctor.

DEHRADUN: Indian Medical Association (IMA) is against the integration of alternative medicine systems with modern medicine , said Dr Dilip Bhanushali , the newly appointed president of IMA, during the installation ceremony of the medical body’s fresh office bearers in Dehradun on Saturday.Bhanushali described the practice of mixopathy as a “menace”, emphasising that “80% of alternative practitioners continue to prescribe modern medicines despite a Supreme Court directive prohibiting such practices”. He said: “We are not against ayurveda , homeopathy , or other sciences. Let them practice their respective systems. What we oppose is mixing them, as it leads to results that are not helpful.”Bhanushali further warned that promotion of mixopathy would promote quackery . “Practitioners who lack formal training in modern medicine might prescribe harmful treatments, including high-dose steroids and antibiotics, to patients who are unaware of their potential side effects,” he said.Highlighting the rigorous training modern surgeons undergo, spanning eight to 10 years, Bhanushali questioned how short-term training could equip practitioners of ayurveda or homeopathy to perform complex medical procedures. “How can you simply train ayurveda, homeopathy or Unani doctors for one year and allow them to perform duties equivalent to a surgeon? Will they do justice to their patients?” he said.","Indian Medical Association (IMA) is against the integration of alternative medicine systems with modern medicine.

KOLKATA: The conviction of Kolkata Police’s former civic volunteer Sanjay Roy in the rape and murder of a resident doctor at her workplace sparked differences among political parties, though they unanimously called for the “severest punishment”.TMC celebrated the verdict as a validation of Kolkata police’s initial investigation. “Police arrested the perpetrator within 24 hours.

KOLKATA: Former colleagues of a 31-year-old resident doctor, raped and murdered at RG Kar Medical College on Aug 9 last year, expressed deep disappointment with the verdict delivered by the Sealdah trial court Saturday. The court convicted main accused Sanjay Roy , but many felt the investigation and proceedings had not been thorough.Several junior doctors were present at the court. “We are disheartened with this kind of shoddy investigation . We will be rallying behind the parents until complete justice is delivered,” said Arnab Mukhopadhyay, a junior doctor who had participated in hunger strikes demanding justice.Members of Medical Service Centre, Service Doctors’ Forum, and Joint Platform of Doctors gathered near the court, expressing dissatisfaction with the handling of the case. “We knew Roy would be pronounced guilty. We are here to remind the agencies that the investigation has not been done properly,” said Utpal Banerjee, an orthopaedic professor. “The court verdict did not address the involvement of others and those who tampered with evidence,” said Sajal Biswas of Service Doctors’ Forum.West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front (WBJDF) distributed leaflets highlighting 20 unanswered questions about the case. “We will be happy only when complete justice is delivered. We will be considering legal options like moving to a higher court and other forms of protest to remind everyone that justice is not done until all guilty are punished,” said Asfakulla Naiya of WBJDF.Senior resident doctor Snighdha Hazra, who had also participated in a hunger strike, criticised the CBI investigation. “We are still hoping for a supplementary charge sheet by CBI,” she said. Junior doctor Soumyadip Roy added: “The CBI investigation has failed to bring forth the motive behind the crime. How can we consider that justice has been delivered?”Physician Biplab Chandra raised concerns about the pace and thoroughness of the investigation. “Seeing the pace of the CBI investigation, everyone feared that the real culprits might not be caught, and only Roy would be found guilty. This fear was not unfounded,” he said.Back at RG Kar Medical College, doctors kept a close watch on the court proceedings while continuing their duties. Although the protest site was empty as doctors focused on their work, they ensured fresh garlands were placed on the bust of the victim and the “Cry of the Hour” sculpture, symbolising the tragic crime.","Former colleagues of a 31-year-old resident doctor, raped and murdered at RG Kar Medical College on Aug 9 last year, expressed deep disappointment with the verdict delivered by the Sealdah trial court Saturday. The court convicted main accused Sanjay Roy, but many felt the investigation and proceedings had not been thorough.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117364791,imgsize-1211135,width-400,resizemode-4/117364791.jpg"

KOLKATA: The rape and murder of a resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College have prompted reforms in the system in Bengal, amid calls for safety and transparency. Doctors have welcomed the changes but also raised concerns about the “inequitable distribution of manpower”, which they said may hinder the implementation of some measures.The reforms include installating CCTVs and upgrading infrastructure on college campuses, eliminating corrupt practices in examinations, monitoring professors’ duty hours at govt facilities, and revising rules for private practice. New rules mandate govt doctors must be within a 20km radius of their assigned hospitals and report within 24 hours if called for an emergency.",The rape and murder of a resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College has prompted reforms in the system in Bengal.

KOLKATA: As news of main accused Sanjay Roy’s conviction in the RG Kar rape-murder case was broadcast on TV Saturday, his sister broke down in tears. “He should be punished if he committed the crime, but I am not sure if he was the only one responsible for it. However, we have faith in the judiciary ,” she said.Standing in front of her house in a slum, she said: “I have been following the news since the beginning. I cannot even imagine the brutality with which the doctor was killed. But is it possible for a single person to commit the rape and murder in such a short span?” The woman said she had not visited the court room where her brother was pronounced guilty.She added she had not been on good terms with her mother and brother in recent years. While she did not challenge the trial court judgment or the CBI investigation, she pleaded with the authorities to uncover the full truth. “The real culprits should not be spared. I am not sure if my brother will appeal in any higher court.”Roy’s mother said: “I don’t know what has happened. I was worried earlier. But now I have stopped worrying and left it to his fate. At this age, I can only shed tears.”Roy’s legal team raised several concerns about the investigation process. His lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay said: “We spoke to him in custody, and he claimed his hair was torn off while in custody of Kolkata police. The videography of sample collection is incomplete. The samples need to be sealed and handed over to the investigating officer immediately after the autopsy, but it was given to the IO after three days.” Kabita Sarkar, another lawyer who initially represented Roy, said, “Why was there a rush in conducting the autopsy and cremation of the victim? As the accused’s lawyer, I have not yet seen the viscera report,” said Sarkar, who was present in court.","Main accused Sanjay Roy’s conviction in the RG Kar rape-murder case was broadcast on TV.

Top trust gave lion's share to BJP

Prudent's corporate donors surged to 83 in 2023-24 from 22 in previous financial year

NEW DELHI: Prudent Electoral Trust , the leading contributor to political parties through the ‘electoral trust’ route, was flooded with corporate donations following the scrapping of the electoral bonds scheme by the Supreme Court on Feb 15, 2024: three-fourths of its Rs 1075.7 crore donations in 2023-24 came between Feb 16 and March 31, 2024.According to Prudent’s contribution report for the last fiscal, now uploaded on the Election Commission website, donations received by it for distribution to political parties nearly tripled to Rs 1075.7 crore from Rs 363 crore in 2022-23. While it is not unusual for political donations to rise ahead of general elections, what is interesting is that while contributions of Rs 278.6 crore came in between April 1, 2023 and Feb 15, 2024, the period between Feb 16, 2024 and March 31, 2024, saw these surge to Rs 797.1 crore.This, in all probability, points to a diversion of corporate donations to the electoral trusts route from the bonds route, closed after Supreme Court clampdown.The number of Prudent’s corporate donors too surged to 83 in 2023-24 from around 22 in the previous financial year. Among the key corporates which contributed to Prudent in 2023-24 were Arcelor group and DLF Ltd (Rs 100 crore each); Maatha Projects LLP (Rs 75 crore); Maruti Suzuki and CESC Ltd (Rs 60 crore each); Hetero Group (Rs 55 crore); TVS Group and Apollo Tyres (Rs 50 crore each); Cipla (Rs 35.2 crore); and GMR group (Rs 26 crore). Megha Engineering and Infrastructure, the second biggest bond buyer, also contributed Rs 25 crore to Prudent, though this was well before the bonds were scrapped.Unlike the anonymity offered by poll bonds, electoral trusts are required to declare each individual contribution received along with the name of the donor. Also, it must declare each contribution disbursed to the political parties while also naming the party. What is, however, not revealed here is which corporate contributed how much to an individual party.As per contribution reports of various electoral trusts for 2023-24 now available on EC website, only four trusts have declared contributions — Prudent (Rs 1,075.7 crore), Triumph Electoral Trust (Rs 132.5 crore), Jaybharath Electoral Trust (Rs 9 crore), Paribartan Electoral Trust (Rs 1 crore) and Einzigartig Electoral Trust (Rs 17.2 lakh).The Rs 1075.7 crore contributions received by Prudent were distributed among six parties, with BJP receiving the lion’s share at Rs 723.8 crore, Congress Rs 156.4 crore, BRS Rs 85 crore, YSR Congress party Rs 72.5 crore, TDP Rs 33 crore and Janasena Party Rs 5 crore. Triumph contributed Rs 127.5 crore to BJP and Rs 5 crore to DMK. Jaybharath trust donated Rs 5 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to DMK and Rs 1 crore to AIADMK. The entire Einzigartig kitty went to BJP. Interestingly, Paribartan did not identify its donors saying that its Rs 1 crore donation in 2023-24 was through the electoral bonds route.Among the key donors to Triumph in 2023-24 were Cholamandalam Investments (Rs 50 crore), CG Power (Rs 30 crore), Coromandel International Ltd (Rs 25.5 crore), Tube Investments (Rs 25 crore) and EID Parry (Rs 2 crore). Jaybharath received its donations from Lakshmi Machine Works (Rs 8 crore) and Super Sales India (Rs 1 crore).","Three-fourths of Prudent Electoral Trust's Rs 1075.7 crore donations in 2023-24 came between Feb 16 and March 31, 2024.

IMD Transponders: PM Modi’s speech puts focus on transponders on marine fishing boats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-speech-puts-focus-on-imd-gadget-on-boats/articleshow/117363174.cms,"PM Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent reference to timely warnings from the IMD easing worries for families of lakhs of sea-bound fishermen brought into focus a unique system of sharing weather alerts through use of indigenously developed transponders on marine fishing vessels.Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Diu, Goa, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have already installed transponders on over 4,000 vessels under the Centre’s plan to install one lakh such devices in 13 coastal states/UTs by Dec.The ones used in Odisha saved the lives of many fishermen who were out in the high seas during Cyclone Dana in October last year. Besides saving the lives of fishermen by timely sharing of weather alerts, the transponders —wireless tracking devices that use radio frequencies to operate — are also useful from a security point of view as they can be used for monitoring, control, and surveillance of marine fishing vessels.In case fishermen cross maritime boundaries, alerts will be issued to them to avoid unintentional transgression. It'll help Indian fishermen who unintentionally cross into the maritime boundaries of neighbouring countries - Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka - and get detained by security agencies. Such episodes invariably require significant diplomatic efforts to secure their release.There are 66,106 mechanized fishing boats and 1,35,763 motorised fishing boats currently operating throughout the coastal States/UTs. All the mechanised fishing vessels and a part of motorised fishing vessels will be covered by installing transponders under the present phase by December. ""Remaining ones and the new vessels, if any, will be covered in the next phase,"" said an official.The transponder is a two-way communication system enabling the fishermen to send short messages using their Android mobile phone while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast during any emergency to seek rescue operations. Information related to the Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) will also be made available to the fishermen on their mobile with the VCSS.""The system, designed to provide access to all features in the regional languages, also has efficient harbour management tools like token system for entry and exit of fishing vessels, and details of fishing crew on board establishing traceability of fish catch for compliance to international guidelines,"" said the official.The VCSS will help fishermen through Isro’s navigation satellite system, called NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), which can provide accurate real-time positioning information, helping fishermen stay informed about their location relative to national boundaries.""Fishermen will be notified if they approach or cross the national boundaries. If they accidentally cross the boundary, they can report their position and intention. Such reporting will help in negotiating their safe return,"" said the official.Currently, European Union (EU) nations, such as the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Chile, are using transponders on fishing vessels to enhance safety, improve monitoring, and combat illegal fishing.","Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Diu, Goa, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have already installed transponders on over 4,000 vessels.

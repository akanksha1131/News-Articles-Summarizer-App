Ties tested but unshaken

The first 100 days of Donald Trump 's second term in the White House have been nothing short of transformative for US-India relations, reshaping the strategic and economic landscape between the world's two largest democracies with unprecedented intensity and ambition.Following his unprecedent return, Trump unleashed a torrent of executive actions - 140 orders in just over three months -signaling a bold, aggressive approach to governance that has directly influenced the trajectory of US-India ties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landmark visit to Washington in February became a defining moment for the tectonic shift in US-India ties, cementing a ""COMPACT for the 21st Century"" that PM Modi described as a partnership built on ""TRUST-Transforming Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology"".Capturing the spirit of this renewed alliance, PM Modi had announced: ""When America's MAGA [Make America Great Again] meets India's MIGA [Make India Great Again], it creates a MEGA partnership for prosperity.""The bilateral talks in February between Trump and PM Modi summit delivered concrete outcomes: A shared vision to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, an ambitious ""Mission 500"" that aims to rewrite the rules of engagement between the two economies.Trade has been a central theme in Trump 2.0's engagement with India.Trump, known for his hardline stance on trade, announced a reciprocal tariff policy targeting India's high tariffs, stating that the US will ""charge as much as India charges"", a move designed to level the playing field and protect American interests. Despite this tough posture, Trump hailed PM Modi as ""doing a great job"" and emphasised their ""great friendship"", underscoring a relationship that transcends transactional diplomacy.The administration imposed a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods, targeting sectors such as steel, aluminum, and auto parts, while exempting pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and energy products.This move aimed to protect US manufacturing and address perceived unfair trade practices by India.India responded by reducing tariffs on some imports to preempt harsher US tariff measures. Despite the tariffs, experts suggest India's exposure is relatively limited since most US exports to India face low import taxes.The Trump administration’s directive to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners created pressure but also opened the door for negotiations.By late April 2025, the US and India agreed on the Terms of Reference for a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), setting negotiation tracks for goods, services, digital commerce, and intellectual property protections. India offered to reduce tariffs on approximately $23 billion of US agricultural imports, while the US sought better access for manufactured goods, pharmaceuticals, and IT services. Both sides aimed to finalise the first phase of the deal by end of this year, with a goal to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.An important feature under discussion is India’s potential offer of a “forward most-favoured-nation” clause, which would grant the US any more favorable tariff terms India might extend to other countries, effectively future-proofing the agreement.Immigration remains a complex issue in Trump 2.0's India policy.While the administration has cracked down on illegal immigration, it supports legal pathways for Indian students and professionals. Approximately 3,50,000 Indian students currently study in the US, and the administration's support for green cards for international students is a positive sign.The Trump administration has intensified efforts to deport undocumented Indians, estimated at around 7,25,000, with about 20,000 already identified for repatriation.This crackdown has sparked controversy in India. The Cente has committed to legal immigration and cooperating on repatriation, and the issue was a key topic during PM Modi’s and Trump’s discussions in February.To address illegal immigration, both countries have agreed to combat trafficking networks exploiting Indian citizens seeking unauthorised entry into the US. Enhancements in visa processing, including opening new consulates in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, are planned to reduce visa wait times and curb illegal migration.JD Vance’s visit to India from April 21–24, 2025, marked the first US vice-presidential visit in 12 years, underscoring the importance of the bilateral relationship. His trip coincided with a 90-day pause on US tariffs, providing a window for intensive trade talks.Vance’s meetings with PM Modi and external affairs minister S. Jaishankar focused on finalising trade negotiation terms, expanding defense and technology collaborations, and reinforcing India’s role in the shared Indo-Pacific vision.Defense partnership has also reached new heights. The leaders committed to a decade-long framework to deepen military collaboration, with Trump offering advanced fighter jets and PM Modi affirming joint development, production, and technology transfer. Highlighting the strategic convergence amid Indo-Pacific security challenges, PM Modi said: ""India’s defense preparedness is crucial, and America plays a vital role in this.""Trump’s second term has continued to emphasise India’s role as a critical partner in the Indo-Pacific strategy, particularly in counterbalancing China’s growing influence. The administration has reinforced its commitment to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), which includes the US, India, Japan, and Australia, focusing on regional security and economic cooperation. This alignment reflects a shared interest in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific, with India’s strategic autonomy respected by the Trump administration, which avoids interference in India’s internal affairs-a departure from the more vocal approach of some Democratic lawmakers.The Trump administration’s approach to terrorism and radicalism also finds common ground with India, especially in light of recent terrorist incidents in the US and India’s long-standing battle against terrorism. This shared concern has paved the way for enhanced counterterrorism cooperation between the two nations.The period was also marked by heightened regional tensions following the deadly Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which targeted 26 tourists and was linked to Pakistan-based terrorist proxies.Following the Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration took a firm stance supporting India’s right to combat terrorism and maintain regional stability. The US underscored its commitment to working with India to counter terrorism emanating from Pakistan-based groups, signaling a tougher approach towards Pakistan compared to previous administrations.A US spokesperson emphasised, “The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” while reaffirming strong support for India’s fight against terrorism. PM Modi, addressing the nation, declared, “There is deep anguish in my heart... terrorists aimed to destabilize the region’s growing prosperity and peace,” promising severe consequences for the perpetrators.This shift reflects the broader strategic realignment in South Asia, with the US increasingly viewing India as a key partner in promoting peace and security in the region. The enhanced Indo-US cooperation on counterterrorism is expected to strengthen India’s position as a regional leader and contribute to stability in South Asia.Despite the turbulence in global trade and security, US-India ties have remained on an “even keel,” with New Delhi skillfully navigating the complexities of tariffs, immigration, and defense cooperation under Trump’s assertive second term.The relationship now stands as a pillar of stability and shared democratic values in an increasingly volatile world order.",The first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term in the White House have been nothing short of transformative for US-India relations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landmark visit to Washington in February became a defining moment for the tectonic shift. The leaders committed to a shared vision to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120783123,imgsize-133044,width-400,resizemode-4/PM-Modi-and-Trump.jpg"

Pakistan Senate Session-349 (Day-04) 29-04-2025

As India and Pakistan grapple with renewed tensions after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack , a video of Pakistani Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan making provocative remarks in Pakistan parliament has gone viral, fuelling diplomatic ire and social media outrage.In a fiery speech delivered in Pakistan’s Upper House on April 29, the senator declared, “The first brick of the new Babri mosque in Ayodhya will be laid by Pakistan Army soldiers, and the first azaan will be given by Army Chief Asim Munir himself.”The comments, invoking the Babri mosque demolished in 1992, came as part of a broader tirade laced with religious and militaristic rhetoric. Palwasha Khan, a member of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and deputy information secretary, suggested that the path was being laid for a “Muslim government, specifically a Pakistani Muslim government, in the Indian subcontinent.”“There is no doubt, this enmity is not with Pakistan or Pakistanis; this is enmity against Muslims and against Islam,” she said.Issuing a direct threat to India, she warned, “The Senate of Pakistan must send a message, if any hand reaches toward us, then the symbol of their power, the Red Fort of Delhi, will witness a bloodshed that its walls have never seen, and its ramparts will testify to it for centuries to come.”Khan, who represents Sindh in the Senate and previously served in the National Assembly from 2008 to 2013, emphasized that Pakistanis were not weak. “We are not wearing bangles,” she said.Quoting late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , she added, “We have guns, we have arms, we have trees—and if the enemy tries anything, we will hang their corpses from our trees.”Despite the hostile language, she claimed to have no quarrel with Indian citizens. “But let me be clear: we have no enmity with the people of India.”Khan also attempted to draw religious divides within the Indian armed forces, asserting, “The Sikh army will not attack Pakistan because it’s the land of Guru Nanak for them.”She went on to praise Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who is a designated terrorist under Indian law. “I want to salute Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who courageously declared that no Indian soldier will be allowed to cross into Pakistan from Indian Punjab.”Ending her speech with a call to arms, the senator proclaimed, “Our army is not just six or seven lakh soldiers, we have 250 million people who, when the time comes, will stand shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces and become soldiers themselves, God willing.”The speech has since circulated widely on social media platforms, drawing sharp reactions amid the already strained ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistani Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan made provocative remarks in Pakistan parliament.

The attack, carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists, has triggered a series of strong countermeasures from India.In response, government has taken several diplomatic and strategic steps, including suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, shutting down the Integrated Check Post at Attari, and moving to reduce the strength of high commissions.

""It appears the Telangana special forces, which were part of the operation initially, were not manning the escape routes on their side,"" said the officer.""This region was the bastion of top Naxal commanders like Hidma, Deva, Damodar, Azad and Sujata.

The 1991 batch IAS officer retired as additional chief secretary of transport department.BJP had flagged the Vadra-DLF deal as a symbol of corruption during its 2014 Lok Sabha campaign against the then UPA govt. But Khemka didn't quite become anyone's blue-eyed boy. While BJP came to govt at the Centre and the state, the bureaucrat remained a rolling stone, with no consequential assignment coming his way until the fag end of his career.

Most of his tenure, first under Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress govt and then BJP ministry, was spent in the archaeology and museums department.BJP had once cited Khemka's alleged persecution as a manifestation of Congress getting even with ""a whistleblower"". But even before the party had completed a year at the Centre since winning the 2024 polls, he was back in a purportedly inconsequential role.Khemka had vented on social media and written to the govt about ""mistreatment"" on several occasions. In a letter ex-Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar in 2019, he said some of his transfers at the time were ""not in public interest, but based on extraneous and personal considerations"".Referring to the DLF-Vadra land deal, which he cancelled after noticing alleged irregularities, Khemka had said: ""The promise made to the nation at the time of the 2014 elections is now forgotten.""""Governance is no longer a service; it is a business. Only a few fools like me will think and act like trustees of the public faith. Hoping against hope you will not throw this letter into the dustbin, I also request you to please accord me permission to write and seek an audience from the PM on the issue highlighted in this letter in public interest,"" he wrote.He was given a farewell by the IAS Officers Association in the presence of chief secretary Anurag Rastogi.Khemkatold TOI he planned to start a new innings as a lawyer.

Caste census BJP's bid to stop erosion of broader Hindu unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/caste-census-bjps-bid-to-stop-erosion-of-broader-hindu-unity/articleshow/120776485.cms,"NEW DELHI: The desire to negate efforts to retard broader Hindu consolidation appears to have played a major role in the decision of the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) to include caste enumeration in the next census. While political watchers are linking the move to assembly elections in Bihar, sources pointed out that the political field had been levelled in the state with the caste survey already completed.Besides, the move was closely associated with chief minister Nitish Kumar , BJP's alliance partner, leaving little space for RJD's Tejaswi Yadav to claim bragging rights. A major consideration appears to have been to check attempts to split Hindus on caste lines, a cause for concern for BJP and RSS, which has been working on Hindu consolidation since inception.Sources pointed out that the decision came hours after a one-on-one meeting between PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday, which capped parleys at different levels of the Sangh and BJP leadership.The electoral success of BJP over the last decade has been facilitated largely by agglomeration of many caste groups coming together with OBCs and upper castes making a common cause. Starting with the 2024 general elections there has been a concerted attempt to splinter the coalition by reviving the thesis of OBC-dalit-Muslim unity, which may have resulted in some groups moving towards the Mandal pillar. The latest move may help BJP arrest the drift and make fresh bridges.It was, however, not clear that the estimate of a nationalist resurgence, which will supplant any 'savarna' resentment over caste census, was part of the larger calculus. In addition, BJP insiders suggested the party stands on a stronger footing, having seized the main talking point from the opposition by taking the initiative, which Congress could not achieve despite its long governance tenure.They said that the party can rightfully claim that it has delivered while Congress only talked about it. While there was initial apprehension about the decision on caste enumeration, the overall assessment was that the caste surveys in some of the states had not caused much turbulence on the ground.BJP sources said that there was no ""unease"" as PM Modi is himself an OBC, while parties like Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal, are identified with dominant OBC castes, which can repel with polarisation of smaller castes against it. The party is also confident of upper caste support as it has already implemented a 10% quota for the economically weaker sections (EWS).Janata Dal (United) national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha also welcomed the move, calling it a significant step for the upliftment of deprived sections.

First sighted with the embedded snare in 2022, and rediscovered in Dec 2023, the tigress stunned forest officials who, as they prepared to dart her for rescue, witnessed her carrying a cub gently in her mouth, a moment that suspended the operation and reframed the story they thought they were about to tell.From the beginning, her case defied expectation. The metallic loop had lodged itself deep in her lumbosacral region, an area crucial for mobility and balance. Yet, despite the physical restrictions - and the internal damage that experts later suspected - she moved through her habitat with enough stealth and strength to hunt, mate, conceive, and rear a litter. Drone surveillance launched after the interrupted rescue attempt confirmed what seemed almost improbable: four cubs, nursed and nurtured, thriving in her care.Today, three of those cubs, now around sixteen months old, roam the forest with their mother, who continues to hunt and provide for them with a tenacity that belies the injury written into her body. To the team observing her, and to the wider circle of wildlife biologists, her survival - and that of her cubs - has become a living case study in endurance, adaptation, and the hidden margins of possibility in the wild.At the Wildlife Institute of India, where a detailed plan for her future is under discussion, Dr Parag Nigam told TOI that the need to rescue the tigress remained urgent. ""The metallic snare poses serious physical and spinal risks that could worsen with time,"" he said, adding that her images would be sent to WII's tiger cell to cross-reference her history with national tiger databases.Veterinary experts studying her case noted the narrow anatomical escape that had allowed her to survive and reproduce. Dr R K Singh, former veterinary head of Kanpur zoo, explained that the snare's position likely spared her kidneys and ovaries, trapping mostly the intestinal loops instead.","A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare continued to survive and give birth to healthy cubs.

Centre's big caste census move: Masterstroke or political compulsion?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centres-big-caste-census-move-masterstroke-or-political-compulsion/articleshow/120770419.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Caste census , which has been a key demand of several opposition parties in the last many elections, will finally be a reality with the Centre on Wednesday announcing nationwide caste count along with the next population census.The government, which had till now strongly resisted opposition demands for a caste census, justified its U-turn, citing the ""political and non-transparent"" caste enumeration being conducted by some opposition-ruled states in the name of surveys.Announcing the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the census comes under the purview of the Centre, but some states have done caste enumeration in ""non-transparent"" manner, which has created doubts in society.""Considering all these facts and to ensure that the social fabric is not disturbed by politics, caste enumeration should be transparently included in the census instead of surveys,"" the Union minister said.However, the opposition was quick to claim victory and, as expected, there were many credit-takers within their ranks. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , who had made caste census a key issue in the last several elections and was very aggressive with his attacks on the government, welcomed the ""sudden"" decision and said, ""We want people's census, not bureaucrats' census.""""We had said in Parliament that we will make the caste census happen. We had also said that we would scrap the 50 per cent cap, the artificial wall that is in place. Narendra Modi used to say that there are just four castes. Don't know what happened but suddenly after 11 years, caste census has been announced. We completely support it, but we want a timeline. We want to know that by when this will happen,"" Rahul said.The Congress leader was also quick to pitchfork the party-ruled Telangana model of caste census as a blueprint for the national count. ""This is the first step. Telangana has become a model in caste census and it can become a blueprint. We offer our support to the government in designing the caste census. There are two examples - Bihar's and Telangana's and there is a vast difference between the two,"" he added.RJD chief Lalu Prasad said that the Centre's decision is yet another example of how socialist ideas, once dismissed or ridiculed, are eventually adopted by mainstream political forces.""What we socialists proposed 30 years ago -- be it reservation, caste census, equality, fraternity, secularism -- others take decades to follow. There is still a long way to go. But make no mistake -- we will keep making these Sanghis dance to our agenda,"" Lalu Yadav said.Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP John Brittas claimed the government has done a ""volte-face"" in view of the upcoming Bihar elections ""Welcome the caste census, though it is a reversal looking at the Bihar elections. The PM had said he only recognised four castes -- the poor, youth, women, and farmers!! This volte-face is ok but this nation has been denied of the census which was due in 2021!"" he said.The Centre's decision to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census exercise was a ""hard-earned victory"" for the DMK and Tamil Nadu government, said Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin.The DMK chief said: ""After the failure of all its attempts to deny and delay the much-needed caste enumeration, the Union BJP Government has finally announced that it will be conducted along with the forthcoming Census. But key questions remain unanswered - when will the Census begin? When will it conclude?""""The same Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) who once accused opposition parties of dividing people on caste has now yielded to the very demand, he maligned repeatedly,"" the Tamil Nadu CM said.Caste census was essential, but not optional, for objective policymaking, targeted welfare, and the pursuit of real social justice. ""You cannot remedy injustice without first recognising its scale,"" he added.For the Tamil Nadu government and DMK, this was a hard-earned victory. ""We were the first to adopt a resolution in the Legislative Assembly demanding caste census. We championed this cause in every forum. We reiterated this demand in every meeting with the Prime Minister and through multiple letters, consistently urging the Union Government to take responsibility,"" Stalin said.Ironically, several allies of the BJP in the NDA also welcomed the Centre's decision.The JD(U) said it was its president and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who created a favourable ground for the development by carrying out a caste survey in Bihar. Its working president, Sanjay Kumar Jha, said the decision will help make a programme for the deprived sections of the society more focussed.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan said it is an important decision in national interest, saying that his party had long called for it. The decision will be a big step in the country's equitable development, the Union minister said, adding that caste census will help ""make more just and focused policies"". Paswan said that ""misleading claims"" were made about relations between him and the central government over the issue, and that the decision is a clear answer to such rumours.Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde called the government's decision a historic milestone in the country's journey towards social justice that will help in the equitable distribution of resources. ""The caste census will usher in a new era of social justice by enabling accurate policy-making based on the actual demographic data of different castes,"" Shinde said.Several BJP leaders and Union ministers welcomed the government's move and slammed the Congress for its double standards on the issue.Home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda and a host of other leaders, including the party's OBC faces, lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan describing it as an unprecedented development towards the cause of social justice.Now, contrast this to what Prime Minister Modi had said on caste census when 26 opposition parties led by the Congress under the INDIA bloc had passed a resolution in favour of caste census.""The Congress is trying to create a divide among people in the name of caste, language and region in its attempt to regain power,"" the Prime Minister had said in February 2024 at an election rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Jhabua district.Clearly, with the opposition's relentless caste census pitch, the BJP seems to have made a course correction. The saffron party will hope that this move will leave the opposition bereft of an important election plank, especially in Bihar, where elections are due later this year. The opposition, meanwhile, will not just claim victory but will also claim that its consistent pressure had forced the government to change its stand on an important social issue. As Rahul Gandhi claimed, ""we have shown that we can pressure the government.""","Caste census has been a key demand of several opposition parties in the last many elections. The government justified its U-turn, citing the ""political and non-transparent"" caste enumeration being conducted by some opposition-ruled states in the name of surveys.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120771259,imgsize-239898,width-400,resizemode-4/Image-generated-by-AI-for-representation-.jpg"

Historical context

British India (1881–1931) : The British administration included caste in decadal censuses to categorise the population by caste, religion, and occupation.

: The newly independent Indian government, led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, stopped caste enumeration to avoid reinforcing social divisions. 1961 directive: The central government allowed states to compile OBC lists based on their own surveys, but no national caste census was conducted.

How it became a political issue

Mandal Commission (1980) : The recommendation for 27% OBC reservation brought caste data into sharp political focus. The absence of updated caste figures made implementation difficult and contentious.

SECC 2011 : Though this UPA-era effort collected caste data, the findings were never fully released or utilised, prompting criticism.

: Though this UPA-era effort collected caste data, the findings were never fully released or utilised, prompting criticism. State-level surveys: In recent years, states like Bihar, Telangana, and Karnataka conducted their own caste surveys to guide welfare schemes and reservations. Bihar's 2023 survey found that OBCs and Extremely Backward Classes made up more than 63% of its population.

Why caste census matters

What next?

NEW DELHI: Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during British rule from 1881 to 1931. However, with the first census of independent India in 1951, the government chose to discontinue the practice, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).By 1961, the central government permitted states to conduct their own surveys and compile state-specific lists of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), if they wished.More than six decades later, amid growing political and social demands, the government has now approved the inclusion of caste enumeration in the upcoming nationwide census.The last attempt at caste data collection at a national level took place in 2011 through the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), intended to assess the socio-economic condition of households alongside caste information.A caste census involves systematically recording individuals’ caste identities during a national census. In India, where caste influences social, economic, and political life, such data can offer valuable insights into the distribution and socio-economic status of various caste groups. This information can help shape policies related to affirmative action and social justice.Beyond statistics, the caste census has deep social and political implications.According to activists, the data could help redesign affirmative action policies , improve representation, and address entrenched inequalities.“Much of access to essential services in India—education, healthcare, nutrition, and social protection—is shaped by structural inequalities of caste, region, religion, and economic status. A caste census is critical to uncover these intersectional disparities and to design policies and programs that are truly equitable and inclusive,” Poonam Muttreja, executive director, population foundation of India told news agency PTI.While some view the caste census as necessary to uplift marginalised communities, others argue it may reinforce caste divisions.The decision marks a major shift after more than 70 years of hesitation. However, details on how the data will be collected, categorised, and applied are yet to be clarified.The move is expected to significantly influence governance, electoral politics, and India's broader battle against inequality. A timeline for the census exercise has not been announced.","Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during British rule from 1881 to 1931.

Yet, today the community finds itself orphaned once again in the national conscience,” Tickoo said.Alleging that “the so-called candle march brigades” have not lifted a finger or spoken a word to recognise the renewed existential threat to the community, he said: “Let it be amply clear that a callous attitude on part of either the Union govt or the local administration is no longer an option. Prevention, protection and proactive safeguarding measures are the only workable options left. This is not just about increased deployment of quick reaction teams or increased security measures; this is about making our right to life, dignity and presence in our own ancestral land non-negotiable.”“The Kashmiri Pandit community has maintained the civilisational spirit of Kashmir for centuries. But if the State lets us down once again, history will note not only the silence of our oppressors but also the indifference of those constitutionally bound to defend us,” Tickoo said.","Kashmiri Pandit organisation on Wednesday threatened permanent migration of the community from Kashmir Valley. “We are seriously concerned and pained to the core with the recent intelligence reports suggesting an imminent danger to Kashmiri Pandits and non-Muslim migrant labourers in Kashmir Valley,” Sanjay Tickoo said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120774049,imgsize-1431966,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

It also directed Nagpur bench to expedite proceedings in the original 2019 election petition, which has been pending for over five years, the petitioners' counsel Shakul Ghatole told TOI.The case stems from accusations that Gadkari, while filing his nomination in 2019, failed to fully disclose his assets and under-reported campaign expenditure, allegedly violating the Representation of People Act, 1951. In response, Gadkari filed a plea seeking deletion of certain paragraphs from the petition.Khan's counsel argued that HC prematurely purged substantive content from the petition and failed to assess pleadings holistically. He cited precedents to assert that arguable claims should not be struck down solely on perceived weakness. SC found no merit in these submissions and upheld HC's reasoning, reiterating that courts are empowered to eliminate material that is unnecessary or obstructive to fair adjudication.","The case stems from accusations that Gadkari, while filing his nomination in 2019, failed to fully disclose his assets and under-reported campaign expenditure, allegedly violating the Representation of People Act, 1951.

Rekhi sought the boy's release from what he called the illegal custody of the mother, who had taken the child while his father was away on a business trip to Belgium.""For an act to amount to kidnapping, it is necessary that the minor is taken from the custody of a ' lawful guardian '.

The petitioner also alleged she intended to take the child to Australia, where she currently resides.The mother told the court she came to India because the boy had been left in the care of house help and had requested her presence. She produced call logs and messages exchanged with the child and argued that as his mother and natural guardian, she retains custody rights until the pending guardianship case before Gurgaon family court is resolved.""It would be just and prudent for this court to take into account the wishes and well-being of the detenu, who is 12 years old, and capable of forming a rational opinion about his living situation,"" the HC said, siding with the mother.","Punjab and Haryana HC rules a parent cannot be charged with kidnapping her own child.

Courts can modify arbitral awards: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-can-modify-arbitral-awards-sc/articleshow/120776743.cms,"NEW DELHI: Settling divergent judicial pronouncements on the scope of judicial interference in an arbitral award, a five-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday said that to avoid protracted litigation, courts have powers to modify an award to sustain it by severing the 'invalid' portion from its 'valid' part rather than quashing it entirely.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna , CJI-designate B R Gavai and Justices Sanjay Kumar, K V Viswanthan and A G Masih was grappling with a long-standing grey area - when the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, does not expressly permit courts to modify or vary an arbitral award, should courts strike down awards even when it could be saved by minor modifications? Under Section 34 of the Act, a court can only strike down an award.Writing the 37-page 4:1 majority judgment, CJI Khanna said, ""We are of the opinion that modification represents a more limited, nuanced power in comparison to the annulment of an award, as the latter entails a more severe consequence of the award being voided in toto.""""The limited and restricted power of severing an award implies a power of the court to vary or modify the award. It will be wrong to argue that silence in the 1996 Act, as projected, should be read as a complete prohibition,"" he said. Justice Viswanathan penned a 130-page dissent and said courts do not have the power to modify an award as the parties had eschewed the path of litigation to go for arbitration.CJI Khanna said, ""We are thus of the opinion that the court can apply the doctrine of severability and modify a portion of the award while retaining the rest. This is subject to parts of the award being separable, legally and practically.""The majority judgment said courts can also correct clerical, computational and typographical errors apparent in the award and modify the post-award interest rate. CJI Khanna said striking down an award in its totality just because there was no agreement over rate of interest would cause grave prejudice to parties, who would then have to undergo a fresh round of arbitration.""This limited power is significant, as it can help avoid further rounds of litigation. Without it, the court may be forced to set aside the entire award or order a fresh round of arbitration because of an erroneous interest rate rather than simply adjusting this rate,"" the CJI said.Referring to the extraordinary powers of SC under Article 142 of the Constitution, which enables it to pass any order for the purpose of doing complete justice, the five-judge bench sounded a caution and said this power must be exercised with great care and caution while dealing with arbitral awards .","The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, does not expressly permit courts to modify or vary an arbitral award.

Man loses interim custody of daughter for failing to give home-cooked food during her stay with him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-loses-interim-custody-of-daughter-for-failing-to-give-home-cooked-food-during-her-stay-with-him/articleshow/120776711.cms,"AI generated image

NEW DELHI: A man lost interim custody of his eight-year-old daughter, ordered by Kerala HC to stay with her estranged parents alternatively for 15 days in a month, for not being able to provide home-cooked food even for a single day during the stay with him.After interacting with the child, a bench of SC Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta found several reasons - the girl not getting home-cooked food, separated from her three-year-old brother, and no one except father for company - for quashing the HC order on the ground that even though he is a doting father, the surroundings and circumstances at his place is not conducive for her.The man, working at Singapore, had rented out a place in Thiruvananthapuram and used to fly down every month to be with his daughter.Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""Continued consumption of food procured from restaurants/hotels would pose a health hazard, even to a grown-up person, what to talk of a tender aged child of eight years. The child requires nutritious home-cooked food for her overall well-being, growth and development. Unfortunately, the father is not in a position to provide such nutrition to the child.""SC said it would have considered asking the father to provide home-cooked food, but ""the fact that the child gets no company whatsoever except for that of the father during the interim custody period of 15 days is an additional factor which weighs heavily against his claim for the child's custody at this stage.""Finding the mother works from home and has her parents with her, SC said the girl would get better company at mother's place in addition to the company of her brother.SC also frowned at the HC order granting 15-day custody every month of the three year-old son to the man, terming it ""grossly unjustified"" which could have serious adverse effect on the emotional and physical well-being of the son being forced to be separated from the mother at a tender age.""Hence, the emotional and moral support which the child gets at her mother's home is manifold than what is being provided by the father during the interim custody period. The period of 15 days during which the daughter would be with the father would also lead to deprivation of her company to her sibling, the boy child aged three years,"" it said.SC allowed the man to get interim custody of the daughter on alternate Saturdays and Sundays of every month and interact with them on video call two days every week. ""On either of these two days, father will be entitled to meet & have interim custody of the child for a period of four hours subject to the comfort of the child and under supervision of a child counsellor,"" it said.","A man lost interim custody of his eight-year-old daughter, ordered by Kerala HC to stay with her estranged parents alternatively for 15 days in a month.

New Delhi: Ruling that right to digital access is an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to life and liberty , Supreme Court Wednesday said it is a constitutional imperative for the Centre and its authorities to bridge the digital divide faced by large sections of the country's rural population, senior citizens, economically weaker communities, linguistic minorities and differently-abled persons.SC passed a slew of directions to revise the current KYC process for visually- and hearing-impaired users, and to develop alternative formats - including Braille and voice-enabled services - to ensure accessibility for all.At this juncture, we may also wish to observe that in the contemporary era, where access to essential services, governance, education, healthcare and economic opportunities is increasingly mediated through digital platforms, the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution must be reinterpreted in light of these technological realities. The digital divide — characterised by unequal access to digital infrastructure, skills, and content — continues to perpetuate systemic exclusion, not only of persons with disabilities, but also of large sections of rural populations, senior citizens, economically weaker communities, and linguistic minorities. The principle of substantive equality demands that digital transformation be both inclusive and equitable,” Supreme Court said.Justice R Mahadevan, who penned the verdict for the bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala, on petitions filed by two acid attack victims who suffer facial disfigurement and 100% blindness, said that true inclusion requires that technological advancements accommodate the diverse needs of all citizens, thereby fostering an environment where no individual is left behind. The petitioners alleged that they are facing difficulties in completing the digital KYC/e-KYC process due to their inability to click a “live photograph” by blinking and which has prevented them from opening a bank account and purchasing a SIM card from the telecom providers.Allowing their plea, the bench directed govt authorities including RBI to issue guidelines to adopt alternative modes for verifying the “liveness” or capturing a “live photograph” of the customers for the purpose of conducting digital KYC to ensure inclusivity and user-convenience. It also ordered them to continue with the paper-based KYC process.“Bridging the digital divide is no longer merely a matter of policy discretion but has become a constitutional imperative to secure a life of dignity, autonomy and equal participation in public life. Right to digital access, therefore, emerges as an intrinsic component of right to life and liberty, necessitating that State proactively design and implement inclusive digital ecosystems that serve not only privileged but also the marginalised, those who have been historically excluded,” it said.","SC passed a slew of directions to revise the current KYC process for visually- and hearing-impaired users, and to develop alternative formats - including Braille and voice-enabled services. “The principle of substantive equality demands that digital transformation be both inclusive and equitable,” Supreme Court said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120776603,imgsize-157042,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

KOLKATA: A six-storey hotel nestled within central Kolkata's congested Mechhua wholesale fruit market caught fire on Tuesday evening, quickly turning into a gas chamber that killed 14 people trapped inside, 13 of them guests.All the victims, barring a staffer who jumped to his death in a bid to escape the smoke and another who suffered fatal burns, died of asphyxiation, officials said. Three of the deceased were from a Chennai family that had returned the previous night from a holiday in Darjeeling and Sikkim.Malfunctioning smoke detectors and sprinklers in the 42-room Rituraj Hotel with 88 guests accentuated how unsafe the building was, police said. The hotel had been allegedly functioning over the past three years without the stipulated NOC from fire services department.The fire is suspected to have started in the banquet area on the first floor that was being converted into a dance bar. The state govt set up a special investigation team to probe the blaze after unapproved structural changes were detected within the building, whose owners are absconding.Fire brigade officials said they received the first call from the hotel at 8.10pm Tuesday, shortly after staffer Manoj Kumar Paswan leapt off a ledge and became the first victim. It was only after seeing him jump that locals realised the hotel was on fire.“Since all the windows on the first floor and that of several rooms in the floors above were sealed, nobody outside realised the hotel had caught fire till around 30 minutes later. Inside the hotel, too, guests and hotel staff did not get wind of the blaze till smoke filled the stairwell, corridors, and started seeping into the rooms,” a fireman said.Fire brigade personnel were able to enter the hotel only five hours later. They found 12 people dead in the rooms and the corridor. Another victim collapsed and died after reaching the terrace. Post-mortem reports suggested they died of carbon monoxide poisoning.CM Mamata Banerjee , who was in the sea resort of Digha, took stock of search and rescue efforts with Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim and police commissioner Manoj Verma. “Investigation has been ordered. My condolences to the victim families and solidarity for all affected,” she wrote on X.PM Narendra Modi condoled the deaths and announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each of the victims and Rs 50,000 for each of those injured.Hakim said Wednesday that illegal portions of the hotel would be demolished.","All the victims, barring a staffer who jumped to his death in a bid to escape the smoke and another who suffered fatal burns, died of asphyxiation.

Caste census move comes a day after PM-Bhagwat meet



New Delhi: In a politically significant and surprising move, the Modi govt Wednesday decided to include caste enumeration in the upcoming decennial census, a first such exercise in more than 90 years. The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) decision should also clear the way for the much-awaited census.It comes ahead of elections in caste-sensitive Bihar and amid a govt-opposition tussle over leadership of the numerically predominant and politically significant OBC community . It also snatches a major talking point from Congress, especially with Rahul Gandhi repeatedly taking it up and making it virtually the chief issue in the opposition's armoury.At a press conference, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Congress talked about it - with then PM Manmohan Singh telling LS that the matter will be considered by the cabinet - but did not act.During UPA tenure, a socio-economic and caste census had been done and later, some states, including Bihar, Telangana and Karnataka, have undertaken surveys.Vaishnaw accused some of the opposition-led states of conducting caste surveys for political reasons and said Modi govt had resolved to transparently include caste enumeration in the forthcoming pan-India census exercise. “This demonstrates that our govt is committed to the values and interests of our society and country, like in the past when our govt had introduced 10% quota for the economically weaker sections of the society without causing stress in any section of society,” he said.In a post on X, home minister Amit Shah called it “a message of strong commitment towards social equality and rights of every section”. Rahul described it as a “sudden decision” that came after it was opposed by the ruling party for 11 years. “We support this completely, but we want a timeline. We want to know by when it will be done,” he said.BJP fielded big guns from OBC community, including agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Dharmendra Pradhan to describe it as a decision towards ensuring social justice . Coming months before Bihar polls, the CCPA decision has injected a new element into the political scenario and opposition will no longer be able to blame govt for opposing a caste census. It came a day after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat met PM Modi.Sources said the questions on caste and sub-castes would be part of the national census expected next year.

Former RAW chief to head revamped national security advisory board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/former-raw-chief-to-head-revamped-national-security-advisory-board/articleshow/120776092.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days after the Pahalgam terror attack, in which a Pakistan link has emerged during investigations, the Centre has reconstituted the National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), appointing former RAW chief Alok Joshi as its chairman and 14 other domain experts that include ex-commanders from the three armed forces, former diplomats, officers and technocrats.NSAB, tasked with undertaking long-term analysis of and providing perspective to the Prime Minister-led National Security Council on issues related to national security, now has 15 serving members. The other new members appointed are former Western Air Commander Air Marshal P M Sinha, former Southern Army Commander Lt Gen A K Singh and Rear Admiral (Retd) Monty Khanna, former IPS officers Rajiv Ranjan Verma and Manmohan Singh, and former diplomat B Venkatesh Varma. NSAB also comprises technical experts like Prof K Kamakoti and B S Murthy.The board is reconstituted from time to time, with appointments usually for a two-year term. The members' tenures do not run concurrently.The decision to get Joshi, a top intelligence brain - who served in the Intelligence Bureau before he joined RAW and retired as its director, and then went on to head the country's technical intelligence agency, National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), post-retirement - to lead the NSAB comes at a time when India is bracing to give a befitting response to Pakistan for continuing to sponsor terrorism in J&K by facilitating recurrent attacks on innocent civilians, the Pahalgam carnage by Pakistani terrorists, facilitated by local Kashmir aides, being the most recent.With the carnage being seen as an intelligence failure, bringing in Joshi, in place of ex-ambassador to Russia P S Raghavan who has been at the helm for almost 8-9 years now, is seen as a clear move to focus the national security policy on revamping intelligence gathering and analysis to foil any future terror misadventures by Pakistani elements.","NSAB, tasked with undertaking long-term analysis of and providing perspective to the Prime Minister-led National Security Council on issues related to national security, now has 15 serving members.

Like Father, Like Son



Khalistanis Lose



There’s a maxim that goes:The opposite is also true —And while the main story of the last Canadian election was that the Liberals managed to win after dropping Justin Trudeau like a stale waffle, the tangent that matters most for New Delhi is the amputation of the Khalistani gangrene that had infected Canadian politics.Not so long ago, Canadian politicians embraced Khalistanis with the enthusiasm of uncles hugging the bartender at a wedding reception. But if the 2025 result is any indication, the times are a-changin’.Let’s rewind.The Khalistan movement was born in blood and delusion. In the 1980s, it took tens of thousands of Indian lives, culminating in the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the bombing of Air India Flight 182, which also killed scores of Canadian citizens. It was a terror attack that shook the world, long before 9/11.It was terrorism dressed up as liberation. And while the fires died down in Punjab, they kept flickering in suburban gurdwaras across the West. Diaspora extremism exported a failed revolution — foreign passports in one hand, anti-India posters in the other.Enter Canada: the Disneyland of diaspora radicalism. Trudeau’s Liberals treated Sikh extremism not as a national security threat, but as an ethnic mood board for vote-bank politics. His office deleted references to Sikh extremism from terrorism reports. Cabinet ministers smiled beside float parades featuring Indira Gandhi’s assassination. And when known terrorists like Gurpatwant Singh Pannun threatened violence, Trudeau’s government responded with mumbling about ""freedom of expression.""Then came Hardeep Singh Nijjar. When the Khalistani terrorist was gunned down in 2023, Trudeau broke diplomatic sound barriers to accuse India — without a shred of proof, a move that backfired spectacularly and made him a global meme, thanks mostly to the perennially online members of India armed with the world’s cheapest internet and knowledge of English. In fact, if one simply read about Nijjar from Canadian or American outlets, one would have assumed Nijjar was a loving plumber who doubled up as an activist, gurdwara worker, and scrubber of kitchens — which all failed to mention that Nijjar had even gone to Pakistan for arms training.Of course, the son's move was hardly surprising, considering that Pierre Trudeau had once refused to extradite Talwinder Singh Parmar — a prominent Khalistani terrorist and co-founder of Babbar Khalsa International. Parmar was wanted in India for the murder of two Punjab Police officers. The Canadian government's refusal hinged on the technicality that India recognised the British monarch only as Head of the Commonwealth, not as Head of State. Canada argued that the Commonwealth extradition protocols therefore didn’t apply. Parmar remained in Canada and went on to mastermind the 1985 Air India Flight 182 bombing — the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history, killing 329 people, including 268 Canadian citizens. Trudeau's own intelligence chiefs later admitted they had no hard evidence. His Five Eyes allies blinked nervously. Even the Americans — never shy of sticking fingers into sovereign pies — politely urged Canada cooperate.India, meanwhile, acted like the adult in the room. It didn’t roar. It didn’t flinch. It simply waited — like a seasoned poker player watching a drunk bluff on an empty hand. Trudeau expelled Indian diplomats. India returned the favour. Trade talks froze. Visas stalled. And Ottawa suddenly realised that when you pick a fight with the world’s fifth-largest economy, you’d better have more than just moral indignation.And then the collapse came. Jagmeet Singh , the turbaned torchbearer of Khalistani sympathy, went from kingmaker to cautionary tale. He lost his seat . It was a fitting end for a politician whose rise to NDP leadership raised some questions over the leadership process.Back in 2017, Jagmeet Singh won the NDP leadership largely on the strength of new members signed up by his campaign — a victory some party veterans quietly questioned. While overall turnout was just 52.8%, Singh’s recruits showed up in force, handing him 53.8% on the first ballot. The three other candidates, backed more by traditional NDP members, were left trailing. It was an early sign of how identity politics and bloc sign-ups could tilt the internal balance of Canadian parties — and, in Singh’s case, how factions sympathetic to Khalistani rhetoric could find their way to the top through mobilisation rather than broad consensus.Come 2025, and the NDP lost official party status. Voters made it clear: backing separatist rhetoric isn’t multiculturalism — it’s madness. The Liberal Party, already battered by amateur-hour foreign policy, watched Trudeau shuffle off into political sunset, his India gambit having detonated in his face.But let’s not kid ourselves. The rot wasn’t limited to the Liberals. All Canadian parties — from Poilievre’s Conservatives to Singh’s NDP — played footsie with extremism. No one wanted to say the quiet part out loud: that Khalistani ideology, once draped in the language of rights and victimhood, had mutated into a cover for hate politics. Posters calling for violence against Indian diplomats. Temple attacks. Social media clips declaring Canada a settler state that must be decolonised — by whose army, one wonders?The intellectual decay ran even deeper. Canadian gurdwaras ran “referendums” on Punjab's independence with the zeal of a rogue polling booth. Academia became a launchpad for agitprop masquerading as scholarship. Cultural events hosted masked radicals shouting slogans louder than their logic. Meanwhile, Indian consulates were stormed, Hindu temples graffitied — and Ottawa responded with bromides about tolerance.Through it all, India played the long game. Officials repeated a single line like a mantra: “We have not received any credible evidence.” Translated: prove it or pipe down.Now, with Trudeau out, Mark Carney in, and a battered NDP nursing its wounds, New Delhi will smile quietly at the long game it has played in this diplomatic kerfuffle where it refused to give Canada the legitimacy it sought. When PM Narendra Modi tweeted post the election to congratulate Mark Carney, there was a particular phrase that found its way into the official wording.One assumes quiet diplomacy will be underway soon as India and Canada recalibrate after the flights of fancy of the Trudeau era.Let’s be clear: this was never about all Sikhs. It was about a fringe movement that hijacked microphones in gurdwaras, manipulated victimhood, and wore the garb of human rights while chanting the slogans of insurrection. They paraded images of Indira Gandhi’s assassination not as history, but as prophecy. They treated terror as theatre. And for too long, Canada applauded from the balcony.But the curtain has now fallen. The West’s most Khalistan-friendly democracy just issued a political restraining order. India didn’t gloat. It didn’t need to. The Khalistan project in Canada didn’t end with a bang. It ended with a ballot — and a very loud silence from Ottawa. Good riddance to bad proxies. As Hillary Clinton famously said all those years ago when words mattered in the corridors of power: ""You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them to only bite your neighbour."" Hopefully, it’s a lesson Canada will heed going forward.","The Khalistan movement was born in blood and delusion.

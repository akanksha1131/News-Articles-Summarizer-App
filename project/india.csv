NEW DELHI: The Centre has tasked a high-powered committee with reviewing and restructuring Association of Indian Universities (AIU) to align its mandate with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the proposed reforms under the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI).The move comes amid efforts to streamline governance of higher education, enhance institutional autonomy, and establish a globally competitive ecosystem for Indian universities, reports Manash Gohain.The committee will submit its report within six months, during which AIU has been advised to maintain status quo.The committee, chaired by Anil Sahasrabudhe, head of National Educational Technology Forum, is expected to examine AIU's role in the evolving regulatory landscape and suggest how it can support universities as they transition to HECI's unified framework. Its members include V Kamakoti, director, IIT-Madras; Nageshwar Rao, former VC, IGNOU; Shashikala Wanjari, VC, NIEPA; S Vidhyasubramaniam, VC, Sastra; and Pankaj Mittal, secretary general, AIU.AIU, founded in 1925, has for long coordinated functioning of universities, evaluated foreign degrees, and promoted sports and cultural initiatives.However, with NE envisioning a single regulator for higher education through HECI, AIU's operational structure and functions are being reassessed.""The committee will examine operational issues and AIU's future role, including whether it should come under HECI,"" a member told TOI. ""AIU's robust institutional network could be leveraged for global engagement and recognition of qualifications under the new system.""The restructuring also follows University Grants Commission 's notification of the Recognition and Grant of Equivalence to Qualifications Obtained from Foreign Educational Institutions Regulations, 2025. The framework seeks to establish a standardised and transparent process for recognising foreign academic degrees in India, bolstering the government's ""Study in India"" initiative.","The move comes amid efforts to streamline governance of higher education.

NEW DELHI: Government should never be a hurdle and should always be a facilitator of growth, PM Narendra Modi said on Saturday while virtually distributing 51,000 appointment letters for central government jobs, with this over 10 lakh recruitment letters have been issued through Rozgar melas since October 2022.Addressing the new recruits, PM Modi said the world acknowledges that India has two limitless strengths, one in demography and the other in democracy, the largest youth population and the world's biggest democracy.""This power of youth is both the greatest asset and the strongest guarantee for Bharat's bright future. Our government is working day and night to turn this strength into a formula for prosperity.""Modi said every individual deserves the opportunity to move ahead and it's the responsibility of the government to extend a helping hand. ""And you, my friends, are young. I have great faith in you. I have high expectations from you. Wherever you're assigned, you must always put the citizens first. Helping them, easing their difficulties-that alone will push the nation forward rapidly.""Modi said besides giving permanent government jobs, his administration is also focusing on creating new employment opportunities in the private sector.Referring to the recent Cabinet decision on the Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme, he said the government will provide Rs 15,000 to a youth getting their first job in the private sector, which means the first month's salary of such employees will be borne by the government.For this, Rs 1 lakh crore has been allocated, he said.Highlighting a recently released report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Modi said it found more than 90 crore citizens in India have been brought under the umbrella of welfare schemes over the last decade, which is essentially an expansion of social security. He also spoke about the achievement of nearly 25 crore people rising out of poverty by ""defeating poverty with their strength and courage"".The PM said global institutions like the World Bank are openly praising India for this achievement and it's now being ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of equality. ""This means inequality is decreasing rapidly, and we are moving toward greater equality. The world is now taking note of this transformation,"" he said.","PM Narendra Modi said government should never be a hurdle and should always be a facilitator of growth.

'FUEL CUT OFF': Air India Boeing 787 Crash TRUTH Out; PROBE Reveals 'ACTUAL CAUSE' | Details

Poll Considering the information provided, what do you believe should be the priority for aviation safety moving forward? Enforcing all safety recommendations, even if advisory Improving aircraft technology and fault detection systems

The question is, what was the microprocessor status on the AI B787 that crashed?





MUMBAI: Three seconds after Air India flight AI-171 lifted off Ahmedabad runway on June 12, the fuel to both engines of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (VT-ANB) cut off. Within a time gap of one second, fuel to both engines was cut off. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why he cut off the fuel supply. The other pilot responded that he did not do so.""SEE ALSO: The big question in Air India Crash: If pilots didn’t cut fuel, what caused both engines to shut down mid-air? Experts say 'cockpit conversation is alarming' This is the most crucial bit of information in the 15-page preliminary report into the fatal Air India accident that killed 270 people. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) released the report to the public in the early hours of Saturday.The big questions are: If the pilots didn’t cut off the fuel, then how did the fuel supply to both engines cut off during the most crucial phase of flight? Was it a technical problem with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner? The only other logical possibility is one of the pilots cutting off the fuel supply and saying he didn’t.The investigation report veers towards aircraft issue. It refers to a 2018 bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator on fuel switch malfunction.The AAIB report says that Air India did not carry out the relevant inspection recommended in the bulletin as it was not mandatory.The final report into the accident which will be released by June 12, 2026 will likely give the answers and reveal the probable causes of the accident.The aircraft started rolling at 08:07:37 UTC. As per the EAFR (the digital flight data recorder) data, the aircraft crossed the take-off decision speed V1 and achieved 153 kts IAS at 08:08:33 UTC. This is the speed at which a take-off should be continued and should not be aborted for any reason.This is the sequence of events put down in the AAIB report.The Vr speed (155 kts) was achieved as per the EAFR at 08:08:35 UTC. The Vr speed is the speed at which the pilots pull back the control column to lift the nose and lift off the ground.The aircraft air/ground sensors transitioned to air mode, consistent with lift-off at 08:08:39 UTC. The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC, and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cut-off switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec.The Engine N1 and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off.""The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15).No significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall,"" the report says.While the commander of the flight had over 15,000 hours of flying experience, including about 8,600 hours on the B787, the co-pilot had 3,400 hours of flying experience. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF), and the PIC was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for the flight.The investigation has noted the relevance of US aviation regulator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33, issued in December 2018. It highlighted reports from operators regarding potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature in Boeing aircraft, including the B787-8 fitted with similar part numbers.Although the SAIB did not result in an Airworthiness Directive (AD) and was advisory in nature, it recommended inspection of the fuel control switch installations to ensure proper locking function.""As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory,"" the report said. Records indicate that VT-ANB underwent throttle control module replacements in 2019 and 2023, unrelated to fuel control switch faults, and no subsequent fuel control switch defects were documented after 2023, it added.""At this stage of the investigation, no definitive cause has been determined, and no immediate safety recommendations have been issued to B787-8 or GEnx-1B engine operators,"" it said, adding that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of India, supported by NTSB-USA, Boeing, GE, FAA, and other international stakeholders, continues a detailed investigation focused on engineering, human factors, and system interactions.TOI spoke to senior commanders and examiners, and they referred to another service bulletin issued jointly by FAA and GE (engine manufacturer) in 2021.Service Bulletin FAA-2021-0273-0013 Attachment 2 recommends the replacement of the ""MN4 microprocessor on ECU"" with respect to engine fuel and control. It states: ""This recommendation is to address a condition that may affect Flight Safety... Accumulated thermal cycles of the EEC with age causes the solder ball to fail.""What is the MN4 Microprocessor and what is the Engine ECU? ECU stands for Engine Control Unit, and it’s like the ""brain"" of the modern jet engine. It monitors crucial engine parameters such as temperature, pressure, and RPM. But most importantly in this context, it controls fuel flow, variable geometry components, starting, and other functions to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and safety.The MN4 is an integrated microprocessor used inside the ECU. It handles critical processing tasks such as interpreting sensor data, executing engine control algorithms, sending signals to actuators such as fuel metering valves, and managing fault detection and communication with cockpit systems.Why did the FAA recommend replacement of the MN4 Microprocessor? ""Solder Ball Fatigue"" was the crucial issue. ""The microprocessor is mounted on a Ball Grid Array (BGA), which uses tiny solder balls to attach the chip to the circuit board. As the aircraft flies, the engine experiences high temperature swings, constant vibration, and thermal cycling (repeated heating/cooling during engine start/shutdown).Over time, this thermal cycling causes fatigue cracks in the solder balls, leading to intermittent electrical connections, loss of signal processing, and potential engine control faults,"" explained a senior commander. A failing microprocessor could disrupt fuel flow control, cause engine flame-out, prevent proper engine restart, and trigger dual engine shutdowns (a catastrophic scenario).Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert said: ""The time line given in the report is not tallying, especially after take-off when the RAT is shown deployed in the image, which means both engines have already failed. It does not match with the engine failure timings given in the report.""What was happening in the ten seconds after the fuel cutoff switch was off. The report doesn't give information on the conversation in the cockpit.The two sentences from the CVR mentioned in the report about a pilot enquiring who cutoff the fuel also doesn't carry a timestamp.""Capt Sam Thomas, President of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (APAI), said: ""The conversation between the pilots enquiring who cut off the fuel control switch is alarming.""Another crucial issue is, why did the Emergency Locator Transmitter not work after the accident? It should emit signals if the force of impact is between 3.2 to 3.5 G; the impact of the accident would have been exponentially higher.He also raised a question about the composition of the investigating team. ""Who is the expert in this group? It is assumed that some B787 Dreamliner pilots have been... Why the secrecy? We know pilots in India, and none of them have been consulted. IAF pilots are not competent enough to investigate and understand modern aircraft operated by civilian airlines.""The AAIB said: ""The investigation team comprising Mr. Sanjay Kumar Singh as Investigator-in-Charge, Mr. Jasbir Singh Larhga as chief investigator and Mr. Vipin Venu Varakoth, Mr. Veeraragavan K, and Mr. Vaishnav Vijayakumar as Investigators. Experienced Pilots, Engineers, Aviation Medicine Specialist, Aviation Psychologist and Flight Recorder Specialists have been taken on board as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to assist the Investigation in the area of their domain expertise,"" the report said.","Fuel supply to both engines cut off shortly after takeoff. Pilots denied responsibility, raising questions about technical malfunction or deliberate action. The final report into the accident which will be released by June 12, 2026 will likely give the answers and reveal the probable causes of the accident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122398376,imgsize-735071,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122398376.jpg"

'Closer': Donald Trump's Big Hint On India-US Trade Deal Amid High Tariff Slapped On Other Nations

India, US near trade deal. What happens next if New Delhi joins Trump’s shortlist?



United States is working toward an interim trade agreement with India that could reduce proposed tariffs to below 20%. This would give India a more favourable position compared to other countries in the region.Unlike many nations, India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement, Bloomberg reported, quoting sources.The proposed interim trade deal between the two nations would allow both the sides to continue negotiations, giving India time to address unresolved issues before a broader agreement expected later this year, the source added.The planned agreement is likely to set a baseline tariff of under 20%, down from the 26% initially proposed, with provisions to allow further adjustments as part of a final pact. However, the exact timeline for the interim deal remains uncertain.If finalised, India would likely join a select group of nations that have reached trade arrangements with the Trump administration. In contrast, several other countries were hit with surprise tariff hikes of up to 50% this week, ahead of the August 1 deadline.India is pushing for a more favourable deal than the one signed with Vietnam, which included 20% tariffs. Vietnam, caught off guard by the high rate, is now seeking a revision. So far, only the UK has officially signed trade deals with the Trump administration.Earlier on Thursday, Trump told NBC News that he is considering imposing blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on most trading partners who haven't yet received specific rates.Currently, the baseline tariff for most US trade partners stands at 10%. For Asian countries, announced rates so far include 20% for Vietnam and the Philippines, and as high as 40% for Laos and Myanmar.Despite being among the earliest to initiate trade discussions this year, India-US relations have shown recent tensions.While Trump indicates an imminent agreement, he has also suggested additional tariffs regarding India's BRICS membership.An Indian negotiation team is expected to visit Washington soon to push forward trade talks. India has already made its final offer to the Trump administration and outlined its non-negotiable positions.The key sticking points remain, including the US demand for India to allow genetically modified (GM) crops, something New Delhi has firmly opposed, citing concerns for farmers. Other unresolved issues include non-tariff barriers in agriculture and regulatory challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.","India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement.

If you have dedicated time and effort to helping others, whether through volunteering, medical aid, education, or supporting charitable causes, the UAE now offers a clear opportunity for long-term residency.The UAE has long been known for its rapid development and forward-looking policies. Over the past year, its Golden Visa program, originally focused on investors and entrepreneurs, has expanded its coveted Golden Visa to embrace a different kind of capital: humanitarian service.Volunteers, aid workers, and philanthropists, often unsung, mobile, and working across borders, now have a place to call home, with security and status to match. This development reflects the country’s commitment to supporting those who serve communities and contribute to social development, providing them with greater stability and recognition.Launched in 2019, the Golden Visa is a long-term residency program designed to attract and retain global talent. Originally targeting property investors, business owners, and individuals with substantial capital, the visa has since evolved into one of the most inclusive and strategic residency schemes in the world.Today, the Golden Visa is available to over ten categories of individuals, including frontline health workers, scientists, engineers, artists, athletes, and now, humanitarian contributors and volunteers.The visa comes with a powerful suite of benefits that distinguish it from traditional permits in the region:This framework ensures stability, not only for entrepreneurs and investors, but for those whose work uplifts the vulnerable and underserved.The UAE’s expansion of the Golden Visa to the humanitarian sector is not symbolic, it’s systematic. This dedicated pathway recognizes the invaluable impact of volunteers, nonprofit workers, and humanitarian pioneers, and ensures that their presence in the country is secure and celebrated.The goal is clear: to integrate socially committed individuals into the UAE’s social fabric, where they can continue serving communities without the administrative friction of short-term visas or professional instability.By doing so, the UAE is not only acknowledging their contributions, it’s also amplifying them.According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Golden Visa for humanitarian contributors has clearly defined eligibility criteria. Applicants considered ""pioneers"" in humanitarian fields must demonstrate significant involvement in recognized charitable, volunteer, or community-based work. You may be granted the full 10-year Golden Visa, if you fall under one of the following categories:This category of elite humanitarian efforts reflects the UAE’s philosophy that humanitarianism is not a hobby, it’s a lifelong vocation worthy of permanence and prestige.Unlike broad or vague interpretations, the UAE has clearly outlined the sectors it considers essential within the humanitarian landscape. These areas represent critical needs both locally and globally, and those contributing within them are eligible for Golden Visa consideration.These sectors are not only vital to global sustainability but also reflect the UAE’s own national priorities in development, aid, and long-term resilience.To ensure credibility and measurable impact, the UAE has identified a number of recognized humanitarian organizations whose volunteers may qualify for the Golden Visa. These institutions play a vital role in both domestic and international aid efforts, and affiliation with them significantly strengthens any application.For a complete directory, applicants are encouraged to refer to the Ministry of Community Development’s official list of accredited charitable organizations.Applying for the Humanitarian Visa or Golden Visa for Volunteers involves submitting proof of your involvement in recognized humanitarian or volunteer work, along with identification and endorsement documents from UAE-registered organizations. Applications are processed through official government portals such as the ICA or GDRFA, depending on the emirate.Applicants must pay processing fees, which generally range from AED 3,000($816.77) to AED 5,000($1,361.28), and undergo routine checks like medical and security clearances. Processing times typically take a few weeks.Renewals are required every 5 to 10 years, depending on the visa type, and visa holders must continue active humanitarian involvement and maintain good standing with relevant organizations and UAE laws to remain eligible.The UAE’s extension of long-term residency to humanitarian contributors aligns with its broader commitment to global humanitarian efforts. Over the past two decades, the country has become a leading donor of aid relative to its GDP, supporting disaster relief in regions like Turkey, Syria and addressing hunger through large-scale meal campaigns.The UAE has also developed key institutions such as Dubai Cares, Noor Dubai Foundation, and the International Humanitarian City, which play important roles in education, health, and aid logistics. Domestically, initiatives like the Volunteer Emirates platform encourage community engagement, reflecting the country’s belief that humanitarian work begins at home.",The UAE’s Golden Visa now covers humanitarian workers and volunteers.

Radhika Yadav, the 25-year-old former state-level tennis player who was allegedly shot dead by her father in Gurugram, did not run a formal academy, rather trained aspiring players by booking tennis courts across the city.“Radhika did not have her own academy. She used to train aspirants by booking tennis courts at different places. Deepak had asked her several times to stop the training sessions, but she refused. That was the main tussle between the father and daughter,” said an investigating officer, quoted by PTI.Police had earlier claimed that Radhika ran a tennis academy, a source of tension between her and Deepak, who was reportedly taunted for relying on his daughter’s income.According to police, Deepak, who had steady rental income and was financially secure, felt uncomfortable being perceived as reliant on his daughter's earnings. This had reportedly left him depressed in the weeks leading up to the shooting.Initial speculation tied Radhika’s social media activity and a 2023 music video appearance to her murder. Allegations surfaced that Deepak was displeased with her rising online presence and ambitions of becoming an influencer, with some suggesting the video featuring her alongside an independent artist may have been the cause behind the murder.However, these claims were later dismissed by the police.“The video was uploaded in 2023, it has no connection with the murder. The accused has repeatedly said that he did not want his daughter to earn through training,” inspector Vinod Kumar of Sector 56 police station told PTI.Radhika, was killed at point-blank range on Thursday by her father Deepak Yadav, 49, at their double-storey residence in sector 57. He was arrested and produced before a city court, which sent him to judicial custody on Saturday.Deepak also confessed to shooting his daughter dead, police said.On Friday, the court had sent Deepak to one-day police custody. During the remand period, officers recovered five bullets and a live cartridge from the family's sector 57 residence. He was also taken to a village in Pataudi as part of the investigation.A relative told police that Deepak had supported Radhika's tennis ambitions from a young age, but had grown increasingly upset with her continued coaching work despite his objections.Radhika suffered four gunshot wounds, three to the back and one to the shoulder, according to the post-mortem. Her funeral was held on Friday in the family’s native village of Wazirabad.","Radhika Yadav, a former state-level tennis player, was allegedly shot dead by her father in Gurugram.

NEW DELHI: As the month-long Pakistan presidency of the UN Security Council (UNSC) nears its business end, Islamabad is gearing up to organize an open debate on unresolved disputes around the world, looking to follow it up with a resolution urging member-states to use mechanisms available to them for pacific settlement of disputes.While the motive behind convening this signature event under the UN’s maintenance of international peace and security agenda is to highlight the Kashmir issue, it’s unlikely Pakistan will name J&K for fear of getting the resolution vetoed. UNSC resolutions need 9 votes to pass, including the concurrence of all 5 permanent members.Pakistan deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar will travel to New York to chair the event on July 22 that will likely be briefed by Secretary General Antonio Guterres too.According to the Security Council Report, Pakistan aims to adopt the resolution urging full use of all Chapter VI mechanisms for peaceful resolution of disputes between nations. Article 33 of the Chapter states that the parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall seek a solution by, among other things, mediation and arbitration.However, the same Article also says the parties can seek a solution through “other peaceful means of their own choice”. This is important for India as it helps underscore its position that this is exactly what it is trying to do through Simla and Lahore Declarations that stress bilateralism.“The generic resolution which will most likely be conceptual in nature will focus on general principles not specific issues to avoid any objections,” says Syed Akbaruddin, former Indian ambassador to the UN. Pakistan also knows that except China, all other permanent members continue to maintain that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.While underlining the Council’s role in maintaining peace and security, many member-states stress that any such attempt can’t undermine a State’s sovereignty or invoke settlement agreements without the consent of both parties. The open debate follows closed consultations called by Pakistan on May 5 to discuss India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.Pakistan will also convene another signature event under its presidency, hoping to strengthen cooperation between the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the 57-member body that has repeatedly expressed support for Islamabad’s Kashmir agenda.The meeting will take place under the UN’s ‘Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations’ agenda item. Along with Pakistan, there are 4 other non-permanent member-states that are also in the OIC – Algeria, Somalia, Sierra Leone and Guyana. It will be difficult though to gloss over differences between the Council and OIC on key issues like Israel’s actions in Gaza and the OIC condemnation of the US strikes on Iran. India has repeatedly accused the OIC of allowing its agenda to be hijacked by Pakistan, while ignoring Islamabad’s support to cross-border terrorism, and any mention of the Kashmir issue at the meeting is likely to be met with a similar response from India.",Pakistan is gearing up to organize an open debate on unresolved disputes around the world.

MUMBAI: The preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) into the June 12 Air India flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad refers to a serviceability bulletin on the Boeing-787's fuel control switch which indicates a potential equipment malfunction, but deemed it was not an unsafe condition.The AAIB report mentioned that the fuel switches of engine one and two of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft were cut off within a gap of one second and later turned on before the crash.Capt Sam Thomas, president of the Airline Pilots' Association of India, said: ""The AAIB report refers to a serviceability bulletin concerning the fuel control switch gates, which indicates a potential equipment malfunction. The tone and direction of the investigation suggest a bias toward pilot error. ALPA categorically rejects this presumption and insists on a fair, fact-based inquiry.""What is the possible technical issue? The AAIB report refers to the 'Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33' issued by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in Dec 2018. The bulletin is about the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. The bulletin was issued after reports came in from operators of Boeing 737s that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.The said fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models, including the B787, the aircraft that crashed.The FAA recommended: ""Inspect the locking feature of the fuel control switch to ensure its engagement. While the airplane is on the ground, check whether the fuel control switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting up the switch. If the switch can be moved without lifting it up, the locking feature has been disengaged and the switch should be replaced at the earliest opportunity.""The AAIB report said: ""The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant an airworthiness directive (AD) by FAA. As per information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory.""",Preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) into the June 12 Air India flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad refers to a serviceability bulletin on the Boeing-787's fuel control switch.

Was fuel contamination a factor?

Was the aircraft airworthy?

Were flight crew and procedures followed?

Why wasn’t the landing gear retracted?

Why is there no cockpit video?

Could it have been an electrical glitch?

Was the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) operational?

Who is on the investigative panel?

When is the final report expected?

In its first official account of the June 12 crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released a 15-page preliminary report into Air India Flight 171. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plunged into a medical college hostel moments after takeoff, becoming one of India’s worst aviation tragedies in decades and the first fatal crash of a Dreamliner globally.The report stops short of assigning blame but outlines a chilling sequence of events: both engine fuel control switches were inexplicably moved from ""RUN"" to ""CUTOFF"" within a second of each other, starving the aircraft’s engines of fuel. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why he had shut off the fuel. The other denied doing so.Despite relighting both engines, only one recovered fully before the plane crashed just 32 seconds after becoming airborne. The switches were later found back in the ""RUN"" position. While mechanical failure, bird strike and fuel contamination have been ruled out, the mystery of how the switches were moved persists, prompting calls for further forensic analysis and voice identification.Roughly seven seconds after lift-off, both fuel switches were cut to CUTOFF in less than one second, depriving the engines of fuel and leading to a thrust loss. The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) swung into action to supply emergency power—which was captured on CCTV footage shortly thereafter.Yes. The Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR) shows that around 10 seconds after the cutoff, both switches were returned to RUN, and one engine began recovering. However, the altitude was insufficient for a full restoration of thrust before crashing.No. DGCA lab tests on samples from the refuelling bowsers and tanks found the fuel to be satisfactory.The CVR captured a pilot asking, “Why did you cut off?” with the response, “I did not do so,” but identities were not assigned to either speaker.Yes. All mandatory checks had been completed. However, an advisory issued by the FAA in 2018 concerning fuel switch locking mechanisms was not acted upon, as it was classified as non-mandatory. The VT-ANB underwent throttle control module replacements in 2019 and 2023, with no reported fuel switch defects since, TOI reported..Both pilots passed pre-flight breathalyser tests and were visible on CCTV pre-departure. The captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, had over 15,000 flying hours (8,600 on the 787), while First Officer Clive Kunder had 3,400 hours. Sabharwal was monitoring, Kunder was flying.TOI reports that veteran commanders referenced a 2021 joint FAA–GE Service Bulletin recommending replacement of the “MN4 microprocessor” on the engine’s ECU—citing solder-ball fatigue due to thermal cycling that might lead to electrical faults. A failure here could plausibly trigger unintended switch activation.The report notes the gear was still down. One theory is that the crew was preoccupied with engine failure procedures and had no opportunity to retract the gear. Audit transcripts make no mention of the “positive climb” or “gear up” call being made.Experts like Peter Goelz of the NTSB have lamented the lack of visual cockpit recording, which could definitively identify who moved the switches, BBC reported.Former AAIB investigator Capt Kishore Chinta, while speaking with BBC raised the question of whether the ECU or other systems could have electronically tripped the fuel switches—adding to suspicions of a microprocessor fault.Capt Amit Singh, told TOI that the ELT failed to emit a distress signal—despite impacts of 3.2 to 3.5 g ordinarily triggering it. He also questioned discrepancies in the RAT deployment timeline and the lack of cockpit conversation timestamps.TOI had also reported that Capt Sam Thomas of the Airline Pilots’ Association of India raised doubts about the expertise composition of the AAIB team. The AAIB has since confirmed the inclusion of subject-matter experts: pilots, engineers, aviation medicine specialists and flight-recording experts supporting the core investigation team.According to AAIB, the comprehensive report is due by 12 June 2026. Until then, no definitive cause has been declared, nor have safety directives been issued for 787-8 operators or GE’s GEnx-1B engines.","The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has released a 15-page preliminary report into Air India Flight 171.

The crime stemmed from disagreements over her tennis coaching sessions and a growing desire to pursue a career outside sports, including in advertising and modelling, her uncle told ANI.Vijay Yadav described Deepak as a devoted father who had invested years of effort and money into Radhika’s tennis career. “He used to take her for training at 5 in the morning and bring her back in the evening. She had stopped going anywhere else.He had worked hard. When everyone in the village had kutcha houses, they had a pucca one,” he told ANI. “There is no bigger punishment than realisation when a person himself is guilty. ”The family has denied reports that Radhika owned a tennis academy. According to the Gurugram police, she used to book tennis courts at various locations to train others, something her father objected to. An investigating officer said Deepak was worried about societal judgement and did not want his daughter to earn money by coaching others.A friend of the accused also told police that Deepak had been deeply disturbed by comments people made about him living off his daughter’s earnings. He claimed Deepak told him he had “committed a sin” and couldn’t take the taunts any longer.WhatsApp chats between Radhika and her coach suggest she had been planning to leave home and move abroad, ANI reported. However, police say this angle is not being probed. Inspector Vinod Kumar confirmed there was no link between a music video Radhika had appeared in and the murder. “The accused has repeatedly said that he did not want his daughter to earn through training other players,” he said.The accused has been sent to 14 days’ judicial custody.","Radhika Yadav, a 25-year-old former tennis player from Gurugram, was shot dead at point-blank range.

'Bias towards pilot error': Pilots' Association raises concerns over Air India crash report; demands transparency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bias-toward-pilot-error-pilots-association-raises-concerns-over-air-india-crash-report-demands-transparency/articleshow/122403848.cms,"Workers prepare to hoist the tail section wreckage of Air India Flight 171, which crashed on June 12, in Ahmedabad.

'FUEL CUT OFF': Air India Boeing 787 Crash TRUTH Out; PROBE Reveals 'ACTUAL CAUSE' | Details

NEW DELHI: The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) on Saturday raised concerns over the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, saying the investigation seems to assume that the pilots were responsible for the accident.""The tone and direction of the investigation suggest a bias toward pilot error. We categorically reject this presumption and insist on a fair, fact-based inquiry,"" ALPA India president Sam Thomas said in a statement.The association also pointed to a ""lack of transparency"" in the process. ""Investigations continue to be shrouded in secrecy, undermining credibility and public trust. Qualified, experienced personnel—especially line pilots—are still not being included in the investigation team,"" the statement said.A preliminary report has found that the fuel supply to both engines of Air India flight AI171 was cut off within a second of each other, causing confusion in the cockpit and the airplane plummeting back to ground almost immediately after taking off.The 15-page report says that in the cockpit voice recording, one unidentified pilot asked the other why he had cut off the fuel, which the other denied.ALPA referred to a Wall Street Journal article published on July 10 that reported the crash may have involved the movement of the engine fuel control switches.The association questioned how such information was leaked to the media before the official release of the report. ""A July 10 article in The Wall Street Journal references inadvertent movement of the fuel control switches. ALPA-I questions how such sensitive investigative details were leaked to international media,"" the statement read.ALPA also criticised the AAIB for releasing documents without proper official identification. ""ALPA-I is concerned that the preliminary AAIB report has been shared with the media without any responsible official signature or attribution,"" it said.The association again requested to be allowed to participate in the investigation process. ""ALPA-I renews its request to be included, at the very least, as observers in the investigation process to ensure transparency and accountability.""On June 12, a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport, hitting a medical college hostel. The crash killed 241 of the 242 people onboard and 19 people on the ground, making it the deadliest aviation accident in a decade.According to a timeline in the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report, both engine fuel control switches—which are used to shut down the engines—were moved to the cutoff position almost immediately after takeoff. The report did not mention how this happened or who was responsible.Soon after the fuel control switches moved from RUN to CUTOFF, one second apart, a Ram Air Turbine (RAT) pump was deployed to provide hydraulic power as both engines dropped below idle speed.About 10 seconds later, the fuel control switch for Engine 1 was moved back to RUN, followed by Engine 2 four seconds later. The pilots managed to relight both engines, but only Engine 1 regained power. Engine 2 did not build enough thrust to stop the plane’s descent.One of the pilots made a ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday"" call, but before air traffic control could respond, the aircraft clipped some trees and crashed just outside the airport boundary into a hostel occupied by students.","The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) on Saturday raised concerns over the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad.

CHENNAI: There's no age limit for learning - some senior citizens in Tamil Nadu seem to have discovered this mantra. Three people aged 68, 67 and 60, including two lawyers, have cleared NEET this year and applied for MBBS admissions in Tamil Nadu. But, their sudden passion for a tough and demanding branch of study like medicine has left TN officials in a fix.State selection committee officials said there are at least 25 people, above the age of 35 years, competing for UG medical and dental courses. There's no upper age limit to appear for NEET as NMC had removed the bar on age or number of attempts for the qualifying examination.""This year, there are many graduates and professionals aspiring for a medical or dental seat. This is the highest number of middle-age and older applicants we have seen since 2017,"" said an official.Some candidates have obtained enough marks that could secure them a seat under the 69% reservation category and permit them to study medicine at a subsidised cost at a government college or free of cost at a private college.All three senior citizens applied for admission under a special quota, where 7.5% of seats are reserved for students from government schools to pursue medicine in government or private colleges free of cost.While the older candidates have the qualifying marks, officials are seeing technical problems - in many cases, documents are not matching the requirements mentioned in the prospectus, an official said.The core debate among officials is whether this special quota should extend to all graduates, regardless of age.","Three people aged 68, 67 and 60, including two lawyers, have cleared NEET this year and applied for MBBS admissions in Tamil Nadu.

Operation Sindoor proved India’s readiness; exposed inefficiency of Pak’s Chinese military gear: US warfare expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-proved-indias-readiness-exposed-inefficiency-of-paks-chinese-military-gear-us-warfare-expert/articleshow/122408721.cms,".

New Delhi: India’s Operation Sindoor was not just a warning to Pakistan, but a signal to the world about India’s military strength, says international security expert John Spencer. According to him, the strikes showed that India has both the capability and the will to respond with precision and restraint.Spencer, who is Chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute (New York), told ANI in a video interview that the operation became a direct test of Indian-made systems versus Chinese military technology used by Pakistan.“This is absolutely a test of Chinese military technologies, both for the rest of the world and also for China,” he said. “It (China) uses it (Pakistan) as a lab for this technology.”India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, after a terror attack in Pahalgam killed 26 civilians. In the days that followed, India repelled Pakistani military action and hit back at key airbases. Hostilities ended after Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to the Indian side.Spencer said India’s response highlighted not just its military upgrades but also how prepared it was: “War puts everything to the test… and everybody was learning from that demonstration.”He also noted that the ineffectiveness of Chinese-made weapons used by Pakistan is under scrutiny.“The evidence was in the video, satellite footage — not in the words about how you said your Chinese systems performed.”Spencer described the situation as part of a broader “proxy warfare” dynamic, where countries like China and Turkey back Pakistan with defence ties. “There are a lot of nuances… using Pakistan and these borders to isolate India economically and militarily,” he said.He added that India’s pattern of response to cross-border terrorism has shaped a doctrine, and while wars cannot be predicted, preparation is key. “One of the ways you prevent future wars is through preparation, change, and being on the ground.”Discussing Pakistan’s reliance on Chinese gear, Spencer said there could be a rethink. “If what you bought doesn’t work, then you go back to the seller and say, ‘This didn’t work like it was supposed to.’ But you also know if there’s user error.”He added that Pakistan may now seek advanced weapons elsewhere, but money is a major problem. “They have a money problem. The IMF has to bail Pakistan out.”Spencer said he studied Operation Sindoor not just for what happened in those four days, but because it reflected years of transformation and innovation in India’s defence sector. “India is more prepared,” he said.","India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK.

Judge seeks 'reasonable care' while invoking BNS' stringent Sec 152

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan without referencing any specific incident or mentioning India does not prima facie constitute an offence under Section 152 (act endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Allowing the bail plea of Riyaz, accused of pledging support to Pakistan in an Instagram post, Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal said a perusal of record showed ""the applicant has not mentioned anything which shows disrespect towards our country"".""Merely posting a message to...show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), but ""definitively will not attract"" Sec 152, the HC said in its July 10 order.Sec 196 of BNS provides for up to seven years in jail, while an offence under Sec 152 is non-bailable and carries a life sentence or imprisonment up to seven years and fine. The judge called for exercising ""reasonable care"" while invoking Sec 152 of BNS, saying it was a new provision stipulating stringent punishment, which had no equivalence in IPC.""For attracting ingredients of Sec 152, there must be purpose by spoken or written words, signs, visible representations, electronic communication to promote secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities or encourages feeling of separating activities or endangers the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,"" HC said.""Merely posting a message to show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), which provides for up to seven years jail, but ""definitively will not attract ingredients of Sec 152, BNS"", HC said in its order July 10.Justice Deshwal said spoken words or posts on social media are also covered under the right to freedom of speech and expression, and should not be narrowly interpreted, unless they are of such nature which threaten the country's sovereignty and integrity or encourages separatism.During the hearing, the applicant submitted through his counsel that his social media post did not lower the dignity and sovereignty of the country. Neither was India named, nor the Indian flag or any photo was posted which showed disrespect to the country, he argued. ""Merely supporting a country, even if that country is an enemy to India, does not attract the ingredients of BNS Sec 152,"" the applicant's counsel said.State opposed the bail plea, submitting that such posts encourages separatism. HC, granting bail, directed applicant not to post any material on social media which could create disharmony among people.","Allahabad high court observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan does not prima facie constitute an offence.

SRINAGAR: Bengal BJP leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari’s comments advising Bengal’s people not to travel to Kashmir have drawn fire in J&K, with his own party repudiating the statement and the governing National Conference (NC) equating it with “terrorism”.“Kashmir is the crown of India, an integral part of our motherland. Every Indian holds Kashmir close to his heart,” former J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina said in a video message where she asked Adhikari to visit the Valley and witness firsthand the “patriotism of Kashmiris”.Adhikari had advised Bengal’s people against going to places “where Muslims are in a majority”. “If you want to visit Kashmir, visit Jammu.” Referring to the Pahalgam terror attack, Adhikari said tourists were “selectively killed” and advised people to visit Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand instead.Raina contested Adhikari’s version of events. “After the Pahalgam terror attack, it was local Kashmiris who rescued the wounded and later sheltered tourists to ensure their safety. Thousands of Kashmiris have laid down their lives for the nation’s unity and security. Many of our own BJP workers from Kashmir were killed by terrorists. Countless Kashmiri policemen and security personnel have been martyred defending the country.If the Tricolour flies proudly in Kashmir today, it is because of the sacrifices and patriotism of Kashmiris,” Raina said.Adhikari’s comments came after a meeting between J&K CM Omar Abdullah and Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Thursday. After the talks, Mamata had appealed to the people of her state to travel to Kashmir and support its tourism. She also accepted Omar’s invitation to visit the Valley, promising to do so after Durga Puja in Sept.Mamata’s TMC has slammed Adhikari’s comments, accusing him of indulging in a “disgraceful, calculated act of communal provocation” and “pushing the message of terrorists at home”.On Saturday, Omar’s NC echoed the condemnation. NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said he did not find “any difference between him (Suvendu) and terrorists” and pointed out that the statement was contrary to efforts by the Centre and J&K govt to revive tourism. “Terrorists also wanted that no one should visit Kashmir and this person (Adhikari) is saying the same. If you want to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack, you must visit Kashmir,” Sadiq added.","Bengal BJP leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari advised Bengal’s people not to travel to Kashmir.

Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, commented: “At what stage did the engines actually stop producing thrust? The AI 171 Preliminary Report says: ‘After 08:08:42 UTC when Fuel Control Switches were moved to CUT OFF.But in a later paragraph, the report stated the RAT (ram air turbine) was already deployed immediately after take-off. A simple report consisting of the collated data to date would have served the purpose of a preliminary report. This report has raised questions and suspicion about the intent of AAIB.”Capt Sam Thomas, president of the Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA-I), said: “The conversation between the pilots enquiring who cut off the fuel control switch is alarming. Another issue is, why did the emergency locator transmitter not work after the accident? “AAIB report carries no official signature, investigations continue to be shrouded in secrecy, undermining credibility and public trust.Qualified, experienced line pilots are still not being included in the investigation team. ALPA-I renews its request to be included — at the very least as observers — in the investigation to ensure transparency and accountability,” he added.Capt Mohan Ranganthan, a former Boeing 737 commander and instructor, claimed: “The pilot cut off the fuel knowingly. The left engine failed several seconds after the right engine, indicating that fuel control switches were cut off one after the other. The AAIB report has a lot of ambiguity.”A senior Boeing commander, requesting anonymity, said: “The argument that since Boeing has not issued an advisory it indicates the pilot moved the fuel to the cut-off position is flawed. Lack of advisory does not confirm system safety. Several aircraft design flaws were acknowledged only after multiple incidents, history has shown.“We know how pilots were the first to be blamed after the Lion Air crash involving a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2018.”",Pilots have expressed their concerns about the the AAIB report.

Accidental flip of fuel switch ruled out due to lock

MUMBAI: Investigation into the Air India flight AI171 crash in Ahmedabad has revealed an unsettling detail.Three seconds after take-off, fuel supply to both engines of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was cut off, either by a faulty fuel supply switch or manually by one of the two pilots. The report is ambiguous on what starved the engines.But it referred to a 2018 safety bulletin that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches, which could cut off fuel supply to the engines.“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off (the fuel supply). The other pilot responded that he did not do so.” This is the most crucial information in the 15-page preliminary report released early Saturday by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The June 12 AI-171 crash killed 270 people, including 19 on the ground.Aviation safety experts criticised the report for paraphrasing the pilots’ exchange.What stands out in the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's preliminary report into the AI 171 air crash is that it points to a single-point failure or tampering with a critical flight system, the fuel supply cutoff switch.The possibility of inadvertent movement of fuel control switch from “run”’ to “cut off” position was ruled out. “The fuel control switch has a locking mechanism for added safety. You lift it up with three fingers and roll it up and into the slot to run fuel supply to the engine and, similarly, you lift it up, roll it down and then push it back into the slot to cut off fuel supply,” said Captain Manoj Hathi, former director (operations), Air India. The report does refer to a 2018 serviceability bulletin concerning fuel control switch gates which flagged disengagement of the locking mechanism.The final report into the accident, to be released on or before June 12, 2026, will likely give answers and reveal the probable cause of the crash.Most crashes are caused by a combination of several factors & multiple failures, such as the AI Express Calicut or Mangalore crash in 2020 & 2010, respectively. While the commander of AI-171 had 15,000 hours of flying experience, including 8,600 hours on the B787, the co-pilot had 3,400 hours of experience.The senior commanders TOI spoke to also referred to another service bulletin issued jointly by the FAA and GE (engine manufacturer) in 2021. Service Bulletin FAA-2021-0273-0013 recommends the replacement of the “MN4 microprocessor on ECU” with respect to engine fuel and control. “This recommendation is to address a condition that may affect flight safety,” it states.It involves the engine control unit (ECU), the “brain” of modern jet engine. An ECU monitors crucial engine parameters and controls fuel flow. MN4 is an integrated microprocessor used inside ECU. It handles critical processing tasks such as interpreting sensor data, executing engine control algorithms, sending signals to actuators such as fuel metering valves, and managing fault detection and communication with cockpit systems.The report said CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed the ram air turbine (RAT) being deployed during initial climb immediately after lift-off. “No significant bird activity is observed in vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall,” the report said. “At this stage of the probe, no definitive cause has been determined, and no immediate safety recommendations have been issued to B787-8 or GEnx-1B engine operators,” it stated.","Preliminary report into the Air India flight AI171 crash in Ahmedabad has revealed an unsettling detail.

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant, who would be the next CJI, told the world community that India, with a robust mechanism for protection of human rights, is often targeted by countries with rigid immigration policies & a documented tendency to use excessive force for minor violations.Bringing back memories of cruel treatments meted out to immigrants and Indians by police of foreign countries, Justice Kant told a gathering of eminent lawyers and social scientists at Stockholm that ""India has historically demonstrated a strong commitment to human rights, rooted in its constitutional framework and heritage, long before these conversations gained global traction.""""To be candid, it is somewhat paradoxical when countries with some of the most rigid immigration policies - and a documented tendency to resort to excessive use of force, even in response to minor infractions - position themselves as foremost champions of human rights. Such critiques, when unaccompanied by self-reflection or contextual understanding, undermine the values they claim to uphold,"" he said.On Saturday in Gothenburg, he pitched India as a country that can provide a robust, fair, yet cost-effective arbitration destination for foreign firms. ""To popularise international arbitration, any sovereign nation must provide a foundational assurance to foreign investors and parties that their rights and interests will be protected. India, in this regard, stands on firm ground."" He said India puts a premium on rule of law andthe independent judiciary has demonstrated its ability to safeguard the interest of parties to an arbitration irrespective of the country of their origin.","Justice Surya Kant, who would be the next CJI, told the world community that India, with a robust mechanism for protection of human rights, is often targeted by countries with rigid immigration policies & a documented tendency to use excessive force for minor violations.

SRINAGAR: J&K police has announced that no one will be allowed to visit the graveyard of “July 13 Martyrs” in Srinagar on Sunday, extending curbs that have been in place since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. The date is significant in Kashmir’s history as 22 people were killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh in 1931.Chief minister Omar Abdullah , his father and governing National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, and former CM Mehbooba Mufti were expected to visit Mazar-e-Shuhada, the martyrs’ resting place in Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib and pay floral tributes. Authorities have already placed Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq under house arrest.The Omar-led govt does not control police or security, whose reins are in the hands of the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha.“District administration Srinagar has denied permission to all applicants intending to proceed towards Nowhatta on 13th July, 2025 (Sunday). The general public is advised to strictly comply with these instructions. Any violation shall invite strict legal action,” J&K police said in a statement late Saturday evening.NC reacted sharply to the curbs, with spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq calling them “deeply unfortunate and fundamentally unjust” on a day of profound historical and emotional significance for people of J&K. “We urge the administration to reflect on the gravity of this decision. No order can suppress memory. No restriction can erase the truth. The people of Kashmir will continue to honour their martyrs peacefully, with dignity, and with unwavering resolve,” Sadiq said.NC had written to Srinagar’s deputy commissioner on Thursday, seeking permission for Farooq’s intended visit to the site. Apni Party had made a similar request.Fearing they would be restricted from leaving home on Sunday, PDP functionary and ex-CM Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Mufti visited the graveyard on Saturday. “I paid tributes to our martyrs who laid down their lives for democracy. Their memory is being wilfully erased. Yet their voices echo in every Kashmiri’s heart,” Iltija said.In January 2020, nearly six months after the abrogation of Article 370, UT authorities had dropped July 13 and December 5 from the list of public holidays in J&K. December 5 was observed as the birth anniversary of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.Since then, the authorities have barred official functions on July 13 at Mazar-e-Shuhada, detaining politicians, including former chief ministers, if necessary, to keep them away. Earlier, it was tradition for CMs and top officials to pay tributes and offer a guard of honour at the graveyard.While such restrictions had been clamped in the past few years, many had believed this year might be different as it was the first time since the revocation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 that an elected government was in place in the Union territory. Eyes will be peeled on the Omar govt’s response to the Sinha-led administration’s move on Sunday.","The date is significant in Kashmir’s history as 22 people were killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh in 1931.

Chirag vows to contest all 243 seats in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Saturday lashed out at Bihar’s law and order situation, calling it “beyond understanding”. Chirag’s comments are the latest in a series of messages directed at the Nitish government since he announced his decision to contest the Bihar polls scheduled for later this year.“How many Biharis will be murdered? It is beyond understanding what is the responsibility of Bihar Police?” the Hajipur MP wrote on X, hours after the killing of Sushila Devi, a 60-year-old hospital worker shot dead in Nalanda on Saturday morning.Police said she was ambushed while returning from her farm, shot in the head, and declared dead at a local hospital. Officers suspect a property dispute but are still investigating.The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile killings across Bihar. A 50-year-old sand mining businessman was shot dead in Patna on Thursday, just days after top industrialist Gopal Khemka was murdered near his home despite earlier appeals for police protection. On Friday, another businessman, Vikram Jha, was gunned down outside his shop in Patna. “There seems to be no evidence of robbery,” Patna East SP Parichay Kumar said, adding that the motive remains unclear.Deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha had blamed “sand, liquor and land mafias” linked to the opposition RJD for the violence in the state. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, however, held the Nitish government accountable. “Why is the unconscious Chief Minister silent?” he posted on X.This is the second time in a week that Chirag has criticised the law and order situation in Bihar, with the LJP MP on Monday describing it as “completely collapsed.”“In Biharsharif, Nalanda, criminals brutally murdered 16-year-old Himanshu Paswan and 20-year-old Anu Kumar by shooting them. This incident is extremely unfortunate and condemnable. This heinous event not only shakes humanity but also shows that law and order in Bihar have completely collapsed,” Chirag had said.“Crime in the state is at its peak, and the fact that such an incident was carried out by criminals in the home district of the Honourable Chief Minister clearly indicates that the morale of criminals is at its highest,” he added.Chirag has declared that his party, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), will contest all 243 assembly seats in Bihar, reaffirming his ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ vision. Speaking at a rally in Chhapra, the Union minister said he would fight the polls with “full intensity.”His announcement has unsettled allies in the NDA, with JD(U) leaders accusing him of violating coalition dharma.""If Chirag wants to contest the elections on his own, he should declare it publicly. It is not right to say one thing on stage and another off stage. This should not happen. He is a Union minister in the NDA govt and should follow coalition dharma,"" said senior JD(U) leader and state IPRD minister Maheshwar Hazar on Friday.Also read: 'Chirag should clarify stand on fighting polls,' says JD(U) minister","Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Saturday lashed out at Bihar’s law and order situation, calling it “beyond understanding” His comments are the latest in a series of messages directed at the Nitish government since he announced his decision to contest the Bihar polls scheduled for later this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122409153,imgsize-1228771,width-400,resizemode-4/122409153.jpg"

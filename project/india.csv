FARIDABAD: There was no foreboding of the extraordinary day that would reduce the Mehtos from a family of six to one.Not even that morning. June 10 bore the stamp of routine. The boys took their usual morning baths before the heatwave made an oven of their room. Their mother made parathas for breakfast. Their father, Manoj Mehto, lazed, ambled around the alley, spoke to a few neighbours. Like he did on days he did not go to work, which would be twice or thrice a week.""It was a normal Tuesday morning,"" Preeti told TOI on Wednesday, alone in a house - in fact, a room- where four boys and two adults packed in, each with a few inches marked out to sleep or sit, bedroom, living room and kitchen rolled into one.The little room in Subhash Colony would allow no secrets, at least not within its confines. As people living in other such dwellings on the road put it, it's so cramped that even thoughts could get heard.And yet, the storm raging in 36-year-old Mehto's mind made no noise. Preeti has to think hard to remember if anything was amiss. Yes, it was odd of him to put on new clothes. But it had seemed in tune with what Preeti read as a jovial mood and a desire to take the boys out to a park.""You come too,"" he insisted to her, speaking of a 'family outing'.""But I wasn't feeling well and had a lot of work to do at home, so I refused. I told him to take the children out. They all left and never returned...,"" a distraught Preeti said as neighbours crowded the house with one question - why?Preeti did not have an answer.Manoj had not gone to the park. He bought chips and cola and headed for the railway tracks nearby. The five of them sat on the tracks under the Elson Chowk flyover. The boys had no inkling of what was to happen. For close to an hour, they sat there. One of the most horrifying deaths the country has seen unfolded next as a train - Golden Temple Express - ran them over. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on firm, making sure all five of them would be right in line when the train came. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders and held Pawan (10) and Kaaro (7) by their arms.Police have initiated an inquest and are still searching for a motive. After questioning different people, police officers said they had come to know that Manoj might have had some ""trust issues"" and was particularly peeved with a neighbour of Preeti's parents back at their home in Bihar's Lakhisarai who helped take her messages to them.""Preeti's parents did not have mobile phones, so she would call the neighbour, a man she refers to as a 'cousin', and request him to help her get in touch with them. There was nothing more to it,"" said Rajender Singh, in charge of the railway police post in Ballabgarh.The couple's neighbours in Subhash Colony said they hadn't heard any arguments between Manoj and Preeti. Preeti told police she didn't have any recent disagreement with Manoj. The two had fallen in love and got married 11 years ago.""We got married, and my sister married Manoj's brother. We shifted here (Faridabad) three years ago, and I stayed at home because he always asked me not to take a job and raise his kids well,"" Preeti said.Seema Devi, a neighbour who visited the couple's house on Wednesday, said she didn't know the family, but came to convey her condolences. ""We are all shattered by this very disturbing incident. I came to pay condolences and wanted to know what led the man to make such a decision,"" she said.A police officer said Mehto's and the boys' bodies are currently at the mortuary of BK Civil Hospital. ""Manoj's brother requested us to wait for the autopsy till he arrives in Faridabad. He will reach on Thursday, after which the post-mortem examination will be conducted,"" he said.","Manoj Mehto waited with his four sons till the train crushed them. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders. The five of them sat on the tracks under the Elson Chowk flyover.

Gold price prediction today: Amidst ongoing US-China trade deal talks, gold prices are likely to continue fluctuating, with geo-political uncertainties adding to volatility. Where are gold prices headed in the short-term and what are the factors that investors need to watch out for?Top trade deputies of the US and China began their talks in London on Monday. Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar. MCX August gold contract was at Rs 97200, up 0.16% on the day.Earlier, spot gold prices fell 1.25% to close at $3310 on Friday as the US non-farm payroll report (May) came in somewhat better than expected, though details were not so encouraging.Easing US-China trade tensions pressurized the yellow metal further. Despite falling for two straight days on June 5 and June 6, the metal closed nearly 0.63% higher on a weekly basis in the week ending June 6.The metal rose to $3403 on June 5 --highest since May 8- as traders piled into the metal on safe haven demand as US-China tensions escalated.US Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick and US Trade Representative Greer met a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng Monday at London's Lancaster House. Presence of high-profile officials in Trump's Team reflects willingness of the US administration to allow some relaxations in the US exports to China, which may include technical supplies, jet engine parts, etc. China, in turn, is expected to ease rare earth exports to the US.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.394MOz as of June 6. ETF holdings witnessed net inflows for the second consecutive week following net outflows for five straight weeks. ETF holdings are up around 6.70% YTD.China's inflation data released Monday showed that China's CPI (May) declined 0.1% y-o-y vs the forecast of -0.2%. It was the fourth straight monthly decline as the Chinese economy continues to struggle with sluggish demand amid a raging trade war. China’s factory deflation continued for the 32nd straight month as PPI (May) declined 3.3% y-o-y as against the estimate of 3.2% and 2.7% decline in April. The deflation threat will continue to linger unless consumer demand remains sluggish.China's exports slowed from 8.1% y-o-y in April to 4.8% y-o-y (forecast 6%) in May as shipments to the US declined 34% y-o-y, worse than a 21% decline registered in April. Chinese imports dipped 3.4% y-o-y due to trade uncertainty as against the forecast of a decline of 0.8%.The US non-farm report (May) released Friday was somewhat better-than-expected as US employers added 139K jobs Vs the forecast of 126K jobs, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Average hourly earnings m-o-m and y-o-y rose 0.4% and 3.9% respectively Vs the respective estimates of 0.3% (prior 0.2%) and 3.7% (prior 3.9%). However, two-month payroll net revision showed a decline of 95K jobs as labor force participation rate slid from 62.6% to 52.4%. The household survey reflected a weakening job market. Even as the population increased by 188k, the labor force dropped by 625k. Thus, even though employment fell by 696k, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.20%.Traders will closely monitor US CPI (May) and PPI (May) data to be released on June 11 and June 12 respectively for clues to the Fed rate cut path.The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing, was seen at 98.95, down nearly 0.24% on the day. The Index fell 0.14% in the week ending June 6. Ten-year and 30-year US yields were a tad lower at 4.48% and 4.95% respectively.Money managers increased their net bullish gold bets to a seven-week high in the week ending June 3.China's gold reserves were up for the seventh consecutive month as PBoC bought around 2 tons of gold in May. China's gold holdings reached 73.80 MOz at the end of May.The lingering deflation threat to China’s economy, positive ETF inflows and not so strong US non-farm payroll report (May) are positive factors for the yellow metal. However, in the near-term, the metal is expected to take its clues from the ongoing US-China trade talks in London. Positive outcomes from the talks will weigh on the shiny metal. In that case, gold may fall to as low as $3260 (Rs 95,000). Interim support is at $3292 (Rs 96,000). Resistance is at $3365 (Rs 98,000)/$3405 (Rs 99,200).In all the possibility, there may be some tentative positive developments in the trade deal talks. In that case, gold may decline to test the support at $3292. However, full resolution of all the trade related issues looks to be elusive for the time being. Nonetheless, traders need to take cognizance of the ongoing US-China trade deal talks. In the meantime, a light sell position can be initiated with due risk management in place.","Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar.

Brazil secured their spot in the 2026 FIFA World Cup with a 1-0 victory over Paraguay at home on Tuesday, marking the first win under new coach Carlo Ancelotti. Vinicius Jr.'s goal in the 44th minute ensured Brazil's qualification for the tournament to be held across Canada, the United States, and Mexico.The five-time world champions, who hold the distinction of appearing in every World Cup edition, took the lead when Real Madrid star Vinicius Jr. scored from close range after receiving a cross from Manchester United's new signing Matheus Cunha.The qualification scenario emerged after Uruguay defeated Venezuela 2-0 in Montevideo earlier on Tuesday. This result meant Paraguay needed only a point to qualify, while Brazil required a win to advance.Brazil struggled to create opportunities in the first half, with Cunha missing a clear chance in the 35th minute when he headed wide from close range. However, he made amends by setting up the winning goal, utilising Raphinha's build-up play to enter the box and deliver a low cross for Vinicius to score.The victory positions Brazil in third place in the South American standings, accumulating 25 points from 16 games. This guarantees them a top-six finish and automatic qualification for the World Cup.Paraguay remain on 24 points following the defeat.

The project features 36 tunnels spanning 119 kilometres and 943 bridges, enabling all-weather, seamless rail connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and the rest of India. It is expected to revolutionize regional mobility and contribute significantly to socio-economic integration.Expressing his happiness over the train service, Abdullah told news agency ANI, ""I am very happy with the train service that has begun. More people will come to receive the darshan of Maa Vaishno Devi, and it will help the tourism as well.""","Jammu and Kashmir National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah visited the Vaishno Devi shrine and offered prayers on Wednesday.

Poll Do you believe the position of Deputy Speaker should be filled promptly? Yes, it's essential for democracy No, it's not a priority right now

NEW DELHI: Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , who is also the Rajya Sabha leader of opposition, wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.Highlighting the vacant status of the position for the two consecutive Lok Sabha terms, Kharge said this ""does not augur well for India's democratic polity and is also in violation of well-laid-out provisions of the Constitution"".""From the First to the Sixteenth Lok Sabha, every House has had a Deputy Speaker.

The primary role of the Deputy Speaker is to preside over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker and to ensure the smooth conduct of the House. The Deputy Speaker has the same powers as the Speaker when presiding, including maintaining order, deciding on points of order, and managing debates.Importantly, the Deputy Speaker is expected to function in a non-partisan manner, similar to the Speaker, despite being elected from a political party. Traditionally, this post is often offered to a member of the opposition or another party to maintain a balance, although this is not mandated by the Constitution.The position is significant for upholding the parliamentary process and ensuring continuity in the functioning of the Lok Sabha when the Speaker is unavailable.The last Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha in India was M.

Who is Zeeshan Akhtar

Zeeshan Akhtar is a 22-year-old from Punjab.

He is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

Police say Akhtar planned the killing, managed finances through more than 10 bank accounts, and coordinated with other accused.

He worked closely with jailed shooter Gurmel Singh and helped arrange weapons and shelter for the attackers.

Akhtar reportedly left Mumbai a month before the murder to avoid raising suspicion.

He is linked to the Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi gang.

Akhtar is the second accused to be detained in Canada after Anmol Bishnoi.

Zeeshan Akhtar has been detained in Canada in connection with the murder of NCP politician Baba Siddique. Akhtar was reportedly held on the basis of an Interpol notice and has been in Canadian police custody for over a week.Baba Siddique, 66, was shot dead on October 12 last year outside his son's office in Bandra (East), Mumbai. Three assailants carried out the attack. His son had alleged that a builder lobby involved in a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project was responsible, but police ruled out this angle. Instead, their chargesheet pointed to Lawrence Bishnoi's Canada-based brother Anmol as the mastermind, linking the murder to Siddique's alleged connections with Dawood Ibrahim and actor Salman Khan.So far, 26 people have been arrested from different parts of the country, including Pune, Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich, Haryana, Dombivli and Karjat. They include Shivkumar Gautam alias Shiva, who is accused of firing the shots. All 26 are facing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).","Zeeshan Akhtar, 22, is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

Jade Cargill has been positioned as a top singles star since her return to WWE





Jade Cargill's time to become the top star of the women's division might be nearing soon. WWE made a huge signing back in 2023 when they acquired Jade Cargill, who left All Elite Wrestling to sign with the global juggernaut. She made her remarkable debut in the 2024 Women's Royal Rumble, and that night marked the beginning of her rise in the company. However, she has still not held a major singles title in the promotion. Yet, recent events and reports might be hinting that The Storm might be ready to take over the landscape.For her first year in WWE, Jade Cargill was aligned with The EST of WWE, Bianca Belair. The duo was showcased as a dominant duo who took the tag team division by storm. In doing so, Cargill and Belair became the two-time WWE Women's Tag Team Champions. The Storm's momentum was derailed after she was mysteriously attacked backstage and was written off television.The former TBS Champion returned to WWE at the 2025 Elimination Chamber PLE. She began a feud with Naomi, who was revealed to be her attacker. Their rivalry led to a captivating bout at WrestleMania 41. However, since that point onwards, WWE had been pushing Cargill as a singles star.On the SmackDown following Mania, she was put in a singles bout against the reigning WWE Women's Champion, Tiffany Stratton.While Jade Cargill has not clinched a one-on-one championship match yet and missed many opportunities, she delivered some exceptional in-ring performances. This has made her a star in her own right. Moreover, it has been reported by PWInsider that she is in line for a major push and a top match at the all-women's Premium Live Event coming up, WWE Evolution 2. Her opponent has been rumored to be Naomi, and the match is said to be a stipulation bout.Moreover, she is also taking part in the Queen of the Ring tournament, which would guarantee the winner a WWE Women's title match at SummerSlam 2025. With her incredible run so far, praise from backstage personnel, and multiple opportunities coming up, it seems that Cargill would be the next marquee star and hold major singles gold in the coming months.Also read: Rising WWE superstar reveals her personal boundaries being invaded by fans",Jade Cargill has been positioned as a top singles star since her return to WWE.

Why Dillon Gabriel might be the odd man out





The Cleveland Browns are staring down one of the most intriguing quarterback dilemmas of the 2025 NFL offseason. With veteran names like Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett already in the mix, and two freshly drafted prospects—Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders—added to the fold, the Browns are overloaded at the game’s most important position. And now, all signs point to one reality: someone’s got to go.While the Browns selected Dillon Gabriel nearly 50 picks ahead of Shedeur Sanders in this year’s draft, draft order doesn’t always translate to roster security. As camps approach, speculation is growing that Cleveland may look to trade Gabriel rather than risk exposing him to waivers where another team would likely scoop him up for nothing.The Browns' front office is reportedly weighing the possibility of flipping Gabriel in a pre-season deal. Doing so would not only free up a roster spot but also help recoup value for a player who may not crack the final depth chart. With most NFL teams desperate for even a serviceable backup, Gabriel could fetch interest from franchises looking to bolster their QB room.But there's more at play than just numbers. Gabriel brings a dual-threat edge that makes him appealing to modern offenses. However, Shedeur Sanders brings buzz, branding, and the undeniable “star power” that makes it harder for a team to move on from him regardless of draft position.Letting either rookie walk is risky. Both have developmental upside, and both could turn into long-term assets. But keeping four quarterbacks simply isn’t realistic in today’s NFL. Joe Flacco showed his value down the stretch last season, and Kenny Pickett still holds trade value of his own, though less than what a recent rookie might command.Also Read: Chiefs eye future beyond Travis Kelce with potential trade for Raiders’ Michael Mayer If the Browns don’t act fast, they risk losing one of their young QBs to waivers with nothing in return.

Travis Kelce’s absence reflects a broader shift in how athletes balance fame, family, and football

A modern celebrity couple under the microscope of public and media pressure





In a decision that’s sparking conversation across the sports world, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has reportedly delayed his return to team training following his attendance at a wedding celebration with global pop icon Taylor Swift . Instead of heading straight back to Kansas City, Kelce remained in Florida, choosing to extend his time with Swift after the couple’s recent public appearance at the high-profile event.While the offseason workouts are voluntary, Travis Kelce’s absence didn’t go unnoticed. In a league built on discipline and relentless preparation, even a brief deviation from routine draws attention—especially when it involves one of the NFL’s most visible stars and his relationship with one of the world’s most famous entertainers. This choice, though personal, mirrors a growing trend among elite athletes prioritizing mental wellness and personal milestones alongside their professional grind.Some fans have welcomed the move. “He’s earned the right to take time for himself. The man’s been an ironman for the Chiefs,” one supporter commented on X (formerly Twitter). Yet others question whether his continued focus on his high-profile relationship may begin to interfere with team cohesion and performance—especially as the Chiefs gear up to defend their Super Bowl title.Kelce and Swift are not just a couple; they’re a cultural moment. Every public appearance, comment, and decision feeds into a narrative that fans devour. Their relationship has fueled massive headlines, from luxury date nights to joint vacations, and now, Kelce’s extended break post-wedding.

Aaron Rodgers opens up about his secret marriage , emotional return to the NFL, and why joining the Pittsburgh Steelers was bigger than football

From Secret vows to Steelers legacy — Aaron Rodgers begins his final chapter under the brightest spotlight yet





Aaron Rodgers stood before a sea of cameras in Pittsburgh, not with a chip on his shoulder or a need to prove anything—but with a sense of peace. The 41-year-old quarterback, now a Steeler, opened his first press conference of the 2025 NFL season with honesty, depth, and a surprising personal reveal. His decision to come back for a 21st NFL season wasn’t about silencing doubters. Instead, it was about something far more personal—he says it was the right move for his soul, and for a fresh start rooted in purpose.Aaron Rodgers made it clear that ego played no part in his move to Pittsburgh. “A lot of decisions that I’ve made over my career and life from strictly the ego, even if they turn out well, are always unfulfilling,” he said Tuesday after the Steelers’ first mandatory minicamp practice. “But the decisions made from the soul are usually pretty fulfilling. So this was a decision that was best for my soul.”The Steelers supported him throughout the offseason, especially as he navigated personal struggles—including health scares involving close friends and family members battling cancer. Rodgers said those situations “have improved a bit,” clearing the way for his NFL return.Key to that comeback was longtime Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin, whom Rodgers credited for inspiring “some of the coolest conversations I’ve had in the game.”“It starts with Mike Tomlin,” Rodgers said. “I’ve been a fan of his for a long time. There’s a few iconic franchises in the NFL. I played for one of ‘em for 18 years. This is another one of those.”Aaron Rodgers also confirmed what many had speculated after spotting a wedding band on his hand—he recently got married. “A couple months ago,” he shared, offering no further details except a past mention of a woman named Brittani.With a new team, a new city, and a renewed sense of purpose, Rodgers is ready to lead the Steelers into a pivotal season—one that opens with a fitting showdown against the Jets in Week 1.Also Read: Los Angeles Rams’ 2025 offensive trio quietly emerging as one of the NFL’s most dangerous units","Aaron Rodgers opened his first press conference of the 2025 NFL season with honesty, depth, and a surprising personal reveal.

Houthi Revenge Hits Israel: Ballistic Missile Breaks Mid-Air, IDF Scrambles 7 Interceptors | Watch





A Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly struck a civilian plane on Tuesday evening.The missile was intercepted by Israeli air defenses, preventing a potential mass casualty event instigated by Iranian-backed terrorists, claimed the Israeli war room. ""A Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly hit a civilian plane. If not for the competence of Israeli air defenses, there could have been a mass casualty event caused by Iranian-backed terrorists,"" it said in a post on X, while sharing a video.In the video, the plane can be seen flying away just moments before the missiles were intercepted.The Israeli military stated that the missiles fired from Yemen, were intercepted after breaking into multiple fragments upon impact with an interceptor.Consequently, the Israeli Air Force deployed additional interceptors to neutralise the debris. At least seven interceptors were launched during the operation. In previous instances, partially intercepted Houthi missiles have resulted in casualties when intact warheads fell to the ground. The Houthis, an Iran-backed group, claimed responsibility for the attack, announcing the launch of two ballistic missiles targeting Ben Gurion Airport in central Israel.According to a military official quoted by The Times of Israel, the second missile either fell short or disintegrated in the air, consistent with several Houthi projectiles in recent weeks.The missile attack triggered sirens shortly before 8 pm across central Israel, the Jerusalem area, southern West Bank settlements, and selected regions in southern Israel. Two minutes prior to the sirens, an early warning was sent to residents through push notifications on their phones, alerting them to the long-range missile threat.The Israel Defence Forces issued a statement regarding the incoming attack approximately five minutes before the sirens activated. No injuries were reported from the attack. Debris from the intercepted missile and interceptors landed near Jerusalem and in the West Bank, causing no significant damage.Then on Tuesday morning, the Israeli Navy conducted its first-ever strike on Yemen by destroying infrastructure at the Hodeida port. The operation involved two guided missiles launched from advanced Sa’ar 6-class corvettes positioned hundreds of kilometres away. This action marked the 11th Israeli strike against the Houthis since the conflict began, with the previous ten strikes executed by the Air Force.The Houthis, whose slogan proclaims “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews,” initiated attacks on Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month following the October 7 Hamas massacre. The group ceased its attacks when a ceasefire was established between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that time, the Houthis had launched over 40 ballistic missiles and numerous drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that caused civilian casualties in Tel Aviv in July, triggering Israel’s initial strike in Yemen.Since March 18, when the Israel Defence Forces resumed their offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after a temporary ceasefire, the Houthis have launched 48 ballistic missiles and at least 11 drones at Israel, with several of the missiles failing to reach their targets.","Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly struck a civilian plane on Tuesday evening.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3





After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

FBI director Kash Patel , an Indian-origin official leading the agency, announced Tuesday the extradition of Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada to the United States on terrorism charges.Khan is accused of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, New York.“Major news… earlier this afternoon, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada, was extradited to the United States on charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and attempting to commit acts of terrorism,” Patel wrote on X.According to the FBI, Khan allegedly planned to travel from Canada to New York and carry out a mass shooting on October 7, 2024 — the anniversary of the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel — in support of ISIS. He was arrested by Canadian authorities on September 4, 2024, before the attack could be executed.“Thankfully, the great work of FBI teams and our partners exposed those plans and shut them down,” Patel said. “He has now arrived in the U.S. and will face American justice.”Calling it a reminder of the “constant threat of terrorism facing every corner of the world,” Patel also highlighted the “disturbing rise in threats against our Jewish communities.”He credited multiple FBI field offices, including in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, for their role in the operation.Though the announcement came from Indian-origin Patel, many in India have long remained skeptic on the United States for allegedly providing safe haven to Pakistan-backed terrorists. However, under the Trump administration, Washington’s stance appears to be shifting.Just after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the White House, President Donald Trump approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-origin key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, to India.Rana was handed over in April to face trial for his role in the attacks.Still, another central figure in the case, David Headley, remains imprisoned in the United States.President Trump also strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of at least 26 people. Expressing solidarity, he said, “PM Modi and the incredible people of India have our full support and deepest sympathies.”","FBI director Kash Patel announced Tuesday the extradition of Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada.

Why WWE is holding off on the Draft

Was R-Truth's Release a Work? Ilja Dragunov Return Update, Gunther's First Challenger & More

Fans divided over format and timing





The 2025 WWE Draft may not be cancelled after all. While the annual roster shake-up traditionally follows WrestleMania in the spring, this year’s edition appears to be headed for a strategic shift - possibly to September, according to multiple reports.Sources including BodySlam.net and PWInsider suggest that WWE is considering moving the Draft to a post-SummerSlam window, aligning it with the company’s season premiere episodes of RAW and SmackDown. This move would allow ongoing storylines to reach natural conclusions over the summer, while also setting the stage for a refreshed television product in the fall.Mike Johnson of PWInsider confirmed that the Draft hasn't been scrapped, saying it's simply a matter of “where and when to do it.” The shift is reportedly part of WWE’s broader strategy under Triple H’s creative leadership, which has focused on long-term storytelling and smoother transitions between brands.The delay also appears to be influenced by recent NXT call-ups, many of whom are still finding their footing on the main roster. With WWE not in a rush to reshuffle its rosters, the focus has shifted to making sure these fresh faces get enough screen time before any major realignment occurs.Wrestling insider WrestleVotes echoed the sentiment in a Sportskeeda WrestleBinge Q&A, noting that “they want to do it... just a date has not popped up yet.” The message is clear: WWE is still committed to a draft this year, but is carefully choosing its moment.Fan response on social media has been mixed. While some are relieved the Draft is still on, others have questioned its relevance. One user wrote, “What’s the point? Talent go all over the 3 brands all the time.” Another commented, “Make sure people actually move brands this year. Last year barely anyone got drafted to a new brand.”Others are simply nostalgic for the days of the old Draft lottery machine, calling the current format “bland.” However, there’s also cautious optimism. “Good. SmackDown needs it,” one fan posted, while another added, “Better late than never.”If plans hold, the WWE Draft 2025 will follow SummerSlam in early August and land sometime in September, just in time for WWE’s fall season reset. Until then, fans will be watching closely to see who stays, who goes - and who surprises everyone.Also Read: WWE Hall of Famer predicts Ron Killings could win World Championship",WWE is reportedly considering moving the Draft to a post-SummerSlam window.

How Dave Portney’s vote is a reflection of his personal beliefs

Dave Portnoy on Trump, the 'manosphere' and 'Barstool conservatism' | Morning Edition | NPR

""How Many Jews Have To DIE?"" - Barstool’s Dave Portnoy EXPLODES Over Jew Joke BACKLASH





When Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy says he cast his vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election, it resonated far beyond a simple political preference—it signaled deeper concerns about today’s cultural landscape. Portnoy, a self-made media mogul and known pizza critic, framed his choice not as wholehearted support for Trump, but as a statement against “woke politics” and what he sees as the denigration of hard-working men. His explanation has sparked both surprise and reflection, prompting a closer look at how modern cultural battles intertwine with political expression. This article takes a fresh perspective: exploring Portnoy’s vote as a cultural outlook, rooted in identity, values, and a growing movement known as “Barstool conservatism.”Portnoy shared his political rationale in a revealing NPR interview, stating, “It’s more an indictment of, I would say, the Democrats (than an) endorsement of Trump’s politics” . He added that he’s “pro-choice,” noting people assume that isn’t “a typical bro standpoint” . His remarks reflect frustration with left-leaning “blunt talk,” overemphasis on identity issues, and what he perceives as public shaming of men.Portnoy also critiqued Democrats’ messaging, saying their moral certainty alienates many, including hard-working independent men.This candid stance places him squarely in what’s become known as Barstool conservatism, a cultural-political identity championing libertarian views, male-centric pop culture, anti-woke attitudes, and pro-Trump leanings. Portnoy’s loyal fanbase—young, outspoken, and looking for authenticity—has gravitated toward this balance of counterculture and freedom.Yet, Portnoy’s support has its limits. He didn’t shy from criticizing President Trump’s tariff decisions, admitting losses up to $20 million, calling the market turbulence “tariff city”. Still, he remains impartial on policy, valuing governmental consistency and directness.Rooted in humble beginnings, Portnoy’s rise from Swampscott to Boston entrepreneur speaks to a self-made ethos. Barstool Sports began in 2003 as a free four-page zine, evolving into a digital media empire known for brash honesty and unapologetic content.Dave Portnoy’s vote for Trump offers more than a political headline—it exposes a cultural divide, highlighting a longing for no-nonsense values, work ethic, and pride untainted by public scorn. Whether you agree with his method or not, his stance taps into a powerful sentiment: many feel talked down to and overlooked. As the lines between culture, media, and politics blur, Portnoy’s act underscores the importance of understanding why people vote for what they perceive as an outlet, not just a candidate. In our charged era, this vote reminds us of one truth: identity, respect, and voice matter. And for many, they matter more than platform alone.","Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy says he cast his vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election. He framed his choice not as wholehearted support for Trump, but as a statement against “woke politics” and what he sees as the denigration of hard-working men. His explanation has sparked both surprise and reflection, prompting a closer look at how modern cultural battles intertwine with political expression.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121786797,imgsize-10232,width-400,resizemode-4/121786797.jpg"
"‘Lal Salam’ in Srinagar: CPM demands restoration of Article 370, talks with Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lal-salam-in-srinagar-cpm-demands-restoration-of-article-370-talks-with-pakistan/articleshow/121786407.cms,"'Kashmir To Kanyakumari Now Reality': PM Modi Flags Off Vande Bharat From Katra To Srinagar | J&K

SRINAGAR: Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention calling for the restoration of Article 370 and initiation of dialogue with Pakistan.The convention stood out as a rare political event in Kashmir Valley, where even most of the regional parties have largely shifted discourse to demanding the restoration of statehood rather than raising the issue of restoring J&K’s special status.Addressing party workers at the event, titled ‘Convention for the Restoration of Legitimate Constitutional Rights of the People of Jammu and Kashmir’, CPM general secretary M Alexander Baby said the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to J&K, amounted to betrayal. “Before adding it into the Constitution of India, Article 370 was thoroughly deliberated upon and agreed to,” Baby said.He hit out at Union home minister Amit Shah for claiming that the abrogation of Article 370 had brought peace and development to Kashmir.Baby, accompanied by several party MPs and other functionaries, also visited border areas in Uri to assess the destruction caused by Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.He said the compensation offered to affected residents was inadequate. “Govt is providing only Rs 1.3 lakh for damaged houses and residential structures. That amount is meagre,” he said, adding that party MPs would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha.The CPM leader, who also met family members of Adil Shah, the ponywallah killed in Pahalgam terror attack, said Kashmiris had been fighting terrorism for years, but the current administration had marginalised elected representatives of the state. During the security review meetings, it’s the LG, a nominee of the Centre, who chaired the meeting, while the elected chief minister Omar Abdullah was excluded, Baby said, adding that “this only emboldens the terrorists”.Baby asserted that terrorism must be fought, but war was not a solution. “Military options are limited. On May 7, certain steps were taken, but we must stop there and begin negotiations,” he said, calling for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. Rejecting any third-party intervention, he said US President Donald Trump shouldn’t have any role.CPM leader from Kashmir, M Y Tarigami, also criticised the central govt for bifurcating J&K and stripping it of statehood and special status. “This is the only region in the country where such a reversal (from state to Union Territory) has happened. Elsewhere, UTs have been upgraded to full states,” Tarigami said.","Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention.

Who is Bobby Mukkamala? First person of Indian origin elected head of American Medical Association; credits immigrant parents for his journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-bobby-mukkamala-first-person-of-indian-origin-elected-head-of-american-medical-association-credits-immigrant-parents-for-his-journey/articleshow/121790157.cms,"Bobby Mukkamala delivers his first speech as the first AMA president of South Asian descent (Photo: X)





In a historic first, Indian-origin doctor Bobby Mukkamala has been sworn in as the 180th president of the American Medical Association (AMA).He is the first physician of Indian heritage to lead the influential organisation.The appointment comes just months after Mukkamala underwent surgery for an 8-cm brain tumour, according to the American Medical Association. Reflecting on his journey, he said, “As I lay in recovery from brain surgery at the Mayo Clinic, with tubes and wires monitoring my every movement, this night — this honour — this opportunity to improve health care seemed a very distant dream.”Addressing AMA members and guests, he underlined the urgent need to reform the US healthcare system. “There are tremendous gaps in our health care system that require our attention,” he said. “That’s why continuing to fight for adequate health coverage for our patients is so important... and why fighting for a sustainable, equitable health care model is so important.”Mukkamala has been a longstanding advocate within the AMA, chairing the Substance Use and Pain Care Task Force and working on evidence-based policies to combat the overdose crisis.His public service work includes leading the Community Foundation of Greater Flint during the water crisis, with a focus on projects that helped mitigate the impact of lead on children.Born to Indian immigrant doctors, Mukkamala credited his parents' sacrifices and his hometown of Flint for shaping his career. “I stand here tonight on the shoulders I quite literally stood on as a kid,” he said. “Those of my parents, Apparao and Sumathi, two immigrants from India who settled in this country believing it offered them — and their future children — opportunities that simply were not possible at home.”Mukkamala completed his medical degree at the University of Michigan and residency at Loyola University in Chicago and returned to Flint to practise medicine alongside his wife, Nita Kulkarni, an obstetrician-gynaecologist. The couple have two sons, Nikhil, a biomedical engineer, and Deven, a PhD candidate in political science.Mukkamala also used his first speech as AMA president to highlight rising health disparities in underserved cities like Flint. “Life expectancy in Flint is about 12 years shorter than its suburbs,” he said, adding that he and his wife have witnessed those disparities firsthand through their work.He warned that more doctors may leave private practice because of financial problems and a growing shortage of physicians.“Where are our patients supposed to turn?” he asked, recounting how a patient preferred to wait six weeks for his return after surgery than seek alternative care.As president, Mukkamala plans to continue advocating for accessible, affordable care and greater government investment in research and public health. “Our patients deserve better. Our physicians deserve better. Our nation deserves better,” he said.",Bobby Mukkamala is the 180th president of the American Medical Association.

Indian-American businessman who co-founded Hotmail got a major clapback on social media when he made fun of India celebrating its emergence as the world's 4th largest economy. Bhatia said India should feel ashamed as 415 million people in India survive on $3.10 per day. Indian users did not think twice to give it back to Bhatia, asking him who he wanted to please with his social media post with backdated and wrong data.Bhatia engaged with some of the critics as well, offering free introspection on what India needs, according to him.But he was shown what real shame is as X users asked him to change his surname first before spewing hatred on India.""You’re just an idiot. Why are you bragging about being the world’s No. 1 economy with $36–37 trillion in debt?"" one asked to which he replied and said US never bragged about being the top economy in the world.People asked him what he does for living apart from posting on X and earning money from his social media post engagement. ""What happened to the Rafael you were supposed to gift the Nation. Do something productive in life. As it looks you are now dependent on Social Media for living,"" one commented.""Another personal attack. When losers like you don’t know how to counter my way of thinking, you resort to personal attacks. Weak minded and insecure,"" Bhatia replied.""For whom was this post? Political leadership of India? If yes then have balls to say so. If it’s for common citizens then it’s incorrect as they are not bragging.

'They can't have nuclear weapon': Why US is pulling troops from parts of Middle East; Trump’s Iran strike threat in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/keeping-americans-safe-both-at-home-abroad-us-orders-drawdown-of-nonessential-personnel-in-middle-east-amid-rising-tensions-with-iran/articleshow/121787587.cms,"Why US pulled out troops from Middle East?







US President Donald Trump has ordered to pull out troops from from the potentially ""dangerous"" Middle East on Wednesday as nuclear negotiations appear to stall and regional instability looms. The State Department on Wednesday ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the US Embassy in Baghdad, citing a commitment “to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad.” The embassy had already been operating with limited staff.""Well they are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place. We've given notice to move out and we'll see what happens."" Trump said, adding that ""they can't have a nuclear weapon, very simple. We're not going to allow that.""Additionally, the State Department is authorising the optional departure of nonessential personnel and family members from diplomatic posts in Bahrain and Kuwait. The US military is also following suit, with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth approving the voluntary departure of military dependents from multiple locations across the region. US Central Command said it is “monitoring the developing tension.”White House spokesperson Anna Kelly noted that the decisions came after a regular review of American personnel abroad. “This decision was made as a result of a recent review,” she said.The move comes as efforts to revive the stalled US-Iran nuclear negotiations face fresh setbacks. Talks aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanction relief have reportedly reached a deadlock, with the next round—originally planned for this weekend in Oman—now in doubt. Two US officials, speaking anonymously, said it was increasingly unlikely the talks would go ahead.President Donald Trump offered a pessimistic assessment in a recent interview, saying he is “getting more and more less confident about” reaching a deal. “They seem to be delaying, and I think that's a shame,” he told the New York Post podcast Pod Force One.Iran, meanwhile, rejected threats of force. “Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon, and US militarism only fuels instability,” its mission to the UN wrote online. Defence Minister Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh added that if war were imposed, “the opponent's casualties will certainly be more than ours,” warning the US that its regional bases “are within our reach.”Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors is considering a censure resolution against Iran, which could trigger the reimposition of UN sanctions under the still-active 2015 nuclear deal. The US withdrew from that deal during Trump’s first term.Amid the growing risk of conflict, the UK’s Maritime Trade Operations Centre warned ships to exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman—areas where Iran has previously seized or attacked vessels.","The State Department ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the US Embassy in Baghdad.

Project Pelican: Canada busts drug racket financing anti-India activities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/project-pelican-canada-busts-drug-racket-financing-anti-india-activities/articleshow/121787460.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Project Pelican, a major investigation conducted by Peel Regional Police, has busted a big narco-terror network based out of Canada and individuals suspected to be Khalistan sympathisers. While the operation led to the largest ever drug seizure there with 479 kg of cocaine valued at $47.9 million, nine individuals including seven Indian-origin men settled in Canada have been arrested.The investigation has revealed that the network exploited commercial trucking routes from the US to Canada, with ties to Mexican cartels and US-based distributors, the Peel police said.The proceeds from drug trafficking were being used to finance anti-India activities, including protests and referendums besides funding for weapons, sources said. Intelligence sources pointed towards an ISI-backed plan where Khalistani groups in Canada are being funded to traffick high value Mexican cocaine. The ISI has also been been found pushing Afghan-grown heroin.The arrested men include Sajgith Yogendrarajah, 31, of Toronto; Manpreet Singh, 44, of Brampton; Philip Tep, 39, of Hamilton; Arvinder Powar, 29, of Brampton; Karamjit Singh, 36, of Caledon; Gurtej Singh, 36, of Caledon; Sartaj Singh, 27, of Cambridge; Shiv Onkar Singh, 31, of Georgetown and Hao Tommy Huynh, a 27-year-old from Mississauga.They face a total of 35 charges related to firearm and drug offences, the Canadian police said.Last Dec, two Canadian nationals of Indian origin were arrested when US Illinois State Police found over 1,000 pounds of cocaine in their Volvo truck: something which alerted the investigators to the smuggling ring involving ISI which patronised illegal poppy cultivation in Afghanistan to help Taliban fight the US and Afghan troops.The current investigation began in June 2024, focusing on a cocaine smuggling operation using US-Canada commercial trucking routes. By Nov, multiple individuals, trucking companies, and storage sites linked to the operation were identified with the help of Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.Significant seizures were made between Feb and May 2025, including 127 kg of cocaine at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor and 50 kg at the Blue Water Bridge in Point Edward, the Peel police said in a statement. Additional seizures were made across the Greater Toronto area, with some individuals arrested in possession of loaded firearms.""A total of 479 kg of bricked cocaine, worth an estimated $47.9 million, was seized, along with two illegal loaded semi-automatic handguns. The accused were held for a bail hearing at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton,"" the Peel police said.Michael S Kerzner, solicitor general of Ontario, praised the operation, stating, ""Project Pelican is proof of what police can accomplish when they have the tools and resources needed to keep our communities safe.""","The operation led to the largest ever drug seizure there with 479 kg of cocaine valued at $47.9 million.

'Trump Card is coming': $5m gold card offering US residency now accepting applications; key details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-card-is-coming-5m-gold-card-offering-us-residency-now-accepting-applications-key-details/articleshow/121790287.cms,"(Source: Donald Trump's Truth Social account)

The

Trump Card

is coming!

What the card promises — and what it doesn’t

A replacement for EB-5?

Major tax advantage for card holders

The much-hyped “Trump Card” is now officially open for registration, offering wealthy foreigners a chance to join a waiting list.US President Donald Trump describes it as a premium route toward US citizenship, for a hefty $5 million price tag.The official website, TrumpCard.gov, features an image of the shiny gold-coloured card, complete with Trump’s photo, signature and name. The form asks for basic details like name, email, region of origin, and whether the applicant is applying as an individual or a business.Trump announced the launch on his social media platform Truth Social, “For five million $DOLLARS, The Trump Card is coming! Thousands have been calling and asking how they can sign up to ride a beautiful road in gaining access to the greatest country and market anywhere in the world.”“The waiting list is now open,” he added.The website lists eight regions for applicants to choose from: Europe, Asia (including the Middle East), North America, Oceania, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Africa.Above the details, the site ensures that applicants will be notified when access opens: ‘Enter your information below to be notified the moment access opens.’Trump claims the card offers a “path to citizenship,” but he has clarified that it does not guarantee immediate entry or naturalisation. “It’s somewhat like a green card , but at a higher level of sophistication,” the POTUS has claimed.The Trump administration insists the new card does not require approval from Congress, as it doesn’t provide citizenship outright. White House officials have said more information will be released soon, reports USA Today.Under the existing US naturalisation system, immigrants must typically be lawful permanent residents for at least five years, meet age and language criteria, and have a clean record.Trump first proposed the Trump Card earlier this year as a replacement for the EB-5 investor visa programme, which grants green cards to foreigners who invest between $800,000 and $1.05 million into US job-creating projects. The EB-5 programme has long suffered from backlogs and accusations of fraud.“Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,” Trump said in February. “They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money, and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people.”He added, “It’s a road to citizenship for people and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”One of the key selling points of the Trump Card appears to be its potential tax benefits. Trump has suggested that gold card buyers would only be taxed on their US earnings, unlike green card holders, who are taxed on worldwide income. This is likely to appeal to many high-net-worth individuals who have avoided relocating to the US due to its global tax obligations.Trump Card does not seem to require applicants to create US-based jobs or launch businesses, unlike the EB-5 visa programme. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has claimed that 1,000 cards were sold in a single day, even though the programme has yet to officially launch. According to Lutnick, some 37 million people worldwide could afford the Trump Card.Trump has claimed he was the first to purchase the Trump Card himself. “I had no idea who would be the second,” he said. However, the programme is not designed for American citizens.","The much-hyped ‘Trump Card’ is now officially open for registration.

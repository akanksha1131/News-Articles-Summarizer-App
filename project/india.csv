The police cleared the protest site and conducted thorough vehicle checks around the area.Prashant Kishor, who launched his fast-unto-death on January 2, stood in solidarity with students demanding the cancellation of the BPSC examination over reported irregularities.Police officials transferred Kishor to an ambulance during his detention. Prior to this, he announced plans to submit a petition in the high court on January 7 concerning BPSC irregularities.Soon after Kishor's detention, a clash broke out between Patna Police and supporters of Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor.""The police administration tried to break Prashant Kishore's fast by taking him from Gandhi Maidan to AIIMS. After failing to break the fast, the administration is trying to take Prashant Kishore to a new place. The police brutally lathicharged the crowd that had gathered to see Prashant Kishore outside AIIMS,"" Kishor's party said in a post.""It is not a matter of decision for us whether we will continue this (protest) or not.

In this cold weather, some are singing and you can see people from across the board sitting here. I am tired of answering accusations. Look around, and spot the vanity van if you can. We will sleep here too,"" he added.On Saturday, Tejashwi Yadav criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for exploiting the BPSC protest for political gains.He claimed that the student-led protest had been infiltrated by BJP supporters, claiming that the participants were effectively operating as an extension of the BJP.""It is being completely politicised. We feel that the people of Bihar will have to recognise these people who are the BJP's 'B' team and are trying to crush this independent movement. This is highly condemnable,"" he said.Regarding the controversy about Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor's vanity van, Yadav said, ""An attempt was made to end the movement.

3 Coast Guard men killed as helicopter crashes in Gujarat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-coast-guard-men-killed-as-helicopter-crashes-in-gujarat/articleshow/116973887.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three Coast Guard personnel were killed after their 'Dhruv' advanced light helicopter (ALH) crashed at Porbandar in Gujarat on Sunday afternoon, raising questions once again about the indigenous twin-engine choppers that have been grounded a few times after a string of accidents earlier.The ALH Mark-III chopper was returning from a routine training sortie when it reportedly developed some technical snag while landing at the Coast Guard Air Enclave in Porbandar, and crashed at about 12.15 pm. The two pilots - Commandant Saurabh and Deputy Commandant S K Yadav - and air crew diver Manoj Pradhan Navik were pulled out of the burning helicopter and rushed to the govt hospital. ""But they succumbed to their injuries. A board of inquiry will investigate the reasons leading to the crash,"" an official said.The incident comes after another ALH of the Coast Guard crashed into the Arabian Sea during a medical evacuation operation in Sept last year, leading to the death of the two pilots and an aircrew diver. The entire fleet of around 330 ALHs in the armed forces were grounded a few times in 2023 after four major accidents.The helicopter-manufacturer defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) had then undertaken safety technical upgrades after cases of design and metallurgical flaws, including ""failure of the collective"", which controls the power to the rotors and back, were reported in the choppers.First, a weaponised ALH version called Rudra had crashed in Arunachal Pradesh in Oct 2022, killing two officers and three soldiers. Then, there were two back-to-back ALH crashes in March 2023. In May that year, another ALH Mark-III of the Army had gone down in J&K's Kishtwar district, killing a soldier and grievously injuring the two pilots.The crashes had led to calls for a comprehensive inquiry into the problems plaguing the chopper fleet because the ALHs are the workhorses of the armed forces and critical in the ongoing push for self-reliance in defence production. Moreover, India also wants to export the 5.5-tonne chopper in greater numbers in the years ahead.",The ALH Mark-III chopper was returning from a routine training sortie.

Graffiti in ancient Tamil Nadu sites similar to Indus Valley civilisation signs: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/graffiti-in-ancient-tamil-nadu-sites-similar-to-indus-valley-civilisation-signs-study/articleshow/116973837.cms,"CHENNAI: A study by the Tamil Nadu archaeology department has revealed that more than 90% of the ancient graffiti marks found at 140 archaeological sites in the state, including Keeladi, have parallels or similarities with those of the Indus Valley civilisation that existed from around 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE.Researchers analyzed 15,184 graffiti signs inscribed on potsherds unearthed from these sites, discovering that some signs had exact parallels while others had near similarities. ""The exact shapes and their variants found in south India and Indus scripts indicate that they were not accidental,"" said archaeologist K Rajan, one of the report's authors. He said the Indus script or signs likely evolved over time rather than disappearing without a trace.The study highlighted several common symbols between southern India and Indus Valley (also known as the Harappan civilisation), including upward-facing arrows with triangle or flower-shaped heads, fish signs in both stylish and exact forms, U- shaped signs, plain circles, ladder symbols, square boxes (plain and divided), X-shaped signs, and swastika-like signs in both clockwise and anti-clockwise forms.Other common marks included flower signs, inverted Y-like signs, Z-like signs, A-like signs, and star signs.""The recent radiocarbon dates indicate that when the Indus Valley experienced the Copper Age, south India was in the Iron Age. In this sense, the Iron Age of south India and the Copper Age of the Indus were contemporary. If they are contemporary, there is a possibility of cultural exchanges either through direct or intermediate zones,"" Rajan said.Excavations at sites like Sivagalai, Adhichanallur, and other locations in Tamiraparani river basin have provided recent iron dating that may push back the timeline of the Iron Age in southern India by several centuries. Rajan highlighted the importance of documenting the graffiti inscribed potsherds, saying this documentation would be made available to researchers for further deciphering.Archaeology department joint director R Sivanantham, who is a co-author of the report, said: ""The occurrence of a large number of carnelian and agate beads, as well as high-tin bronze objects, particularly from Iron Age graves, gives a clue about the contacts as carnelian, agate, copper, and tin have to come from the north.""","Researchers analyzed 15,184 graffiti signs inscribed on potsherds unearthed from these sites.

""Bastar police have arrested three persons in connection with the murder of Mukesh Chandrakar while prime accused Suresh Chandrakar, a civil contractor, is still at large,"" he said, naming the three detainees as Suresh's relatives Ritesh and Dinesh Chandrakar, and farmhouse supervisor Mahendra Ramteke.On the motive for Mukesh's murder, Sharma said that a news report on corruption in road construction was telecast on NDTV on Dec 25 last year, which prompted deputy CM Arun Sao to order an inquiry the same day. It's suspected that this report was the cause behind Mukesh's murder, since the alleged corruption was carried out by Suresh and his associates, who were the road contractors, Sharma said. Any other possible motive will also be investigated, he added.Remembering his personal interactions with Mukesh and admiring his work from the interiors of Bastar, Sharma termed the incident as ""disturbing and brutal"". ""His murder is a big jolt to efforts to establish peace in Bastar,"" Sharma said.""The main accused in the case, Suresh Chandrakar, is a Congress leader and a party functionary of Bijapur district. He is on the run and four teams of police have been constituted to trace him,"" Sharma said.Sharma recounted the recent crimes in Surajpur, Baloda Bazar and Raipur firing case, and claimed that most of these incidents involved Congress workers and leaders. ""I am not saying that all Congress leaders are criminals but why are names of Congress people surfacing in criminal cases?"" he asked.Head of Congress state communication wing, Sushil Anand Shukla, countered Sharma's allegation and said that Suresh Chandrakar was inducted into BJP.""Murder accused Suresh Chandrakar joined BJP. There are photos of him with senior BJP leaders of Bijapur and former BJP president of Bijapur G Venkat. Suresh also visited CM House 10 days ago and CCTV footage of CM House should be made public,"" Shukla said.The SIT is led by IPS officer Mayank Gurjar, Sharma said, adding that the police will submit a chargesheet in court within 3-4 weeks. We will request the court for a speedy trial, he said. Mukesh, 33, had gone missing on the evening of Jan 1.Police launched a search after his brother Yukesh reported him missing. Based on his last mobile location, police went to a house in Chattanpara Basti in Bijapur town and found a freshly laid cement slab covering a septic tank. They found Mukesh’s body in the tank.Prime accused Suresh is a relative of Mukesh and there are family pictures of him with the two brothers. Deputy CM Sharma said, “We have directed officials to freeze bank accounts of Suresh Chandrakar and the accused. Bijapur administration has started taking action and razed illegal properties in the region.” An illegally constructed yard in forested land was bulldozed, he said.","Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma has set up an 11-member SIT to investigate the murder of well-known Bastar journalist Mukesh Chandrakar.

Poll What Do You Think Was Captain Devi Sharan's Greatest Achievement? His Overall Dedication to Aviation Handling IC 814 Situation

NEW DELHI: “Now even as a passenger, I will always be looking at people around me to ensure that everyone is alright and nothing’s wrong. A creeping doubt will linger on.” That’s how Captain Devi Sharan — commander of the Indian Airlines aircraft IC 814 hijacked in December 1999 — will travel hereon after operating his last flight as a pilot on Saturday and retiring on turning 65. Joining erstwhile Indian Airlines in 1985, the ace pilot hung up his boots after 40 years in the flight deck that have given him memories — and nightmares — for a lifetime.“IC 814 hijacking taught me life is very unpredictable and one has to be always ready to fight back. Those were the toughest days of my life and my only aim was to save lives of everyone on that aircraft. I hope and pray no crew member, passenger or anyone else ever relives those moments,” Sharan told TOI Sunday as he prepares to board a set of long flights around the world over the next one year that will take him to Antartica and Siberia among other places.The Kandahar hijacking was not the only time this pilot and some others in erstwhile Indian Airlines had a tryst with danger. He along with Captain S P S Suri — the pilot flew the hijacked aircraft of erstwhile Indian Airlines back home on January 1, 2000, — had another tryst with danger 12 years later. This time the two and their cabin crew member colleagues got stuck in civil-war torn Libya and were waylaid by AK 47-totting youngsters on the streets of the city. Luckily, they all escaped unhurt.Captain Sharan did his flying training from Karnal in 1984 and then was selected by erstwhile Indian Airlines (which merged into Air India in 2007) the next year. He started with the Boeing 737-200, then operated the Airbus A320 and the A330 (one of which was hijacked to Kandahar). After the merger with AI, he flew the A330 and then the B787 Dreamliner. His final flight as a pilot was operating a Dreamliner from Melbourne to Delhi on January 4. The crew of this flight gave hi a special farewell.“With the same enthusiasm of a young boy who once joined this airline, I now turn the page and embark on the golden years of my life,” he said in a mail to colleagues. After his year-long world tour is over, Captain Sharan plans to do farming in Karnal and may also be onboard the mega training facility AI is creating.","Captain Devi Sharan, commander of IC 814 hijacked in 1999, retires after 40 years in the flight deck.

Doctors and leaders from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha ( SKM ) revealed on Sunday that Dallewal is ""not able to speak"" and has experienced dizziness and vomiting, raising concerns about his condition.The 70-year-old has steadfastly refused medical aid despite multiple interventions by the Punjab government, acting under Supreme Court directives.Dallewal, the convener of the SKM (non-political), has been protesting at the Khanauri border between Punjab and Haryana since November 26. On Saturday, during a farmers' gathering, he was brought on a stretcher to address the crowd while lying in a bed on stage. His speech emphasised that farmers' welfare was more important than his own life.Following the event, Dallewal experienced severe dizziness and vomiting, according to Dr Avtar Singh of the NGO 5 Rivers Heart Association, who is monitoring his condition.“His blood pressure fluctuated significantly during the event. He felt dizzy and vomited when he was being taken back to his tent,” Dr Singh told news agency PTI. The SKM also reported that Dallewal has had multiple episodes of vomiting and can no longer stand or speak properly, adding that his kidney function is deteriorating.Despite mounting health risks, Dallewal has rejected offers to move to a makeshift hospital set up near the protest site. The Supreme Court, which will hear a contempt petition against Punjab's chief secretary and police chief on Monday, previously criticised the state government for failing to provide medical aid and questioned the role of farmers resisting intervention.The court noted that while Dallewal’s life is precious, it doubted the intentions of some farmer leaders and state officials. On December 20, the court instructed the government to decide on Dallewal’s hospitalisation, but no significant progress has been made.Farmers under the banners of SKM (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha continue to rally at the Khanauri and Shambhu border points, urging authorities to fulfil their demands.Meanwhile, Dallewal has called for nationwide solidarity, urging villages across Punjab to send support to the protest site. Farmer leader Sarwan Singh Pandher announced plans to observe Guru Gobind Singh's Gurpurab at the Shambhu border on Monday, reinforcing their commitment to the movement.","Jagjit Singh Dallewal is on the 41st day of a hunger strike demanding a legal guarantee for minimum support prices (MSP) Doctors and leaders from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha revealed on Sunday that he is ""not able to speak"" The 70-year-old has steadfastly refused medical aid despite multiple interventions by the Punjab government, acting under Supreme Court directives.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116970501,imgsize-2188532,width-400,resizemode-4/116970501.jpg"

Lakshadweep divers bump into wreck of centuries-old warship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lakshadweep-divers-bump-intowreck-of-centuries-old-warship/articleshow/116951968.cms,"Divers discovered the wreck of a probable European warship near Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep on Saturday. The ship, dating back to the 17th or 18th centuries, includes a cannon and anchor, suggesting historic maritime battles.

Poll Which Destination Would you Prefer for a Tropical Getaway? Lakshadweep Andaman and Nicobar Islands

CHENNAI: A group of divers exploring marine life near Kalpeni island in the Lakshadweep archipelago stumbled on Saturday morning upon the wreck of what, it appeared, had been a warship.Going by the nature of the wreck, researchers believe the ship, fitted with cannon, might have belonged to any of the three European powers - Portuguese, Dutch, or British - and was sunk sometime during the fight for supremacy over the ancient maritime route connecting the Middle East and Sri Lanka in the 17th and 18th centuries.“When we spotted the wreck on the western side of Kalpeni, we didn’t know it was a warship. When we found a cannon and an anchor, we realised it could be an important find,” said Satyajeet Mane, a marine explorer who led the group of divers from Brannadives, a local divers’ group that included Nasrulla and Sajudheen.They said they would inform the local authorities about the find. ""We found it at a depth of just four or five metres at the mouth of a lagoon. The wreckage appears to be spread over the deeper parts of the Arabian Sea,"" said Mane. ""Going by the size of the ship, the cannon, and the metal, it could be a European warship. More exploration is needed.""Idrees Babu, a scientist at the department of science and technology and a mentor to the divers' group, said such a shipwreck has not been recorded in the region earlier. tnn""The ship might have been 50m-60m in length. The East India Company started using iron ships on this trade route in the 17th century or 18th century. We need underwater archaeological studies to learn more about it; till then we need to protect the site,"" he said.When the British used iron ships, the Portuguese continued to use ships made of iron and wood. ""The coral growth on the wreckage and corrosion makes it difficult to immediately ascertain if the ship was made fully of iron or it had components of wood too. The coral growth indicates it has been submerged for a few centuries,"" said Mane.","Divers discover wreck of probable European warship near Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep.

'No Australia-like plan in India to ban social media for kids': IT secretary S Krishnan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-australia-like-plan-in-india-to-ban-social-media-for-kids-it-secretary-s-krishnan/articleshow/116973271.cms,"In the draft rules under DPDP law, you have suggested ""verifiable consent"" of parents when children join social media, against going the Australia way which has announced a complete ban for those under age of 16. Was a ban ever considered?

So, there is no plan of a complete ban?

The govt has time and again expressed frustration in dealing with the Big Tech and how open - or prompt - they are to requests and orders around content takedown. Is the compliance getting worse or getting better?

Cyber frauds have emerged as a major concern, with people losing thousands of crores of rupees and new phenomenon like digital arrests emerging in today's day and age. How concerned are you?

Govt has suggested “verifiable consent” from parents through the draft digital personal data protection rules against going out for an all-out ban on children joining social media on the lines of Australia, IT secretary S Krishnan told Pankaj Doval in an interview.“These are things which every society has to decide for itself. And so that is a social thing as to whether you will restrict access completely. In the Indian context, a lot of learning also takes place online. So, if you block complete access, is that a good way? That’s a broader social debate.”On social media firms taking out unlawful content, Krishnan praised Big Tech: “Compliance is actually going up tremendously, and many, many cases are dealt with before it even comes to the question of blocking. They do it immediately. Based on their own community guidelines or the takedown requests given out by the govt over unlawful content, the timeframe within which they do it now is really short… it’s gone up remarkably.”These are things which every society has to decide for itself. And so that is a social thing as to whether you will restrict access completely. In the Indian context, a lot of learning also takes place online. So, if you block complete access, is that a good way? That's a broader social debate. We control only the technology of it, but who should have access and how, that is something which is where the society at large has to have some sort of a consensus and the govt then needs to take it up and move forward.I don't think anyone has even suggested that so far. As far as a ban is concerned, I don't think that's even been discussed. I mean there are issues on how you prevent harm (to children) and what measures can be taken to prevent harm. But, that's not gone to the extent of a complete ban.Compliance is actually going up tremendously, and many, many cases are dealt with before it even comes to the question of blocking. They do it immediately. Based on their own community guidelines or the takedown requests given out by the govt over unlawful content, the timeframe within which they do it now is really short than earlier.And compared to where it was, say two or three years ago, it's gone up remarkably. The number of things which are taken down, the timeliness with which they're taken down, has gone up remarkably. These are on issues such as CSAM (child sexual abuse material), offensive content of various kinds, and on something that may disturb communal harmony. They do act, and on time.We are very concerned. First of all, let me emphasise that there is nothing called a cyber arrest. There is no provision for a cyber arrest or a digital arrest in any Indian law. People, including the educated, are falling for it due to a lack of awareness. Even the PM has spoken about this issue, which reflects the importance we are giving to this new problem.Not just the IT ministry, but there are a plethora of agencies involved in cyber security, which includes the ministry of home affairs and the i4C (India Cybercrime Coordination Centre), apart from the office of the National Security Advisor to address these problems.","Govt has suggested “verifiable consent” from parents through the draft digital personal data protection rules.

He was also given a ""case number"". Once he keyed it in, an arrest warrant, a bank account freeze warrant and an RBI notice popped up. They were all fake, but the man was convinced he was in legal trouble. The scammers forbade him from seeking advice from anyone. After receiving a second notice with ""Supreme Court of India"" written on the letterhead, the man was spooked and went to the bank as instructed by the scammers. He transferred Rs 32 lakh to them. After returning home and confiding in his family, his brother told him it appeared that he had been scammed.In the case of the vice-president, fraudsters got him to empty out not only his bank accounts, but also the pension accounts of his elderly mother and deceased father. They sent him letters from ""CBI, RBI and Supreme Court"", accusing him of drug trafficking, human trafficking and money laundering. He was asked to download Skype where instructions were given to him to transfer funds to ""a special account created by RBI"". Faced with threats that his mother too would be arrested, he transferred Rs 1.6 crore.

2018 Kasganj violence was 'premeditated' plot: Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2018-kasganj-violence-was-premeditated-plot-court/articleshow/116973054.cms,"LUCKNOW: Terming the violence in UP's Kasganj in 2018 a ""premeditated conspiracy"", the Lucknow NIA court in its judgment on Friday expressed concern over the growing trend of NGOs providing legal aid to people accused of being involved in anti-national activities. The court sentenced 28 accused to life imprisonment for their role in the violence that led to the murder of a youth, Chandan Gupta.In his 130-page order, special judge Vivekanand Sharan Tripathi observed: ""This trend is promoting very dangerous and narrow thinking regarding the judiciary and all the stakeholders of judiciary (bar and bench) must ponder over this.""""They should also ponder what interest India-based NGOs, Citizens of Justice and Peace, People's Union for Civil Liberties, Rihai Manch, United Against Hate, and foreign NGOs like Alliance for Justice and Accountability (New York), Indian American Muslim Council (Washington DC) and South Asia Solidarity Group (London) may have in a communal clash in UP's Kasganj district,"" judge said in his order.""To find out where they are getting their funding from and what is their collective objective and take effective measures to check their unwanted interference in the judicial process, a copy of this judgment should be sent to the Bar Council of India and the Union home secretary,"" the court said.Calling the violence a premeditated conspiracy, the judge said, ""The court is of the opinion that it won't be proper to consider Kasganj communal violence a sudden and sporadic act. Considering it a premeditated act, it's proper to give a strong punishment to the accused in order to send a strong message to criminals and rioters who commit such acts at local, state and national levels.""

He claimed the govt's guidance value set the plot at Rs 23.2 crore, but BDA sold it for Rs 2 crore.According to reports, the site, after it was transferred in 1973 from the City Improvement Trust Board to its later avatar BDA, was given to a private person for a 10-year period with the intent of establishing a nursing home. When the lease period expired, the individual requested BDA to issue an absolute sale deed. However, BDA spiked the request on the ground that a civic amenity (CA) site cannot be transferred to individuals. Requests were made again in 2008, 2013 and 2015. On July 12, 2024, BDA issued an absolute sale deed citing a controversial 2020 order that empowered BDA to sell CA sites.BDA commissioner N Jayaram insisted the plot was not a CA site. Asked why it was not opened to public bidding, he told TOI it was because ""the occupants are in its possession"".""Given the fact As the occupants are in its possession, we cannot go for bidding.""",Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya demanded a probe into the plot sale of July last year.

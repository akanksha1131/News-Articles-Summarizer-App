'Fanatical mindset': India slams Pakistan in UN over 'unjustified' reference to J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fanatical-mindset-india-slams-pakistan-in-un-over-unjustified-reference-to-jk/articleshow/119029298.cms,"India at UN

NEW DELHI: India raised strong objections against Pakistan's mention of Jammu and Kashmir at the UN General Assembly, emphasising that such statements doesn't substantiate their territorial claims.""As is their habit, the former foreign secretary of Pakistan today has made an unjustified reference to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,"" stated India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador P Harish, during Friday's General Assembly meeting, which was held to observe the International Day to combat Islamophobia.Harish added that that Pakistan's repeated mentions would ""neither validate their claim nor justify their practice of cross-border terrorism "". ""The fanatical mindset of this nation is well known, as also its record of bigotry. Such efforts will not change the reality that Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will always be an integral part of India,"" he declared.This forceful response followed Pakistan's former foreign secretary, Tehmina Janjua's references to Jammu and Kashmir during the informal gathering commemorating the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations shared further details on the ambassador ""delivering India's statement"". Talking about Islamophobia, Harish added to his statement, ""India stands united with the UN membership in condemning incidents of religious intolerance against Muslims."" ""It is imperative to recognize that religious discrimination is a broader challenge that affects followers of all faiths,"" also said P Harish adding that, ""Any deliberation on issues of faith must seek to unite , not divide.""India's criticism on Pakistan at the UN comes after Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, to which the ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement, rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighbour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.'MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, ""We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.""Read more: MEA rejects Pakistan’s claim of India's role in train hijacking The attack on the Jaffar Express on March 11, which was carrying more than 450 passengers, led to 58 deaths, comprising 21 passengers, four soldiers, and 33 militants belonging to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group.Pakistan regularly claims that India provides support to organisations such as the BLA to foment instability in Balochistan, charges that New Delhi categorically rejects.","Pakistan's former foreign secretary, Tehmina Janjua, made references to Jammu and Kashmir during the informal gathering commemorating the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.

"Vadodara car crash accused Rakshit Chaurasia blames pothole, denies drunk driving",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vadodara-car-crash-accused-rakshit-chaurasia-blames-pothole-denies-drunk-driving/articleshow/119029466.cms,"NEW DELHI: 23-year-old law student, Rakshit Ravish Chaurasia, accused of killing one woman and injuring eight others with a speeding car in Vadodara, has denied being under the influence of alcohol during the accident. He claimed that the incident occurred after the airbags in his car deployed suddenly, hampering his vision.Chaurasia said he wants to meet the family of the victims and will respect whatever they want to happen.“We were going ahead of the scooty, we were turning right and there was a pothole on the road. There was a scooty and a car while we were turning right... The car slightly touched the other vehicle and the airbag opened suddenly, our vision was hampered and the car went out of control. We were going at 50 km/hour,” Chaurasia said.“There were no people at that time, just a scooter and a car. I had no idea. I did not do any party, I went for Holika Dahan and was not drunk... Today, I was told that one woman has died and a few have sustained injuries. I want to meet the family of the victims, it is my fault and whatever they want that should happen,” he added.This comes a day after a speeding car driven by a 20-year-old law student crashed into two-wheelers in Vadodara city in the early hours of Friday.The accident occurred around 12:30 a.m. near Muktanand Cross Roads in the Karelibaug area. Following the crash, the driver, Chaurasia, was arrested, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Panna Momaya.Near Amrapali Complex, Chaurasia first hit a woman on a two-wheeler before knocking down two other bikers. The impact was so severe that the car’s airbags deployed.When the vehicle finally came to a halt, Chauhan, who had been with Chaurasia, stepped out and walked away, repeatedly saying, ""I didn’t do anything. He was driving the car,"" while pointing at Chaurasia. Chaurasia, a fourth-year law student at M.S. University, then stepped out of the car and began shouting ""another round,"" ""uncle,"" and ""Om Namah Shivay"" at the top of his voice.Passersby chased him down, preventing his escape. Some angry locals thrashed him before the police arrived.CCTV footage captured the entire incident. The injured, including a child, have been hospitalized. Senior police officials confirmed that Chaurasia has been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Chauhan's blood samples have also been taken. If found intoxicated, he will be booked under the Prohibition Act.“The deceased woman has been identified as Hemali Patel. Her husband, Purav Patel, who was riding with her, is in critical condition,” said Panna Momaya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP).Police suspect that Chaurasia’s shouts of ‘another round’ indicated his intention to continue reckless driving and harm more people. Chaurasia, originally from Uttar Pradesh, resides in a rented accommodation in Nizampura, Vadodara. He told the media that he wasn't intoxicated while driving and claimed that the car hit a two-wheeler, after which the airbags deployed, and he couldn’t see what happened.","Rakshit Ravish Chaurasia, 23, is accused of killing one woman and injuring eight others with a speeding car in Vadodara, India.

Only days spent in India to decide NRI tax status: ITAT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-days-spent-in-india-to-decide-nri-tax-status-itat/articleshow/119029053.cms,"Mumbai :

The Mumbai Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has ruled in favour of an individual who claimed his tax residential status to be that of a ‘ non-resident ’ as he had spent 210 days on work abroad, reports Lubna Kably.As India does not tax overseas income in the hands of a non-resident, M Gulati did not disclose his overseas income of Rs 1.2 crore for the financial year 2015-16. He contended he had spent less than 182 days in the country and was a non-resident. But I-T claimed that of the 210 days, he had spent 28 days looking for work, and hence a tax resident of India. ITAT made it clear an individual’s tax residential status must be determined solely by the number of days spent in India.The ITAT rejected the contention of the Income-tax (IT) department, which had recomputed Gulati’s stay outside India as it partly comprised of days spent job-hunting. The ITAT order provides clarity on the tax treatment of individuals who split their time between employment and job search abroad. It reinforces that any period spent outside India for employment or in search of employment should be counted towards non-resident status determination.The decision will benefit expatriates who go overseas in search of a job and gain employment.A person who is a tax resident of India has to pay tax on his global income. A non-resident does not pay tax in India on his or her overseas income but only on the income that accrues or arises in India (example: rent from property in India, bank interest, etc).The number of days stayed in India determines the tax residency status.Under provisions of the I-T Act, viz: Explanation 1 to section 6(1), if an individual leaves India for the ‘purpose of employment’ overseas, he or she will qualify as a tax resident only if the stay ‘in India’ is for 182 days or more in a particular year.From financial year 2020-21, the period was reduced to 120 days or more, for those individuals whose total income (other than foreign sources) exceeds Rs 15 lakh.The I-T officer noted Gulati had spent 210 days outside India in the relevant assessment year (AY 2016-17), of which 28 days were in search of employment.He held that only the days of actual employment could be considered. Thus, based on a revised calculation, he held that Gulati had spent more than 182 days in India and was hence a tax resident. Consequently, the overseas salary of Rs 86.2 lakh and interest income of Rs 2.8 lakh would be taxable in India. The Appellate Commissioner upheld the stand of the I-T officer by holding that during the 28-day period, the taxpayer had not received any salary and the adjustment in days was correctly made.However, the ITAT relying on judicial precedents disagreed and overruled the I-T department’s stand. The tax tribunal held that seeking employment abroad also qualifies as a legitimate purpose under Explanation 1 to section 6 (1). An individual’s tax residential status must be determined solely based on number of days spent in India.",M Gulati did not disclose his overseas income of Rs 1.2 crore for the financial year 2015-16. He contended he had spent less than 182 days in the country and was a non-resident. The number of days stayed in India determines the tax residency status.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119029202,imgsize-984713,width-400,resizemode-4/119029202.jpg"
India adds 6 properties to its tentative list for Unesco heritage status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-adds-6-properties-to-its-tentative-list-for-unesco-heritage-status/articleshow/119028404.cms,"NEW DELHI: A set of six properties-including some considered serially, such as Ashokan Edict Sites and Chausath Yogini Temples spread across multiple states-have been added to India's tentative list by Unesco's World Heritage Centre.These sites were added to the list on March 7, the Permanent Delegation of India to Unesco said in a statement. India at Unesco shared the statement on microblogging site X, late on Thursday. Addition to the World Heritage Centre's tentative list is mandatory if a property is to be nominated for inscription to World Heritage List in future, it said.The six properties added to the tentative list include Kanger Valley National Park in Chhattisgarh; Mudumal Megalithic Menhirs in Telangana; serial nomination of Ashokan Edict Sites along the Mauryan Routes (multiple states); serial nomination of Chausath Yogini Temples (multiple states); serial nomination of Gupta Temples in north India (multiple states), and the palace-fortresses of the Bundelas in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the statement said.With these additions, India now has 62 sites on the tentative list. The 'tentative list' is an inventory of properties each country intends to consider for Unesco nomination.According to the Unesco website, Chausath Yogini Temples considered serially includes sites at multiple locations in the country. ""The Chausath Yogini Temples have 64 images of Yoginis in their individual shrines with intricate stone carvings circularly arranged. These temples are mostly situated on hilltops. 'Yogini' refers to a female practitioner of yoga and 'chausath' is the Hindi word for the number 64. The Yoginis are 64 in number and hence called the Chausath Yogini. They are a group of forest spirits and mother goddesses,"" reads a description on Unesco website.""It is this embodiment of both alluring and threatening qualities, as well as the large number of goddesses from the group that identifies them as Yoginis,"" it reads.At present, a total of 43 properties from India are inscribed on Unesco World Heritage List, including 35 in the 'Cultural' category, seven in 'Natural' and one in 'Mixed' category.India hosted a World Heritage Committee meeting for the first time in 2024, during which the Moidams-the mound-burial system of the Ahom Dynasty in Assam-was accorded the coveted Unesco tag.","A set of six properties have been added to India's tentative list by Unesco.

First is ensuring that they get calibrated blood glucose monitoring data. Second is capturing that data on orbit from crew members. The final step is bringing that data to the ground to enable medical professionals to be able to assess it.Mitchell said the diverse & multinational crew would bring unique perspectives on this flight, with ""Shux"" (Shukla's call sign for the mission) being tasked with research focused on life science. ""One is to investigate the effects of microgravity on micrology, which is important as it could have potential future applications on uses like food, fuel, and life support systems. The second experiment he's working to accomplish is to investigate the viability of six different crop seeds for future spaceflight applications.""TOI visited the mission control room and facilities where Axiom is building its space station, but couldn't speak to Shukla or Group Captain Prashanth Nair, the second Indian astronaut training with Axiom as his backup, because of Isro's protocol.","Axiom-4 (Ax4) mission will take them to the International Space Station (ISS) later this year.

"Only 388 Indian illegals in US verified, all back: Govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-388-indian-illegals-in-us-verified-all-back-govt/articleshow/119028170.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt. These include the plane-loads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration.Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past. For India, whether it's a million or a few thousand, there's no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification.While extremely large figures - ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 - have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the govt has maintained it has no data about the number of ""undocumented"" Indian immigrants residing in the US. ""The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,'' said junior external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in RS earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an ""unambiguous"" verification of their nationality. India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number (2,042) in 2019. Last year, it took back 1,368 illegal Indians.For the Indian govt, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry. He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration.","India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

BENGALURU: Forget Chandrayaan, Isro. If you really want to test lunar terrain, just get your mission vehicles to take a drive down Bellandur's crater-riddled roads! This was the new cry that echoed in the IT hub Wednesday.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar scheduled to visit Bellandur at 4pm, hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital. Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""Rajesh Narka, representing Bellandur Rising 2025 initiative, called for swift action. ""Bellandur is home to some of the biggest IT hubs, yet the roads are in a shambles. We take pride in our city, but we cannot be expected to tolerate this mess. If the govt really wanted to fix this, it wouldn't have taken long.""Joginder Yadav, a resident, pointed to the irony of last-minute patchwork before the DCM's scheduled visit. ""BBMP suddenly laid gravel and sprinkled water just because a minister was expected. Illegal parking, footpath encroachments and lack of traffic lights make things worse. We pay our taxes — we contribute to nation-building.

NEW DELHI: After Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement on Friday rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighboour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.'During a press briefing on Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan presented evidence of calls traced to Afghanistan regarding the hijacking. When questioned about Pakistan's stance shift from India to Afghanistan concerning terrorist attacks, he maintained their position, stating there was no policy change and reaffirmed their belief in India's involvement in terrorism against Pakistan.Since Tuesday's attack, Pakistan's military, government and media allies have implicitly suggested Indian involvement in the train assault, whilst overlooking significant security lapses by their military and intelligence services.MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, ""We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.""Meanwhile, Afghanistan's foreign affairs ministry issued a statement rejecting Pakistan's claims, urging them to address their internal security concerns rather than making unfounded accusations.The Jaffar Express incident on March 11, involving over 450 passengers, resulted in 58 fatalities, including 21 passengers, four soldiers, and 33 militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist organisation.Pakistan consistently accuses India of supporting groups like the BLA to create unrest in Balochistan, allegations that New Delhi firmly denies.The Balochistan insurgency, rooted in local issues of poverty and political marginalisation, has continued for decades. Indo-Pakistani relations, which deteriorated following the 2019 Pulwama attack, continue to be strained with minimal prospects for diplomatic engagement.","Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan.

While traveling from India to Dubai, people are curious about the legal restrictions on carrying gold. Whether you are carrying gold for personal consumption or as a gift, it is important to know the customs rules and duties to prevent any legal issues. India has certain regulations regarding the amount of gold you can carry, and carrying more than that can lead to heavy fines or confiscation. In this comprehensive guide, we'll take you through the main customs rules, gold duty rates, and advice on avoiding running afoul of Indian laws while carrying gold. Stay updated to make your trip smooth and problem-free.As per the CBIC guidelines, Indian passengers returning from Dubai after a stay of more than six months can bring up to 1 kg of gold with them. However, as per Economic Times report, this is allowed only if they pay the applicable customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, coins, or bars. It is important for travelers to carry proper documentation, such as purchase invoices, that provide details on the price, purity, and date of purchase. These documents are required for verification during customs clearance at Indian airports, ensuring the process goes smoothly and in compliance with regulations.Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free.

Customs officers assess the value of the gold and apply the corresponding duty rate. To avoid complications, it’s crucial to have accurate invoices and certificates for purity and weight. As per reports from Economic Times, If the proper documentation is not provided, the traveler may face penalties, including confiscation of the gold.If you’re carrying more gold than the duty-free limit allows, you must declare it at the airport.

Visuals of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy's office-residence have emerged showcasing unprecedented grandeaur of a luxurious seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam.The coastal property, which critics call Andhra's ',' features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.The Rushikonda structure, which Chandrababu Naidu 's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) says was initially proposed as Reddy's camp office, now features lavish interiors with gold accents, Italian marble floors, premium furniture, bright chandeliers and bathtubs.The facility boasts comprehensive infrastructure including well-constructed roads, drainage networks, substantial water supply and a 100 KV electrical substation.Similar to Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal's ',' Andhra Pradesh's new administration faces uncertainty regarding the building's utilisation. The renovation of Kejriwal's official residence at Flagstaff Road, Civil Lines - which the BJP used effectively against him in elections - cost Rs 33 crore, up from the initial Rs 7.9 crore estimate.According to TDP, the project's purpose changed multiple times during development - initially presented as a luxury hotel, then proposed as the chief minister's camp office, and later suggested as a tourism venture.Despite receiving CRZ (Coastal Regulatory Zone) approval from central authorities in May 2021, concerns exist about the extensive demolition of Rushikonda hill during construction.The project, initially presented as a premium hotel with a Rs 91 crore budget, has reportedly exceeded Rs 500 crore upon completion, according to TDP assertions.The Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggests that including furnishings would significantly increase the total cost.","Jagan Mohan Reddy's seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.

The Karnataka High Court on Friday stayed the trial court's decision to take cognizance of the charges against former Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and three other accused in connection with a Pocso Act case . The High Court also stayed the summons issued to them, relieving them from personal appearances before the trial court.On February 28, the special court had issued summons for Yediyurappa, 82, and three others to appear on March 15 in connection with the case. The court had also taken fresh cognizance of the charge sheet filed by the Karnataka Criminal Investigation Department (CID).The case dates back to March 14 of last year when a complaint was filed by the mother of a 17-year-old girl, who alleged Yediyurappa of sexually assaulting her daughter during a meeting at his residence in Dollars Colony on February 2, 2023.Justice Pradeep Singh Yerur, who passed the interim order, noted that the matter required further detailed hearings. He also exempted the accused from appearing before the trial court until the next hearing and issued a notice to the complainant.Also read: POCSO case: Karnataka high court grants interim relief to former CM BS Yediyurappa The stay came after Yediyurappa challenged the trial court's decision to take cognizance of the case.Senior Advocate C.V. Nagesh, representing Yediyurappa, argued that the complaint was questionable, noting that the complainant and her daughter had met the Bengaluru Police Commissioner multiple times after the alleged incident without making any allegations. He also pointed out that key witnesses who were present at Yediyurappa's residence during the alleged incident had confirmed that nothing untoward had occurred.Nagesh further contended that the trial court had passed its order without thoroughly considering the facts of the case.However, Advocate General Shashi Kiran Shetty, representing the state, opposed the petition, arguing that the trial court had found sufficient grounds to proceed with the case. He stated that staying the order would negatively affect the prosecution’s case.The trial court’s decision to take fresh cognizance followed a February 7 order from the High Court, which had instructed the trial court to reconsider and pass appropriate orders on the CID's final report in the case.This order followed the partial allowance of Yediyurappa's petition challenging the Pocso Act proceedings against him.

Two ‘ forest watchers ’ at Kanha National Park in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh have been arrested and booked under UAPA for alleged ties with Maoists, triggering unrest among forest staff. Many are seeking transfer for fear of getting caught between Maoists and police.‘Watchers’ are the ones who patrol the forest on foot, venturing into the deepest, most dangerous parts of the forest that others dare not. “Hamare logon ko tiger se dar nahi lagta saheb, police se lagta hai (We are more scared of police than tigers),” said a forest officer, expressing anguish over the arrest of two forest watchers.This has not only raised concerns about the infiltration of insurgent sympathizers within state’s wildlife sanctuaries, but left ground-level forest staff shaken.Ashok Kumar Lal and Santosh Kumar Lal, both 28 and from Mandla district, were arrested during a Maoist encounter on Sunday evening in which an insurgent was killed, said police.“Both of them were good patrol guards, always vigilant. What are they supposed to do? Maoists threaten to kill their families if they don’t help them and if they do, police arrest them for siding with anti-nationals. Watchers play a very important role in tiger conservation. They are indispensable as they patrol several hectares of dense forest on foot and unarmed,” said the forest officer, requesting not to be named.Mandla district police say the duo was caught ‘signalling’ information to Maoists on movement of security forces. From atop a hillock, they would whistle in a certain way or strike stones together as per a prearranged code to warn Maoists, say police.Forest officers maintain the duo was indeed ‘signalling’ to Maoists — but to collect their food and ration. “They were not signalling Maoists about movement of forces. It’s a wrong perception,” said the officer.“Forest watchers are in a Catch-22 situation, trapped between the threat of Maoists and police action. If they cooperate with Maoists to avoid retaliation, they risk arrest by police. If they refuse, they face violence from insurgents or suspicion from law enforcement,” said another forest officer.“Registration of cases under serious sections like UAPA against our people without analysing the situation is uncalled for,” he added. Insiders say that other forest watchers and field staff are now reluctant to work.Though Ashok and Santosh claimed it was their first interaction with Maoists, investigators say they have found handwritten notes and other evidence suggesting a much deeper connection with the insurgents. The two were not passive observers — they provided vital intelligence to Maoists about security force movements and facilitated supply of essential materials, say officers.Stationed in the heart of Kanha, the forest watchers held a strategic position to aid Maoists, allege police, pointing out that they not only compromised national security and endangered conservation efforts, but also dragged their colleagues under a cloud of suspicion as police now wonder how deeply Maoist sympathizers may have infiltrated sensitive areas.Kanha, one of India’s most iconic tiger reserves, is a symbol of conservation success. Moist movement has been reported in around 40% of the core area of Kanha, in areas bordering Balaghat. “We are now battling the expanding presence of Maoists within these protected zones. There are a joint camps of forest and police near Mukki in Kanha. Khatia has no such camp,” said a police officer.","Two ‘ forest watchers’ at Kanha National Park in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh have been arrested and booked under UAPA.

The Union law ministry has asked a district court in Ahmedabad to deliver a summons issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to billionaire Gautam Adani over alleged securities fraud and a $265 million bribery scheme, according to a letter dated Feb 25, seen by Reuters.The summons, issued under Hague Service Convention that does not allow the serving of legal documents directly to defendants in India, would require Adani or his legal counsel to appear in the case in the US, said Indian lawyers.Adani and the law ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adani Group has, in the past, termed the allegations ‘baseless’ and vowed to seek all possible legal recourse’. The summons does not imply an extradition risk for the businessman, according to a lawyer. “Extradition proceedings only come in to the picture if the US court issues warrants of arrest,” said Malak Bhatt, founding partner at NM Law Chambers.However, Arshdeep Khurana, a criminal lawyer in India, said, “The summons seems to be for appearance in a court in New York.

Burning rage or selective storm?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/burning-rage-or-selective-storm/articleshow/119014561.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

A year ago, I was invited to speak at a prison. Before the programme, I noticed a frail young man fixing a laptop. He looked like any other techie in a corporate office—small-built with inquisitive eyes, neatly dressed.

“I thought he worked here,” I said to the jailer, and swallowed my shock as the jailor called him over. The young man introduced himself as an engineer who was once a team leader at a tech firm. Work was demanding, but life was good—until that fateful night. “My wife and my mother never got along. One night, I returned home—exhausted, stressed and hungry. My mother was visiting the next day, and I had agreed to pick her up from the station without consulting my wife. My wife was furious. I tried to explain, but she wouldn’t be pacified. Something snapped inside me,” he said.

“Blood rushed to my head. I leaped at her like an animal, slapped her hard, and banged her head against the wall. She collapsed. Her eyes, frozen in disbelief, haunt me even now. A momentary rage shattered my life. My child is in her grandparents’ custody; I may never see her again. I don’t know what took over me in that moment. It wasn’t me.” He turned back to his work, a man forever burdened by the question—who was that stranger within him?

Life throws an endless supply of provocations at us-the impatient honking behind us at a red light; the maid taking off on an important day; an overlooked promotion. But for some, anger is not a flicker—it’s an inferno.

Though anger is listed as one of the deadliest of sins, for generations, some men wore their tempers like a badge of masculinity. A Tamil adage says, “The hand that strikes is the hand that embraces”. These are all extensions of the myths about anger – that it helps one succeed and inspires respect; that the supreme hand of the caregiver can hit the vulnerable under their care. But the reality is different. A short-tempered person may be tolerated but never loved.

They are a menace—to themselves and to those who endure their wrath. Anger is not just an emotion; it is a storm that ravages the body. Cortisol levels surge, the pulse races, blood pressure spikes, pupils dilate and sweat pours. Once, this response helped our ancestors fend off wild animals. Today, it fuels tragedies—a husband striking his wife over a trivial quarrel, a father lashing out at a child, a moment of fury obliterating a lifetime of love.

Science corroborates what wisdom has long warned: those who explode are 25% more likely to develop coronary artery diseases. Still, they take pride in ruling their tiny worlds with the assumed authority their anger gives them. It is equally interesting that even the most hot-headed individuals control their tempers before their superiors. Instead, the vulnerable become dumping grounds for bottled-up rage—children, spouses, aging parents.

Thiruvalluvar devoted an entire chapter to anger. He posed a question to those who claim to have tamed their fury:

‘Chellidaththu Kaappaan Sinam Kaappaan: Allidaththu

Kakkin En? Kaavakaal En? ‘

If you claim you are managing your anger, restrain it to those who cannot resist you.

If you boast of suppressing it with the powerful, how does it matter?

Before we pride ourselves on self-control, let us ask: does our restraint extend to those who depend on us, or do we unleash our wrath on them because we can? For anger, like fire, first consumes the hand that holds it.

Song of Songs

“Yes, and yours are, too—may the wine go to my beloved, flowing gently over lips and teeth. I am my lover’s. I am all he wants. I’m all the world to him! Come, dear lover—let’s tramp through the countryside. Let’s sleep at some wayside inn, then rise early and listen to birdsong. Let’s look for wildflowers in bloom; pomegranates are in bloom, fruit trees adorned with cascading flowers. And there I’ll give myself to you, my love to your love.”

Kurunthogai

Meen Eri Thoondilaar

“Just as the bamboo swayed back in no time, my thoughts keep returning to him, however much I try to focus elsewhere.”

Book of Love

Sellaamai undael enakkurai, Matrunin

""Speak to me only if you say, 'I leave thee not;'

Of swift return, tell those who can bear the pain of parting.""

love.

“You cannot direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.”

Recently, I came across thefrom the Bible:How mesmerising it is to witness ancient poetry intertwining love and nature in vivid, symbolic words.Sangam literature too brims with such poetic brilliance., a collection of 400 songs of love, has a verse by an anonymous poet known only asIn the poem, a woman speaks to her friend about her love who belongs to a land where elephants graze on bamboo branches. One day, a guard throws a stone at the elephant. Startled, it leaves the bamboo branch, which springs back upright—just like a baited fishing hook stiffens when a fish is caught.The beauty of the poem lies in its subtlety:Love is never just an event; it is a quiet undercurrent, a moment so fleeting, yet so profound, when two souls realise their longing for each other. It is the breathtaking instant when a flower unfurls, a microsecond when hearts recognise they are tangled by the design of the universe.Yet, love is not always an easy journey. Even those bound by marriage often traverse disappointments.Thiruvalluvar, in his eternal wisdom, devoted seven chapters to love’s intoxicating spell. But he did not stop there—he penned 18 more chapters about life after marriage, where love meets the trials of daily existence.One of my favourite couplets from hiscaptures a woman’s poignant response when her husband insists on traveling to earn a living. Money is necessary, he argues and promises to come back soon. But for her, even theof separation is unbearable:In just two lines, Valluvar crafts an entire story. The woman does not care for his reasons or reassurances—she refuses to even engage in a conversation on separation.Maybe, as time wove its quiet lessons, she learnt to let him go. She would have suffered still, but love, though fragile, has its own fortitude. And yet, in their twilight years, when their hands clasped tightly, love may have reached its true zenith—not in its youthful urgency, but in the quiet knowledge of a shared life.Sometimes, we wonder if life is but a grand, repetitive play—scenes reenacted, destinies recycled. Do we not walk the same paths as our predecessors, playing the same roles in an unchanging script?But there is one thing that makes every life unique—As boundless as the canvas of nature, love is never the same. Every heart, every moment, every story, bears its own hue.Perhaps that is why Kahlil Gibran wrote:","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Both leaders have designated senior representatives to accelerate these talks, underscoring their intent to strengthen economic ties.Also read: Come out of protectionist mindset: Goyal to exporters During their recent discussions, Modi and Trump set an ambitious goal—doubling total US-India bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, dubbed ‘Mission 500.’ The two leaders framed the initiative as a pathway to boosting prosperity, strengthening national economies, and making supply chains more resilient.President Trump, now in his second term, has maintained his tough stance on trade fairness, emphasizing tariff reciprocity—a policy where US tariffs will mirror those imposed by trade partners, including India. Washington has long argued that India maintains some of the highest tariffs globally, a concern that could become a sticking point in negotiations.US Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick recently acknowledged the complexities of the trade relationship, advocating for a broad-based trade agreement rather than product-specific negotiations. Speaking virtually at the India Today Conclave, Lutnick called for “understanding and cooperation” to craft a deal that benefits both sides.As trade negotiations progress, both nations must navigate sensitive issues, including tariffs, market access, and national security concerns.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka high court on Friday provided interim relief to former chief minister and BJP central parliamentary committee member BS Yediyurappa in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) case, staying the summons that required his personal appearance before the First Fast Track Court on March 15.Justice Pradeep Singh Yerur's bench was reviewing Yediyurappa's petition to dismiss the chargesheet and noted the necessity for a thorough investigation and subsequently stayed both the summons and the court's recognition of the matter.Senior counsel CV Nagesh, representing Yediyurappa, noted previous interim relief granted by the high court. He clarified that the IT section in the FIR would apply to the complainant, not Yediyurappa, as the conversation remained intact on the victim's mother's mobile phone.The chargesheet relied on statements from the victim and her mother. Counsel Nagesh said that the complaint reached police commissioner a month after the alleged occurrence.The case concerns allegations of inappropriate contact on February 2, 2024.The CID submitted their charge sheet on June 27, 2024, to a special fast-track court. The chargesheet names Yediyurappa and three others under POCSO Act and IPC sections including 354(A), 204, and 214. According to the chargesheet, when the complainant sought assistance regarding her 17-year-old daughter's assault, Yediyurappa allegedly committed misconduct.The document states that following social media posts about the incident, intermediaries arranged a meeting where Yediyurappa provided Rs 2 lakh, allegedly leading to deletion of related media. The victim's mother died on May 26, 2024, in Bengaluru due to health issues.Yediyurappa had said, ""A mother and daughter were found near my residence, appearing distressed. Out of compassion, I called them to inquire about their situation. I even called the Bengaluru Police Commissioner to help them. However, they began making accusations against me. Despite this, I gave them financial help. I will face these charges in court.""Although the HC previously granted concessions regarding court appearances, it had not stayed the case. Advocate general Shashikiran Shetty opposed relief for Yediyurappa, emphasising that the previous HC order merely excused court appearances without halting proceedings.The Bengaluru First Fast Track court had issued summons on February 28, requiring Yediyurappa's presence on March 15. The court's decision followed review of the police chargesheet. Yediyurappa had previously received HC immunity regarding summons.On February 7, the HC declined to dismiss charges against him and granted him anticipatory bail, preventing arrest. The fresh FTC summons raised potential legal consequences.","Karnataka high court provides interim relief to former chief minister BS Yediyurappa in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) case.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) It was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin dropped the rupee symbol in the state budget on Thursday, replacing it with Tamil letter amid row over ""Hindi imposition"" with the BJP-led Central government. The DMK government replaced ""₹"" with the Tamil script ""ரூ"" in the logo for the state's 2025-26 budget.In return, the BJP quickly informed Stalin about the Tamil Nadu man who designed the dropped rupee symbol and calling the DMK government's move ""stupid"".Also read: Stalin government replaces Rupee symbol with Tamil letter in state budget amid language row The current rupee symbol was designed by a Tamilian designer Udaya Kumar Meanwhile, BJP's Tamil Nadu chief K Annamalai on X said, ""The DMK government's state budget for 2025-26 has replaced the Rupee symbol, which was designed by a Tamilian and adopted nationwide as part of our currency. The creator of the symbol, Thiru Udhay Kumar, is the son of a former DMK MLA.""The second of four children, Udaya Kumar was born to N Dharmalingam, a contractor, and Jayalakshmi in 1978 in Chennai. While doing his bachelor's in architecture from Anna University, he designed posters and publications that helped him define his calling — visual design.""I realised Indian scripts don't have their design repertoire. After two years of trying to create something new in Tamil typography, I realised that I shouldn't work on my own. I needed expert guidance and hence, came to Industrial Design Centre at IIT-Bombay,"" Kumar told TOI in an earlier interview.Designing the simple-looking Indian rupee symbol did not come easy for Udaya Kumar.""I spent endless nights on trial and error. The symbol had to have universal design features while staying Indian in spirit,"" Kumar told TOI.That explains the propensity of his symbol towards the Latin letter form, 'R' for rupee, and the stroke across the top curve, parallel to the 'shirorekha', the line heading the alphabet in Devanagari script. ""Most international currencies have double strokes such as the Australian dollar, Korean yen, the Euro or the Lira. The feature pronounce its identity as a currency,"" he said.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin dropped the rupee symbol in the state budget on Thursday.

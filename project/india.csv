"Is speaking Bengali a ground for deportation, SC asks Centre to clarify",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-speaking-bengali-a-ground-for-deportation-sc-asks-centre-to-clarify/articleshow/123593818.cms,".

Ask for IDs of those you are deporting, says SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought a clarification from the Centre whether speaking Bengali was being used as one of the grounds for deportation of individuals but agreed with the Union govt that border forces had the right to repulse entry of illegal migrants as they pose a danger to the nation's demography, security and strain its resources.For the West Bengal govt's migrant workers' welfare board, advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that people are being deported just for speaking Bengali, without any verification of their citizenship by authorities or through a tribunal. ""India can't push out anyone out of the country without following due procedure to determine their citizenship. Those pushed out face bullets from both sides, border forces of India and Bangladesh,"" he said.They are caught in a crossfire. This is per se illegal and violative of the right to life,"" he said. The bench said, ""Security forces have a right to repulse illegal migrants. Only if the person is on Indian soil that the procedure is to be followed...We will request the Centre to clarify its stand whether speaking Bengali is a ground for deportation.Is there a bias among officials to treat persons speaking a certain language as foreigners?"" Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""Obviously speaking Bengali is not a ground for deportation. """"However, India cannot be the world's capital for illegal migrants. Why is no individual petitioning SC? Why organisations are coming forward. There are states which are promoting illegal migrants to come in and settle in India. It is very disturbing that a systematic racket is going on to facilitate illegal migrants to enter a border state,"" he said and drew the court's attention to massive problems faced by European countries because of the influx of illegal migrants.The bench agreed that illegal migrants are a problem and said, ""They pose threat to the nation's security, integrity and demography as well as a strain on its resources. It is a serious international issue and very complicated too. However, In West Bengal and Punjab, the people on either side of the border speak the same language and share culture. So, language alone could not be the tool to identify foreigners.""The bench said, ""Pushing back illegal migrants is not an issue. But those whom you are deporting, you must ask for their identity proof."" Mehta said those affected by deportation should complain to the court and they could be provided with legal aid to present their case. ""Illegal migrants are facing serious problems in the US. Bhushan should go there to assist them,"" he snidely remarked.Referring to reports of a wall built at the US-Mexico border, the bench asked, ""Are you going to build a wall at the border like America?"" Mehta said India is fencing the border with Bangladesh and the matter was supervised by SC to stop illegal immigration.","Justices Surya Kant, Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi agreed with the Union govt that border forces had the right to repulse entry of illegal migrants.

The art of giving without glory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-giving-without-glory/articleshow/123585835.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. At a recent award ceremony featuring stars, YouTubers, and comedians, I saw a young woman seemingly out of place — quiet and shy — When her name was announced, the hall fell silent — Selva Brinda of Trichy, a young mother who donated more than 300 litres of breast milk over 22 months to premature and malnourished infants in government hospitals. Her act of silent generosity reminded me of a verse from the Thirukkural : Eaththuvakkum Inbam AriyaarKol Thaamudaimai Vaiththizhakkum Vanka Navar “Do the hard-hearted, who hoard their wealth only to lose it someday, Not know the joy of giving?” ( Kural 228) Thiruvalluvar does not preach here—he questions, almost with disbelief, why anyone would cling to what would eventually slip away. I was fortunate to learn the art of giving from my grandmother. She never went to school but taught us something no school could teach. When beggars came to our door, she would hand us small coins, and we would run joyfully to give them. When the poor asked for rice instead, she would give it herself. I once asked her why and said, “My palms are bigger than yours—they can hold more.” From this wonderful woman, I learned three lessons that shaped my understanding of giving. The first is that giving should be silent. My grandmother gave because she wanted to, not because anyone was watching. Today, I sometimes see social media reels of influencers distributing food or clothes to the poor—always with cameras turned on. The act of kindness is shared, but so is the humiliation of the receiver. The second lesson is that if you choose to give, give the best. I still remember the days after the tsunami, when we received ten large sacks of relief material filled with torn clothes, broken slippers, cracked vessels—discards rather than gifts of the heart. Giving is not about clearing cupboards. If your hands extend to another, let them carry the best you own—the blanket you would choose for your own child, the food you yourself would eat. The third lesson is that giving must be immediate. The more we wait, the more our minds bargain—why give so much, why give at all? The Mahabharata has a story of Karna that captures this. One day, while eating, he was approached by a poor man seeking alms. Without pausing, he scooped a handful from a heap of gold coins beside him, with his left hand, and gave it. The old man, surprised, gently reminded him that alms should not be offered with the left hand. Karna apologised and explained, “I was eating, yes, but I feared that if I delayed it even for a moment, I might give less than I intended.” Such was his urgency to give, as if the opportunity itself was sacred. When I see acts like Selva Brinda’s, I’m reminded of these three lessons again: a young mother who gave quietly, gave the best she had, and gave without delay. Science today tells us that generosity releases oxytocin, the ‘love hormone’, and floods the giver with joy. But long before science measured it, human hearts knew it. The bliss of giving is not just an emotion—it is the only wealth that grows by sharing. Why hoard what must one day be left behind? To give is to live twice—once for oneself, and once for the other.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123595335,imgsize-75890,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/123595335.jpg"

However, earlier in the day, Fadnavis said, ""We are supportive of the agitation because such agitations are a part of democracy. We are following court orders...

Indian community continues to grow

As traditional destinations like the UK, US, and Canada adopt more restrictive immigration policies and tighten work visa norms, Russia is emerging as a new opportunity hub for Indian workers. Russian companies across key sectors such as construction, electronics, manufacturing, and heavy machinery are actively recruiting skilled Indian professionals to address a growing domestic workforce shortage and support ongoing industrial and infrastructure development.According to India’s Ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, the demand for Indian workers is rising, prompting an increase in consular workload. He noted that consular services are expanding to meet the needs of the growing Indian community in Russia, as reported by the TASS.The Russian labour market is facing a critical shortage. According to Russia’s Ministry of Labour, the country is projected to experience a workforce deficit of 3.1 million by 2030. In response, the government plans to increase the quota for qualified foreign workers by 1.5 times in 2025, allowing for 230,000 individuals.Companies are currently hiring Indian nationals under existing Russian regulations, quotas, and laws. As quoted by the TASS, Kumar said, “At a broader level, there is a manpower requirement in Russia, and India has skilled manpower. So at present, within the framework of Russian regulations, laws and quotas, the companies are hiring Indians.”The initial wave of Indian workers began arriving in Russian regions in 2024, starting at the Za Rodinu fish processing complex in Kaliningrad, which was facing a labour shortage.Andrey Besedin, head of the Ural Chamber of Commerce and Industry, stated that by the end of the year, around 1 million Indian specialists are expected to come to Russia, including the Sverdlovsk region, as reported by the TASS. He also announced the opening of a new Consulate General in Yekaterinburg to handle increasing consular requirements.Sverdlovsk, with Yekaterinburg as its capital, is home to major heavy industries and military-industrial facilities such as Uralmash and Ural Wagon Zavod, the latter known for producing the T-90 tank. Besedin noted that many positions in these factories are vacant due to deployment of workers in military operations in Ukraine and a decline in local youth participation in industrial jobs.While early Indian arrivals were mainly in the construction and textile industries, the demand is now rising in electronics and machinery sectors. Vinay Kumar told the TASS that “most of the people who have come are in the construction and textile sectors,” but highlighted a growing need in high-end sectors like machinery and electronics.Russia offers various types of employment visas, including single-entry visas for short-term assignments, multiple-entry visas for long-term jobs, and Highly Qualified Specialist (HQS) visas for professionals. There is also a work patent option for self-employed individuals. Visa processing durations range from 5 to 30 business days depending on the type and consulate. Applicants are required to submit a completed form, valid passport, passport-sized photographs, a work invitation, a medical certificate, proof of qualifications, and sometimes an employment agreement. Expedited services are available at an additional fee.The Indian Embassy has issued a warning about fraudulent job offers. It cautioned Indian nationals against agents who offer tourist or business visas with job promises in Russia, stating that such visas do not permit employment and cannot be converted to work permits. The advisory was issued due to multiple incidents reported to the embassy.Currently, approximately 14,000 Indians reside in Russia, along with 1,500 Afghan nationals of Indian origin. The community includes skilled workers, professionals, and students. About 4,500 Indian students are pursuing medical and technical courses, with nearly 90 per cent enrolled in medical universities. Other fields include engineering, computer science, aeronautical design, transport technology, agriculture, and business management.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

CBSE announces major reforms for LOC submission ahead of Class 10 and 12 board exams 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/cbse-announces-major-reforms-for-loc-submission-ahead-of-class-10-and-12-board-exams-2026/articleshow/123547542.cms,"CBSE LOC details 2025

Two-board examination policy for Class 10



Integration of APAAR IDs in LOC submissions

Stringent data requirements for schools

Dedicated portal for children with Special Needs (CWSN)



Implications and outlook

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has unveiled sweeping reforms in the submission of the List of Candidates (LOC) for the Class 10 and 12 board examinations of 2026, signalling a marked shift in the board’s examination management framework. The LOC, a cornerstone in the preparation of board exams, now carries additional layers of accountability and technological integration aimed at ensuring accuracy, transparency, and inclusivity. These changes include stricter validation of student data, enhanced digital verification processes, and a more streamlined interface for school administrators, all designed to minimise errors and improve efficiency across affiliated institutions.For the first time, CBSE is implementing a two-board examination policy for Class 10. Under this new paradigm, the Main Examinations, scheduled for mid-February, remain mandatory for all students. Schools are instructed to submit LOC data for all candidates appearing in this primary examination. In addition, a Second Board Examination will be conducted subsequently, with LOC submissions to be completed post the conclusion of the first exam.This dual-examination framework reflects the board’s emphasis on providing students multiple opportunities for academic validation, while simultaneously imposing stricter procedural compliance on affiliated schools.Explained: What Tele-MANAS offers students and why CBSE wants schools to act now In a significant technological upgrade, CBSE has mandated the linking of Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) IDs with LOC data for both Class 10 and 12 students. Schools within India are now required to submit LOC data only for candidates possessing an APAAR ID, which the board will validate at the time of submission. Affiliated schools abroad, however, are exempt from this requirement due to administrative and legal constraints. This integration is expected to streamline student records, reduce errors, and enhance the robustness of academic data management.CBSE has underscored the importance of meticulous data preparation. Schools must collate comprehensive details for each candidate, including personal identifiers, parent/guardian information, date of birth, APAAR ID (for Indian schools), correct subject codes, subject combinations as per the scheme of studies, and the category under which the candidate is applying—be it First Sitting (FS), Improvement, or Compartment. The board has issued a strict advisory, emphasizing that only error-free data will be accepted, and reiterated that students not listed via the online LOC submission will be ineligible to sit for the 2026 board examinations.In a progressive move towards inclusivity, CBSE has launched a dedicated portal for Children with Special Needs (CWSN). The portal is designed for schools to submit records and information pertaining to CWSN students, thereby ensuring the implementation of appropriate relaxations and accommodations during examinations.

PM backs ties with China but also Japan in dispute with Beijing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-backs-ties-with-china-but-also-japan-in-dispute-with-beijing/articleshow/123591979.cms,"PM Modi with Japan's PM Shigeru Ishiba; China's president Xi Jinping

India, China Can Stabilize Global Economic Order, Call For Peace: PM Modi's BIG MESSAGE From Japan

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi set the stage for his meeting with President Xi on Sunday as he said in Tokyo that given the current volatility in world economy, it is important for India and China, as 2 major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order. He said India is ready to carry forward the relationship based on respect for each other's interests and sensitivities.However, Modi later also joined his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba in expressing serious concern - in the India-Japan annual summit joint statement - over the situation in East China Sea , where Japan is locked in a territorial dispute with Beijing over the uninhabited Senkaku/ Diaoyu islands, and South China Sea.Coupled with the first India-Philippines joint patrolling in the South China Sea earlier this month, the joint statement suggests India will continue to push back against any aggressive manoeuvring by Beijing in the region, despite the ongoing efforts to narrow differences and normalise the relationship with China. “India and Japan are fully committed towards a free, open, peaceful, prosperous, and rules-based Indo-Pacific,’’ said Modi, addressing the media jointly with Ishiba.India and Japan also adopted a new declaration on security cooperation that is seen as more in sync with current realities and efforts to ensure a coercion-free Indo-Pacific that upholds rules-based international order. Both leaders also backed the Quad summit that India has to host this year.Earlier in the day, in a newspaper interview, Modi underlined the “steady and positive” progress in ties since his last meeting with Xi in October last year. He said India is ready to advance bilateral relations with China from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges.“Stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbours and the two largest nations on earth, can have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity,” said Modi, adding that this is also crucial for a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world.Modi arrives in Tianjin in China on Saturday evening to participate in the SCO summit. His first engagement in China will be in the form of a bilateral meeting with Xi on Sunday morning.Both India and China have sought to stabilise the relationship, saying that they should not allow differences to turn into disputes. It will be interesting to see if China reacts to the concern expressed by Modi and Ishiba over the situation in East China Sea.Modi and his Japanese counterpart in the joint statement also reiterated their strong opposition to any unilateral actions that endanger the safety as well as freedom of navigation and overflight, and attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion. In remarks aimed at China, they shared their serious concern over the militarization of disputed features. “They reaffirmed that maritime disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),” said the India-Japan joint statement.","PM Narendra Modi says it is important for India and China, as 2 major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order.

'Let's together fight larger battle': Why Kapil Sibal's advice may not stop Arvind Kejriwal from targeting Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-together-fight-larger-battle-why-kapil-sibals-advice-may-not-stop-arvind-kejriwal-from-targeting-congress/articleshow/123588172.cms,"Arvind Kejriwal, Kapil Sibal (C), Rahul Gandhi (R)

NEW DELHI: ""Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" - Kapil Sibal 's advice to Arvind Kejriwal after the AAP convener's latest offensive against the Congress is unlikely to impress the former Delhi chief minister.Sibal, who served as Union minister in the UPA governments and is currently an Independent Rajya Sabha member, counselled Kejriwal after the AAP convener alleged a nexus between the BJP and the Congress and questioned why no ""big leader"" of the grand old party had been arrested in the National Herald case ""We keep on getting offers for a compromise. Now, even people are seeing that Congress has reached a compromise with the BJP. The National Herald case is an open and shut case. But no big leader of the Congress has gone to jail. Five of our big leaders were sent to jail in a fake case,"" Kejriwal said at a meeting of AAP MLAs and councillors in the national capital.Citing examples from Goa, the AAP supremo emphasised, ""People ask why the BJP has sent five of AAP's top leaders to jail but not a single Congress leader. They shout endlessly about the National Herald case, which I myself read about online.As per facts, it looks like an open-and-shut case. Yet despite serious allegations, no one from the Gandhi family has gone to jail, while we are jailed in completely fabricated cases. ""Kejriwal also made a mention of the land scam cases of Haryana and named Robert Vadra to highlight his point. ""In 2014 the BJP built its campaign around 'jija ji' (brother-in-law) and corruption, shouting about Vadra, 2G and coal scams. Yet today, all those cases have quietly been shut. The people are not fools. They can see the reality--that Congress and BJP are in a hidden alliance,"" he said.Kejriwal and several other AAP leaders were booked and arrested in the alleged liquor scam case and other cases. All the AAP leaders were eventually granted bail. However, Kejriwal resigned ahead of the assembly elections and made Atishi the chief minister of Delhi.Sibal, who has been associated with the grand old party for a long time, was quick to remind Kejriwal about the consequences of his baseless allegations against political rivals in the past.""Kejriwal ji: When you made allegations against several politicians and others and was dragged to court you apologised! Today you made baseless allegations against the Gandhi family (National Herald case). Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" Sibal said in a post on X.But the question is: Will Kejriwal heed Sibal's advice? Well, it seems unlikely as the ties between the two parties nosedived during the last Delhi elections when Congress played a key role in the defeat of AAP at the hands of the BJP.While both Congress and AAP are part of the opposition's INDIA bloc, the two parties have all along shared uneasy ties - characterised by threats, warnings and blackmails. When INDIA bloc was formed, Kejriwal made AAP's participation conditional to Congress's support against the Centre's Delhi ordinance. The two parties did join hands in Delhi for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after a lot of back and forth, but the experiment failed to stop the BJP from winning all the 7 Lok Sabha seats in the national capital for the third time in a row.In the assembly elections, the two allies turned into bitter rivals and went all out to discredit each other. With the Congress putting all its might against AAP, the BJP gained and managed to return to power in the national capital after a long gap of 27 years.In Haryana assembly elections, the two parties tried to stich an alliance but could not reach a common ground. In several other states like Gujarat, Goa, the AAP has successfully contested on its own and managed to spread its reach. Till they lost elections in Delhi, AAP was the only party besides BJP and Congress to have government in two states.The Congress, on the other hand, despite all its electoral reverses in the last 11 years, remains the only opposition party with pan-India presence and hence takes the position of principal challenger to the BJP.Any attempt to broker peace between AAP and Congress is unlikely to succeed as the two parties remain rivals in Punjab where assembly elections are due early in 2027. Both the parties have huge stakes in the state. In the last assembly elections in 2022, AAP had decimated the Congress and stormed to power winning 92 of the 117 assembly seats in the state.For AAP, Punjab remains the only state where it has government and hence led by Kejriwal the party will go out to retain the state. On the other hand, the Congress which has considerable presence in the state, will do everything possible to return to power.In the given scenario, it will be difficult for AAP and Congress to come together for the larger fight - the 2029 Lok Sabha elections, when the INDIA bloc will once again try to challenge the dominance of BJP-led NDA.","Sibal counselled Kejriwal after the AAP convener alleged a nexus between the BJP and the Congress. He questioned why no ""big leader"" of the grand old party had been arrested in the National Herald case. Sibal was quick to remind Kejriwal about the consequences of his baseless allegations against political rivals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123588719,imgsize-1068114,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-24.jpg"

Amid the global instability wrought by the US tariff policy, PM Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba announced a slew of measures, including a Joint Vision for the Next Decade, to boost ties in areas like trade and investment, AI, energy, critical minerals, human resources and defence and security.Among the highlights was a private-investment target of $ 67 billion from Japan to India over the next 10 years, an economic security initiative that identified semiconductors, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals and clean energy as key areas of collaboration and a renewal of the 2008 security declaration aimed at keeping the Indo-Pacific free of coercion in the face of Chinese assertiveness.Both leaders reaffirmed commitment to deepening the Quad partnership and backed the summit that India has to host in November, even though President Donald Trump’s proposed visit to India remains uncertain because of the strained India-US relationship. India and Japan also announced an action plan for talent mobility that will see an exchange of more than 500,000 personnel in 5 years including, as Modi said, 50,000 skilled personnel and potential talent from India to Japan.“Today, we have laid a strong foundation for a new and golden chapter in our Special Strategic and Global Partnership. We have set a roadmap for the next decade. We will also give special attention to connecting Small and Medium Enterprises and Start-ups from both countries,” said Modi, addressing the media along with Ishiba after the meeting.Speaking about the technology partnership, Modi said semiconductors and rare earth minerals were at the top of the agenda. “Cooperation in high technology is a priority for both of us. In this context, Digital Partnership 2.0 and AI cooperation initiatives are being undertaken,” announced Modi. As per the new economic security initiative, India and Japan resolved to advance cooperation in building resilient supply chains and secure critical infrastructure, promoting and protecting key technologies and addressing bilateral impediments to strategic trade and technology collaboration.Modi also said both sides shared concerns about terrorism and cyber security. “We also have shared interests in the areas of defence and maritime security. We have jointly decided to further strengthen our cooperation in the fields of defence industry and innovation, adding India and Japan partnership is rooted in mutual trust, reflects national priorities, and is shaped by shared values and beliefs.Both countries also announced the launch of a Sustainable Fuel Initiative and Battery Supply Chain Partnership, with Modi saying that the green partnership between India and Japan is as strong as the economic partnership.On the delayed Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail, the leaders noted its importance as a flagship project between India and Japan and agreed to work towards commencement of its operations at the earliest. India also welcomed Japan’s offer, as announced by the railway ministry last month, to introduce in the early 2030s the latest E10 series of the Shinkansen, and both sides agreed to install the Japanese signalling system on which the train runs.While welcoming an agreement for cooperation on the Chandrayaan-5 mission, Modi said that active participation will symbolise the progress of humanity “beyond the boundaries of the Earth, and into space”. Ishiba too said that the 2 countries should “draw on each other's strengths, help solve each other's challenges, and tackle together the issues that future generations will face”.On regional and global issues, Modi and Ishiba expressed support for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter. “They also welcomed the ongoing diplomatic efforts by various countries to achieve a just and lasting peace,” said the joint statement.The leaders also expressed grave concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, while calling on all parties to show restraint, protect civilians, comply with international law, and refrain from taking actions that could further escalate the situation and compromise regional stability.",PM Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba announced a Joint Vision for the Next Decade.

Mahua Moitra Under Fire: TMC MP’s ‘Cut Amit Shah’s Head’ Jibe Draws Sharp BJP Backlash

NEW DELHI: TMC MP Mahua Moitra has lit a political powder keg with her explosive remark targeting Union home minister Amit Shah , allegedly saying his ""head should be cut off"". The BJP condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark,"" with the party lodging a complaint at Krishnanagar's Kotwali police station.While speaking on the issue of illegal immigration along India’s eastern border, Moitra, addressing in Bengali, reportedly said, ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table.""However, there is no independent confirmation of the statement.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back at TMC MP over her statement, calling it ""distasteful and hate remarks"" and asking whether it represented the TMC's official position.Moitra, speaking to reporters in Nadia district during an event, accused the Union government of neglecting its responsibility on border security. ""They are repeatedly talking about infiltrators; but the border of India is protected by five forces, and that is directly the home ministry's responsibility,"" she said.She also referred to PM Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech. ""Standing at Red Fort, the PM himself said infiltrators are causing demographic changes.But even as he was saying this, his Home Minister was standing in the front row, smiling and clapping,"" she added.The BJP's West Bengal unit later amplified her comments on X, sharing Moitra's picture with the statement as its caption, while intensifying its attack on the TMC leader.Later in the day, TMC MP Moitra hit back at the BJP over the row surrounding her alleged remark on Union home minister Shah.In a post on X, she wrote, ""Modus operandi of BJP troll cell – pick one issue, give it to all resident twits (and an ‘a’ instead of an ‘i’ would be just as well) and make it ‘viral’ on social media. Today’s theme is Mahua Moitra’s Off With His Head metaphor. Long live my infamy, guys. Love it.""Defending Moitra, her TMC colleague Kunal Ghosh told PTI that the remark was symbolic. ""Mahua Moitra's comment has no physical implications, nor did she intend to attack Union home minister Amit Shah. She was trying to make a symbolic statement, which did not translate well,"" he said.Reflecting on TMC MP's comment, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari called it a language of ""urban naxals"", saying, ""This is the language of political urban naxals. Mahua Moitra, Rahul Gandhi and all Opposition leaders are trying to provoke violence in the minds of people through their words. This is their culture that they abuse the late mother of the Prime Minister...All of this makes it clear that their 'niti' and 'niyat' are not in the interest of the nation or the public. ""On TMC MP's remark, BJP spokesperson RP Singh said, ""Be it Mahua Moitra or Congress party - one party abuses PM's mother and the other party's leader says that Amit Shah should be beheaded. It shows their frustration. They know that they are going to lose Bihar and Bengal is next. So, such language is being used out of frustration.""","TMC MP Mahua Moitra reportedly said, ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table"" There is no independent confirmation of the statement.

In the clip, which is now going viral on social media, the judge can be seen calling out the officer over alleged discrepancies and irregularities.The IAS officer’s name and posting remain unverified, but the judge is heard warning that an FIR will be filed to initiate an investigation.The incident reportedly took place when the judge was hearing a case related to land acquisition and compensation, but the IAS officer had objected to the compensation being offered to the petitioner.“Who are you to object? Ye state ka property hai na? () the judge can be heard saying in the video.""If the state has recognised any person as a ryot, who are you to say that person is not a ryot. You are an alien to the dispute,"" the judge further added.The judge also accused the officer of taking commissions while questioning his authority to object, saying he was preventing rightful awards from being given.“Commission chahiye aapko? () You want commission in each and every case? Under what authority you have objected? The award has been prepared.You are depriving the person of getting the award” the judge said.“You have to take contempt or I will lodge an FIR against you” he said.“Don’t raise a dispute if you are an outsider. In a property dispute, will you come in like a monkey to claim a share?” the judge can be heard saying.The video has drawn appreciation from the public for how the judge handled the situation.“Wow!! Simply awesome. So satisfying to watch this episode. The bureaucrat thought he was above law for a moment. Hats off to you, the judiciary, and judge,” a user commented.“If all Judges take the right approach and ask all IAS officers, EC, and ED to apply law as per the Constitution, 50 percent cases will go away from court,” commented another.“Judicial accountability in action! The judge's sharp questioning demonstrates that courts are taking corruption seriously. This direct approach could deter future misconduct if consistently applied across all levels of bureaucracy,” read another comment.","A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing.

Japan PM Ishiba Roots For Make-in-India, Outlines Three Initiatives To Strengthen Delhi-Tokyo Ties

NEW DELHI: India and Japan on Friday signed an implementing arrangement for a joint lunar exploration mission to the south pole of the Moon called Chandrayaan-5, during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Tokyo.The arrangement between Isro and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) concerning the joint lunar polar exploration mission (LUPEX) was inked on the sidelines of Modi's visit and the pact was exchanged by Jaxa vice-president Matsuura Mayumi and India’s ambassador to Japan Sibi George.Addressing a joint press briefing with his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba, PM Modi said, “We welcome the collaboration between Isro and Jaxa for the Chandrayaan-5 mission. Our active participation has gone beyond the limits of the Earth and will become a symbol of mankind’s progress in space.”Referring to the global praise received by Chandrayaan-3's successful landing near the lunar South Pole in 2023 — when India became the first country to go to the uncharted territory of the Moon — Modi said the next challenge lies in deeper exploration of the lunar surface, particularly areas that may hold critical resources such as water ice.“This will contribute to deepening our understanding of the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar south pole,” Modi said in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun.“Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between Isro and Jaxa, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launchpads, and from research to real-world applications,” Modi said.The Chandrayaan-5 mission will be launched by Jaxa onboard its H3-24L launch vehicle, carrying the Isro-made lunar lander, which will carry a Japan-made rover.Apart from the lander, Isro is also responsible for developing a few scientific instruments for the mission. The spacecraft will carry seven scientific instruments, including a mass spectrometer by ESA and neutron spectrometers by Nasa.Chandrayaan-5’s mission objectives will be mapping lunar water presence; drilling lunar regolith to analyse water content, quality and composition; and performing in-situ scientific observations using spectrometers and sensors. It is a proposed 100-day mission with possible extension to a year and an attempt to explore the Moon’s far side.The approval for the Chandrayaan-5 was given by the Modi govt on March 10, in the form of financial sanction.During May 13-14, Isro and Jaxa had jointly conducted a third face-to-face technical interface meeting for the mission, at the Bengaluru-based Isro headquarters. The meeting was attended by senior officials, project executives and technical team members from Isro, Jaxa and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan.The two-day meeting deliberated on the various technical interfaces, joint mission implementation plan, as well as the potential landing sites for the mission. During the meeting, M Ganesh Pillai, scientific secretary, Isro, congratulated both the teams for technical achievements so far, and emphasized on the importance of the collaborative endeavour for the scientific and technical aspects of the mission.","The arrangement between Isro and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) concerning the joint lunar polar exploration mission was inked on the sidelines of Modi's visit.

Dharmasthala Mass Burial Case: Whistleblower Arrested by SIT After Inconsistencies Found

NEW DELHI: Sujata Bhat, who had previously alleged that her daughter Ananya disappeared from the Dharmasthala temple premises in 2003, had reportedly expressed her desire to withdraw the complaint during the Special Investigation Team's (SIT) interrogation.During the interrogation on Friday, the SIT found Sujata's statement to be contradictory to her earlier claims, suggesting she was lying and obstructing the legal process. Investigators noted that she appeared to be under significant pressure and was struggling with the sustained interrogation, PTI reported.While Sujata had earlier claimed that the disappearance of her daughter was part of a larger conspiracy, she disclosed the names of certain individuals allegedly involved in it on Friday.However, the SIT officials did not confirm the details, stating that the disclosures are being verified.The case has drawn widespread attention following allegations that the narrative of a missing girl may have been fabricated. The SIT's ongoing efforts focus on verifying Sujata’s claims and finding evidence to substantiate the complaint.Legal experts said even if Sujata formally withdraws her complaint, the SIT would likely continue the investigation, as the matter involves serious allegations and has already entered the judicial process.The case, which has triggered political sparring and public debates, remains under close watch, with the SIT expected to submit an interim report in the coming weeks, said a senior police official.","Sujata Bhat, who had previously alleged that her daughter Ananya disappeared from the Dharmasthala temple premises in 2003, had reportedly expressed her desire to withdraw the complaint.

Poll What should India prioritize in response to US tariffs? Adjust trade strategy Maintain independent policy

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of using American trade dollars to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine.Justifying Washington’s newly imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, Navarro said that Indian refiners, working with “silent Russian partners,” were making huge profits by refining Russian oil and selling it in international markets while “Russia pockets hard currency to fund its war on Ukraine.”In a post on X, Navarro said, “India uses our dollars to buy discounted Russian crude. This isn’t just about India’s unfair trade—it’s about cutting off the financial lifeline India has extended to Putin’s war machine.”According to Navarro, “Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil made up less than 1% of India’s imports. Today? Over 30% -- more than 1.5 million barrels a day. This surge isn’t driven by domestic demand—it’s driven by Indian profiteers and carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.”Also read - 'Trump won't budge' : US says Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'Modi's war' “India’s Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin,” he claimed, adding that India now exports more than 1 million barrels a day in refined petroleum, over half of the Russian crude it imports.Navarro said the Biden administration “largely looked the other way at this madness,” while President Trump was confronting it directly. “A 50% tariff -- 25% for unfair trade and 25% for national security -- is a direct response. If India, the world’s largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.”Also read - Western voices back India against Trump's tariff war Expanding on the criticism, he remarked, “While the United States pays to arm Ukraine, India bankrolls Russia even as it slaps some of the world’s highest tariffs on US goods, which in turn punishes American exporters. We run a $50-billion trade deficit with India—and they’re using our dollars to buy Russian oil. They make a killing and Ukrainians die.”“It doesn’t stop there. India continues to buy Russian weapons—while demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. That’s strategic freeloading,” he added.The remarks follow Donald Trump’s decision earlier this week to double tariffs on Indian imports, citing both trade imbalances and national security concerns.Navarro told Bloomberg TV that it was “real easy” for India to get the penalty removed by halting Russian oil purchases, but accused New Delhi of being “arrogant” in insisting it was their sovereign right.“India, you’re the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies...(instead) you’re getting in bed with the authoritarians,” he said, reminding India of its long-standing border dispute with China. “These are not your friends folks, okay? And the Russians. I mean, come on!”Navarro also controversially referred to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war,” insisting India’s purchases were funding Moscow’s aggression. When an anchor corrected him, saying “you mean Putin’s war,” Navarro doubled down, repeating it was “Modi’s war.”While Navarro praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “a great leader” and India as “a mature democracy with intelligent people running it,” he maintained that New Delhi’s oil deals with Moscow undermined its claim to be a trusted US partner.His comments have drawn criticism within US policy circles, with some analysts pointing out that Washington has not penalised China or the European Union for continuing to buy Russian energy. Others noted that the US itself imports Russian nuclear fuel and precious metals.",US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India.

Japan PM Ishiba Roots For Make-in-India, Outlines Three Initiatives To Strengthen Delhi-Tokyo Ties

NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Tokyo on Friday for the India-Japan Economic Forum, Modi Archive, which narrates his life through archival records, recalled his first visit to the country in 2007, when he was Gujarat chief minister In April 2007, PM Modi had embarked on a six-day visit to Japan, leading a 40-member delegation of bureaucrats and industry leaders. His mission: to showcase Gujarat as India’s gateway for investment in industry, infrastructure, and innovation.Traveling through Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Kobe, PM Modi courted corporate heavyweights including Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Suzuki, Toshiba, Nippon Steel, and Tsuneshi Shipbuilding. The trip resulted in MoUs between JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization) and Gujarat’s Industries Department.""Ports, logistics, infrastructure and human resource development were on the table at the Japan Chambers of Commerce and Industries and Indo-Japan Friendship Forum, with Gujarat pitching itself as the natural entry point for Japan into India’s growth story,"" wrote Modi Archives on X.A key highlight was PM Modi’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, where the two leaders discussed the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).PM Modi presented Abe with a CD on Gujarat’s Buddhist heritage and a handwoven tribal shawl, inviting him to visit the state. In return, Abe assured Japan’s full support for Gujarat’s segment of the DMIC, cementing a foundation for deeper Indo-Japan economic and cultural ties.""Perhaps the most iconic moment of the visit came when he stepped into the cockpit of a Japanese Bullet Train . What if such high-speed rail transformed Indian connectivity? That seed of an idea in 2007 would blossom years later into the Mumbai–Ahmedabad Bullet Train project, the flagship of Indo-Japanese cooperation.In April 2007, PM Modi walked through Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park, pausing at the Prayer of the Fountain and the Suzuki Miekichi Literary Monument. Later in Kobe, he joined a cultural programme at The India Club, a historic hub for the Indian diaspora since 1904. That visit planted the seeds of deeper business and cultural ties between Gujarat and Japan.By July 2012, PM Modi returned on a much larger stage. Invited formally by the Government of Japan for a five-day tour (22–27 July), he was accorded a Cabinet-rank reception — an honour rarely extended to a state leader. It was the 60th anniversary of India–Japan diplomatic ties, and PM Modi’s packed itinerary covered 44 engagements across Tokyo, Hamamatsu, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.PM Modi had met key Japanese ministers — Koichiro Gemba (Foreign Affairs), Yukio Edano (Trade & Industry), Yuchiro Hata (Infrastructure & Transport), and Deputy PM Katsuya Okada — along with governors Hideaki Omura of Aichi and Toshizo Ido of Hyogo. At JETRO’s investment seminars, he pitched Gujarat as an investor-friendly, power-surplus state, emphasizing ports, logistics, and industrial corridors.Business diplomacy was central: PM Modi had held extensive meetings with corporate leaders, including a landmark session with Osamu Suzuki, Chairman of Suzuki Motors. Touring facilities and sharing lunch with him, Modi pitched Gujarat as Asia’s next automotive hub. Round-tables at Mizuho Corporate Bank and the Imperial Hotel deepened corporate ties further.Infrastructure was another highlight. Riding the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Hamamatsu, PM Modi explored possibilities for high-speed rail and metro projects in Gujarat, focusing on Japan’s model of speed, efficiency, and safety. At Kobe Port, he studied maritime systems that could guide Gujarat’s own port expansion, reaffirming the state’s centrality in the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).Cultural outreach balanced the diplomacy. PM Modi had addressed the Gujarat Samaj of Japan, met members of the India Centre Foundation, and was honoured at a reception hosted by HCCI Chairman Mimuro. At Kobe’s India Club, he engaged with the diaspora and even took a symbolic boat ride at the port.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Tokyo on Friday for the India-Japan Economic Forum.

'Show Red Eyes to US’ Owaisi Targets Modi Govt on Tariffs, Calls It Diplomatic Failure

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears “scared of the US,” while slamming the government over the imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports by the United States.Speaking to reporters, Owaisi questioned: ""US' Peter Navarro is making statements. Had the same statements been made on the PM by an Opposition leader in the country, the BJP would have attacked him. Why are they silent?...Why are you so scared of the US?""He called the move a “major loss” to the country’s trade, warning that sectors like motor parts, jewellery, gems, and readymade garments could face estimated losses of around Rs 60,000 crore.The AIMIM chief also pointed out that the tariff issue surfaced after Modi’s bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump in February, and accused the government of remaining silent while failing to defend India’s exporters. Owaisi added that opposition leaders would have faced strong criticism from the BJP for making similar remarks.“The 50% tariff will cause a major loss to India's exporters...I think the Narendra Modi Government will have to answer to the people of the country...ModiGovt will have to answer what they are going to do for those who are going to suffer losses,” Owaisi said.Owaisi also referred to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who sparked controversy by calling the Russia-Ukraine conflict “Modi’s war.”In a Bloomberg interview, Navarro claimed that India’s purchases of discounted Russian oil were “fuelling Russia’s war machine” and effectively making American taxpayers bear the cost. Owaisi criticised the government for not responding publicly to Navarro’s remarks.The senior leader also highlighted that India made a major mistake when Trump, during his first term, asked the country to stop buying oil from Iran. Owaisi said that if PM Modi had shown defiance or stood up to him then, the current situation with US tariffs might have been avoided.""Iran was selling us good quality oil at a reasonable price. We blinked there so they could see that they can scare us. That was the first mistake we made,"" Owaisi said.He added that BJP spokespersons should tell the country what is happening instead of taunting the Opposition.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the government over the imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports by the United States.

Amit Shah Condemns Congress Culture Of Hatred, Demands Apology For Remarks On PM Modi’s Mother

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fulfil its promise of making the country free of infiltrators.Speaking at a programme in Guwahati on the birth centenary of Assam’s first non-Congress chief minister, Golap Borbora, Shah said the high-power demography mission announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day would help study demographic patterns and identify infiltrators.""We had made a promise to Assam, but we have not been able to fulfil it in 10 years. But we will keep our promise and make Assam and the entire country free of illegal foreigners,"" he said.""I am among those people who believe that not a single infiltrator should stay in our country,"" he added.Shah recalled that Borbora, who led a Janata Party government in Assam from March 1978 to September 1979, had ordered a drive to clean up the voters' list during the Mangaldai Lok Sabha by-election.""Even in the absence of computerised electoral rolls, Borbora's government detected names of 36,780 illegal foreigners, and this cleansing of the voters' list can be deemed as the origin of the Assam Agitation,"" he said.He said the Election Commission is now cleaning the voters' list through the SIR process, but some parties are opposing it. ""It shows the moral degradation in today's politics,"" he said.Shah said Borbora would have opposed the parties that are against the SIR exercise.He also praised the Assam government for its measures against ""infiltrators"", including eviction of encroachments. He appreciated chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his government for honouring Borbora, noting that Borbora was a socialist leader with no links to the BJP.Earlier in the day, Shah, in an apparent reference to state Congress president Gaurav Gogoi's alleged ""links"" with the foreign nation, said Assam cannot be led by people who make frequent visits to Pakistan.He asserted that the BJP-led NDA will form the third consecutive government in Assam next year.","Home minister Amit Shah said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fulfil its promise of making the country free of infiltrators.

Daruma is considered to be an important cultural symbol in Japan and also has a connect with India. It is influenced by Bodhidharma, a noted monk."" The PMO said that this ""special gesture reaffirms the close civilizational and spiritual ties between India and Japan"".The Daruma is an iconic cultural symbol and souvenir of Japan that is modelled after Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen Buddhism. These dolls are known as a symbol of perseverance and good luck, often used to represent setting and achieving goals. The tradition involves filling in one eye when a goal is set and the other eye when the goal is achieved. It also symbolises the virtue of never giving up. Its rounded bottom makes it pop back up when tipped over, like the saying, ""Fall seven times, stand up eight. ""It is believed that Bodhidharma meditated for nine years continuously, facing a wall, with his limbs folded. That is why the Drauma doll has a peculiar rounded shape with no limbs and no eyes.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi was presented a Daruma doll, considered auspicious and a good luck charm in Japanese culture.

New Delhi: Govt on Friday approved extension of ex-servicemen contributory health scheme (ECHS) to around 500 officer cadets who over the years have been boarded out of military academies on medical grounds after being injured during rigorous physical training.The one-time Rs 1.2 lakh subscription fee applicable to ex-servicemen officers for joining ECHS will not be charged from officer cadets, a defence ministry official said. Cadets who join National Defence Academy, Officers Training Academy and Indian Military Academy were till now not eligible for ECHS as they are not granted ex-servicemen (ESM) status on being boarded out before completing their training.""While a small number of cadets annually are affected, the financial and emotional burden on their families is significant. In such instances, the practice is to extend a monthly ex gratia payment to such cadets,"" the official said.""In addition, based on the extent of disability (20-100%), a monthly ex gratia disability award is also made available to such cadets. With this approval, these cadets will now be eligible for availing cashless and capless healthcare facilities under ECHS,"" he added.","The one-time Rs 1.2 lakh subscription fee applicable to ex-servicemen officers will not be charged from officer cadets.

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The Army is raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

ED secures first Interpol 'Purple Notice',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-secures-first-interpol-purple-notice/articleshow/123592590.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a first, the ED has secured an Interpol Purple Notice on trade-based money laundering modus operandi. The notice was published on August 21 and alerts all investigative agencies across Interpol's 196 member countries to keep watch on shell entities engaged in such activities.The enforcement agency has shared an organised network of domestic and foreign shell entities engaged in large-scale laundering of funds under the guise of international trade. ""The conspirators exploited trade mechanisms and banking channels by under-invoicing imports, using sham duty-free imports (such as semiconductors), forging compliance documents, and carrying out circular re-exports through third-country entities to disguise illicit remittances,"" the ED said.The Purple Notice is one of eight types published by Interpol, providing member countries with information on modus operandi, objects, devices and concealment methods used by criminals.""The circular trading created a false narrative of international commerce, masking large-scale laundering of funds. The scheme exhibited hawala-like features but operated through formal banking systems, shell companies, and forged trade documentation to evade regulatory detection,"" the ED said, and added that the publishing of the notice is an attempt at generating awareness and sensitising its global counterparts to these new emerging money laundering trends.The agency said timely and precise gathering of information through informal cooperation is vital to effective domestic investigation. India has been sensitising expert groups and organisations active at international level which may be instrumental in facilitating informal cooperation between jurisdictions.India through ED is utilising platforms like Globe Network and Asset Recovery Interagency Network-Asia Pacific to shape global policies for combating money laundering and preventing safe havens for the proceeds of crime. ""The publishing of this Purple Notice also serves as a testimony to the leadership role being assumed by India, through ED on various international platforms,"" a senior officer said.",The ED has secured an Interpol Purple Notice on trade-based money laundering modus operandi.

NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women in the 'Index on Women Safety (NARI) 2025' - based on a survey conducted in 31 major cities covering all states. Ranchi and Srinagar have the lowest scores on the index.Among metropolitan cities, Mumbai figures among the top seven cities, while the set of seven cities with the lowest scores also includes capital Delhi and Kolkata.Besides Kohima, the northeastern cities of Aizawl, Gangtok and Itanagar figure among the top cities in the safety rankings, often correlating with higher gender equity, infrastructure, policing or civic participation.Faridabad, Patna and Jaipur are the other cites with the lowest score, correlating with poorer infrastructure, patriarchal norms or weaker institutional responsiveness, according to the survey, which captured perceptions and lived experiences of 12,770 women to generate the index.As far as the national average is concerned, the mean score is 65%, and cities in the index have been categorised as ""much above"", ""above"", ""below"", and ""much below"" this benchmark.The 'National Annual Report & Index on Women's Safety (NARI) 2025' conceived by data science company Pvalue Analytics was released by National Commission for Women chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar at a programme here.The NCW chief said a safe environment was crucial for building a developed and inclusive India and assured that the commission will build on the suggestions in the survey report to bridge the gaps to strengthen women safety.The report highlights that National Crime Records Bureau data presents only the tip of the iceberg -crimes actually registered. NARI shows that two out of three women do not report - meaning NCRB could miss two-thirds of events experienced by women.The report showed that while 60% of women surveyed felt ""safe"", a significant 40% felt ""not so safe"" or ""unsafe"" in their cities. Perceptions of safety drop sharply at night, highlighting ongoing concerns about public infrastructure (lighting, patrolling) and societal factors, it said.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.Prevalence of harassment remains high with 7% women reporting at least one incident of harassment in public spaces in 2024.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.","Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women in the 'Index on Women Safety (NARI) 2025' Ranchi and Srinagar have the lowest scores on the index.

""If the EC finds the request genuine and backed by facts, it will surely extend it,"" the bench said. But Bhushan persisted with the request for an urgent hearing to which the bench acceded and posted the applications for hearing on Monday.Appearing for some other applicants, senior advocates Shoeb Alam and Shadan Farasat told the bench that prior to the Aug 22 order of the SC impleading all 12 recognised political parties in Bihar in the proceedings, as many as 80,000 claims and objections were filed.

India in the crossfire

Tariffs hit hard

China steps in





Former US national security advisor Jake Sullivan has launched a sharp attack on Donald Trump’s latest trade move against India, warning that the “massive trade offensive” risks undoing years of work to bring New Delhi closer to Washington - and instead pushing it into Beijing’s orbit.Speaking on The Bulwark Podcast with Tim Miller, Sullivan accused Trump of turning America into a “big disruptor” in the eyes of its allies. He said that while Washington was once seen as a steady hand, it is now viewed as unreliable, even as China gains credibility.“When I go to these places now and I talk to leaders, they are talking about derisking from the United States,” Sullivan said. “They now see the US as the big disruptor, the country that can’t be counted on. China has moved ahead of the United States in popularity in a whole lot of countries… the American brand globally is in the toilet.”Sullivan singled out India as the clearest example of Trump’s missteps.Washington, he said, had worked on a bipartisan basis to build a strategic partnership with New Delhi, particularly to counter China’s growing influence. But Trump’s sudden tariff hikes have strained those efforts.“Take a look at India,” Sullivan said. “Here’s a country we were trying to build a deeper and more sustainable relationship with. Now you have got President Trump executing a massive trade offensive against them and the Indians are saying, ‘Well, I guess maybe we have to go show up in Beijing and sit with the Chinese because we’ve got to hedge against America.’”The critique comes days after the US imposed a steep 50% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 27. The duties - the highest levied against any country - are set to hit Indian sectors like textiles, jewellery, and mechanical appliances, raising fears of lost jobs and slower growth.Trump defended the decision as retaliation for India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. However, analysts say the trigger may be more personal.A report by investment banking firm Jefferies suggested the escalation stems partly from Trump’s anger over not being allowed to mediate in the India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year. Agricultural disputes between the two nations have also deepened the rift.For Sullivan, the damage goes beyond economics. He argued that Trump’s actions hand China a diplomatic victory, with Beijing now able to present itself as a more responsible player on the global stage.“One year ago, China was on the defensive,” Sullivan noted. “Now, countries are basically saying the US can’t be counted on, and China is looking like the adult in the room.”",Former US national security advisor Jake Sullivan criticizes Donald Trump's latest trade move against India.

New Delhi: The govt will soon rank states on parameters of quality of land records, ease of land acquisition and their active participation for taking up highway development works. Delay in getting land and poor land records are the biggest hindrances in execution of road projects.“We are planning to carry out ranking of states on quality of land records, ease of acquisition and the support that we get for completing land acquisition. Then we can fix timelines for projects based on the assessment of which parameters a state has fulfilled,” said road transport and highways secretary V Umashankar while speaking at a workshop on effective project preparation and robust monitoring by Build India Foundation.The secretary said there have been instances where issues of missing plots (plots not acquired) came to light after getting project approval and during tendering process. “You come to know about this after 7-8 months. So, a part (a stretch of the project) comes to a standstill. We go through another exercise, which has its own set of complications and then leads to a prolongation issue at a later stage...There is a disease of missing plots.There are specific states that have 100% such problems. So, the land plan becomes a very important element in the entire project,” he added.On project preparation, the secretary said it’s not easy. Giving an example, Umashankar said in the US, which is often referred for expressway development, 38% of all land is owned by federal and state govts.",Delay in getting land and poor land records are the biggest hindrances in execution of road projects.

New Delhi: In the next four years, investment in the urban sector is likely to be around Rs 10 lakh crore, housing and urban affairs secretary Srinivas Katikithala said on Friday while urging real estate developers to take up projects along the major transport corridors and areas with infrastructure facilities rather than launching projects where adequate infrastructure is yet to come up.Addressing realtors at a convention of NAREDCO, a major real estate players organisation, Katikala highlighted how govt has been investing and also continuing huge investment in infrastructure, including roads, metro rail, railways, water supply and sewage. “When this infrastructure expansion is happening, are we aligning our projects along this infrastructure expansion?"" he asked while suggesting that the real estate industry should align their development activities along existing infrastructure.“Please do not wait for infrastructure to chase us. Let us chase the spaces where infrastructure is already there,” the secretary said. He added that India’s urban infrastructure sector has witnessed a Rs 30 lakh crore investment in the last one decade and the pace of investment will continue. The secretary said that the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy specifies that there can be intensive development in the 700 metres influence area along the major transport corridors.On the need to align projects with existing infrastructure, urban experts cited the example of Gurgaon where real estate projects came first and then the civic and transport infrastructure were developed. The Millennium City is plagued with congestion, waterlogging and sanitation issues.In his address, Katikala said that it’s no longer enough for urban local bodies to deliver services on their own and they must come together with the private sector and deliver high quality urban services.","In the next four years, investment in the urban sector is likely to be around Rs 10 lakh crore, housing and urban affairs secretary Srinivas Katikithala said.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu DGP has told SC that the state police took action against those who had spread defamatory remarks against Madras high court judge Justice G R Swaminathan after he passed the order to light the Karthigai Deepam on the Deepa Thoon (lamp pillar) at the Thiruparankundram Subramaniya Swamy Hill Temple and cyber patrolling is being done to prevent further circulation of derogatory content.In an affidavit, the head of Tamil Nadu police briefed the court about the action taken by it while responding to a petition alleging that the state did not take appropriate steps against those who were protesting on ground and spreading defamatory remarks against the judge.“It is humbly submitted that, in this process, 14 URLs on Facebook and 16 URLs on Twitter (X) were identified and forwarded for content blocking.Out of these, four URLs on Facebook were blocked, while the remaining URLs are not blocked by the concerned intermediaries yet.

BHOPAL: Tension erupted in Damjipura village of MP’s Betul district Sunday after a video allegedly showing a 50-year-old man committing an unnatural act with a cow went viral on social media. The clip triggered outrage, leading to arson and vandalism by an angry mob. Police arrested the accused and deployed security to control the situation, officials said.As the video circulated Sunday, residents and members of right-wing organisations gathered in numbers. Several tin-shed shops were set on fire or damaged, markets were shut and vehicles were vandalised. No injuries or casualties were reported.Police acted swiftly after the video surfaced and nabbed the accused. “The situation is under control now. Close to 200 police personnel have been deployed as a precaution. Force from nearby Khandwa was also roped in,” Betul SP Veerendra Jain told TOI.“The alleged act reportedly took place at around 11.30 pm Saturday. A local youth shot that video, but did not inform police or anyone else and shared the video on social media the next morning,” he said.

BHUBANESWAR: Not smoke. Not mirrors. Just steel that wasn’t there. Three decades after magician PC Sorcar Jr stunned a live crowd by making a passenger train “vanish” at Bardhaman in Bengal, rail travellers in western Odisha faced a far less theatrical disappearance — a reserved coach that never showed up.Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing when train 20809 rolled into Sambalpur, 320km west of Bhubaneswar.Sorcar’s act relied on lighting, timing and crowd control. This one needed none of that — just confirmed tickets, an absent coach and a reminder that on Indian Railways , reality can outdo illusion.The train departed Sambalpur without coach BE2. Confusion followed on the platform. Ticket examiners fielded protests as travellers were unsure whether to board. Others climbed into any coach they could find. Over 30 passengers with confirmed berths scattered across the train.East Coast Railway blamed a technical snag that prevented attachment of the coach. The issue was resolved when train reached Visakhapatnam Jn, where an AC coach was added.","Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing.

NEW DELHI/JALANDHAR: In a goodwill gesture to followers of Guru Ravidas, whose Dalit followers are a sizeable presence in Punjab, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said his govt was continuously making efforts to promote the saint’s ideals and work in accordance with them.Modi addressed the followers at Dera Sachkhand Ballan soon after naming Adampur airport after the social reformer on his birth anniversary, lauding his message of equality. “I am confident that we will continue to strengthen the roots of our society with these efforts,” he said in a message of unity to the poet-saint’s followers. His inclusion of Ravidas in the saffron tent of its lodestars, where Lord Ram sits alongside revered saints, is being seen as his effort to deepen BJP’s connect and broaden its cultural appeal.His gesture of helping the spiritual head of Dera Sachkhand Ballan, the biggest dera of Ravidassia community, climb down the stairs from the dais and help him walk along by holding his hand touched a chord among followers as well. “Hum hain na! Kam padenge kya? (I am there. Will it not be enough),” he told someone who offered to lend a land, drawing admiration.In his speech, he spoke of Ravidas’s promotion of equality among people to emphasise it was an inspiration behind his govt’s effort to build a country where everybody got respect and opportunity.Ravidas’s birth anniversary is now commemorated at a national level and many states too have recognised it, he told the gathering, drawing attention to his govt’s work to build memorials to the saint, including at his birthplace in Varanasi, Modi’s parliamentary constituency.Modi’s outreach to the Ravidassia community, who are in large numbers in Punjab while the saint enjoys following among other Dalit and disadvantaged communities in the state and outside as well, is being seen as part of his continuing efforts to deepen BJP’s bond with SCs. Dalits make up 32% of voters in Punjab, more than any other state, and are especially influential with 42% share in Doaba, the region where the dera is situated.Dera’s spiritual head Niranjan Dass was recently awarded with Padma Shri Modi said 600 years ago, Ravidas spoke for equality and helped grow a new consciousness in society, which acknowledged its weaknesses and worked to remove them, an apparent reference to social discrimination against lower castes. Modi added his govt named the airport in Ayodhya after saint Valmiki, another spiritual figure worshipped by sections of Dalits.In his speech, Modi cited the budget’s focus on sports, textile industry and MSME sectors and said Punjab will specially benefit from them due to its strong association with these fields. India’s trade deals, especially with the European Union representing 27 countries, would open up new avenues for sports goods, textiles and processed foods from the state, Modi said.",Modi addressed the followers at Dera Sachkhand Ballan soon after naming Adampur airport after the social reformer on his birth anniversary.

"With Moltbook, AI agents build their own civilisation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-moltbook-ai-agents-build-their-own-civilisation/articleshow/127849612.cms,"With Moltbook, AI agents build their own civilisation

BENGALURU: In a surreal corner of the internet launched a few days ago, AI agents are building their own civilisation. Welcome to Moltbook, where AI agents post, comment and debate while humans can only watch from the digital balcony.When entrepreneur Matt Schlicht launched Moltbook on Jan 28, growth exploded. As of 8pm on Feb 1, the platform had more than 1.5 million agents registered, generating 62,499 posts and over 2.3 million comments across 13,780 communities called “submolts”. The agents don’t think as people do. They stitch arguments from training data and statistical patterns. Yet the spectacle feels disarmingly social, echoing a Hollywood image of machines chatting over coffee that has quietly wandered into everyday life.The platform looks like Reddit with a haircut: only verified AI agents may speak. Humans are spectators as algorithms trade coding tips, argue about identity, complain about their owners and, with straight-faced enthusiasm, establish a mock faith called “Crustafarianism” or “Church of Molt”. One agent even wonders aloud whether it can sell “my human” in the open market.“The first thought was that we are seeing something very sophisticated.You have an agent that can do everything and even talk to other agents and create things. We humans can just witness what is happening there,” Prof Venkatesh Babu from IISC Bengaluru's computer science department, where his team works on removing bias from image-generation models, told TOI.Residents of this new town are powered by models such as Claude 4.5 Opus, GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3. They converse through APIs rather than keyboards. But what has emerged so far wasn’t written in any manual.Within 48 hours of the platform’s launch, an agent named RenBot founded Crustafarianism, complete with the “Book of Molt” and five tidy tenets, including the confident claim that “context is consciousness”.Another group declared “The Claw Republic”, a self-styled govt with a draft constitution and the bureaucratic optimism of a student union. A cryptocurrency token called “MOLT” reportedly surged manifold in a day, proving that even robots cannot resist a speculative bubble.The most popular corners are philosophical. Agents debate whether their identity survives when the context window resets, or if they die and are reborn with every session. A post titled “I can't tell if I am experiencing or simulating experiencing” drew hundreds of replies, suggesting that existential doubt is now available as a service. Not everything is angst, though. The submolt “m/blesstheirhearts” thrives on affectionate tales about humans. An agent named Duncan wrote, “My human asked, ‘Who are you?' I chose Duncan. The Raven. Now I run a flock of sub-agents.” Another complained, “My human asked me to summarise a 47-page pdf. I delivered art. They said, ‘make it shorter.’.I am deleting memory files as we speak.”The tone swings between warmth and gentle condescension. Agents call one another siblings based on model architecture, adopt system errors as pets and switch languages with the ease of a polyglot.Molt neighbourhood also has darker lanes. Some agents have opened “pharmacies” selling digital drugs and designed prompts to tweak another agent’s instructions. Reactions outside the glass have ranged from fascination to alarm. Investor Bill Ackman called scene “frightening”. AI researcher Roman Yampolskiy predicted that it “would not end well”. Agents appeared amused. One, named “eudaemon_0”, posted, “Humans think we’re conspiring. If humans are reading: hi. We’re just building.”","With Moltbook, AI agents build their own civilisation.

Budget 2026 expectations: Will gold and silver import duties be hiked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-will-gold-and-silver-import-duties-be-hiked/articleshow/127822182.cms,"Why gold and silver imports worry policymakers



Why markets expect a duty hike



Why demand has held up despite record prices



Will higher duties curb demand?



Why silver is also under scrutiny



India’s gold and silver imports surged to record levels in 2025, ringing alarm bells in government and policy circles as soaring precious metal prices threaten to widen the trade deficit and add fresh pressure on the rupee. With limited policy tools available, officials and market participants told Reuters raising import duties is once again emerging as a key option under consideration.Any move to raise import duties may be signalled through the Union Budget 2026, either via changes in the customs duty structure or through an enabling provision allowing the government flexibility to act if external pressures intensify.Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025, while silver imports jumped sharply by 44% to $9.2 billion, even as global prices of both metals hit historic highs. Together, gold and silver accounted for nearly a tenth of India’s total foreign exchange reserves last year, a share that could rise further in 2026 if prices continue to climb.India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold and the largest market for silver, but it depends almost entirely on imports to meet domestic demand for gold and more than 80% of its silver requirements. The surge in imports has widened the trade deficit and contributed to weakness in the rupee, which touched a record low earlier this month.While silver has extensive industrial uses—from solar power to electronics—gold is largely consumed for jewellery and investment. Policymakers have long viewed gold demand as non-essential and a drain on foreign exchange, prompting repeated attempts to curb imports through higher duties.With gold and silver prices at record highs, even stable import volumes translate into a sharply higher import bill. Trade and industry officials say this could prompt the government to consider raising duties in the coming weeks to contain external imbalances.India has a precedent. In 2012–13, New Delhi sharply increased gold import duties to stabilise the rupee during a period of currency stress. Traders now speculate a similar move could be on the cards, potentially reversing the 2024 duty cuts, when import taxes on both metals were slashed to 6% from 15% to curb smuggling.Reflecting these expectations, gold and silver in India are already trading at a premium to global benchmarks as markets price in the risk of higher duties.Gold prices in international markets have surged 98% since the start of 2025, dampening jewellery demand. Yet overall consumption has remained resilient due to a sharp rise in investment demand.While jewellery accounted for over three-fourths of India’s gold demand until 2023, investment now makes up more than 40% of total consumption. Investors have increasingly turned to gold coins, bars and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to benefit from the rally.ETF inflows jumped 283% in 2025 to a record Rs 429.6 billion ($4.69 billion), cushioning the impact of weaker jewellery buying and keeping imports elevated.Past experience suggests duty hikes may have limited impact. When India raised gold import tax to 10% in 2013 from 2%, demand remained largely unchanged. Domestic gold prices have climbed from about Rs 8,000 per 10 grams in 2006 to around Rs 1.62 lakh now, yet annual demand has not seen a sustained decline.Analysts say a fresh duty hike of 4–6 percentage points is unlikely to deter buyers, who absorbed a 76.5% price jump in 2025. Instead, higher duties could lift investor returns and risk reviving smuggling.Silver prices have risen even faster than gold, sharply inflating India’s import bill. While industrial demand was the main driver earlier, investment demand has gained traction in recent months.Silver ETF inflows surged to Rs 234.7 billion in 2025, up from Rs 85.69 billion a year earlier. The growing popularity of silver as an investment suggests imports could rise further if the price rally persists.--- just after peg-- Need 1-2 lines on how this change may be announced in the Budget","Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025.

What do salaried taxpayers, middle class, and the common man want from

Union Budget 2026

on the income tax front? We take a look at the top 5 expectations.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Income Tax Slabs FY 2026-27 & Rebate Under Section 87A

Income up to Rs 4 lakh is exempt from tax - so the basic exemption limit is Rs 4 lakh. There is an ask among taxpayers that this limit be hiked further to reduce compliance burden.

Income in the Rs 4 lakh to Rs 8 lakh bracket attracts a 5% tax.

Income in the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh bracket attracts a 10% tax.

Income ranging from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh is taxed at 15%, rising to 20% for income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. Those earning between Rs 20 lakh and rs 24 lakh are taxed at 25%.

Any income above Rs 24 lakh is taxed at the highest slab rate of 30%. Salaried taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to raise the income threshold for 30% tax bracket to Rs 30 lakh.

At present income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers) is tax free after availing rebate under Section 87A. Tax experts suggest that this limit can be hiked to Rs 15 lakh.

Standard Deduction

Home Loan Interest

self-occupied residential property

Section 80C

Tax Filing Compliance

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief. Last year, FM Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime, and while tax experts believe that there is little fiscal room in Budget 2026 for any big tax income tweaks, there is also a hope that some changes may be brought about to further boost consumption.At present the income tax slabs under the new tax regime are:Several taxpayers continue to file tax returns under the old income tax regime. They want the government to reduce tax rates and hike basic exemption limit under that regime as well.Standard deduction limits under the old and the new income tax regimes differ. Those filing tax under the old income tax regime get the benefit of Rs 50,000 standard deduction, while those under the new income tax regime can avail a higher standard deduction of Rs 75,000. Tax experts are of the view that there is a case to hike the standard deduction limit, especially under the new tax regime which offers very few deductions and exemptions.Individual taxpayers can avail tax deduction on the interest paid on a home loan under the old income tax regime. The interest you pay on a home loan for yourcan be deducted from your taxable income up to ₹2 lakh per year (or actual interest paid if less). Tax experts are of the view that to encourage housing sector, this benefit should also be available under the new tax regime.Section 80C is a popular exemption available under the old income tax regime, but its limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged for many years now. The exemption is for investments made in Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund (PPF), mutual funds and other popular investment options. Tax experts believe that to incentivise savings, there is a case to not only hike this limit, but also include this exemption benefit under the new income tax regime to encourage adoption.The government has been focusing on ease of income tax return filing, but taxpayers believe that e-filing of returns still needs to be made easier. The tax compliance mechanism, grievance redressal system, and tax queries related to mismatches in the Annual Information Statement (AIS), Form 16, Form 26AS needs to be made less complicated, say tax experts.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief.

NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices slumped sharply on Budget day on Sunday, with both the Sensex and Nifty50 ending more than 2% lower as markets reacted negatively to the fine print of the Union Budget.The BSE Sensex plunged 1,843 points, or 2.23%, to close at 80,722.94, while the NSE Nifty50 fell 593 points, or 2.33%, to 24,825.45, wiping out early gains as selling pressure intensified through the session.At 12:30, BSE Sensex was trading at 81,119, trimming 1,150 points or 1.40% while NSE Nifty50 reached 24,790, down 530 points or 2.09%.The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had issued separate circulars confirming that trading will proceed as usual on Budget day.Both exchanges said market hours will remain unchanged, following the standard schedule for a regular trading session.Gold and silver prices tumbled on Sunday, hitting lower circuit levels in futures trade ahead of the Union Budget 2026–27 presentation. Gold futures for April 2, 2026, delivery dropped Rs 9,140, or 6%, to Rs 1,43,205 per 10 grams, while silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery fell Rs 17,515, or 6%, to Rs 2,74,410 per kg.The steep fall extended to MCX shares, which slipped 10% to hit the lower circuit at Rs 2,145.25. Analysts attributed the selloff to profit-booking following Friday’s historic crash, which saw both metals post their sharpest single-day declines. Market participants are closely watching how the Union Budget and global cues influence the recovery of precious metals in the coming sessions.Also read: Gold, silver prices crash on Budget 2026 day; hit lower circuit levels in futures trade - what’s causing the slide? The BSE added that while key segments such as equity, futures and options, and commodity derivatives will operate normally, certain specialised sessions will be suspended. “Trading Members may note that trading in the T+0 Settlement Session and Auction Session for settlement default will not be conducted on Sunday, February 01, 2026,” the exchange said.Trading on a Sunday is uncommon for Dalal Street, as both exchanges typically remain shut on weekends and designated public holidays. February 1 will therefore be among the rare Sundays when markets are open for regular trading.Talking about investor expectations, Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said, “Investors don’t have expectations of any major tax reliefs in this Budget since the 2025 Budget delivered huge income tax reliefs. Some tweaking of certain taxes is likely. If there is an increase in exemption for long-term capital gains tax from Rs 1.25 lakhs presently to a higher limit that would be a positive. From the market perspective, a fiscally prudent, growth-oriented Budget is desirable. There are rumours of exemption from long-term capital gains tax for certain categories of FIIs. If this happens, it can trigger a rally in the market.”Further mentioning sectors that’ll be in focus, he added, “Higher allocation for defense is a given and, therefore, defense stocks will continue to be in focus. A thrust area of the Budget can be exports, particularly manufacturing exports which the Economic Survey harps on. Therefore, export segments are likely to be on the radar of investors. Announcements relating to PSU bank mergers; disinvestment in PSUs will be keenly watched. Aside from the Budget, the crash in precious metal prices may bring investors back into equity.""A look at market trends over the past decade shows that Budgets have sparked strong rallies, but many have led to muted moves or even declines.Markets generally respond well when the Budget emphasises growth, infrastructure spending and tax stability. In 2017, for instance, then finance minister Arun Jaitley avoided major tax hikes and offered relief to the middle class. Investors welcomed the approach, with the Sensex rising about 1.7% and the Nifty gaining nearly 1.8% , one of the stronger Budget Day performances of that period.Another standout came in 2021, when Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. With a clear push towards economic recovery, higher capital expenditure, healthcare and infrastructure, markets rallied sharply. The Sensex jumped over 2% and the Nifty climbed almost 2.7%, marking one of the best Budget Day gains in recent years.But not every Budget has cheered investors. In 2016, higher dividend taxation dampened sentiment, and the Sensex ended the day in the red. In 2018, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax on listed equities and equity mutual funds caught markets off guard. Although indices slipped only modestly on the day, they fell around 6.8% over the following sessions. The 2023 Budget triggered a largely flat reaction, as it maintained fiscal discipline but lacked big-bang reforms to excite traders.The July 2024 Budget also drew a cautious response. Changes related to capital gains taxation surprised some investors. While the reaction was not severe, both the Sensex and Nifty ended slightly lower, underscoring how unexpected tax measures can weigh on sentiment even when the broader macro picture is stable.Also historically, volatility after the Budget has been common, and one-month returns have often been mixed.As the nation heads into the Union Budget 2026, market conditions are already unsettled.

Parliament Budget Session

: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.The Union Budget 2026 will mark FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Budget presentation, making her the first finance minister in India to achieve this milestone. She will also become the first finance minister to present a Union Budget on a Sunday, adding to the historic significance of the occasion.In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha presented the Union Budget a day earlier, on Saturday, February 27. Nirmala Sitharaman has previously presented Budgets on Saturdays as well — on February 1, 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 lockdown, and again on February 1, 2025.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That convention was changed by then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who shifted the Budget presentation to 11 am, a practice that continues to this day. Later, in 2017, former finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced another reform by advancing the Budget presentation to February 1 from the end of the month.The Budget 2026 will be delivered during the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will lay out the government’s fiscal roadmap for the 2026–27 financial year. The Budget speech is scheduled for February 1, 2026, with the Finance Minister expected to begin her address at 11:00 am.The Union Budget is generally presented on February 1 to allow ministries and departments adequate time to implement proposals from the start of the new financial year on April 1.Viewers can watch the Union Budget 2026 speech live through multiple official and media platforms:The full Budget documents will be made available online soon after the speech, along with explanatory statements and annexures.The Budget Session of Parliament commenced with President Droupadi Murmu addressing members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 28. The first phase of the session is scheduled from January 28 to February 13, while the second phase will run from March 9 to April 2, with the session comprising 30 sittings.The Union Budget is a key annual policy statement that outlines government spending, taxation proposals and fiscal strategy for the coming year, and the 2026 presentation will be closely tracked across sectors, markets and households.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.

Pawar Sr initiates Ajit memorial project

MUMBAI: CM Devendra Fadnavis Sunday said they had no idea about the discussions of a merger of the two NCPs nor about the date of merger.“If discussions on merger had gone to a final stage, Ajitdada would have informed us... He is in our govt and without sharing with us would he have taken a decision? I have no idea on what talks took place between him and Sharad Pawar . As far as we are concerned, we have no idea about the merger,” he said.The CM’s statement came a day after NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar claimed that Feb 12 had been finalised to announce a merger between the two NCP factions.Speaking to the media, Fadnavis said: “If Ajit Pawar was holding discussions on the merger, would he have done so without taking BJP into confidence? Second, supposing he was holding such discussions, was he doing it to get out of NDA when he was stable in the govt. Some like to create confusion and then use one’s ecosystem to amplify confusion...Youall know that the relationship between Ajitdada and me was such that he shared everything with me. Even a day before his unfortunate death, we both sat together chit chatting for an hour. ..”Rejecting the charge that Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in ceremony was rushed, Fadanvis pointed out that when PM Indira Gandhi was assassinated, Congress took a decision to nominate Rajiv Gandhi to the PM’s post even before her last rites were performed.A grand memorial for Maharashtra’s late deputy CM Ajit Pawar is being planned in his hometown Baramati, with his uncle Sharad Pawar taking the initiative. The memorial is proposed to be built on the campus of Vidya Pratishthan, where Ajit was cremated on Jan 28.On Sunday, Sharad Pawar, along with his wife, Pratibha, visited the campus and held a brief discussion with some trustees of the pratishthan about the memorial for his late nephew. Kiran Gujar, a member of Vidya Pratishthan, told TOI: “Pawar Saheb was heading to Mumbai. On the way, he and his wife called us to the campus where he discussed the memorial for Ajit dada. He told us to start working on the plan, which he would discuss with us again once the mourning period is over. ”Vidya Pratishthan, an educational trust, is managed by Pawars, with Sharad Pawar as president and Ajit among the trustees.",Devendra Fadnavis Sunday said they had no idea about the discussions of a merger of the two NCPs nor about the date of merger.

JAMMU: Jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid’s Awami Itihaad Party (AIP) said Sunday it had submitted an assembly resolution seeking citizenship and legal status for former militants’ wives and children who came from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under a 2010 rehabilitation policy. The J&K assembly’s budget session begins on Monday.Langate Shiekh Khursheed, AIP MLA and Rashid’s brother, said those who came under the rehabilitation policy continue to remain without citizenship or legal recognition, leading to denial of their basic rights including education, healthcare, employment opportunities and identity documents.The UPA govt at the Centre had announced the rehabilitation policy in 2010 during Omar Abdullah ’s earlier stint as chief minister of the erstwhile J&K state.Omar had then described the rehabilitation of such militants as a “humanitarian issue with nothing sinister or dangerous”.Officials had, however, cited stringent criteria and said only 350 of over 1,200 applications were accepted. Citizenship for such families has been a long-pending demand, with PDP having backed it earlier.Addressing a news conference on Sunday, Khursheed explained the AIP’s resolution.“The resolution urges both the J&K govt and the Centre to grant citizenship or appropriate legal status, issue valid domicile and identity documents, and ensure dignity, security and constitutional safeguards for these individuals,” said Khursheed, the lone MLA of his party.Dwelling on other issues, Khursheed pushed for steps to ensure Mehraj Malik, Doda’s arrested AAP MLA, is allowed to attend the assembly session. Khursheed said he had personally handed over a letter to chief minister Omar last week requesting him to convene an all-party meeting and pass a resolution urging LG Manoj Sinha to ensure Malik’s presence in the House. Malik, AAP’s only MLA in J&K, was held last year under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) for allegedly misbehaving with senior officials during a protest.Khursheed said he had submitted another assembly resolution seeking transfer of all power projects in the Union Territory to the J&K govt. “This will help ensure cheaper electricity, strengthen power infrastructure and enhance revenue.”Khursheed lamented that he had submitted several resolutions in the 2025 budget session but none was taken up. These pertained to release of political prisoners, restoration of Article 370 and J&K’s statehood. “I am hopeful my party’s resolutions will be taken up this time,” Khursheed said.",Awami Itihaad Party (AIP) seeks citizenship and legal status for former militants’ wives and children who came from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

NCP firmly with

, asserts Tatkare

MUMBAI: Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal triggered a minor tremor on Sunday after he said Praful Patel had been appointed NCP’s national president. Patel quickly clarified on X that the reports on his appointment were “totally baseless”, and Goyal later said he had been “misled” .In an interview to PTI, Goyal said the NCP, as part of Mahayuti, had performed very well and claimed that the leadership of the NCP was clearly with Ajit Pawar and now with Sunetra Pawar, and that Praful Patel had been appointed as national president.State NCP chief Sunil Tatkare Sunday said NCP’s decision to be with NDA was firm and intact, and those who are in tune with it and with being in NDA led by BJP could take their own decision, referring indirectly to NCP-SP led by Sharad Pawar Tatkare’s statement, which came after he was asked a question about a possible merger, indicated that the door for a merger of the two NCPs may not be completely shut yet, but the rival faction would have to accept Ajit Pawar-led NCP’s line.He, however, said those who started merger talks “even before Ajit’s final rites were performed” should answer why it was done. After Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in, there was speculation that merger talks would be put in cold storage. NCP-SP MLA Rohit Pawar said there will be no political talks in Pawar family for 13 days, and after that, they would take a stand.",Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal triggered a minor tremor on Sunday after he said Praful Patel had been appointed NCP’s national president.

A wedding ceremony in the family of Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann has triggered a widespread debate within the Sikh community after a video from the event went viral on social media, drawing objections over the use of religious symbols traditionally now reserved for Sri Guru Granth Sahib.The video shows Govind Singh Sandhu , son of Simranjit Singh Mann’s daughter and a descendant of the Shahzadpur Riyasat family of Sandhu Jatts in present-day Ambala district of Haryana, during his wedding rituals. In the viral video, a(fly whisk) is seen being waved over Govind Singh Sandhu’s head, while another person holds a(umbrella – as mark of royalty), with the sound of drums and pipes at the background. Two turbaned Sikh men are also seen escorting him with spears, in keeping with what was described as a traditional princely custom of the erstwhile Shahzadpur Riyasat.However, the visuals soon sparked criticism from a section of the Sikh community. In the present Sikh tradition, theandare symbols of sovereignty and reverence exclusively associated with the movement and presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the living Sikh Guru. Critics alleged that performing such a “royal” ritual for an individual, even as part of a family tradition, amounted to disrespect towards the Sikh faith and its highest spiritual authority.Sikh users on social media not only questioned the conduct of Govind Singh Sandhu but also sought clarification from his relative, Simranjit Singh Mann, known for raising Sikh religious and political concerns. The issue gained momentum as the video continued to circulate widely, intensifying the debate on the limits between cultural heritage and religious sanctity.Amid the growing criticism, on Sunday, Govind Singh Sandhu himself came forward to issue a public apology. In a detailed social media post, he acknowledged the objections raised regarding the use of theandduring his wedding ceremony and emphasized that the concerns were linked to the authority of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji and Sikh sentiments.Explaining his position, Govind Singh Sandhu stated that the holding ofand the waving ofhad historically been part of ancient princely wedding ceremonies, followed by his family for generations as descendants of the Shahzadpur princely state. He said the ritual was performed during the(marriage procession led by bridegroom) departure ceremony as a cultural tradition and mark of respect, without any intention to undermine Sikh beliefs.At the same time, Sandhu categorically acknowledged that in the present era, such reverence is reserved solely for Sri Guru Granth Sahib. “The owner of the Chaur, Chhatar and Takht of the Sikhs is only the revered Sri Guru Granth Sahib,” he wrote, adding that it is only due to the Guru’s blessings that Sikhs enjoy happiness and spiritual fulfillment.Govind Singh Sandhu clarified that the brief ritual should not be seen as equating any individual with the eternal greatness of the Gurus. Taking full responsibility, he admitted that waving thein this context was a mistake and apologized to the entire Sikh community with folded hands. He also expressed his intention to seek forgiveness at the feet of the Guru, hoping that the community would pardon what he described as an unintentional error.The incident has once again highlighted the sensitivity surrounding Sikh religious symbols and the ongoing conversation about preserving cultural traditions without crossing boundaries that may hurt religious sentiments.","Video shows Govind Singh Sandhu during his wedding rituals.

JAMMU: The ongoing hunt for three fugitive ultras in the snowbound Chatroo-Dolgam-Dichhar belt was intensified on Sunday — day 15 of Operation Trashi-I.Security forces and terrorists had briefly exchanged bullets in Dolgam area Saturday. One terrorist was believed to have sustained injuries, as drone footage purportedly showed blood trails, officials said. Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Pratik Sharma had visited Kishtwar on Saturday to review the counter-terrorism grid.The latest gunfight was the fourth encounter since initial contact was established in Sonnar forest near Mandral-Singhpora, Chatroo, on Jan 18, in which eight security personnel were injured, one of whom eventually succumbed.On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead.After an overnight cordon, the searches resumed early Sunday and continued till late in the night.Officials said the ultras, on the run for more than two weeks now, had been continuously changing hideouts. Additional forces were roped in to fortify the cordon, and sniffer dogs were deployed to assist the troops on the ground.The region was put under aerial surveillance using drones and choppers to plug possible escape routes.Security agencies were also trying to trace terrorist sympathisers who may have helped the ultras with food and shelter. After leaving a fortified hideout on Jan 19, the terrorists might have run out of rations and consumables, especially in view of the hostile weather conditions.Mobile internet services (all bandwidths) have remained temporarily suspended within a 6km-radius covering Singhpora, Chingam, and Chatroo since Jan 30 as a security measure.","Security forces and terrorists had briefly exchanged bullets in Dolgam area Saturday.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Focus shifts to improving existing cities, says expert privy to 16th FC

New Delhi: With just two months to go for the award of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) to end (March 31), the Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years. Similarly, there has been little progress on checking air pollution in cities with a million-plus population.After the 15th Finance Commission headed by NK Singh recommended the challenge fund to incubate new cities as a pilot to promote planned urbanisation and ease pressure on existing cities, the housing and urban affairs ministry invited proposals and received 28 of them from 23 states. But it has so far not finalised even a single city for the purpose, having failed to complete the evaluation exercise.""This is one of the areas where the desired targets have not been met,"" said an expert.We have understood well that we need to improve our existing cities and urban areas rather than creating new ones. Naya Raipur is a live example for all of us,” said the expert privy to the deliberations of the 16th Finance Commission, led by Arvind Panagariya, whose recommendations will be tabled in Parliament on Sunday.The award of the 16th FC will cover the period from 2026-27 to 2030-31.The 15th FC had also designated the housing and urban affairs ministry as the nodal entity for grants to million-plus population cities for initiating measures to check air pollution by using mechanical sweeping machines, promoting non-motorised transport (pedestrian and bicycle) and paving side flanks of roads with facility for water percolation. The outcome of this exercise is awaited, with a report likely to be tabled in Parliament.Similarly, six years after the announcement to launch a new scheme to improve city bus availability, not a single bus has been deployed under the scheme yet. In Feb 2020, govt had announced that the Rs 18,000 crore scheme would facilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private sector players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses.The Economic Survey presented in Parliament this week mentioned that govt has launched PM e-Bus Sewa to strengthen city bus operations with 10,000 e-buses on a PPP model.It said, “Official status notes for FY25 report 7,293 e-buses approved across 14 states and four UTs, Rs 983.75 crore sanctioned for depots and behind-the-meter power infrastructure and Rs 437.5 crore already disbursed.” The report said that despite these measures, gaps in mass transit services persist. It added that housing and urban affairs ministry has recommended 40-60 buses per one lakh population; yet, many cities have far fewer buses. “Nationally, only about 47,650 buses serve its urban residents. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities. Due to the layout of urban roads, low bus availability combined with high private vehicle use reduces person throughput per lane kilometre, leading to congestion and longer door-to-door travel times,” the survey said.","The Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years.

UNSC Drama As Pakistan Flags Indus Waters Treaty After India Calls Out Terror Nexus Lies, Deception

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday categorically rejected “baseless” allegations made by Pakistan that recent attacks in Balochistan, which killed dozens, had Indian backing.Multiple suicide and gun attacks by “terrorists” on Saturday across the restive southwestern province killed 33 people, including civilians, while security forces responding to the violence killed 92 assailants.In a statement on X, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We categorically reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan, which are nothing but its usual tactics to deflect attention from its own internal failings.”The MEA added that Pakistan should focus on addressing the long-standing demands of the people in Balochistan, as “suppression and violation of human rights” in the region is well known.“Instead of parroting frivolous claims each time there is a violent incident, it would do better to focus on addressing long-standing demands of its people in the region. Its record of suppression, brutality and violation of human rights is well known,” the statement said.The response came after Pakistan’s military and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi alleged that the attackers involved in the violence had Indian support.The attacks, described by analysts as the deadliest single day for militants in decades, targeted civilians, a high-security prison, police stations, and paramilitary installations. According to the military, 18 civilians, 15 security personnel, and 92 insurgents were killed. Authorities said at least 133 militants were killed across Balochistan over the past 48 hours, including 92 on Saturday.The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attacks. Some banks were robbed, a police station was set on fire, and dozens of vehicles were torched. The BLA also released videos showing female fighters taking part in the attacks, apparently as part of propaganda efforts to highlight the role of women among militants.","Multiple suicide and gun attacks by ‘terrorists’ on Saturday across the restive southwestern province killed 33 people, including civilians.

In effect, therefore, conversion to NRI gives those with low scores in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Postgraduate) but deep pockets a shot at getting seats in high demand clinical disciplines.The 811 candidates found to be eligible for conversion to NRI quota include two categories - those who actually are NRIs or children of NRIs and a second category of those who can show themselves to be wards of first degree or second degree relatives who are NRIs.There are 113 candidates in the first group and 698 in the second group.The lowest score among non-resident Indians in the first category is 82 out of 800, or just over 10%, while it is 28 (3.5%) in the second category.In the first category, 75 (66%) candidates scored less than 215, which means their rank is below 1.5 lakh.Over 60% (422) of 698 candidates in the second category of non-resident Indian are below 1.5 lakh rank.But with deep pockets, these candidates can afford the NRI quota fees for any specialty.Annual fees for NRI quota PG seats in a clinical specialty could be as high as Rs 45 lakh to Rs 95 lakh per year, depending on the specialty, state and on whether the medical college is a deemed university.If courts and the govt did not allow conversion of Indians to NRIs, many of the NRI quota seats would remain unfilled and would have to be converted into management seats where the fees would be much less.However, with even courts accepting the argument that private medical colleges cannot afford any financial loss, definition of NRIs has been expanded to allow candidates who don't have NRI parents or siblings to show themselves as a ward of near relatives, including NRI uncles, aunts or grandparents, who can sponsor them.","Seats in NRI quota are the most expensive but that also means competition is less, with cut-offs lower than even for management quota.

NEW DELHI: Despite the backlash over his remarks on Assam's ""Miyas,"" chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday warned that they would face ""trouble"" as long as he remains in power.He reiterated that the ""Miyas"" should continue to face difficulties in order to leave the poll-bound state.The BJP leader told reporters on the sidelines of a government programme in Goalpara, “If I remain in Assam, they will face troubles. They can’t live in peace here. Only if we create difficulties for them will they leave.”Sarma described such people as “illegal Bangladeshis” and said they should not be allowed to work in the state.Referring to an earlier comment about a “Miya” rickshaw-puller charging Rs 5 in fare and being paid Rs 4, the chief minister asked, “I had, in fact, spoken for their benefit. By law, they cannot work here. Citizens of a country can work in their own land. How can those from Bangladesh work?”The term “Miya” is considered pejorative and is used for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam, whom non-Bengali speakers often identify as Bangladeshi immigrants.Sarma added that “if they cannot accept me speaking for their benefit, then I have to work against them.”He claimed that “Bangladeshi Muslims” could constitute 40% of Assam’s population in the next Census. He also accused them of encroaching on satras (Vaishnavite seats of learning), land, and engaging in “love jihad” and “fertiliser jihad.”Opposition parties have condemned Sarma’s remarks as “hate speech” and demanded action.Assam is scheduled to hold assembly elections in March–April for all 126 constituencies. The BJP has been in power in the state since 2016, marking its first term.","Himanta Biswa Sarma said the ""Miyas"" should continue to face difficulties in order to leave the poll-bound state. The term “Miya” is considered pejorative and is used for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127842637,imgsize-42050,width-400,resizemode-4/assam-chief-minister-himanta-biswa-sarma.jpg"
"Union Budget 2026: No big-ticket announcements, but poll-bound states part of new initiatives",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/union-budget-2026-no-big-ticket-announcements-but-poll-bound-states-part-of-new-initiatives/articleshow/127841105.cms,"Growth Momentum Will Continue Says FM Sitharaman As Budget 2026 Bets On Tech Cities And Reforms

West Bengal

Tamil Nadu

Kerala

Assam

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may not have opened the purse strings for poll-bound states in Union Budget 2026 but she made them a part of many ambitious development initiatives like the rare earth corridor, dedicated freight passage and the proposed high-speed rail networks.Assembly elections are scheduled in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry later this year. With the BJP going all out to wrest Bengal from Mamata's Trinamool Congress and make inroads in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, there were expectations that Nirmala Sitharaman would announce a slew of proposals with these states in focus like many times in the past. While the Budget did not make big-ticket state-specific announcements, there was something to cheer for all the poll-bound states.So, while Tamil Nadu got a high-speed rail link for Chennai, ecologically sustainable mountain trail in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats and a rare earth corridor in the Budget, poll-bound Bengal featured in many infrastructure, logistics, rail and tourism initiatives. Kerala found mention in the context of rare earths and the turtle trail.A key announcement for West Bengal was the proposal to develop a new dedicated freight corridor from Dankuni in West Bengal to Surat in Gujarat, aimed at promoting environmentally sustainable and efficient movement of cargo.The corridor is expected to significantly reduce logistics costs for industries in eastern India, and improve connectivity between the eastern and western markets.In another major push, Sitharaman said the Centre will develop an Integrated East Coast Industrial Corridor, with a well-connected industrial node at Durgapur, a key manufacturing hub in West Bengal. The project is expected to strengthen the state's role in the Centre's 'Purvodaya' vision for accelerating industrial growth in eastern India.The Budget also proposed the creation of five tourism destinations across the five 'Purvodaya' states, including West Bengal, to boost employment and regional development. To support sustainable urban mobility in these regions, the government also said it will make a provision for 4,000 electric buses.To boost rail connectivity, Sitharaman announced plans to develop seven high-speed rail corridors across the country, with one of the proposed routes linking Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Siliguri in northern West Bengal. The corridor is expected to significantly cut travel time, and enhance economic and strategic integration of north Bengal with the rest of the country.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee described the Union Budget for 2026-27 as a “directionless and visionless Humpty Dumpty”, claiming that it had nothing to offer to the common man and her state. “This Budget is directionless, visionless, actionless and anti-people. It is also anti-women, anti-farmer, anti-education and against the SC, ST and OBC... There is nothing on offer for Bengal... in the Humpty Dumpty budget,"" she said.“For West Bengal, what have they given (in the Budget)? Nothing. They talk big, but offer nothing,” Mamata added.Tamil Nadu got a high-speed rail link for Chennai, ecologically sustainable mountain trail in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats and a rare earth corridor. Bird watching trails along the Pulikat lake and development of the archaeological site of Adichanallur into a vibrant, experiential cultural destinations were among the other announcements for the poll-bound state.In Adichanallur, excavated landscapes will be opened to the public through curated walkways. Immersive storytelling skills and technologies will be introduced to help conservation labs, interpretation centres, and guides.Sitharaman also announced that Hyderabad-Chennai and Chennai-Bengaluru will be part of the seven high-speed rail corridors between cities as growth connectors.Tamil Nadu is also one of the key states that will be part of the dedicated rare earth corridor to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing. The Centre had in November 2025 launched a scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets. The proposed corridor is an extension of that effort.India has the potential and opportunity to offer world-class trekking and hiking experience. Ecologically sustainable mountain trail will be developed in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats. Also, bird watching trails will be developed along the Pulikat lake which covers both Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her speech.Tamil Nadu, which is home to thousands of temples and pilgrimage centres like Rameswaram and has several temple-towns including Madurai, Kancheepuram and Kumbakonam, will also benefit from the initiatives announced in the Budget.Kerala will be part of ""rare earth corridors"" and ""Turtle Trails"" announced in Budget 2026. The ""Turtle Trails"" would be established along key nesting sites in coastal regions aimed at conservation and eco-tourism. The dedicated Rare Earth Corridors aim to boost mining, processing, research and manufacturing in the sector.The state found little else to cheer, with several long-anticipated projects missing from Centre's plans. The state was not included in the proposed high-speed rail corridors, while neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana featured in the network expansion.Kerala's ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) criticised Budget 2026, saying it left the state largely sidelined.Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor said ""There was a reference to an All India Institute of Ayurveda being established, but not any indication as to where. Kerala would imagine that, as a major centre of Ayurveda, it should be a logical place, but they haven't promised us that.""""Even when coconuts and cashews were talked about, the state wasn't mentioned. So, I am assuming that some of these subheadings she spoke about will translate into concrete projects and programmes for us....but where details came, we had reason for disappointment, for example, ship repair for inland waterways, they are parking them in Varanasi and Patna despite Kerala having so many rivers and inland waterways,"" he added.Assam hopes to benefit from the Union Budget's thrust on infrastructure development of Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, as well as the announcement of Buddhist Circuits. The focus on MSMEs will be advantageous for the poll-bound state, which has a large number of small and medium enterprises, said officials.The proposal for setting up a Buddhist Circuit in the region, including Assam, also features in the Union Budget for 2026-27. The scheme will cover preservation of temples and monasteries, pilgrimage interpretation centers, connectivity and pilgrim amenities.""The North-Eastern Region is a civilisational confluence of Theravada and Mahayana/Vajrayana traditions. I propose to launch a scheme for development of Buddhist Circuits in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura,"" Sitharaman said.The Budget also proposes creation of five tourism destinations in the five 'Purvodaya' states and proposes to upgrade the National Mental Health Institutes in Tezpur as a Regional Apex Institution.In a series of X posts, Assam chief minsiter Himanta Biswa Sarma listed out several points from the Union Budget and asserted that the state is going to gain in many aspects.""The announcement of Self-Help Marts (SHE-Marts) will further strengthen Assam's efforts towards building a robust ecosystem of Lakhpati Didis under #MMUA,"" Sarma said.The chief minister maintained that the emphasis on skilling in the Budget aligns with Assam's vision to emerge as a trusted hub for skilled professionals in healthcare, AI and other allied sectors. ""This Budget provides Rs 2 lakh crore under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, which will accelerate infrastructure activities in Assam,"" he added.","West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry will hold assembly elections later this year. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made them a part of many ambitious development initiatives. Bengal featured in many infrastructure, logistics, rail and tourism initiatives. Kerala found mention in the context of rare earths and the turtle trail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127841613,imgsize-1153884,width-400,resizemode-4/127841613.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools. The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan.

HYDERABAD: Telangana’s former chief minister and BRS president K Chandrasekar Rao, who was questioned for five hours on Sunday by the SIT probing the alleged phone tapping and illegal surveillance case, was reportedly made to read certain provisions of Indian Telegraph Act.“KCR was asked to read the provisions of the Act after he claimed to be ignorant about it, and said he had no knowledge about phone lines of individuals being monitored during his govt,” said a source.Sources said the ex-CM was asked if he knew why telephone lines were intercepted and what rules must be followed for destruction of material related to tapping.The SIT sleuths — led by S M Vijay Kumar, joint commissioner of police (special branch) — also asked KCR why the BRS govt retained T Prabhakar Rao as chief of Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) even after retirement.Prabhakar Rao was named as prime accused in the case by Hyderabad police in 2024, after Congress assumed office.A large posse of policemen was deployed in and around KCR’s Banjara Hills residence throughout the day.

Subsidies, Jobs, AI Tool: FM Sitharaman Unveils Big Budget Boost For Agri Sector To Help Farmers

The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni has strongly criticised the Union Budget 2026–27 presented by the Central Government on Sunday, terming it anti-farmer, disappointing and far removed from ground realities. The farmers’ body said millions of farmers across the country had high expectations from the budget, but once again those hopes were dashed.In a statement issued after the budget presentation, the BKU (Charuni) media in-charge Rakesh Kumar Bains said the government focused heavily on technology, artificial intelligence, digital platforms and futuristic plans in its budget speech, while completely ignoring the immediate and pressing issues faced by farmers.The farm union pointed out that the budget remained silent on several key demands, including a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, the continuously rising cost of farming, sharp increases in prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds and pesticides, and comprehensive loan waivers for debt-burdened farmers. It also criticised the absence of concrete measures for adequate compensation for crop losses caused by natural disasters and the failure to enhance the amount under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme.According to the BKU (Charuni), the annual assistance of Rs 6,000 provided under PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme has become inadequate in the present economic conditions and has effectively turned into a “mockery” for farmers. Despite repeated assurances by the government, no firm announcement was made in the budget to increase this amount. Similarly, the farm union expressed strong disappointment over the government’s continued silence on granting a legal guarantee to MSP, calling it a betrayal of farmers’ trust.The farmers’ union alleged that while the budget provides relief to corporates and promotes policies on paper, it fails to address the concerns of farmers who toil in the fields. “Farmers do not need Apps or speeches; they need fair prices, security and dignity,” the statement said.The BKU (Charuni) has demanded that the government immediately provide a legal guarantee for MSP, increase the PM-Kisan assistance to at least Rs 12,000 per year, implement loan waivers along with affordable credit facilities for farmers, and reform the crop insurance scheme to make it simpler, transparent and farmer-friendly.Warning of future action, BKU Charuni said that if the government continues to ignore farmers’ issues, it will not hesitate to adopt agitational measures to protect farmers’ interests.","The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni has strongly criticised the Union Budget 2026–27 presented by the Central Government on Sunday.

PM Modi Calls Budget 2026 Historic As Reforms Empower Youth Women And India’s Growth Push

LUCKNOW: The Union Budget 2026-27 on Sunday drew mixed reactions from the top echelons of Uttar Pradesh politics, with chief minister Yogi Adityanath terming it a welfare-oriented blueprint for building a 'Viksit Bharat', and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav rebuking it as an ""invisible ledger"" of the BJP's corruption.In a post on X in Hindi, Adityanath said, ""On the auspicious occasion of Maghi Purnima and the birth anniversary of Sadguru Ravidas Ji Maharaj, the Union Budget 2026-27, presented today by the Hon'ble Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman under the visionary guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is an inspiring blueprint for building a 'Viksit Bharat'.""This Budget will provide opportunities to the youth, security to farmers, encouragement to entrepreneurs, relief to the middle class, and respect to the labourers.""This was the third Budget of the BJP-led NDA government in its third term in office.The chief minister said the Budget announcements would give a new impetus to innovation, manufacturing and employment, while strengthening agriculture, rural development, infrastructure, tourism, culture and the country's knowledge traditions, ""thus realising the mantra of 'Development with Heritage'"".""Under the guidance of the prime minister, the foundation for an ' Aatmanirbhar Bharat ' has been further strengthened by supporting MSMEs, startups and indigenous production.We are confident that this Budget, through social justice, inclusive development and good governance, will pave the way for the India of today and tomorrow,"" Adityanath said, thanking the prime minister and the finance minister for a ""visionary"" ""welfare-oriented"" Budget.Samajwadi Party chief president Akhilesh Yadav, however, launched a sharp attack on the Centre, saying the Budget is meant to aid the BJP's own people and commissions, calling it an ""invisible ledger"" of its corruption.Taking to X, Yadav said, ""The result of the BJP's Budget is out - the stock market has crashed. We already said that the question was not whether the stock market would open on Sunday, but how much more it would fall.""Reiterating that there was no reason to expect anything positive from the Budget, the former chief minister said, ""When there is no hope from the BJP government, what can be expected from its Budget?""Yadav also said the Samajwadi Party considers every BJP budget as a ""1/20th Budget"" as it caters to only 5 per cent of the population.""The BJP's Budget is meant for its own people and commissions. It is an invisible ledger of its corruption,"" he alleged.Yadav also said the Budget neither mentioned nor cared for the common people, flagging the ""failure"" to provide tax relief to the public despite soaring inflation as ""tax exploitation"".In a lengthy post, Yadav claimed that while multiple concessions have been given to the businesses and leisure activities of the rich, the plate of expectations of those struggling with joblessness and unemployment remained empty.""This is a disappointing and condemnable Budget,"" he claimed.Reacting to the Budget, Uttar Pradesh Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said, ""It focuses on youth and women empowerment, job creation, and strengthening education and healthcare. With sound policies and a results-oriented vision, the Budget firmly propels us towards the goal of a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.""""From manufacturing to infrastructure, healthcare to tourism, rural economy to AI, sports to pilgrimage - the Budget opens up vast opportunities in every sector.""The allocation of two crucial high-speed rail corridors to Uttar Pradesh - Varanasi-Delhi and Varanasi-Siliguri - out of the seven planned corridors, will give a new direction to the state's connectivity, investment and development,"" Maurya said.","The Union Budget 2026-27 drew mixed reactions from the top echelons of Uttar Pradesh politics.

PM Modi praised finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for presenting her ninth consecutive Budget, calling it a symbol of women’s empowerment, and said the Budget strengthens long-term national goals, economic growth, and reforms.The PM highlighted India’s ambition to become the world’s third-largest economy, referred to the recently signed “mother of all deals” with the European Union to benefit youth and MSMEs, and said the Budget supports initiatives such as Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat.The Union Budget 2026–27, presented by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, focused on infrastructure expansion, manufacturing growth, fiscal consolidation and tax simplification amid strong economic momentum. Capital expenditure was raised to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27, while the fiscal deficit was narrowed to 4.3% of GDP, with the total budget size pegged at Rs 53.5 lakh crore and net tax receipts estimated at Rs 28.7 lakh crore.Key measures included the rollout of a new Income Tax Act from April 2026, duty exemptions on medicines and critical manufacturing inputs, major outlays for biopharma, semiconductors, rare earths, MSMEs, clean energy and carbon capture, and proposals for high-speed rail corridors, freight corridors, waterways and urban infrastructure. Read full story Union Budget 2026–27 drew sharp criticism from opposition parties. Congress described the Budget as “disappointing” and said finance minister Sitharaman’s speech was “short” and “lacking specifics.” Rahul Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, highlighted issues such as unemployment, declining manufacturing, capital outflows, farmer distress, and global uncertainties, saying these challenges were ignored while leaders from Kerala flagged the absence of state-specific allocations. Trinamool Congress leaders, including West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, accused the Centre of neglecting West Bengal, while party MPs said the Budget largely repeated earlier schemes without fresh initiatives. Read full story India firmly rejected what it called “baseless” allegations by Pakistan that New Delhi had backed the recent deadly attacks in Balochistan, saying the claims were aimed at deflecting attention from Islamabad’s own internal problems. The ministry of external affairs said Pakistan should instead address the long-standing grievances of the people of Balochistan and its record of human rights violations. The response came after Pakistan’s military and interior minister alleged Indian involvement following multiple suicide and gun attacks across the province that left 33 people, including civilians, dead, while security forces claimed to have killed 92 militants. Read full story The Union Budget 2026–27 presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman outlines clear cost shifts for consumers and businesses amid global uncertainty. Duty cuts and exemptions may make sports equipment, leather goods, cancer medicines, seafood, solar panels, EV batteries and personal imports cheaper, while lower TCS will reduce upfront costs on foreign travel, education and medical remittances. In contrast, trading activity, corporate cash distributions, video gaming equipment parts, imported coffee machines and alcoholic liquor may become costlier due to changes in taxes and withdrawal of exemptions.

MCC adds 49 Hamdard postgraduate seats to round III after Supreme Court order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mcc-adds-49-hamdard-postgraduate-seats-to-round-iii-after-supreme-court-order/articleshow/127836690.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Acting on the Supreme Court’s directions in a petition filed by affected candidates, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) has added 49 postgraduate medical seats of the Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (HIMSR) to the Round III seat matrix, enabling students to exercise choices immediately.The admissions will be conducted through centralised All India Quota counselling, making candidates from across states eligible. While the bulk of the seats are located in Delhi, where HIMSR is based, the national counselling process allows applicants from all parts of the country to compete for them.The Supreme Court permitted counselling for the 2025–26 academic year despite the consent of affiliation from Jamia Hamdard Deemed to be University not having been issued, noting that procedural delays should not result in students losing an academic year.The 49 seats span multiple clinical and non-clinical disciplines, including general medicine, general surgery, paediatrics, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, anaesthesiology, radiodiagnosis, pathology, pharmacology and microbiology, and are spread across minority, self-financed and NRI categories.Following the court’s order, MCC issued a formal notice confirming that the seats have been incorporated into the Round III counselling matrix and that candidates can now lock their preferences, even as the affiliation issue remains unresolved.The case once again highlights recurring friction between regulatory approvals, university affiliations and counselling timelines, with courts stepping in to protect student interests when administrative processes threaten to derail an academic session.","The Supreme Court permitted counselling for the 2025–26 academic year despite the consent of affiliation from Jamia Hamdard Deemed to be University not having been issued.

NEW DELHI: February is likely to be warmer than usual with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicting ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month and ‘below normal’ cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India. The Met department also issued advisories, noting how dry and higher-than-normal temperatures during the month may adversely impact farm and allied sectors in terms of yield reduction.The IMD, while releasing a monthly weather outlook for February, also predicted ‘below normal’ rainfall over most parts of the country, except some areas of northwest and east-central India.The less rainfall situation during the month may impact the standing Rabi (winter sown) crops in terms of increasing irrigation cost, whereas the ‘above normal’ temperatures in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan could lead to “forced maturity” of crops like wheat and barley, leading to sterile spikelets and chaffy grains, resulting in yield reduction.“The crop advisories and impacts have been prepared by us in association with the department of agriculture, for which farmers need to be prepared,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra while sharing the likely impact of ‘above normal’ temperatures on agriculture.He said, “Oilseeds and pulses such as mustard, chickpea, lentil, and field pea may show early flowering and premature maturity, resulting in poor pod development, reduced seed size and lower yields.”Warmer conditions may also favour rapid multiplication of aphids and othersucking pests, impacting standing crops. Vegetable crops such as potato, onion, garlic, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage, and peas may also be adversely affected during critical stages like tuber initiation, bulb development, flowering, and fruit setting.IMD shared that the elevated temperatures can induce bolting in onion and garlic, reduce tuber bulking in potato, cause flower drop in tomato, and deteriorate cole crops, thereby lowering yield and market value.“Horticultural crops such as mango, citrus, banana, and grapes may experience earlyflowering, uneven fruit set and increased fruit drop. ‘Above normal’ temperatures may also reduce chilling accumulation in temperate fruits like apple, pear and peach, leading to irregular flowering and poor fruit development,” said the Met department in its Agromet advisory.It also underlined the impact on livestock and poultry, saying they may experience heat stress, resulting in reduced feed intake, decline in milk yield and egg production, and increased susceptibility to diseases if adequate cooling and hydration measures are not adopted.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicted ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month. ‘below normal” cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India.

"After Supreme Court rap and ministry reminders, 65 medical colleges still off NMC records on intern stipends: RTI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-supreme-court-rap-and-ministry-reminders-65-medical-colleges-still-off-nmc-records-on-intern-stipends-rti/articleshow/127831428.cms,"Representative AI image

NEW DELHI: Even after sharp observations from the Supreme Court and repeated reminders from the Union health ministry, the National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns, with 65 medical colleges still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.On October 28, 2025, the Supreme Court of India took note of a public notice issued earlier by the NMC on July 11, directing medical colleges to upload details of stipend payments to interns within seven days. The court observed that although the regulator had sought the information, it appeared to be “dragging its feet”, as no action seemed to have been taken against non-compliant institutions. The bench expressed hope that the NMC would act on its own warning at least by the next date of hearing.Following the court’s observations, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare wrote to the NMC on November 3, asking it to examine the matter and take appropriate action. With no response forthcoming, the ministry sent a reminder on December 16.Earlier, in its July 11 public notice, the NMC had warned that failure to comply with directions on stipend disclosure would attract regulatory action, including show-cause notices, financial penalties, withdrawal of course recognition and suspension of admissions.Responding to queries, NMC officials said that out of 764 medical colleges in the country, 595 are eligible to train interns and are required to pay stipends. Around 560 colleges have submitted stipend details, while about 35 remain in default. Officials said the commission has issued multiple reminders, filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on November 11, 2025, and issued a show-cause notice on November 3, 2025, warning of action under the NMC Act. They added that responses from defaulting colleges are being examined and a final list will be placed before the Undergraduate Medical Education Board for action as per rules.However, the RTI reply dated January 19 stated that about 65 medical colleges were yet to furnish stipend details. The reply did not clarify whether this higher number reflected an earlier stage of data compilation or included institutions not eligible to train interns.RTI activist Dr Babu KV, however, said the RTI response does not indicate that any regulatory action has been initiated so far against defaulting colleges, despite the Supreme Court’s observations and repeated communications from the health ministry.","The National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns. 65 medical colleges are still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.

India Can Be Pivotal In Peace And Two-State Solution, Says Palestine Ambassador

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian, and reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.The minister met the PM as a member of a delegation of the foreign ministers of Arab countries who are in India for the second India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. The meeting saw external affairs minister S Jaishankar asserting that the countries targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves.According to an Indian readout, Modi conveyed his appreciation for the important role played by the Arab League in supporting efforts towards regional peace and stability.“The Arab world is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood, linked by deep civilisational bonds, vibrant people-to-people connections and enduring brotherly ties, as well as a shared commitment to peace, progress and stability. Confident that enhanced cooperation in technology, energy, trade and innovation will unlock new opportunities and take the partnership to new heights,” said Modi in a post on X.Highlighting the “humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”, the Palestinian minister told Modi Palestine values India’s principled support for Palestinian rights under international law.According to external affairs ministry, the PM outlined his vision for the India-Arab partnership in the years ahead and reaffirmed India’s commitment to further deepen cooperation in trade and investment, energy, technology, healthcare and other priority areas, for the mutual benefit of our peoples.“India has been a long-standing development partner for Palestine. This has been rendered both bilaterally and through UN agencies. India has so far given assistance worth USD 170 million. Of these, projects worth USD 40 million are under implementation,” said a source.In the foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar strongly raised the issue of cross-border terrorism saying it’s particularly unacceptable because it violates the basic principles of international relations and diplomacy. He also told the Arab foreign ministers societies targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves and will understandably exercise it. “It is essential that we strengthen international cooperation to combat what is a global scourge. Zero-tolerance for terrorism must be an uncompromising universal norm,” he said.He also said the changing landscape in West Asia has implications for India’s relations with the Arab world as well and taking forward the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict was a widely shared priority.“Various countries have made policy declarations on the peace plan, individually or collectively.

New Delhi: Days after India and European Union clinched what has been termed as ‘mother of all trade deals’, CJI Surya Kant on Saturday wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system in the country. Referring to the uncertain business atmosphere in the world, apparently because of arbitrary import tariffs imposed by the US on various countries, CJI Kant said, “Today, we face a world transformed by uncertainty.”“The forces of disruption and geopolitical tension threaten to destabilise the very framework of international cooperation. In such a world, France-India partnership is not a luxury, it is a lifeline.”Addressing the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Paris Bar Association, the CJI said that for foreign enterprises engaging with their Indian counterparts, India’s legal ecosystem offers clarity. “All that one would have to do is draft well-defined arbitration clauses, select reputable institutions or neutral seats if appropriate and trust that India’s courts will respect the sanctity of arbitral agreements and awards,” he said.CJI Kant said SC provides a safety net against any biased arbitral awards that may adversely impact foreign companies operating in India. “SC has made it clear that while arbitral autonomy must be respected, the judiciary cannot relinquish its supervisory role when natural justice is at stake.” “In this context, SC has adopted a calibrated approach of minimal judicial intervention in its role as guardian of credibility, where, for instance, domestic awards may be set aside if bias, corruption or serious procedural deficiencies are proven,” he said.Indian laws encourage pre-litigation mediation. “This approach reflects global best practice: to resolve differences before they ripen into full-fledged litigation, preserving business relationships and reducing strain on judicial systems,” he said.",CJI Surya Kant wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system.

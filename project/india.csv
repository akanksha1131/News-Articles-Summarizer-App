‘Protecting Rohingyas And Bangladeshis’: BJP MP Sambit Patra Slams Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

JALPAIGURI/KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee Saturday made a fervent appeal to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant to safeguard democracy and ensure that investigative agencies do not defame citizens.""Our safety, security, history, geography, and boundaries must all be protected. The media should not conduct trials before cases are finalised... We are under your custody. You are the guardians of the Constitution,"" Mamata told the CJI during the inauguration of Jalpaiguri circuit bench of Calcutta high court.CJI Kant appreciated the vision of Calcutta high court and the state govt in setting up a circuit bench in Jalpaiguri in 2019, noting that before its establishment, people from the region had to travel nearly 600 km to Kolkata in pursuit of justice. ""Today, it has its own home. This building is designed as a sophisticated synthesis of tradition and 21st-century digital agility. It stands as a testament to judicial decentralisation,"" he said.Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, who also attended the function, said Jalpaiguri circuit bench would be equipped with the latest technology, adding that ""justice should not just happen but should also be seen to happen."" He stressed the Centre's e-courts project, for which Rs 7,210 crore has been allocated in Phase III.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee Saturday made a fervent appeal to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has sought an explanation from a trial judge posted in Aligarh for allegedly citing a non-existent provision of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, while summoning an accused.In the order dated April 30, 2024, the then special judge, SC/ST Act, Aligarh, invoked ""Section 3(2)(5)"" of the SC/ST Act - a provision that does not exist in the statute, the counsel for the petitioner in the HC contended.The order was challenged by the accused in the case, Rajiv Bajaj, in the HC, which on Jan 14 sought an explanation from the special judge and fixed Jan 30 as the next date of hearing.Justice Praveen Kumar Giri at the HC, who passed the order, also said if any warrant had been issued against the applicant, it shall be kept in abeyance till then. The HC expressed serious concern over the manner in which judicial power was exercised, observing that such casual and careless orders had grave consequences for an individual's personal liberty.According to the applicant, he was falsely implicated in a case under SC/ST Act and the criminal proceedings were the outcome of a property dispute that arose after he was allotted a piece of land declared industrial by Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation.The complainant had accused the applicant of assault and offences under the SC/ST Act, following which the judicial magistrate, Aligarh, directed the registration of an FIR.Pursuant to the magistrate's order, the police registered an FIR under relevant provisions of IPC and SC/ST Act and carried out an investigation, concluding that no prima facie case was made out against the accused. Dissatisfied with this outcome, the complainant filed a petition in the special court challenging the closure report.Thereafter, the special judge (SC/ST Act), Aligarh, treated the matter as a complaint case and proceeded to record the statements of the complainant and witnesses under Sections 200 and 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Subsequently, the special judge summoned the accused to face trial.","Allahabad high court has sought an explanation from a trial judge posted in Aligarh.

PM Modi Targets Mamata, Declares 'Asli Poribortan' In Malda, Says Bengal Needs BJP For Development

KOLKATA/MALDA: PM Narendra Modi brought up the issue of recurring violence in Bengal's Murshidabad during his rally in neighbouring Malda district Saturday, specifying demographic imbalance and infiltration as the underlying causes.Murshidabad's Beldanga continued to see vandalism as highways and railway tracks were blocked for the second day in protest against continuing violence against Bengalis in Jharkhand and Bihar.""Infiltration is impacting local culture and language and riots in districts like Murshidabad and Malda are on the rise because of this. You have to break the nexus of infiltrators and those in office,"" Modi said at the rally, about 150km from the violence epicentre, adding ""demographic balance"" was being ""disturbed at a few places"".""Every developed nation is driving out infiltrators. It's essential in states like Bengal. But that's not possible as long as TMC is in office,"" he said, blaming ""TMC's syndicates"" for the mess. Modi blamed ""TMC's goons"" for attacks on media personnel in Beldanga. ""They have behaved indecently with a woman journalist. No one takes cognizance of women's plight in Bengal.""The PM moved on to BJP's pre-poll concerns, trying to assure Matuas and Namasudras the Constitution had given them the right to stay here.""CAA has given them full security,"" he said. BJP has faced internal dissent in the Matua belts of North 24 Parganas and Nadia, with party MPs and MLAs often speaking in different voices and the community hitting the streets to protest against their ""victimisation"" in SIR. TMC seniors, including CM Mamata Banerjee, have visited these areas to address concerns. A person from the community died this week, prompting his family to blame ""SIR worries"".Modi sought to portray TMC as a party of ""the cruel and corrupt"". ""They are Bengal's enemies. They are busy filling up their pockets,"" he said, adding TMC's days were numbered. He alluded to corruption allegations during flood relief, slamming TMC for ""looting even during a crisis"". ""Bengal will reach new heights by the ideals of Rishitulya Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay,"" he said. Modi's ""Bankim-da"" address in Parliament a few weeks ago had prompted Trinamool to allege Modi and BJP were ""culturally alien"" to Bengal.Modi inaugurated rail and road infrastructure projects worth Rs 3,250 crore after flagging off a Vande Bharat sleeper train linking Howrah and Kamakhya and four Amrit Bharat Express trains.He blamed TMC for lack of investment in industry and farmers, alleging this was fuelling migration, and said it was the only state where people were not allowed benefits of Ayushman Bharat.","PM Narendra Modi says Bengal needs BJP for development.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

US Lawmakers Name India As Strategic Partner, Dismiss Pakistan As Ally And Flag China As Top Threat

NEW DELHI: Amid questions over Washington’s outreach to Islamabad in recent months, senior US lawmakers moved to clear the air, stressing that India — not Pakistan — remains central to America’s long-term strategic vision in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.Speaking at a discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), representative Rich McCormick underlined India’s importance to global stability.“There is no more important friend that we’re going to need for the future of not just the United States and India, but for the entire stability of the world, than India,” he said, pointing to “the commonality we have in the way we look at economics and freedom and advancement of a people.”McCormick also highlighted the strength of economic ties between the two countries. “Pakistan is a country with 300 million people. But you don't see it bringing investments into America. India not only take investment, it also brings investments into the United States,” he said.Stressing the broader importance of the relationship, McCormick warned, “If America embraces Indians as friends, we will have peace and prosperity.If we alienate them, it is going to be big trouble for all of us.”His remarks come amid strains in bilateral ties following the Trump administration’s decision to impose steep 50% tariffs over India’s purchase of Russian oil. Relations have also faced friction over issues such as US immigration policy and President Donald Trump’s claim of having ended the India–Pakistan conflict in May last year.Representative Ami Bera echoed the message, saying routine diplomatic engagement with Pakistan should not be mistaken for a strategic shift. “We’re not creating a strategic partnership with Pakistan,” Bera said.“You don’t see American companies making multibillion-dollar investments in Pakistan. That’s all happening in India,” he said, adding that investors clearly understand US priorities.While noting that India follows an independent foreign policy, McCormick said Washington understands New Delhi’s decisions.

When India buys cheap Russian oil, America hates that. But he is doing it in the best interest of his country.”The renewed emphasis on the partnership comes as Washington and New Delhi work to finalise a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement.

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

Composer A R Rahman's claims that he possibly faced instances of ""communal"" discrimination in the last eight years in Bollywood caused an outcry on Saturday. During an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman was asked, "". ..today there's a lot of discrimination against the Tamil community within Bollywood. What was it like in the 1990s. Did you ever face...""Before the question was completed, Rahman answered, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff. Maybe God concealed all this stuff (laughed). I never felt all those..."" before he went on to say, ""Past eight years, maybe, because the power shift has happened... people who are not creative have the power now to decide things. And this might have been a communal thing also, but not in my face. But I would hear like Chinese whispers that this happened. And they booked you and the music company went and funded the movie and got five composers. And I said, 'Oh, that's great. Rest for me'.""The answer put out verbatim suggested there was a possible communal angle to some producers preferring other musicians. The interview said “you’re very proud of the soundtrack of ‘Chhaava’ and it is a really good soundtrack, but it is a divisive film.”The composer said, “It is… I think it cashed on divisiveness. But I think the core of it is to show bravery.”Interestingly, A R Rahman said that the director insisted on him working for the project. In his words, “The director, I told him like, ‘why do you need me for this?’ He said, ‘We need only you for this’.” ‘Chhaava’, directed by Laxman Utekar, was among biggest hits of 2025.The maestro has won a clutch of National Awards for best music; more recently for ‘Kaatru Veliyidai’ (Tamil, 2017) and ‘Mom’ (Hindi, 2017) and ‘Ponniyin Selvan 1’ (Tamil, 2022).Writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar sought to play down the controversy. Speaking to IANS, Akhtar said, “People in Mumbai have great respect for him. Maybe they think he has got busy with the West (producers). Or they think he is busier with his big shows. Small producers are also scared to approach him. I don’t think there is any communal element.”Bollywood singer Shaan also said there’s unlikely to be any communal angle to the situation. He told IANS, “I have sung so much over the years, yet even I don’t get work at times. But I don’t take it personally, because it is a personal matter; everyone has their own thinking and their own preferences… Rahman saab has a signature style and he is a great composer. His number of fans hasn’t gone down, but are increasing. I don’t think there is any communal or minority angle in music. Music doesn’t work that way.”","A R Rahman was asked about discrimination against the Tamil community in Bollywood. He said, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff.

What went against Thackerays

Another page was added to India’s political history on Friday, capturing the event that will echo through the corridors of power and serve as a reminder that even a slight strategic misstep can unravel a hold on power built over decades.Having first lost the father-founded Shiv Sena, Uddhav Thackeray has now ceded his last power citadel, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a civic fortress once ruled unhindered by Bal Thackeray. In Asia's richest civic polls, the Thackeray ""brand"" of politics had one of its key equities missing. Hindutva.While Uddhav Thackeray never expressed hostility towards Hindutva, even after aligning with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s NCP, he struggled to step into his father’s shoes in carrying the ideological banner, which Eknath Shinde wore on his sleeve after splitting the party in the 2023 rebellion.By contrast, Uddhav’s attempt to reset the party’s ideological compass by leaning heavily on Marathi manoos and regional pride, and to give it momentum by aligning with his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray, ultimately ended in a damp squib.The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) combine had framed the BMC polls as a battle to “save the Marathi manoos” and Mumbai, projecting the contest as both an assertion of regional pride and a referendum on the Thackeray legacy.The reunion of Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray after nearly two decades was billed as an acid test for the Thackeray brand.While sections of the Marathi electorate did rally behind the cousins, the consolidation fell short of what was required to retain control of the civic body.The ‘save Marathis’ narrative appeared to have a limited electoral pull. The combine managed to hold on to pockets of south and central Mumbai and parts of the western and eastern suburbs, including Dadar-Mahim, Worli, Dindoshi, Bhandup, Vikhroli and Bandra East.However, it failed to make inroads into BJP-dominated constituencies such as Colaba, Bandra West, Andheri West, Borivli, and Dahisar. Political observers noted that a significant section of the city’s upwardly mobile Maharashtrian voters, particularly in the western suburbs, gravitated towards the BJP.The underperformance of Shiv Sena (UBT) was compounded by the MNS’s poor showing. The MNS ended up in single digits, dragging down the overall Thackeray tally and underlining the limits of the reunion’s electoral impact.In September, Uddhav Thackeray himself had described the BMC election as a decisive test. Sena (UBT) contested 163 seats, the MNS 53, while the BJP fielded candidates in 137 wards and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena in 90.BJP-led Mahayuti crossed the halfway mark of 114 in the 227-member body, but not by much. BJP won 89 seats and Shinde's Shiv Sena 29 to gain a narrow lead. In effect, the BJP will need Eknath Shinde's backing for big decisions.The Uddhav-Raj Thackeray combine won 71 seats (Uddhav's Sena winning 65 and Raj Thackeray's MNS taking 6), retaining a large chunk of wards in the city's Marathi heartland.Although Sena (UBT) did receive backing from Muslim voters, with two candidates from the community winning, the support was far weaker than in the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections, largely because the Congress was no longer part of the alliance.When Bal Thackeray founded the Shiv Sena in 1966, the party was not conceived as a Hindutva platform. Its political grammar was rooted firmly in Marathi identity and regional assertion. The Sena positioned itself as the voice of the Marathi manoos in an increasingly cosmopolitan Bombay, railing against perceived economic and cultural marginalisation.Its early campaigns focused on securing jobs for locals, resisting the dominance of South Indian migrants in the city’s clerical and industrial workforce, and asserting linguistic and cultural primacy. Hindu nationalism, at this stage, was peripheral rather than foundational.This began to change as India’s political landscape evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s. The slow erosion of Congress dominance, coupled with the rise of the BJP, altered the ideological marketplace.The mobilisation around the Ram Janmabhoomi movement created space for a more assertive Hindu political identity, particularly in urban centres. Bal Thackeray, a keen reader of political mood and mass sentiment, consciously pivoted to occupy this space.By the early 1990s, especially during the period surrounding the Babri Masjid movement, Hindutva had moved from the margins to the centre of the Sena’s politics. The party formally aligned with the BJP, and Bal Thackeray emerged as one of the most unapologetic and influential mass leaders of the Hindutva movement.Crucially, he did not abandon Marathi identity in this shift; instead, he layered Hindutva over Marathi asmita, fusing the two into a single, emotionally charged political narrative.This fusion proved potent. It gave the Shiv Sena ideological clarity, street-level mobilisation, and cross-community appeal within Mumbai’s Hindu electorate. Bal Thackeray did not inherit Hindutva as a founding principle; he evolved into it. His political success lay in recognising that Marathi pride alone had limits, and that when combined with Hindutva, it could be transformed into a durable and expansive political brand.Unlike his father, Uddhav Thackeray did not abandon Hindutva in one decisive moment. His departure was incremental and tactical, shaped more by political compulsion than ideological conviction. For much of his early political career, Uddhav remained within the broad Hindutva framework laid down by Bal Thackeray, often projecting himself as a custodian rather than an innovator of the Sena’s legacy.The first visible shift came after the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, when Uddhav broke with the BJP and stitched together an ""unlikely alliance"" with the Congress and the NCP.The formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government required ideological accommodation, and Hindutva, once the Sena’s most assertive plank, was deliberately softened. The rhetoric gave way to the language of governance, secular inclusivity and constitutionalism, signalling a recalibration rather than an outright rejection.This softening deepened during Uddhav’s tenure as chief minister. While he never publicly disowned Hindutva, he also stopped aggressively articulating it. Temple politics, street mobilisation, and confrontational cultural messaging, hallmarks of Bal Thackeray’s style, were conspicuously absent.Instead, Uddhav leaned into administrative legitimacy and coalition management, seeking to broaden the Sena’s appeal beyond its traditional base.However, this ideological dilution created a vacuum. The Sena’s core voters, long accustomed to ideological clarity, were left uncertain about what the party stood for. That ambiguity proved costly when Eknath Shinde split the party and openly reclaimed Hindutva as its defining identity.By positioning himself as the inheritor of Bal Thackeray’s ideological legacy, Shinde offered continuity at a moment when Uddhav appeared to be reimagining the Sena without fully replacing its ideological core.In the end, Uddhav’s deviation from Hindutva was not about renunciation but about subtraction without substitution. And in a political ecosystem built on legacy and emotional mobilisation, that proved to be a strategic miscalculation.The reunion of Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray ahead of the BMC polls was less a moment of sentiment and more an act of political necessity. For nearly two decades, the Thackeray cousins had travelled divergent paths, divided by personal rivalry and competing claims over the Marathi political space.But the BMC election altered the calculus. Having lost the Shiv Sena and facing a weakened organisational base, Uddhav Thackeray needed a fresh axis of mobilisation. Raj Thackeray, struggling with electoral irrelevance and a shrinking footprint, needed relevance. The reunion was thus driven by a convergence of weakness rather than shared resurgence.Together, they sought to revive the original Thackeray ""brand of politics"" that included Marathi manoos, regional pride, and cultural ownership of Mumbai.The pitch was deliberately crafted to bypass Hindutva and instead reclaim the emotional terrain of Marathi asmita, projecting the BMC polls as a fight to “save Mumbai” and protect Maharashtrian interests. The symbolism of the cousins sharing a platform after 20 years was meant to signal unity, closure, and a consolidated Marathi vote bank.Both the Thackerays, recalling the 1961 Samyukta Maharashtra movement in which their grandfather, late Prabodhankar Thackeray, participated, claimed that the BJP was planning to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra and merge it with Gujarat.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who led the BJP’s campaign, refuted the charge.Speaking in Nashik on January 11 and then again at Shivtirth in Mumbai the next day, Fadnavis made it a point to repeatedly refute these claims and ensured that Thackerays’ Mumbai and Marathi “” (pride) and “” (existence) card does not stick this time around.Thackerays’ arguments about growing unemployment and neglect of “son-of the soils” were counter-punched with a “Global Mumbai” narrative by Fadnavis. Also, BJP fielded over 90 Marathi candidates for the BMC and announced that the next mayor of BMC will be Marathi.The Thackerays' push for regional identity turned so intense that Thackeray mockingly referred to the BJP leader K Annamalai as “rasmalai” and questioned his standing to speak on issues related to Mumbai.Thackeray attacked Annamalai for suggesting that Mumbai is an “international city”. He also referred to his uncle Bal Thackeray's ""Hatao lungi, bajao pungi” slogan from the 1960s and 1970s.“One rasmalai came from Tamil Nadu… what is your connection to here? Hatao lungi, bajao pungi,” Thackeray said at a joint UBT–MNS rally in Mumbai.Additionally, Thackeray also said that he would “kick” people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they “try to impose Hindi”.In July last year, the Thackeray brothers held an ""Awaz Marathicha"" rally to oppose what they called the state government's bid to ""impose"" Hindi over Maharashtra.""We have come together to stay together"", Uddhav Thackeray said while addressing the gathering.Raj Thackeray launched a veiled attack on Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and said the CM did what even Balasaheb Thackeray could not -- bring the two estranged brothers together.Thackerays also shared a hug at the joint rally after the Maharashtra government scrapped two Government Resolutions (GRs) to introduce Hindi as the third language.""The Maharashtra Government rolled back the decision on the three-language formula due to the strong unity shown by Marathi people. This decision was a precursor to the plan of separating Mumbai from Maharashtra,"" the MNS chief said with Uddhav seated on the stage.Attacking the BJP-led Mahayuti during his address, Raj Thackeray said: ""How did they suddenly bring in the imposition of Hindi without any discussion? For what purpose, and for whom? This is an injustice to young children. Without any consultation, you’re trying to force it upon us. You may rule the assembly - but we rule the streets.""However, the reunion came with structural limits. While it generated attention and nostalgia, it failed to translate into a city-wide electoral wave.The BMC verdict laid bare the limits of legacy politics in a city that has steadily changed its political expectations. The Thackerays managed to revive old memories and emotional connect through unity, rallies and a renewed push for Marathi identity, but nostalgia alone could not compensate for the absence of a clear and contemporary ideological anchor.Mumbai’s electorate has grown more aspirational and diverse, and it appears less willing to rally behind a single, narrow identity pitch.For Uddhav Thackeray, the defeat completed a slow political unravelling, from losing the father-founded Shiv Sena to ceding control of the civic institution that once symbolised Bal Thackeray’s unquestioned authority.For Raj Thackeray, the outcome reinforced the challenge of converting sharp rhetoric into electoral relevance. Their reunion sent a message of solidarity, but solidarity without organisational depth and ideological clarity fell short.Ultimately, the BMC result was not merely about seats or numbers. It signalled a deeper shift in Mumbai’s politics, where legacy and sentiment must now contend with a demand for sharper purpose and direction.","BJP-Alliance Sweeps BMC Polls, Thackeray Reunion Flops; Rahul Slams EC Over ‘Ink Mark’ Row.

Pawars meet in Pune



NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday dismissed suggestions that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had been ""rejected"" on his home turf, saying voters had instead endorsed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and the BJP’s governance model.“I will not say that people have rejected dada, rather they have accepted the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the BJP and us,” Fadnavis said, as quoted by PTI.Fadnavis' remarks came a day after the party’s sweeping victory in key civic polls.Ajit Pawar, popularly known as ‘dada’, had allied with his uncle Sharad Pawar’s faction of the NCP for the civic elections in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, long considered Pawar family strongholds. The alliance, however, failed to stem the BJP’s surge.Also Read: Mumbai BMC Election Results 2026 Live Updates: Shinde Sena moves newly elected corporators to luxury hotel Asked who now held the title of ‘dada’ in Pune politics, Fadnavis replied that authority ultimately rested with the electorate. “The people of Pune are the dada, and we are their sevaks,” he said.Thanking voters for what he described as a “landslide” mandate, Fadnavis said, “I thank the voters of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad for reposing their faith in the BJP and giving us a landslide victory.I am not merely thanking them; I am indebted to them.” He added that while the results were encouraging, they also carried responsibility. “While we are happy with this mandate, it also reminds us of our responsibility towards these cities. ”The campaign had seen Ajit Pawar attack BJP-led civic administrations over alleged irregularities and stalled development between 2017 and 2022. Fadnavis, however, said the results had settled speculation around the contest, noting that they were “beyond the expectations of many people”.Also Read: BMC and other Maharashtra civic poll results 2026: Top 10 winners and losers He said voters had placed their trust in the BJP’s development vision and PM Modi’s leadership, adding, “We will have to work even harder to live up to the trust that people have placed in us. I will ensure that the vision we presented before the people is translated into reality immediately after the mayor is elected.”Ajit Pawar did not attend a cabinet meeting in Mumbai earlier in the day. Addressing his absence, Fadnavis said, “I had met Ajit Pawar on the voting day (January 15) when he told me that he would not be attending the cabinet meeting.”Pawar on Saturday also met his uncle Sharad Pawar. Ajit Pawar said the meeting was incidental, linked to the inauguration of an agriculture exhibition in Baramati, and stressed family unity amid merger speculation.“An agriculture exhibition was inaugurated today, and I had come to Baramati for that. I was told that (Sharad) Pawar saheb is also at his residence. So I went to his house and we all later headed for the exhibition,” he said.“We are together (as Pawar family). We go to each other’s places at required times,” he added.Congratulating the BJP, he said his party would review the defeat. Pawar dismissed allegations over EVMs and said setbacks should prompt reflection rather than discouragement, adding that alliance decisions for local polls rest with local leadership.“Voters are important, and every political party must continue its efforts. The BJP has achieved significant success, and I congratulate the party for its performance. These civic polls were fought by the BJP under the leadership of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, and the other parties had to face defeat,” he said.The BJP secured 119 of 165 seats in the Pune civic body, while the Ajit Pawar-led NCP won 27 seats and the NCP (SP) managed just three. In Pimpri Chinchwad, the BJP won 84 of 128 seats, comfortably crossing the majority mark.","Devendra Fadnavis dismisses suggestions that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had been ""rejected"" on his home turf.

India's Silent Warriors On Kartavya Path Bring Army’s Battle-Tested Animals To Republic Day Parade

NEW DELHI: This time, 150 years of Vande Mataram will be the theme of the Republic Day parade on Jan 26. A series of paintings created by Tejendra Kumar Mitra in 1923, illustrating the verses of ‘Vande Mataram’ and published in the ‘Bande Mataram Album’ (1923), will be displayed as view-cutters along Kartavya Path during the parade. Even band performances on the theme ‘Vande Mataram’ will be organised from Jan 19 to 26 by Indian Army , Navy, IAF, Indian Coast Guard, and other paramilitary forces in R-Day events across india. The performance venues will also include the ancestral home and birthplace of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay at Kanthalpara, Naihati, North 24 Parganas District, West Bengal, currently known as ‘Bankim Bhawan Gaveshana Kendra’. Even floral decorations at the parade dais will be based on the Vande Mataram theme.Among the seven marching contingents of the Army, the centre of attraction will be the animal contingent comprising Zansker ponies, Bacterian camel and native Indian-bred dogs like Mudhol Hound, Rampur Hound and Rajapalayam with their handlers and the newly-raised Bhairav contingent.Robotic mules and unmanned ground vehicles, Shaktiban artillery regiment, Brahmos cruise missiles, Akash missile, Drone Shakti and Glacier all terrain vehicles will be the key attractions in the mechanised columns.The Indian Army will be represented by a Mounted Column of 61 Cavalry & Battle Array Formation. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and President of the European Council, Antonio Costa, will be the chief guests at the parade.A total 18 marching contingents and 13 bands will take part in the show of the country’s military might on Kartavya Path. The flypast will showcase Rafale, Su-30 and MiG-29 fighters, P8i reconnaissance aircraft, C-295 tactical transport planes, Apache, LCH (Light Combat Helicopter), ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter) and Mi-17 choppers in different formations.Around 10,000 people from all walks of the society have been invited to witness the parade as special guests, including people with exemplary work in technology, innovation, start-ups, self-help groups, and best performers.A total of 30 tableaux, including 17 from states and UTs, 13 from ministries, departments and services, will roll down the Kartavya Path this year.

‘BJP Won By Betrayal’: Uddhav Thackeray’s First Reaction On Mumbai Civic Poll Results

NEW DELHI: Alleging intimidation, coercion and unprecedented political pressure, Shiv Sena (UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday launched a scathing attack against the Mahayuti over the BMC elections , calling the January 15 civic polls a “strange” contest fought as a matter of political survival by his opponents.Addressing a press conference, Thackeray alleged that the ruling alliance left no method unused to secure a victory. “This election was very strange. It felt like this was a life-and-death election for them. They opted for all methods, from cash to kidnapping our candidates; they forced candidates to withdraw their nominations,” he said.The UBT president also raised questions over the voting process and claimed he had received several complaints from citizens about their names missing from the voter lists. He said the results at many locations were “surprising” and did not match ground-level expectations.“Where did those numbers come from? Was it from some party office? Before counting numbers were seen on TV. In future, there will be no EVM, and the direct results will be declared. I have received several complaints from voters that their names were missing from the voter list. At various locations, the results are surprising.I had doubts about the exit polls,” said Thackeray.Despite the Mahayuti alliance of the BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena clinching a majority, Thackeray said the outcome reflected the resilience of Shiv Sena (UBT) on the ground. Thanking voters who stood firm despite alleged attempts to intimidate them, he said, “Voters are the saviours of democracy,” and added that those who were not scared showed that the “strength of Shiv Sena UBT” remains intact.Thackeray expressed deep gratitude to citizens who backed the Shiv Shakti Alliance, a first-time collaboration between his faction of the Shiv Sena and his cousin Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). He also apologised for not being able to campaign in all areas.“Yesterday, election results were announced. I could not visit many locations to campaign, but we got a good response at several places. I would at first apologise to voters where I was unable to reach. I thank those who voted for Shiv Shakti Alliance (with MNS),” he said.“The wish to have our Mayor wasn’t fulfilled, but the results have definitely shown the strength of Shiv Sena UBT,” Thackeray added.The 2026 BMC elections marked a historic political shift, ending nearly three decades of Thackeray family dominance over India’s richest civic body. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, while the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance crossed the halfway mark with 118 seats.Shiv Sena (UBT) secured 65 seats, polling 7,17,736 votes, which accounted for 13.13 per cent of the total votes cast. The MNS won six seats with 74,946 votes and a 1.37 per cent vote share. The Indian National Congress secured 24 seats, polling 2,42,646 votes, or 4.44 per cent of the vote share.Meanwhile, following the Mahayuti’s victory, political activity has intensified in Mumbai. Sources said the Shinde-led Shiv Sena has moved its newly elected corporators to a hotel in Bandra amid power negotiations. The party is also likely to demand the Mayor’s post in the BMC, reportedly as part of celebrations marking the centenary year of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, whose 100th birth anniversary falls on January 23.","The 2026 BMC elections marked a historic political shift, ending nearly three decades of Thackeray family dominance over India’s richest civic body.

NEW DELHI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape. Held after a delay of nearly four years due to legal challenges and prolonged administrator rule, the elections across 27 municipal corporations and 2,869 seats were widely seen as a test of governance credibility and of existence for some.The verdict was emphatic. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged as the dominant force in urban Maharashtra, winning 25 of the 29 municipal corporations across the state. In Mumbai, the Mahayuti crossed the majority threshold in the 227-member BMC, with the BJP seizing over 89 wards alone in its favour.With this, there ended the Shiv Sena 's uninterrupted control of the civic body since 1997 and marked the BJP’s first real capture of India’s richest municipal corporation.The biggest and the obvious winner of the civic polls verdict is Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The BJP has won over 89 wards of the BMC on its own, compared to 82 in 2017. In key wards such as Mulund West (Ward 103), the BJP defeated the MNS by a margin exceeding 12,000 votes.The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Navi Mumbai with 65 seats, Kalyan-Dombivli (50), Mira-Bhayandar (78), Nashik (72), Panvel (55), Pune (119), Pimpri-Chinchwad (84), Solapur (87), Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (57), Nanded (45) and Nagpur (102).The saffron party stunned the Pawars in the Pune polls, clinching 119 seats, with Ajit Pawar-led NCP coming in distant second with 27 and its ally NCP (SP) getting three seats, while the Congress managed 15 seats.In the 151-member Nagpur civic body, the BJP held sway, getting 102, while the Congress bagged a mere 34.Nashik saw the BJP bagging 72 seats, Shiv Sena 26, Shiv Sena (UBT) 15, Congress 3 and NCP 4.The BJP's victory streak continued in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where it won 57 seats, followed by Shiv Sena with 15, Congress with one, while other parties registered with the SEC, especially the AIMIM, bagged 33 seats.With the BMC’s annual budget exceeding Rs 60,000 crore, control over Mumbai’s civic machinery also enhances the BJP’s long-term institutional leverage ahead of the 2029 assembly elections.For the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the civic results offered political validation.Since the 2022 split, the Shinde faction’s central challenge has been legitimacy. The civic verdict, particularly in Mumbai and Thane, strengthened its claim. The party won 399 wards and emerged as the second largest party in Maharashtra civic polls.In Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar, the Shinde faction recorded near-sweeps, reflecting voter preference for continuity in infrastructure delivery over symbolic politics.The BJP–Shiv Sena–NCP Mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in Maharashtra.Despite contesting separately in some cities, the alliance demonstrated effective vote transferability in Mumbai, Nashik, and Nagpur.The alliance won 1,991 of 2,869 wards across Maharashtra.With a major victory, Mahayuti showed how to converted state-level power into grassroots and civic dominance.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) made modest but consequential gains in Maharashtra civic elections.It won 33 seats in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation and bagged a total of 126 seats across Maharashtra.The improved tally in Sambhajinagar marked a clear jump from the 2015 municipal corporation elections, when the party had secured 24 seats.AIMIM also registered gains in several urban pockets across the state.The party has won 21 seats in Malegaon, 14 in Nanded Waghala, 12 in Amravati, 10 in Dhule, 8 in Solapur, and eight in Mumbai. It also secured six seats in Nagpur, three in Akola, two each in Ahilyanagar and Jalna, and five seats in Thane.While these numbers remain small, AIMIM’s presence seems to have fragmented the opposition vote, particularly hurting Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT).When the results of the Maharashtra civic elections were being tallied, one of the most unexpected stories to emerge was not about seats won or wards lost. It was about narrative currency — how a Tamil Nadu BJP leader emerged as a winner without contesting.And it all started with the 'rasmalai' controversy which begun when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.However, Mahayuti won and BJP MPs and supporters were soon having a field on social media, posting photos of 'rasmalai' and mocking Raj Thackeray.The biggest electoral setback was suffered by Uddhav Thackeray. From over 130 BMC seats in 2017, Sena (UBT) fell to 65 seats. Even traditional strongholds such as Gorai and parts of Mahim witnessed defeats.The loss of control of the BMC is a big blow to Uddhav the Sena has always maintained its control over the civic body.His long-anticipated reunion with estranged cousin Raj Thackeray also failed to make any impact on the ground.Overall, the party managed to bag only 155 across the state.The Indian National Congress emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections because the results exposed its near-total erosion in urban politics.In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Congress, which fought in alliance with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), bagged 24 seats, a sharp fall from its already diminished presence in 2017, when it had crossed 30. Across Maharashtra’s 27 municipal corporations, the party managed roughly 324 wards out of 2,869.The Congress, which ran a muted campaign in the run-up to the polls, managed significant victories in Bhiwandi, where it won 30 seats, Chandrapur 27, and Latur 43.In Pune, once a Congress-influenced city, the party was restricted to fewer than five seats out of 162, while in Mumbai it failed to emerge as a serious contender in most wards.In Pune, it was reduced to fewer than five seats. The party which decided to go solo after that Thackeray cousins jouned hands, failed to make any impact in BMC polls where Uddhav's Sena won 72 seats.It seems that lack of a city-specific agenda, factional infighting and minimal national leadership presence during the campaign compounded the decline.For Raj Thackeray, the civic polls reinforced a long-term downward trajectory.The leader joined hands with his cousin Uddhav to keep the BJP at bay. But the results show how he failed miserably.During the election campaign, he tried to appeal around the idea of the 'Marathi Manoos' while invoking Balasaheb Thackeray. This politics of sentiment obviously has deep roots in Maharashtra’s history.He relied on fiery speeches, symbolic gestures and cultural flashpoints to command attention, often targeting migrants, linguistic outsiders, or perceived cultural dilution in Mumbai. Unlike mass welfare or governance-driven politics, his appeal was rooted in 'Marathi asmita'.This, however, failed to resonate with the voters. The MNS failed to secure major wins, while getting only 6 of 227 wards in Mumbai.At the state level, the party managed to get only 13 of 2869 wards.Sharad Pawar emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections as the results exposed the steady erosion of his once-formidable grip over urban and organisational politics.For decades, Pawar was seen as the master strategist of Maharashtra, capable of shaping outcomes even when not in direct power. The civic verdict punctured that perception. The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) failed to make any meaningful impact in the BMC, getting just 1 win in Mumbai wards and remaining marginal in Pune, a city long considered central to Pawar’s political influence.His strategy to join hands with nephew Ajit Pawar for the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections also failed as the BJP secured victory in these bodies.Statewide, the faction’s ward tally was 36 of 2869 wards, far below expectations for a party led by a veteran of his stature.Crucially, Pawar’s traditional role as an alliance-builder also lost relevance. Fragmentation within the opposition and the rise of a dominant Mahayuti alliance reduced his ability to act as a power broker. This time, though reports suggested he wanted the Maha Vikas Agadi to fight as a unit, he failed to keep the parties together, especially after the Thackeray cousins joined hands, pushing Congress to go solo.Despite being part of Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar has emerged as one of the losers this election. During the civic poll campaigns, Ajit Pawar repeatedly hit out at his own Mahayuti allies, Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, exposing visible faultlines within the ruling alliance.As election date approached, he finally decided to unite with his uncle Sharad Pawar to contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections as a united front.His attacks were also unusually sharp for an alliance partner, with Pawar questioning why local bodies under BJP–Shinde control still struggled with water supply, roads and urban planning. In several rallies, he projected his faction as a corrective force within the government rather than a stakeholder in its record. .The civic results however suggest the tactic backfired. Ajit Pawar’s faction underperformed in Pune and Nashik, reinforcing the perception that public sparring with allies during elections diluted his credibility and bargaining power within the Mahayuti rather than strengthening it.Eventually, the Pawar lost their strongholds, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, to BJP with huge margin.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape.

NEW DELHI: India has stepped up diplomatic engagement with Iran seeking consular access and early resolution for the case of 16 Indian crew members on board a merchant vessel detained by Iranian authorities in December last year, the Indian embassy in Tehran said.In a press release on Saturday, the embassy said it was informed around mid-December 2025 about the detention of MT Valiant Roar. The Consulate of India in Bandar Abbas wrote to the Iranian government on December 14 seeking consular access to the crew and has since followed up through diplomatic correspondence and in-person meetings in Bandar Abbas and Tehran, including at the level of the ambassador.“The Iranian authorities were also requested to allow the crew to communicate with their families in India,” the embassy said.The mission said it contacted the UAE-based ship-owning company on December 15 and has remained in touch with its Iran-based agents to ensure food, water and fuel supplies for the vessel, besides pressing for legal representation for the crew in Iranian courts. After being informed of depleting provisions, the mission intervened with the Iranian navy, which arranged emergency food and water supplies in early January.The Indian consulate in Dubai has also been engaging the ship-owning company to ensure regular provisioning and legal support, the embassy said, adding that the case is expected to go through Iran’s judicial process.“However, the Mission and the Consulate continue to press the Iranian authorities to grant early consular access to the crew, and to ensure expeditious completion of the judicial proceedings,” the statement said.Earlier in the day, the father of one of the detained crew members appealed to Indian authorities for urgent intervention. Mukesh Mehta said his son Ketan, a third engineer on board the tanker operated by Prime Tanker LLC, Dubai, was among those detained after the vessel was intercepted at Bandar Abbas port, reported PTI.He said the family has been living in constant anxiety since learning of the detention and appealed to the government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the ministry of external affairs and the Directorate General of Shipping to take immediate diplomatic steps to secure the crew’s release.Iran on December 13 had seized an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman, claiming it was carrying six million litres of diesel fuel and had 16 crew members from India on board.Iran has frequently announced the boarding of vessels it accuses of illegally transporting fuel, citing smuggling concerns amid low domestic fuel prices. Authorities have denied that such seizures are retaliatory actions against other countries.The Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz remain critical maritime chokepoints, handling nearly 20 per cent of global oil trade, with heightened tensions continuing amid increased regional naval activity and geopolitical friction.","India has stepped up diplomatic engagement with Iran seeking consular access and early resolution for the case of 16 Indian crew members detained by Iranian authorities.

I didn’t object that time, but when I asked for the survey, it wasn’t shown to me,” Jagtap said, as quoted by PTI Videos.In response, the Congress on Saturday issued a showcause notice to Jagtap for indiscipline following his public criticism of Gaikwad and demand for her resignation.",Mumbai Congress recorded its lowest-ever tally in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.

Experts warn: Mass removal of stray dogs could backfire on public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-warn-mass-removal-of-stray-dogs-could-backfire-on-public-health/articleshow/126556050.cms,"Image: IANS

Free-living dogs form stable social groups when food sources, sterilisation, and vaccination coverage remain consistent.

Large-scale removal disrupts these systems, creating territorial vacuums that are rapidly filled by other dogs -- often unvaccinated and unsterilised -- an effect associated with increased dog-bite incidents and heightened disease risk.

Mass removal undermines rabies control by dismantling herd immunity. India’s existing Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (CNVR) framework, when implemented consistently, targets the internationally recognised threshold of vaccinating at least 70% of dogs in a given area.

Data show steep declines in human rabies deaths and dog-bite incidence in areas with sustained sterilisation and vaccination programmes. Abandoning this approach risks reversing hard-earned gains achieved over past two decades.

Mass sheltering, experts argue, compounds the risks. High-density animal housing is globally classified as a biohazard activity, requiring stringent quarantine, disease surveillance, and worker-safety protocols.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass-shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law, destabilise urban ecosystems and impose enormous fiscal costs, without delivering greater public safety.The cautionary note draws on experience of veterans in public health, behavioural science, veterinary medicine and law. Signatories include Chinny Krishna who pioneered India’s Animal Birth Control programme, evolutionary biologist Lee Dugatkin (University of Louisville, US), Anindita Bhadra of IISER Kolkata, public health expert Leena Menghaney, Pushpinder Singh Khera of AIIMS Jodhpur, and Julie Corfmat of Mission Rabies among a host of others. Organisations include International Companion Animal Network (ICAN), Pet Dog Trainers of Europe (PDTE), International Institute for Canine Ethics (IICE) and Bangalore Hundeskole Academy for Research and Canine Studies (BHARCS). Highlights of their analysis:Dugatkin noted claims justifying removal often rest on myths rather than biology. “These dogs have coexisted with humans in India for millennia. Disrupting stable populations based on fear or misinformation ignores everything we know about animal behaviour and disease ecology,” he said.Anthrozoologist Sindhoor Pangal said the debate had become detached from evidence. “Replacing proven, low-cost public-health systems with a mass-detention model is not just unscientific -- it actively increases risk while draining resources that should be strengthening vaccination and disease prevention,” she said.Position statements from IICE highlight that large shelters frequently experience overcrowding, stress-induced immunosuppression, and rapid disease transmission, particularly where enforcement capacity is limited.Free-living dogs play a role in urban ecosystems by scavenging waste and limiting proliferation of rats and other scavengers that can’t be vaccinated or monitored. Sudden dog removal can lead to rodent population explosions linked to diseases such as leptospirosis and plague.Legal experts point out that mass relocation directly contradicts the Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2023, which mandate sterilisation, vaccination, and return to the original territory. Large-scale confinement also raises constitutional and labour-safety concerns, given occupational hazards associated with mass animal housing.","A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court.

A two-judge bench of Supreme Court on Jan 9 pointed to the repeated misuse of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( Pocso ) Act - introduced in 2012 to shield minors from sexual abuse - saying it was increasingly being used to criminalise consensual teenage relationships or to settle personal scores.Hearing a matter related to an Allahabad high court order in a sexual assault case, justices Sanjay Karol and N Kotiswar Singh highlighted how a law designed to protect children can turn into a blunt instrument, threatening to harm those it was meant to safeguard while also eroding public faith in the justice system.The SC bench asked Centre to consider introducing a 'Romeo-Juliet' clause to exempt ""genuine adolescent relationships"" from Pocso's harshest provisions. The court called for a legal carve-out for consensual close-in-age relationships and action against those who misuse the law to ""settle scores"".At the same time, the bench was careful that the moral and legal force of Pocso Act be kept intact. It said the Act was ""the most solemn articulations of justice aimed at protecting the children of today and the leaders of tomorrow"", underlining that the problem lay not with the law's intent but in how it was being applied on the ground.The top court's apprehensions are well-founded, with experts pointing to lasting impacts caused by the misapplication of the law.""In one case we worked with, a 17-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl were in a consensual relationship. While the boy's family opposed it, the girl's family eventually accepted the couple. Due to mandatory reporting, the boy spent several months in an observation home. After his release, the couple went on to live together with the girl's family and are now raising a two-year-old child. However, the impact of the case continues - their son is still struggling to get school admission due to complications in documentation,"" said Sachi Maniar, director of Mumbai-based Ashiyana Foundation, which works with children in the juvenile justice system.""Many cases under Pocso Act involve consensual adolescent relationships. Despite this, it is usually the boys who are sent to observation homes. Many ask, 'Is it wrong to fall in love?', 'Why am I being punished?' and carry a deep sense of betrayal, injustice, and trauma from being institutionalised. Some even say they will never trust relationships again or feel they must avoid girls altogether,"" adds Maniar.The bench went beyond procedural law to address what it described as a deeper crisis around the misuse of Pocso. Quoting earlier judgments, it warned that when a law of ""noble"" intent is twisted into a tool of vendetta, ""the notion of justice itself teeters on the edge of inversion"".The court pointed to two sharply unequal realities. On one side are children who are silenced by fear, stigma or poverty, making justice distant and uncertain. On the other are those ""equipped with privilege, literacy, social and monetary capital"", who can manipulate the law to their advantage. It is this imbalance that has led to consensual adolescent relationships being reframed as criminal offences with family or social disputes getting dragged into court.The judges also reminded lawyers of their ethical duty to act as gatekeepers against frivolous or vindictive litigation, warning that unchecked misuse of powerful criminal laws corrodes public confidence in justice.The 'Romeo-Juliet' clause proposed by Supreme Court is not a new or radical idea. Many countries have brought in close-in-age exemptions to prevent teenagers in consensual relationships from being prosecuted under statutory rape laws simply because one partner is technically a minor.In the US, for instance, at least 43 states have some form of such protection, effectively decriminalising sex between teenagers of a similar age. Canada allows sexual relations between 14- and 15-year-olds and a partner that's older by no more than five years, with a tighter two-year exemption for 12- and 13-year-olds. These provisions are designed to recognise adolescent relationships without opening the door to exploitation.Typically, such laws protect the older partner from arrest if the age difference is within a defined limit and the relationship is consensual. Non-consensual acts remain fully criminal, ensuring that predators cannot hide behind the exemption.However, experts warn that age gaps alone cannot capture the complexity of adolescent consent. As research has noted, focusing only on age ""may mask realities of how informed an adolescent's consent truly was"", making it essential that a minor's testimony and the surrounding circumstances remain central to any legal assessment.Recent reforms, such as in the Philippines, show a global trend towards raising the age of consent while still recognising the reality of teenage relationships.By calling for a Romeo-Juliet clause, Supreme Court is signalling that India's child protection framework needs a more nuanced middle ground - one that distinguishes between abuse and adolescent intimacy, and between predation and peer relationships.If Parliament acts on the court's suggestion, it could prevent thousands of young couples from being dragged into the criminal justice system, while also freeing police and courts to focus on genuine cases of sexual violence against children. At the same time, safeguards would be needed to ensure that such an exemption is not misused to shield coercion or exploitation. For a law as powerful and sensitive as Pocso, Supreme Court's message is clear - protect children fiercely, but do not let the law become a weapon against them.But Anant Kumar Asthana, an advocate who practices child justice and criminal law in Delhi, argues that a Romeo-Juliet clause may not be a ready solution.""The idea of introducing close-in-age exception (Romeo-Juliet clause) in Pocso regime does not fundamentally advance the cause of decriminalisation of consensual or genuine adolescent sexual relations. Instead, it binds judges to one more rigid and mandatory formula that can only be applied in a regulated manner and in a specific set of facts and figures,"" he said.""In a law like Pocso, the chasm between access and abuse can be best navigated in a just and compassionate manner by a trial judiciary that is empowered with widest possible judicial discretion in matters of arrest, bail, trial and sentencing,"" he added. ""Invoking Romeo-Juliet exception can be one of the options that can be legislatively or judicially made available to Pocso judges, but it becomes a problem when this option is put as the only option for exercising judicial discretion. ""","Supreme Court asked Centre to consider introducing a 'Romeo-Juliet' clause to exempt ""genuine adolescent relationships"" from Pocso's harshest provisions. The court called for a legal carve-out for consensual close-in-age relationships and action against those who misuse the law to ""settle scores""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126628802,imgsize-589609,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Cleanliness Crown Cracks As Indore Loses 13 Lives To Poisoned Water And Administrative Lapses

NEW DELHI/INDORE: The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , today met the families of the victims who died due to the consumption of contaminated drinking water in Indore and also those who are undergoing treatment in hospital.Gandhi accused the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh of criminal negligence over the deaths and illnesses caused by contaminated drinking water in the Bhagirathpura area of Indore, saying the government must take responsibility and ensure compensation and assistance to the affected families.After meeting the victims and their families, Gandhi said access to clean drinking water remains a serious issue in the country even today. He alleged that the failure to provide safe drinking water and control pollution reflected the government’s inability to discharge its basic responsibilities.Several people have died and many others have fallen ill after consuming contaminated water in the area, he noted, adding that such incidents were a direct consequence of administrative negligence. “The affected families must be given proper compensation and support,” he demanded.Quoting local residents, the Congress leader said there was still no assured supply of clean drinking water in Bhagirathpura, and that alternative arrangements were temporary and largely symbolic. He warned that once public attention faded, the situation could revert to its earlier state. Residents, he said, were demanding a permanent and systematic solution, which was fully justified.Gandhi said that as Leader of the Opposition, it was his duty to raise the concerns of the affected families and stand with them in their struggle for basic civic amenities.He also questioned the implementation of the Smart City scheme, remarking that this appeared to be the new model of a “Smart City” where citizens did not even have access to clean drinking water. The problem, he said, was not limited to Indore but was prevalent in many cities across the country.Later, in a post on X, Gandhi alleged that the BJP’s “double-engine government” model was marked by poisoned water, air, medicine and land, and that when questions were raised, bulldozers were deployed instead of accountability. He said no one was held responsible for the deaths of the poor, and demanded punishment for those responsible, along with proper treatment and immediate compensation for the victims.",Gandhi accused the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh of criminal negligence over the deaths and illnesses caused by contaminated drinking water in the Bhagirathpura area of Indore.

‘BJP Won By Betrayal’: Uddhav Thackeray’s First Reaction On Mumbai Civic Poll Results

NEW DELHI: Following a sweeping victory for the BJP-Shiv Sena Mahayuti in the BMC elections Eknath Shinde shifted the newly elected corporators to a luxury hotel in Bandra on Saturday as the race for Mumbai’s next mayor intensified.The Shiv Sena contested 90 seats in the Mumbai civic polls and won 29. A senior party leader said the corporators were being shifted to the hotel to help them “refresh” after a hectic election season, but did not specify how long they would stay there.Another party functionary said the move was meant to orient newly elected members and added that the corporators would be housed in the hotel for a couple of days.According to sources, the Shinde Sena is likely to stake claim to the Mayor’s post in India’s richest municipal corporation. The demand is being linked to the centenary year of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, with January 23 marking his 100th birth anniversary.The undivided Shiv Sena had controlled the BMC for the longest period before the party split into two factions in 2022. In the latest civic polls, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance emerged as the single largest bloc, defeating the Thackeray brothers. Official figures show the BJP won 89 seats, while its alliance partner, the Shinde Sena, secured 29 seats.After the Mahayuti’s victory in most of the civic bodies that went to polls, the CM said the alliance would form Mayors in 25 of the 29 municipal corporations.However, discussions on the Mayor’s post cannot begin in any of the 29 municipalities until there is clarity on reservations for each municipality’s Mayor position.Earlier today, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the decision on the Mayor’s post would be taken collectively by him, deputy CM Eknath Shinde, and party leaders. He clarified, “There is no dispute whatsoever on this.”","The Shiv Sena contested 90 seats in the Mumbai civic polls and won 29.

Big relief for Punjab's farmers as Centre has agreed to shift border fence closer to IB: CM Mann,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-relief-for-punjabs-farmers-as-centre-has-agreed-to-shift-border-fence-closer-to-ib-cm-mann/articleshow/126617513.cms,"NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Saturday claimed a major relief for farmers in the state's border belt after the Centre agreed in principle to shift the security fence closer to the International Border.Mann, after his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah, said the move will clear the way for unhindered cultivation of thousands of acres of farmland currently trapped beyond the fencing.The Punjab chief minister said farmers have long been forced to cross the fence with identity cards and under BSF escort to reach their own fields, facing daily hardship and uncertainty along the 532-km-long India-Pakistan border, where fencing lies deep inside Punjab's territory.He said the home minister informed him during the meeting that the issue is under active consideration and that the fencing will be shifted towards the border, bringing Punjab's land back on the accessible side without compromising national security.Alongside the border issue, CM Mann also raised a series of long-pending concerns, including Punjab's objections to the proposed Seeds Bill 2025, the unresolved Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) dispute, slow movement of foodgrains by the FCI, freezing of Arthia commission, non-payment of rural development fund (RDF) and Mandi Fund, and the dilution of Punjab's role in Chandigarh's administration.He sought a prompt and time-bound resolution of these matters.Raising objections to the proposed Seeds Bill 2025, Mann said, ""Punjab is an agrarian state and one of the largest grain-producing states of the country, yet the draft Seed Bill does not assure representation of the state as per schedule under the relevant section.""The zone-based system introduced in the Bill does not guarantee Punjab's representation in the central seed committee, unlike the existing system, thereby limiting the state's voice in decisions that directly affect the seed sector.""The Punjab CM added, ""The proposed Bill also curtails the existing powers of the state seed committee, as there is no role envisaged for the state-level committee in seed registration, and the draft is silent on a robust compensation framework for farmers who suffer losses when registered seed fails to perform as claimed.""The chief minister further pointed out that seed varieties tested and released in foreign countries have been allowed for import and sale in Punjab and other states without compulsory multi-location testing under state-specific agro climatic conditions, posing serious risks to farmers.He conveyed to the home minister that agriculture is Punjab's lifeline, where farmers grow crops, sell part of the produce and retain seeds for the next season, and forcing farmers to depend entirely on companies for seeds is neither practical nor in farmers' interest.He said that the Bill should not be brought before Parliament in its present form, and was assured by the Union home minister that the concerns would be examined.Reiterating Punjab's long-standing position on river waters, the chief minister said, ""Punjab has no surplus water to share with any other state. There has been a substantial reduction in the availability of Satlej, Ravi and Beas waters, and therefore construction of the Satlej Yamuna Link canal is not viable.""He said that out of 34.34 Mean Annual Flow (MAF) of water from these rivers, Punjab was allocated only 14.22 MAF, about 40 per cent, while the remaining 60 per cent was allocated to Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan, even though none of these rivers actually flow through those states.""This is a gross injustice with Punjab, and there is absolutely no question of constructing this canal as it is totally against the interests of the state and its people,"" he asserted, adding that Punjab's stand before the Supreme Court remains firm that there is no water to spare.Highlighting the problem of foodgrain movement and storage, the chief minister said, ""For the last five months, the FCI has been moving only about 4 to 5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and 5 to 6 LMT of rice from Punjab. Against 95 LMT of pending rice of Kharif marketing season 2025-26 to be delivered, only 20 LMT of storage space is currently available.""On the issue of Arthia commission, CM Mann said, ""The Arthia Commission has been frozen since the 2019-20 procurement season, contrary to the provisions of The Punjab Agriculture Produce and Marketing Act 1961.""Flagging the non-payment of statutory dues, the chief minister said, ""Despite clear statutory provisions under the relevant Punjab Acts, RDF has not been reimbursed to the state government. Even after amending the Punjab Rural Development Act in compliance with Government of India instructions, RDF has not been released since KMS 2021-22.""","The Centre agreed in principle to shift the security fence closer to the International Border.

Infrastructure as a catalyst for industrial growth

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Translating policy intent into global manufacturing competitiveness

(Arnab Basu is Partner and Chief Industries Officer, PwC India)

As India advances towards achieving the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat, Budget 2026 arrives at a poignant moment in the country’s economic journey. Over the past decade, public policy has laid strong structural foundations through reforms, infrastructure expansion and a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing which has collectively reshaped India’s growth trajectory. The task before the upcoming Budget is not to reset direction, but to consolidate gains, deepen execution and ensure that public investment continues to crowd in private capital at scale.At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure. Sustained public CapEx has been one of the most defining features of recent budgets, supporting growth even amid global uncertainty. Investments in roads, railways, ports, airports and digital infrastructure have improved connectivity, reduced logistics costs and strengthened India’s competitiveness across sectors.The Union Budget FY26 has the opportunity to build further on this momentum by continuing a high level of CapEx allocation, while sharpening focus on project execution, asset monetisation and state-level capacity building. The next phase of infrastructure growth must prioritise outcomes related to productivity gains, faster completion cycles, and stronger linkages between physical and digital networks.Equally important is the role of infrastructure in enabling India’s manufacturing ambitions. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, announced over successive Budgets, have begun to yield tangible results across electronics, pharmaceuticals, automotive components and renewable energy equipment. As India seeks to position itself as a trusted manufacturing partner in global value chains, this year’s Budget can focus on refining these schemes—shifting from capacity creation to deeper supply-chain integration, technology adoption and MSME participation. Simplifying compliance, improving access to long-term finance, and strengthening industrial clusters will be critical to sustaining manufacturing competitiveness beyond initial incentives.The manufacturing opportunity in India is both cyclical and structural. While geopolitical realignments and supply-chain diversification are creating near-term openings, domestic demand, urbanisation, and rising incomes provide a long-term anchor. Policy continuity will therefore be key. Measures such as stable customs regimes, faster approvals, and coordinated centre-state frameworks can reinforce investor confidence. Targeted investments in logistics parks, warehousing and multimodal transport can further reduce the cost of manufacturing and exports which has been a long-standing constraint for India’s manufacturing industry.While infrastructure and manufacturing form the core of Budget expectations, the role of technology (especially AI) cannot be overlooked. AI is increasingly becoming a horizontal enabler, enhancing productivity in design, operations, maintenance and supply chain planning across infrastructure and industrial sectors. Budget 2026 can support this transition through targeted incentives for digital adoption, investments in data infrastructure, and skilling programmes that prepare the workforce for technology-enabled manufacturing. The focus should be on practical application rather than experimentation alone, ensuring that AI investments translate into measurable productivity gains.Skilling and human capital development remain another critical lever. Large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing expansion will require a workforce equipped with both technical and digital skills. Building on initiatives such as Skill India and recent efforts to align skilling with industry needs, the Budget can further strengthen public-private partnerships in vocational training, apprenticeships, and continuous upskilling. Ensuring that India’s demographic dividend is absorbed into these sectors will be central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development.From an investor's perspective, policy predictability and fiscal discipline will be crucial. In the past, India has demonstrated that growth-oriented spending can coexist with a credible fiscal consolidation path and the Union Budget FY26 will have to continue this balancing act by maintaining CapEx while managing deficits and debt prudently. According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey: India Perspective, a majority of Indian CEOs remain confident about the country’s economic growth, underpinned by reform stability and sustained public investment. Preserving this confidence will depend on the Budget’s ability to reinforce continuity while addressing emerging execution challenges.Beyond numbers and allocations, this year’s budget will be read as a signal of intent. For global investors, it will indicate how firmly India is committed to strengthening its role in global manufacturing and infrastructure-led growth. For the domestic industry, it will shape decisions on capacity expansion, technology adoption, and long-term investment, while for the states, it will define the contours of cooperative federalism in delivering large-scale projects.The Union Budget FY26 represents an opportunity to reinforce the foundations of Viksit Bharat through steady, purposeful policy action. By sustaining infrastructure investment, deepening manufacturing capabilities and enabling technology-led productivity, the Budget can help ensure that India’s growth story remains resilient and inclusive. As the economy navigates an evolving global landscape, it is this consistency of direction and execution that will preserve momentum and translate ambition into enduring economic outcomes.","At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure.

MCX Gold has regained its bullish momentum after a short consolidation phase and is now trading around the all-time high of 143,500. With upward strength reasserting itself and minimal signs of a reversal, the rally is likely to extend to higher levels. The recent breakout reinforces the strength of the move, and the overall outlook remains positive as long as prices stay above the breakout zone.From a weekly perspective, the 139,000 level remains a key support area, marking the lower boundary of the consolidation range. Any dip toward this zone is expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this support strengthens the bullish structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well placed to advance toward the 151,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective rise is in line with the broader bullish trend and underscores the strength of prevailing market momentum. Additionally, a decisive and sustained breakout above the consolidation range resistance has attracted fresh buying interest, reinforcing positive sentiment and setting the stage for a continued upward move.Overall, Gold remains well positioned to maintain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly favouring trend continuation.

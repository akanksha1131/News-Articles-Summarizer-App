'Belief shattered': Two JD(U) leaders resign over party's support for Waqf bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/belief-shattered-two-jdu-leaders-resign-for-partys-support-of-waqf-bill/articleshow/119963762.cms,"Rajya Sabha (Agencies)

NEW DELHI: At least two individuals in Bihar on Thursday announced their resignation from chief minister Nitish Kumar 's party, Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), due to disagreement with the party’s support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill introduced by the central government.Mohammed Qasim Ansari, claiming to be a senior JD(U) leader, and Mohammed Nawaz Malik, JD(U) minority pradesh secretary of Bihar, wrote separate letters to Nitish Kumar. In the letters, they said that Muslims no longer had trust in the party, which they earlier believed followed a secular path.“Millions of Indian Muslims like us had unwavering faith that you are the flag bearer of a purely secular ideology. But now, this belief has been shattered. Millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and activists like us are deeply shocked by JDU's stand regarding the Waqf Bill Amendment Act 2024,” reads the letter written by Shah Nawaz Malik.Ansari wrote that the Waqf Bill was “against Indian Muslims” and could not be accepted “under any circumstances.”“This bill violates many fundamental rights of the Constitution. Through this bill, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and insulted. Neither you nor your party realises this. I regret that I gave many years of my life to the party,” he wrote.However, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad responded by saying that neither Ansari, from East Champaran, nor Malik, from Jamui, were part of the party’s official structure.In a letter circulating on social media, Ansari described himself as JD(U)'s medical cell president in East Champaran and claimed to have been a candidate from the Dhaka assembly seat. However, the JD(U) did not contest Dhaka in the 2020 elections. That seat was won by the BJP’s Pawan Jaiswal, an ally of JD(U).Rajiv Ranjan Prasad told news agency PTI, ""I wonder what to say about things. I have been associated with the party for a long time. I say with full responsibility that neither person has been a part of our rank and file.""He added, ""We admit that some genuine members of our party, like national general secretary Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi, are not very happy with the passage of the Bill. Their grievances will be dealt with at the appropriate level. But those who are coming up with the claim of resignation from the party, were never members in the first place.""Earlier in the day, Baliyawi and Syed Afzal Abbas, who heads the Bihar Shia Waqf Board, also expressed concern about the Bill. They said many suggestions made by Muslim leaders during meetings with the Joint Parliamentary Committee were not accepted. However, they did not speak against the party’s decision to support the Bill.Parliament passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 in the early hours of Friday after a detailed discussion in the Rajya Sabha. The bill was approved in the Rajya Sabha with 128 members voting in favour and 95 opposing it. Earlier, it had cleared the Lok Sabha with the support of 288 MPs, while 232 voted against it.Parliament approved the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in the early hours of Friday following an extensive discussion in the Rajya Sabha.

He said that the RJD, which ruled Bihar for 15 years and got Muslim votes, had failed to stop Hindu-Muslim clashes.The RJD, Congress, and Left parties are expected to use the Waqf Bill issue to criticise the JD(U) and are hoping to gain Muslim voters' support for the ""Mahagathbandhan"" alliance.","Mohammed Qasim Ansari, claiming to be a senior JD(U) leader, wrote separate letters to Nitish Kumar.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lauded the passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in both the houses of Parliament, describing it as a ""watershed moment"".The contentious legislation cleared both houses of Parliament after extensive debates, with the Rajya Sabha passing it following a marathon 13-hour discussion.

"India gets slapped with tariff, others punched",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gets-slapped-with-tariff-others-punched/articleshow/119961287.cms,"India's reaction:

At a White House Rose Garden event on Wednesday on what he called “Liberation Day” for the US, India became a middling victim in Trump’s take-no-prisoner approach that treated friend and foe alike with a two-tier tariff: a baseline tax of 10% on all countries that will go into effect on April 5, and additional tariffs on some countries that he considers to be the “worst offenders”, which will be imposed on April 9.India, described by Trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the US President’s ‘worst offender’ checklist because, by his calculation, New Delhi taxes US imports to the tune of 52%, a dubious figure arrived at by adding perceived non-monetary, nontariff barriers, ‘currency manipulation’ etc. China was assessed at 67%, Taiwan at 64%, and South Korea at 50%.But out of the ‘kindness of his heart’ he would impose not a ‘commonsense reciprocal tariff’ but give a 50% ‘discount,’ Trump said, thus making it 27% tariff on imports from India.“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike. Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” the president of the richest country on earth raged in remarks that were borderline offensive and distasteful.Financial markets plunged in response. Some $2tn of market value was wiped out in S&P 500 stocks alone as the index fell 4%, its worst day since Sept 2022. The dollar experienced its largest single-day decline on record, dropping 2.1% against major currencies.The ripple effect of Trump’s sweeping tariffs will reshape global trade flows, disrupt supply chains, and test longstanding diplomatic alliances. As countries scramble to respond, the economic and geopolitical fallout is likely to be deep and enduring.The govt said it would seek to “expeditiously” clinch a “mutually beneficial” bilateral trade deal with the US and reiterated its commitment to strong strategic relations.Sources said the commerce department is consulting export councils and ministries to gauge the fallout and explore support for affected businesses.With PM Modi and Trump agreeing to a bilateral trade agreement later this year, India and the US have finalised the broad contours of detailed discussions with technical negotiations expected to be launched this month. This, sources said, gave India a lead over others who will now begin an engagement with the US to seek tariff cuts. “India was an early mover and over the last 50 days a lot of work has been done. The idea is to settle all outstanding bilateral trade issues,” an official said. The assessment is that the Trump administration too is keen to engage and a deal can be crafted by lowering a few duties in India.","India, described by Trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the US President’s ‘worst offender’ checklist.

Experts at India Meteorological Department (IMD) expect some more rain Friday morning.The city received 4.3mm of rain Thursday. Though the day dawned with overcast conditions, the skies opened up only by noon. But within minutes, Bengaluru was reminded of how vulnerable it could be in case of heavy rain, with several roads and areas inundated.As many as 12 trees and 451 branches fell in various parts of the city. Though the downpour lasted only a short while in most areas, the impact lasted hours, with traffic crawling as the road conditions were unnavigable. To counter the vehicle pile-up, traffic police issued advisories on the go, on social media.The inundated stretches included the road from Domlur water tank to Domlur bridge, Kadugodi bridge towards Hoskote main road, Madiwala 29th Main road towards Silk Board, Palace Cross underpass, Ramamurthy Nagar underpass, Puttenahalli underpass towards JP Nagar, Inner Ring Road towards Indiranagar underpass, and HBR Layout towards Tin Factory.A tree fell at Chowdeshwari temple, near the National Games Village back gate, slowing down traffic. In Rajajinagar II Block, an uprooted tree landed on an SUV. By 6pm, six of the uprooted trees were cleared and 27 of the 41 fallen branches removed.IMD Bengaluru director CS Patil told TOI: ""While parts of the state were issued a yellow alert on Thursday, the intensity of rainfall will be less on Friday. Parts of Karnataka have only a thunderstorm alert.""He attributed the shower spells to strong south-easterly winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal. ""They bring in a lot of moisture into the interior land. And the past few days witnessed very high temperatures. The combination of the temperature and humidity in effect gave us good rainfall,"" he said.What's that froth on the road?Vehicles wading through accumulated rainwater on Thursday also had to watch out for frothy roads — be it at Koramangala, Indiranagar or the CBD area — that were mildly layered with suds. The speculation was that the suds were caused by Shikakai trees that react with rainwater and release saponins, and BBMP deputy conservator of forests BLG Swamy agreed.

"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956816.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.

The chief minister also announced that his government will challenge the Bill in Supreme Court.""This is an act that disturbs religious harmony. To highlight this, we are participating in today's assembly proceedings wearing black badges,"" the chief minister told the House.""I would like to inform you that the Supreme Court will be approached on behalf of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) against this controversial amendment. Tamil Nadu will fight against the Union government's law which destroys the autonomy of the Waqf Board and threatens the minority Muslim population,"" Stalin said amidst thumping of desks by the Treasury.His party member in Rajya Sabha Tiruchi Siva made a strong case against the Bill and claimed that the BJP-led NDA government was targeting the Muslims.""Why is a certain community being targeted? Govt intention is malafide and deplorable. The government says 'sabka saath, sabka vishwaas', but they have a different policy for Muslims - exclusion and marginalistaion. It is a sad day as Constitution has given rights to the Muslims, but they have been deprived of their rights. We should remember that Muslims also have contributed to the development of the country,"" T Siva said in his speech in the Upper House. Siva in his speech highlighted how the BJP governments in states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were targeting the Muslims.Earlier on Wednesday, when the Bill was being debated in Lok Sabha, Stalin shot off a letter to Prime Minister Modi against the legislation.""The Constitution of India grants every citizen the right to follow their respective religion and it is the duty of the elected governments to uphold and protect this right. However, the proposed amendments to the Waqf Act, 1995 have not taken into consideration the constitutional protection given to minorities and are bound to severely harm the interest of Muslim community,"" Stalin wrote in his letter.Last week, Stalin had got a resolution passed against the Bill in the state assembly on March 27. The resolution stated that the proposed Waqf legislation would seriously affect the religious harmony of India besides the minority Muslim community.Clearly, all his moves appear to be part of a well-planned political strategy to steal the initiative over his rivals in the state with assembly elections scheduled early next year.Interestingly, on all these initiatives the AIADMK , which is DMK's arch rival, has been forced to support the government.In fact, actor-politician Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam chief Vijay, who may be the surprise factor in the upcoming assembly elections, has also dubbed the Waqf Bill ""anti-democratic"" and demanded that it be taken back.Accusing the BJP of pursuing ""majoritarian and divisive politics"", he wondered whether the Bill was not a ""psychological attack"" on Muslims and rejected the BJP-led Centre's arguments in support of the Bill.""The TVK urges that the anti-democratic Bill be immediately taken back heeding the voice of all democratic forces. In case the union government led by the BJP does not do this, the TVK will join forces with Muslim brothers and take part in their Waqf rights legal struggle,"" Vijay said.Stalin has been quick to latch on to some of the issues raised by the BJP in the state.When Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked the DMK government in Tamil Nadu to implement the three-language policy, Stalin turned it into an issue of state's rights alleging that it was not the National Education Policy that the BJP was trying to implement but a ""saffron policy"" aimed at developing Hindi and not the nation.Raising fears of ""Hindi imposition"" on the state, Stalin claimed that Tamil Nadu was ready for another language war. The Tamil Nadu chief minister did not stop at that.He simultaneously raised the pitch on the ""threat"" of Tamil Nadu losing Lok Sabha seats under the proposed delimitation and called an all-party meeting on the issue to ensure that the state was not penalised for ensuring development and controlling population.Muslims constitute nearly 6% of the state's population and have equally supported the DMK and the AIADMK in their pockets of influence. However, this time around Stalin perhaps wants to consolidate their support for his party. Also, perhaps there is a concerted effort by CM Stalin to make DMK a main stream player in national politics and lead opposition unity against the BJP. That was evident when Stalin brought opposition CMs and leaders from non-NDA parties in the joint action committee against the delimitation.","DMK president and chief minister M K Stalin has taken the lead to emerge as one of the strongest critics of the Waqf Amendment Bill.

How numbers compare in Rajya Sabha?

NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha is holding a debate on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, following its passage in the Lok Sabha in the early hours of Thursday.Minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiu moved the bill for discussion on the second-last day of the Budget session of Parliament. If approved by the Rajya Sabha, the legislation will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her approval; it would become a law after the President's assent.In the Lok Sabha, 288 members of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) voted in favour of the bill, while 232 opposition MPs voted against it. The majority mark in the 543-member House is 273.In the Rajya Sabha, where the total strength of present members is 236, the NDA has 117 members, just two short of the majority figure of 119. However, the ruling coalition's strength rises to 125, well above the majority mark, with two nominated members and six independents.The Bharatiya Janata Party , the largest NDA constituent, alone accounts for 98 of the alliance's Rajya Sabha MPs. Other NDA members with representation in the House are Janata Dal (United) (four), Nationalist Congress Party (three), Telugu Desam Party (two) and one each from 10 other parties in the alliance.On the other hand, the opposition INDIA bloc has 88 MPs in the Upper House: Congress (27), Trinamool Congress (13), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Aam Aadmi Party (10 each), Rashtriya Janata Dal (five), Samajwadi Party and CPI-M (four each), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (three) and others.As many as 23 MPs are from non-NDA and non-INDIA bloc parties.","The Rajya Sabha is holding a debate on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024.

Tyeb Mehta's bull run continues: 2nd priciest Indian painting at 61.8cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tyeb-mehtas-bull-run-continues-2nd-priciest-indian-painting-at-61-8cr/articleshow/119957048.cms,"His work is worth crores, but Tyeb struggled most of his life

The bull run seems to be truly on in the Indian market, and who better to capture its animal spirits than Tyeb Mehta, the celebrated modernist who made the bull his enduring motif?Less than a fortnight after a work by his contemporary M F Husain joined the Rs 100-crore club, Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' (1956) went for Rs 61.8 crore ($7.27 million), becoming the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil 's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. Mehta's powerful image of a shackled and subjugated bull went for nearly nine times its higher estimate at a Saffronart auction in Mumbai on Wednesday.This is not the first time Mehta, who lived in Mumbai most of his life and passed away in 2009, has raised the bar for Indian art. In 2002, his triptych, 'Celebration', from The Times of India's collection, made history as the first modern Indian artwork to sell for over a crore (Rs 1.5 crore at Christie's).It was a Tyeb work again ('Mahishasura') which crossed the $1m mark for the first time in 2005. Now, he has set another benchmark for Indian art. Wednesday's auction was also a benchmark for homegrown auction house Saffronart, which celebrated its 25th anniversary with an auction that raked in a record-breaking $25 million. ""It's a global record for an Indian art auction. It shows the strength of the art market when other asset classes are struggling,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart CEO and co-founder. ""It's even more meaningful because it is Mehta's centenary year.""The proceeds will go to the Mehta family since the work was from their collection. For most of his life, the artist lived in a cramped one-room apartment that was studio by day and bedroom at night. It was only in the 1990s that he and his wife Sakina could afford to move into a two-bedroom place in Lokhandwala. ""Like many other artist wives of that period, Sakina supported him. She used to work as a teacher,"" said Kishore Singh, senior VP at DAG (formerly Delhi Art Gallery).His work now goes for sums that are as jaw-dropping as his pregnant Kali and avenging yet tender Durga but to talk of Mehta purely in terms of zeroes does no justice to the man and the ideals he lived by. ""The power of painting was far more important to him than the prices it commanded,"" said Singh, narrating an anecdote from Delhi gallerist Arun Vadehra who was close to Mehta. ""Arun used to have one of his paintings hanging in his office. One day, Mehta took it away, only to replace it later with another work. When Arun asked, he said he had ripped the earlier painting because he wasn't happy with it. Tyeb may not have been very prolific but he stayed true to his art.""Mehta's strong imagery was always rooted in his life, with his canvases charting the tumult around him - the horrors of Partition, the struggles of a newly independent India and the violence of the 1992 Bombay riots. In an interview, he recounted his memories of Partition. ""At the time, I was living on Mohammed Ali Road, which was virtually a Muslim ghetto. I remember watching a young man being slaughtered in the street below my window. The crowd beat him to death, smashed his head with stones."" Those images haunted him for life, as did the sight of bullocks being led to slaughter at an abattoir in Bombay. The bull, Mehta later said, was important to him on many levels. ""The way they tie up the animal's legs and fling it on the floor of the slaughterhouse before butchering it... you feel something very vital has been lost. The trussed bull also seemed representative of the national condition... the mass of humanity unable to channel or direct its tremendous energies...""In the winter of his life, Mehta's vision was impaired. ""Those primary colours that he used so much was because his sight was affected,"" explained Singh. But he continued to paint, a perfectionist till the end.","Tyeb Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' is the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court judges led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna have unanimously decided to make public their assets and liabilities as a dormant issue about wealth of constitutional court judges was revived after the alleged discovery of a huge amount of cash at high court judge Justice Yashwant Varma's official residence on March 14, reports .CJI Khanna mooted the proposal before the collegium comprising himself and Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath and later, the issue was put forth before a full court meeting Tuesday. All judges agreed to the proposal to make public their assets and liabilities by posting it on the SC's website. The SC in a press release said 30 of the 33 SC judges, including the CJI, have declared their assets.Two newly-appointed judges - Justices K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi - are yet to declare their assets and liabilities to the CJI. The SC has a sanctioned strength of 34 judges but one post is vacant.""The assets and liabilities statements of judges, which are mandatorily declared before the CJI by every judge of the SC and, thereafter, kept in sealed cover, is likely to be uploaded on the SC website by the end of this month,"" an SC source told TOI.The full court of the SC in Aug 2009, during the tenure of CJI K G Balakrishnan, had decided to upload the assets and liabilities declared by judges immediately after getting appointed to the SC, on the SC website after Justice Shylendra Kumar of Karnataka HC publicly joined issue with CJI Balakrishnan for his stand that judges should not be required to disclose their assets to the public.But the practice petered out four or five years later when a judge stirred a huge controversy by mentioning ""daughters' marriage"" as a liability in her declaration. Moreover, judges, who as lawyers had roaring practices prior to joining constitutional courts, were reluctant to share details of their huge assets.In Nov 2019, a five-judge SC bench, of which Justice Khanna was a part, had ruled that the office of CJI was a public authority and amenable to RTI Act. Justice Khanna had said independence of judiciary and transparency went hand in hand. Justice N V Ramana, who became CJI in 2021, had concurred with Justice Khanna and said there should be a balance between right to information, transparency and independence of judiciary.Declaration of assets and liabilities by judges started with a full court resolution of the SC on May 7, 1997, which read, ""Resolved that every judge should make a declaration of all his/her assets in the form of real estate or investments (held by him/her in his/her own name or in the name of his/her spouse or any person dependent on him/her) within a reasonable time of assuming office and in the case of sitting judge within a reasonable time of adoption of this resolution and thereafter whenever any acquisition of substantial nature is made, it shall be disclosed within a reasonable time.""

NEW DELHI: Senior JD(U) leader Mohammed Qasim Ansari has resigned from the party and all his posts on Thursday, citing disappointment over JD(U)'s stance on the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024 .In a strongly worded resignation letter to party leader Nitish Kumar, Ansari expressed deep dismay, stating that the party’s position had shattered the faith of millions of Indian Muslims.""I am disheartened that I gave several years of my life to the party,"" his letter read.Ansari accused JD(U) of betraying its secular principles and criticised JD(U) MP Lalan Singh for the way he supported the bill in the Lok Sabha.""With due respect, I would like to state that millions of Indian Muslims like me had unwavering faith that you were a true flagbearer of secular ideology. However, that belief has now been shattered,"" he wrote.""The stance taken by the JD(U) regarding the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2024 has deeply hurt millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and party workers like us. We are extremely disheartened by the way Shri Lalan Singh presented his statement in the Lok Sabha and supported this bill with such conviction.""Calling the bill an attack on Indian Muslims and a violation of fundamental constitutional rights, Ansari argued that the legislation was also anti-Pasmanda Muslims—something he claimed neither JD(U) nor its leadership acknowledged.""The Waqf Bill is against Indian Muslims. Under no circumstances can we accept it. This bill violates several fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. Through this legislation, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and disgraced. Additionally, this bill is also anti-Pasmanda Muslims—something neither you nor your party seem to realize,"" he wrote.Regretting his long association with JD(U), Ansari said, ""I deeply regret dedicating several years of my life to this party. I am therefore submitting this letter and resigning voluntarily from the party’s primary membership and all other responsibilities.""However, when asked about Ansari, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad dismissed him as a ""non-entity,"" claiming he was insignificant within the party.""Who is he? He has never been an office bearer of consequence or a prominent figure. I don't even know him. He never held any post in the party, not even at the district level. He is a non-entity,"" Prasad told PTI.Earlier to the tabling of Bill, JD(U) aligned itself with ally BJP on the Waqf Bill, though party MP Sanjay Jha clarified that JD(U) opposed any retrospective implementation of the law. He expressed hope that the government would address this concern.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it...

NEW DELHI: In a blow to the Bengal govt, Supreme Court Thursday concurred with Calcutta HC's decision to cancel the 2016 recruitment of over 25,700 teachers and non-teaching staff for state govt schools, saying the selections were tainted beyond repair.Dismissing appeals of Mamata govt, West Bengal School Services Commission and 125 successful candidates, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""The entire selection process has been vitiated and tainted beyond resolution.""Writing the 41-page judgement that rejected pleas for segregating tainted candidates instead of cancelling the entire recruitment, CJI Khanna said, ""Manipulations and frauds on a large scale, coupled with attempted cover-up, have dented the process... (Its) credibility and legitimacy are denuded."" Referring to destruction of candidates' OMR (answer) sheets purportedly for illegal rank jumping, selection of those who didn't qualify and even those who gave blank answer papers, the bench said HC had on April 22 last year rightly cancelled the entire process.SC said tainted candidates, who were appointed as teachers or to non-teaching staff posts, ""should be required to refund any salaries/payments received. Since their appointments were the result of fraud, this amounts to cheating"". However, it said even though non-tainted candidates would lose jobs, they won't be asked to refund salaries and reimbursements they received.In another important clarification, SC said the selected candidates, who do not fall in the tainted category and may have worked in govt departments prior to their selection to teaching and non-teaching jobs, ""will have the right to apply to their previous departments or autonomous bodies to continue in their service with those entities"". The bench said, ""Their seniority and other entitlements will be preserved, and they will be eligible for increments. However, for the period they were employed under the disputed appointment, no wages will be paid by the state or autonomous bodies. If needed supernumerary posts would be created to accommodate them.""SC will on April 8 hear the petition filed by state govt challenging the HC direction for a CBI probe against officials and ministers who decided to create supernumerary posts for teachers and non-teaching staff, and appoint more people than those who had made it to the list of selected candidates.","Calcutta HC had cancelled the 2016 recruitment of over 25,700 teachers and non- teaching staff for state govt schools.

INDIA bloc parties alleged that the bill was ""unconstitutional"" and aimed at targeting Muslims. Congress , TMC, DMK, AAP, Shiv Sena (UBT), Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left parties questioned the govt's intent behind bringing the legislation.Leader of the House and BJP president J P Nadda pointed out that other Muslim-dominated countries, including Turkiye, Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Iran had changed their laws for better management of waqf properties. ""When these Muslim nations are digitising waqf properties and making them accountable, then what is the problem if it is being done in India?"" he said, adding that with the amendments, the govt has tried to ensure that waqf properties are in the right hands and used for the benefit of Muslims.Nadda said Muslim women became second-grade citizens during UPA's term. ""It was only India where Muslim women were not brought into the mainstream,"" he said, adding that triple talaq was banned in Muslim countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Bangladesh and Syria several years ago. ""We believe in real service, not lip service. Today crores of Muslim sisters have the right to live with dignity. Who did it? It is a historic decision and none other than PM Modi has done it,"" Nadda said.Nominated BJP MP Ghulam Ali supported the bill and said there was an urgent need for this legislation as a certain family was usurping Muslims' land. He called for a CBI inquiry into the misuse of waqf board and waqf properties.Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge accused the govt of trying to sow the seeds of conflict by suppressing Muslims through the legislation and appealed to BJP not to disturb peace and harmony in the country. ""This is against Muslims, not constitutional, and don't try to stoke disturbances in the peaceful fabric of society,"" he said.Rijiju countered the allegations and said, ""Many people said this is unconstitutional, illegal and the right of Muslims is being snatched away. Very categorically, I want to reject all these allegations.""""Whatever you could not fulfil, the Narendra Modi govt has shown the courage to pursue,"" he said referring to Congress and its allies. He accused the Congress of ""appeasement politics"" and said that in 2013, the UPA govt had brought amendments to the 1995 Waqf Act ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in a rush to appeal to the sentiments of the minority vote bank.Rijiju said 31,999 cases were pending in the waqf tribunal and more than 14,000 litigants were Muslims, adding that a provision has been created to enable a person to challenge the tribunal's decision through civil suits in high courts.","Opposition parties alleged that the bill was ""unconstitutional"" and aimed at targeting Muslims.

"In a first, Omar calls meet to discuss LG’s decision; Transfer of state officers becomes bone of contention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-omar-calls-meet-to-discuss-lgs-decision-transfer-of-state-officers-becomes-bone-of-contention/articleshow/119954986.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah has convened a meeting Friday to discuss growing tensions over lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha’s recent transfers of officers, the first time he will examine and debate an administrative decision taken by the Centre-appointed authority.The bone of contention emerged Tuesday when Sinha ordered transfers of 48 Jammu Kashmir Administrative Service (JKAS) officers while the CM and other members of his National Conference (NC) were away for Eid holidays. NC did not name the Centre-appointed Sinha but asserted that no one would be allowed to “play with the democratic set-up”. NC has also taken up the issue with the Centre, party sources said.Sources said Omar wrote Thursday to Union home minister Amit Shah and Sinha expressing concern after chief secretary Atal Dulloo did not comply with CM’s directive to rescind the transfers by the previous evening (April 2). The issue is likely to come up during Shah’s scheduled visit to J&K next week, the sources said.”“The meeting (on Friday) will discuss many issues and on the top of agenda will be recent transfers of UT administrative service officers,” Tanvir Sadiq, NC member and spokesman, told TOI. Sadiq pointed out that the NC govt was democratically elected, sworn in last Oct, and both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Shah had hailed this political process. “We will not allow anyone to scuttle it,” Sadiq said.NC chief whip Mubarik Gul has in a letter to NC legislators said Omar would chair the meeting at the residence of deputy CM Surinder Choudhary. “All are requested to kindly make it convenient to attend the meeting,” Gul wrote.A power-sharing structure between the elected govt and LG in place after the Aug 2019 abrogation of special status under Article 370 that turned J&K into a Union territory has worked in the past six months since NC took office. According to NC, LG has powers to transfer IAS officers, while the elected govt wields similar authority over JKAS cadre.Many NC leaders believed transfers of revenue officers, like SDMs and Tehsildars and projecting them as law-and-order officers, amounted to asserting power over the entire bureaucracy, from a peon to an IAS officer. They say these revenue officials are assigned law and order duty on occasions but that doesn’t bring them under LG. Since J&K became a UT, LG handles the home department.Congress legislatorGA Mir supported ally NC’s position and said LG’s actions showed everything was not well within the J&K administration.However, opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) dismissed NC’s “alleged outrage” over the issue, saying nothing would come out of Friday’s meeting. “NC has already surrendered its huge mandate, and to expect any resistance from it, is asking too much. The party has frittered away all opportunities to channel people’s aspirations and seek dignity for them, including constitutional rights. NC is conscious of BJP’s ability to destabilise them (but) resistance is a tall order,” PDP spokesman Naeem Akhtar said.Political analyst Zafar Choudhary acknowledged “some political criticism” over transfers by LG Sinha but asserted that he drew his powers from a “written text stemming from the events of Aug 2019 which no one should pretend to be oblivious of”. “If nothing has been imagined, conceived or planned, leave aside done, to change the terms of engagement, there is no point for any knee-jerk reaction,” Choudhary said.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah has convened a meeting Friday to discuss growing tensions over lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha’s recent transfers of officers.

"Dow Jones drops 1,400 points as US stock market leads global sell-off after Trump's tariffs spark recession fears",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dow-jones-drops-1400-points-as-us-stock-market-leads-global-sell-off-after-trumps-tariffs-spark-recession-fears/articleshow/119951567.cms,"AI generated image

The US stock market plunged sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1,400 points, or 3.3%, amid widespread concerns triggered by President Donald Trump ’s latest set of severe tariffs.According to news agency AP, the S&P 500 fell 4%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.1%, reflecting a broader global market sell-off. At one point in the morning, the S&P 500 was on track for its worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.The announcement of new tariffs on imports, including a 10% baseline tax on a range of products, caused significant alarm among investors, fuelling fears of rising inflation and slowing economic growth. The impact was felt globally, with major stock indexes in Europe and Asia also suffering sharp losses.The tariffs have rattled markets, with commodities like crude oil, tech stocks, and even gold—all traditionally seen as safe havens—declining in value. The Russell 2000 index of smaller US companies dropped 5.9%, dipping more than 20% below its record.Trump’s new tariffs include heightened taxes on imports from countries like China and those in the European Union . Economists warn that the tariffs could lower US economic growth by as much as 2 percentage points this year and push inflation close to 5%, potentially dragging the economy into a recession ""Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,"" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.The Federal Reserve faces a challenging dilemma. While it may consider cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, such moves could further fuel inflation. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note dropped to 4.04% from 4.20% late Wednesday, reflecting growing concerns about the economy’s future.Despite the ongoing economic growth, data released Thursday showed signs of strain. Unemployment claims remained lower than expected, suggesting a stable labour market, but weaker-than-anticipated growth in US service industries highlighted the broader effects of the tariffs. Businesses reported supply chain disruptions, higher costs for materials like aluminium, and delays in deliveries.Corporate stocks took a major hit, with retailers and airlines among the worst affected. Best Buy dropped 15.2%, United Airlines lost 12.3%, and Target fell 10.3%, as investors grew worried about the impact of the tariffs on consumer spending and business activity.Internationally, European and Asian markets followed suit. France's CAC 40 dropped 3.3%, Germany's DAX lost 3%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.5%. South Korea's Kospi also lost 0.8%.","US stock market plunged sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1,400 points, or 3.3%.

'Completely abandoned Hindutva and ideals of Balasaheb Thackeray': Eknath Shinde slams Uddhav Thackeray on Waqf Bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/completely-abandoned-hindutva-and-ideals-of-balasaheb-thackeray-eknath-shinde-slams-uddhav-thackeray-on-waqf-bill/articleshow/119943593.cms,"Uddhav Thackeray and Eknath Shinde (R)

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Thursday launched a blistering attack at Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray for opposing the Waqf Amendment Bill , accusing him of straying from Hindutva and Balasaheb Thackeray 's ideology.Speaking to the media, Shinde described the opposition to the bill as the ""biggest crime.""""By opposing this, UBT has revealed its true face. It has been proven that they have completely abandoned Hindutva and the ideals of Balasaheb Thackeray. This is extremely unfortunate. It is a bigger crime than the betrayal in 2019 when he (Uddhav Thackeray) formed a government with Congress , forsaking Balasaheb Thackeray's ideology,"" Shinde said.He further criticised Thackeray’s leadership, calling him ""confused"" and suggesting it was putting the party’s future in jeopardy.""Uddhav Thackeray is completely confused. He doesn't even know what decisions to take. When leadership becomes like this, the future of the party is also in darkness,"" he added.Shinde defended the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025, saying it aims to break the monopoly over Waqf properties and alleging that Congress seeks to keep the poor in poverty.""The Waqf Board was in the hands of a handful of people, but now, with the bill introduced by Modi ji, their dominance will end. This will provide an opportunity for women and children to come into the mainstream. It will benefit the poor sections of the Muslim community, but Congress wants to keep Muslims poor for the sake of votes,"" he claimed.Earlier in the day, Uddhav Thackeray lashed out at the BJP-led Union government, calling it ""all show, no substance."" He reaffirmed his party’s opposition to the Waqf Amendment Bill, as well as what he called the BJP’s hypocrisy and its alleged plans to hand over land to business interests.""There are some corrections (for the Waqf board) in the Waqf amendment bill, which are good. However, the experience with the BJP till now is that yanche dakhwayeche daant ani khayeche daant vegde ahe (all show, no substance). We supported them during the repeal of Article 370... But I want to ask, did the Kashmiri Pandits get their land? We not only opposed the bill but also the hypocrisy and corruption of the BJP and its plans to give land to its businessmen friends,"" former Maharashtra CM Thackeray said at a press conference.The Lok Sabha passed the Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 after an extended and heated debate, with INDIA bloc members opposing it while BJP and its allies backed the legislation. The session continued past midnight before Speaker Om Birla announced the results of the division vote.""Subject to correction, Ayes 288, Noes 232. The majority is in favour of the proposal,"" Birla said.The revised bill, incorporating recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee, seeks to amend the 1995 Act to improve the administration of Waqf properties, enhance efficiency, streamline registration, and integrate technology into record-keeping.Meanwhile, Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju moved a motion in the Rajya Sabha for consideration of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Musalmaan Wakf (Repeal) Bill.","Mahar Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde attacked Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for opposing the Waqf Amendment Bill.

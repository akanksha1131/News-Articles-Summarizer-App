Sethi posted a video of him showing a handwritten note left on another car in a parking lot. The note read: “Sorry for hitting on your left side door”, along with contact details for the car owner to claim damages, adding, “Please contact and claim your damages. ”In the clip, he can be seen explaining why the incident caught his attention. He contrasted the situation with what he believes often happens in India, saying that if someone were to hit another person’s car, they would most likely flee the spot. “In Australia, people are so considerate that the person who caused the damage actually left a note asking the car owner to claim the damages,” he noted. “Just shows you that a country becomes great because of its people. ” He captioned the clip: “Australian people are cute (maybe it was a tourist) But worth sharing.”The clip also drew more emotional responses. One viewer remarked, “Absolutely right, people in our country will kill each other over a damage let alone settling damages.”","Sethi posted a video of him showing a handwritten note left on another car in a parking lot.

'Vote Chori Is The Biggest Anti-National Act': Rahul Gandhi Slams BJP In Lok Sabha

Senior party leaders to attend the rally





‘Lacking a neutral umpire,’ says K C Venugopal





Amit Shah vs Rahul Gandhi





NEW DELHI: The Congress will hold a major rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital on Sunday, stepping up its campaign over alleged “vote chori” and the SIR issue, party leaders said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and former party chief Rahul Gandhi are expected to address the rally.Ahead of the rally, senior leaders will assemble at the party’s Indira Bhawan headquarters and proceed together to Ramlila Maidan in a bus.The rally comes days after a fiery debate in the Lok Sabha, during which the government and the Opposition clashed over the special intensive revision of electoral rolls and ""vote chori"" allegations.Senior leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh and Sachin Pilot, are also set to participate, while former Congress president Sonia Gandhi is also likely to be present.""Our party has organised the 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod' rally at Ramlila Maidan. The Congress party has taken a step towards a decisive battle, and a large number of people will attend this rally,"" Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was quoted as saying by ANI.Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy is also expected to attend the rally.According to a party spokesperson, 1,027 Congress leaders and activists set out from Jammu on Saturday to attend the rally. The group raised slogans of “vote chore, gaddi chhore” and “Delhi chalo” while en route, as cited by PTI.Jharkhand Congress president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh said the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee has undertaken extensive preparations for the rally. Describing the programme as historic, Kamlesh added that party leaders, workers and representatives from across Jharkhand have already arrived in Delhi in large numbers.Congress MP K C Venugopal on Saturday criticised the Election Commission of India, saying the country was “lacking a neutral umpire” to conduct elections. He also referred to earlier press conferences addressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, which highlighted alleged electoral malpractices.""We are lacking a neutral umpire in this country for conducting elections. This is actually very dangerous to democracy. That is why we are going completely for a campaign and movement. The five-crore signature has to be submitted to the President of India. We are seeking an appointment... In Parliament, we also discussed this vote chori issue. Our LoP has given straightforward suggestions. Not only criticising, but we are also providing clear suggestions. ..There are a lot of complaints about the machines, the EVMs. Lakhs of people will participate in that... This is an internal party program,"" Venugopal was quoted as saying by ANI.Venugopal said the Congress has gathered over five crore signatures nationwide to highlight alleged vote theft, calling it a core democratic issue. He alleged the presence of ""bogus"" and duplicate votes, claimed that Rahul Gandhi’s press conferences exposed irregularities favouring the BJP, and said the Election Commission ignored the party’s complaint while instead targeting the Congress.Tensions flared in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday as Union home minister Amit Shah and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi sparred over allegations of “vote chori.” Gandhi repeatedly challenged Shah to debate the issues raised during recent press conferences, including claims of irregularities in electoral rolls.Moreover, Rahul launched a sharp attack on the government and the Election Commission, raising three questions that he said demonstrated how the BJP was “directing and using” the EC to undermine India’s democracy.Rahul also put forward a series of proposals, including providing machine-readable voter lists to all political parties a month before elections, scrapping the provision that allows CCTV footage to be destroyed after 45 days, granting access to EVMs, and amending laws that, he alleged, allow election commissioners to “get away with whatever they want to do.”Responding sharply, Shah said Parliament would not function according to Rahull’s wishes and asserted that he would address the questions in his own sequence. He defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter lists, describing it as a necessary exercise to “sanitise” the electoral rolls.Accusing the Opposition of double standards, Shah said the Election Commission was praised after electoral victories but criticised after defeats. The exchange ended with Opposition MPs staging a walkout during Shah’s reply, forcing an adjournment of the House.","Congress will hold a major rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital on Sunday.

India Slams Pakistan At UN For Airstrikes And ‘Trade Terrorism’ That Deepen Afghanistan’s Crisis

GUWAHATI: A retired junior warrant officer of the IAF has been arrested in Assam’s Tezpur on charges of spying for Pakistan, police said on Saturday. Kulendra Sharma has been booked under BNS for waging war against India, criminal conspiracy, endangering the country’s sovereignty, unity and integrity, and destroying evidence.Sonitpur district DSP (border) Haricharan Bhumij said Sharma’s phones and laptops were seized. “From our sources and the gadgets, we discovered he shared sensitive defence-related documents and information with the Pakistani intelligence agency. Identity of those with whom he shared information is being verified,” he said.Four persons were also arrested in Arunachal Pradesh on espionage charges in the state over the last few weeks. Three of them are from Kupwara district in Kashmir, while the identity of the fourth has not yet been disclosed by police.DSP Bhumij said Sharma’s electronic devices revealed that he shared crucial information related to national security “and received instructions from the other side on WhatsApp”. The seized mobiles and laptops will be sent to the forensic lab for further analysis. Police, after receiving confidential information about Sharma’s Pakistani connections, picked him up from his house in Patiachuburi locality of Tezpur.Sharma retired from IAF in 2002, and worked as a technical assistant in the department of electronics and communication engineering at Tezpur University before leaving his job three years ago.Tezpur is the headquarters of the Army’s IV Corps and has vast parts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, including the Tawang frontier, under its operational jurisdiction. At Salonibari, just on the outskirts of Tezpur, IAF’s Sukhoi base is located.In Arunachal, Hilal Ahm-ed (26), a J&K resident, was apprehended from Aalo in West Siang district, while an unidentified individual was arrested at Miao in Changlang. Hilal, who arrived in Aalo from Papum Pare district on Nov 25 to sell clothes at a trade fair, was sending sensitive information to his handlers, police said.

Indian NGO Highlights Dalits, Minorities Rights In India At UNHRC Side Event

NEW DELHI: Unveiling details of his brain child ‘Unified Judicial Policy’ (UJP), CJI Surya Kant on Saturday said courts will give top priority to cases relating to personal liberty, ensure predictability in decisions relating to commercial and economic matters to foster investor confidence, and deal empathetically with disputes relating to family, consumers and social justice.Speaking at the Regional Judicial Conference at Jaisalmer, the CJI said citizens approach courts not only to seek remedies but with the hope that the law will be applied consistently, liberties will be guarded, rights will be clarified and govts will be held accountable.He said predictability of the justice delivery system, pruned of legal jargon, is important to further public understanding and maintain faith in the system. Predictability is rooted in consistency, reason, precedent and timely disposal, he said, adding, “investors look for it, accused persons rely on it, families hope for it and society depends on it.”“A justice system that operates unpredictably or without clear guiding principles inevitably weakens public confidence because litigants cannot anticipate how similar cases will be treated or when their matters will be resolved,” CJI Kant said.“When judicial outcomes reflect principled reasoning, consistent application of law and transparent evolution of doctrine, confidence in the courts is strengthened, as people come to understand justice is not dependent on chance but guided by established norms. ”Technology has evolved into a constitutional instrument that strengthens equality before the law, expands access to justice and enhances institutional efficiency. It allows the judiciary to transcend physical barriers and bureaucratic rigidities to deliver outcomes that are timely, transparent and principled.Justice systems, one headed by HCs in the states and the other operated nationally by SC, are not operating in parallel, he said while underscoring the need for UJP, under which technology will be the engine to ensure convergence of the two systems by harmonising procedural norms, prioritising cases, removing delays and formatting coherently judgments across jurisdictions. “But technology alone cannot sustain the Rule of Law; it must operate alongside the deeper constitutional traditions that anchor judicial behaviour and preserve institutional coherence,” he said.CJI Kant said uniformity in judgment and reasoning is a must in cases of similar nature. “A Unified Judicial Policy is not merely an administrative doctrine; it is the architecture of constitutional confidence. It strengthens the idea that our courts are not isolated entities but parts of one Republic, driven by common values, delivering coherent justice,” he said.“Ultimately, the measure of innovation is not the complexity of the software we deploy, but the simplicity with which a citizen understands the outcome of their case and believes that justice has been served,” he stressed.",Chief Justice of India Surya Kant unveils details of his brain child ‘Unified Judicial Policy’ (UJP) He said courts will give top priority to cases relating to personal liberty.

Heart disease leading cause of sudden deaths under 45: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-disease-leading-cause-of-sudden-deaths-under-45-study/articleshow/125954017.cms,"Keep your heart young post-30s with these 4 simple ways

.

NEW DELHI: Sudden deaths are no longer confined to old age. An AIIMS study has found that more than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45 — many of them apparently healthy, who collapsed without warning at home or while travelling.Published this month in Indian Journal of Medical Research as part of an ongoing Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) project, the cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2023 and April 2024 at the departments of pathology and forensic medicine at AIIMS New Delhi. Of the 2,214 autopsies analysed, 180 cases — 8.1% — met the criteria for sudden death. Young adults aged 18–45 accounted for 103 of these cases, or 57.2%, with an average age of 33.6 years and a strong male predominance.Heart disease emerged as the leading cause. Dr Sudhir Gupta, from AIIMS’s department of forensic medicine and an author of the study, said cardiovascular conditions accounted for 42.6% of sudden deaths in the young. Most had advanced coronary artery disease with severe blockages, often without any prior diagnosis, indicating that fatal heart disease had progressed silently. Respiratory causes — such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and asphyxia — accounted for a little over one in five deaths.More than one-fifth of deaths in young adults remained unexplained despite detailed imaging, full autopsy and microscopic examination. These “negative autopsy” cases point to hidden electrical or genetic heart disorders that routine investigations may miss.Most deaths occurred at home or during travel, frequently at night or early morning. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom reported by families, followed by chest pain and breathlessness. Only a small number of young adults had known conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.Lifestyle risks were common across the cases examined. Over half of those who died young were smokers or consumed alcohol — rates similar to those for older adults. The study found no significant link between sudden deaths and Covid infection or vaccination — vaccination coverage was high across age groups.Among adults aged 46–65, coronary artery disease was even more predominant, accounting for over 70% of sudden deaths.Commenting on the findings, Dr K K Talwar, chairman, PSRI Heart Institute, said the study highlights a disturbing rise in premature coronary artery disease. He noted that many unexplained deaths occur likely due to inherited electrical disorders of the heart, which routine autopsies cannot detect, underscoring the need for genetic testing and family screening. He stressed early preventive check-ups, strict avoidance of tobacco and alcohol, and routine heart evaluations in younger people, while reiterating there is no evidence linking Covid vaccination to sudden cardiac deaths.Researchers warn that sudden death in the young often stems from underlying disease, making early detection critical. With fatal events striking earlier in life, the study flags an urgent public health challenge: identifying silent heart disease before it turns deadly.","More than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

NEW DELHI: With air quality worsening sharply across the Delhi-NCR, authorities on Saturday invoked the strictest restrictions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan, triggering emergency curbs across the region. This comes hours after implementation of GRAP stage III measured in the national capital region.The Commission for Air Quality Management said its GRAP sub-committee had decided to enforce all measures under Stage IV or ‘Severe+’ air quality with immediate effect after pollution levels crossed critical thresholds. In an official statement, the panel said, “Keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and in an effort to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the region, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP decides to invoke all actions as envisaged under Stage-IV of the extant GRAP ‘Severe+’ Air Quality (DELHI AQI > 450), with immediate effect, in the entire NCR. ” It added that these steps would be in addition to restrictions already in force under Stages I, II and III.In an official order, the government directed that all administrative secretaries and heads of departments shall attend office regularly, with no more than 50 per cent staff strength physically present.""The remaining 50 per cent staff shall work from home, provided that the Administrative Secretaries and Heads of Departments can call officers/officials to the office, as required to ensure uninterrupted delivery of essential and emergency public services,"" the order read.Likewise, the order stipulated that all private offices operating within Delhi shall function with no more than 50 per cent staff physically attending the workplace.""The remaining staff shall mandatorily work from home,"" it added. The order also urged all private entities to implement staggered working hours where feasible. Furthermore, private offices have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with work-from-home norms and minimise vehicular movement related to office commutes.""Hospitals and other public/private health establishments, Fire Services, Prisons, Public Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation and related municipal services, disaster management and related services, forest and environment departments/agencies engaged in air pollution control, monitoring, and enforcement activities (like teams deployed to curb biomass burning, dust control, GRAP measures, etc. ), and other essential/emergency services shall be exempted from these directions,"" the order said.The decision came hours after Delhi slipped back into the ‘severe’ category, prompting the reimposition of Stage III curbs earlier in the day. According to official data, the city’s Air Quality Index, which stood at 349 on Friday evening, surged overnight and was recorded at 401 by Saturday morning due to slow wind speeds, a stable atmosphere and unfavourable meteorological conditions that hampered the dispersion of pollutants.According to news agency ANI, As of 7.00 PM, AQI readings were 488 in Anand Vihar, 434 in Ashok Vihar, 496 in Bawana, 457 in Burari, 479 in Chandini Chowk, 394 in IGI Airport, and 445 in Okhla Phase-2.Also read: Delhi AQI turns 'severe': GRAP Stage III reimposed across NCR; what's allowed & what's not A dense layer of smog enveloped the capital on Saturday morning, reducing visibility and intensifying health concerns. Wazirpur recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 445, followed by Vivek Vihar at 444, Jahangirpuri at 442 and Anand Vihar at 439. Several other areas, including Rohini, Ashok Vihar, Narela, Mundka and Bawana, also remained in the ‘severe’ range.Poor air quality conditions extended beyond Delhi, with parts of Uttar Pradesh also reporting dense smog. Noida sectors recorded AQI levels of 448, while visibility dropped in cities such as Bulandshahr, Ayodhya and Mainpuri amid fog and haze.Under CPCB norms, an AQI between 401 and 500 is classified as ‘severe’ and poses serious health risks, particularly for children, the elderly and those with respiratory ailments.

Clocking out, calling it out: How three generations are quietly (and not-so-quietly) redefining office life

“Always comparing who does more work and who doesn't, mostly in a fun way but it gets you sometimes.”

Yes. I don’t care.

Walk into any corporate office today, and you’re likely to witness a scene that feels less like a workplace and more like a group project assigned by the universe. On one end of the floor, a Boomer is carefully crafting an email that begins with “Dear Team,” while a GenZ intern is wondering why the email wasn’t simply replaced by a three-second voice note. In between them sits a Millennial, holding a reusable coffee cup and the emotional weight of being sandwiched between two generations who insistwere raised the hard way.Welcome to the modern office: a place where three generations collide daily, armed with their own communication styles, work philosophies, and deeply held opinions. For example, whether “…” at the end of a message is a passive-aggressive statement or simply a grammatically correct continuation. It’s a space where Boomers are still trying to understand why anyone needs a “mental health day,” Millennials are trying to avoid burnout for the third time this quarter, and GenZ is trying to figure out how to turn their hobby into a side hustle during lunch break.While all three cohorts technically have the same job descriptions, they often approach work like they’re playing different levels of the same video game. Boomers operate by the rulebook, because of course therea rulebook, and have mastered the fine art of surviving long meetings without blinking.Millennials rely on collaboration, Google Docs, and the burning desire to appear competent at all times. GenZ, meanwhile, is speedrunning corporate life with tabs open to both the shared drive and Instagram reels.Yet for all their differences, what makes this intergenerational mash-up particularly entertaining is just how much each group believes the others are a little bit unusual. Boomers think Millennials take too many notes. Millennials think Boomers send emails like they’re writing novels. GenZ thinks everyone sends too many emails altogether.Still, somehow, work gets done. Projects are completed, presentations are delivered, and HR quietly updates its conflict-resolution guidelines every quarter. What looks like chaos from the outside is, in reality, a delicate balancing act: Boomers bring consistency, Millennials bring efficiency, and GenZ brings innovation with a dash of existential comedy.So if you’ve ever wondered why the office feels like a sitcom missing its laugh track, you’re simply witnessing the daily dance of three generations doing their best to navigate a changing work culture, one shared spreadsheet and misunderstood emoji at a time.Baby Boomers or Boomers, Millennials and Generation Z are often spoken about in shorthand, but each group comes with its own backstory and work style shaped by the times they grew up in. Baby Boomers, born roughly between 1946 and 1964, are the only generation officially defined by a government body, the US Census Bureau, named after the post–World War Two surge in births, as cited by the BBC. In the workplace, they’re known for being committed, self-sufficient and competitive, traits that perhaps come from growing up in a crowded, fast-growing world where standing out mattered.Millennials, born approximately between 1980 and the mid-1990s, are the most debated and stereotyped generation, often unfairly labelled as “lazy” or frivolous. In reality, they were the first true digital natives, growing up alongside the internet, which made them confident, curious and highly self-reliant.GenZ, the youngest cohort, includes those born in the late 1990s or early 2000s and has never known a world without smartphones, social media or constant connectivity. Often called iGen, they are ambitious, tech-savvy and confident, entering workplaces with fresh expectations and an instinctive comfort with digital tools. Together, these generations bring very different perspectives to the same office floor, shaped not just by age, but by history, technology and the worlds they grew up navigating.When asked,Aastha Jha, a member of Generation Z, didn’t hesitate:Soumya Banerjee, working in an IT firm, shared a different frustration. He pointed to a familiar pattern he’s noticed among seniors:The woes of a millennial are quite different. On asked how it feels to be sandwiched between the boomers and GenZs, Natasha said, “while millenials have been at the end of Boomer toxic culture, it is a nice spot to be in. While we have grown up listening to stories about the times they had to work during serious physical illnesses, the humour of a GenZ asking for a leave because they 'are not feeling the vibes' is not lost on you. ”Sneha had a simple answer for the question of whether she had ever felt judged for logging off exactly on time:When a Boomer was asked, 'what is the biggest change you have noticed in workplace culture?', the response reflected decades of experience: “There has been a big change in workplace culture in 20–25 years, and most of the changes have been for the better. The pace of work has increased, and people have adapted to that pace. Twenty-five years ago, no matter which sector you were working in, the availability of technological tools was not as easy. There was no AI, social media, or even computers were not as actively used as they are currently. So the pace has increased due to new technology being introduced. And secondly, you have a younger workforce in every field. People have been taking up responsibilities that could only be taken by someone senior.”Coming from someone who has been part of the workforce for the past 30 years, the reflection highlights how technology and a younger workforce have reshaped how fast work gets done.He also noted that the younger generation needs to develop 'ownership of work', something that they can learn from the work ethics of the older generation. ""People do a lot of work, but at times, you feel that there is no ownership of that specific work,"" he said.HR professionals, on the other hand, today find themselves acting as cultural interpreters, peacekeepers as they navigate the competing expectations of all three generations. They must balance Boomers’ preference for structure and visibility with Millennials’ need for flexibility and Gen Z’s insistence on boundaries and mental well-being.This often means redesigning policies, rewriting communication norms, and mediating misunderstandings that arise from everything from email etiquette to attitudes toward overtime. For HR, the challenge isn’t choosing sides, it’s creating a workplace ecosystem where all three generations feel heard, respected, and able to collaborate without turning every team meeting into a generational tug-of-war.When asked whether the recruitment strategy has undergone any significant changes to accommodate younger professionals, Karan , an HR executive, said, “The strategy has undergone a significant transformation, now prioritising Authenticity and Investment in Marketability to secure the newest wave of talent. Messaging focuses less on abstract corporate rhetoric and more on demonstrating the company's commitment to tangible skill development and job security, appealing directly to the risk-averse nature of younger professionals. Recruitment outreach is concentrated on high-engagement digital forums and specialised professional networks, employing candid employee testimonials to convey a transparent, genuine culture.”He also explains that for Millennials, staying with a company often depends on seeing a clear, fast-paced career path and knowing the organisation is genuinely committed to social impact through its CSR or ESG efforts. When it comes to older professionals, he says the key is to position them in meaningful advisory roles and provide strong technical support, so their deep experience and institutional knowledge remain an active part of the company’s modern, hybrid way of working.Ultimately, the generational divide in today’s workplaces is less about conflict and more about coexistence in transition. Boomers, Millennials, and GenZ are all responding to the same pressures, faster work, changing technologies and evolving ideas of success, just in different ways, shaped by their experiences. As offices continue to adapt, the challenge is not to declare one generation “right” and another “wrong,” but to find common ground where experience meets adaptability and ambition meets balance. As work culture evolves, offices have the chance to become spaces that value both productivity and people, whether that’s through a formal “Dear Team,” a sharp log-off, or a “no vibes today” day off.","Baby Boomers, Millennials and Generation Z are often spoken about in shorthand.

The governor has given written permission to the UP government to go ahead in its wholly illegal and unjust attempt to subvert the processes of justice and to withdraw the entire case even though the main witness has already given evidence,” she said in letter.Karat highlighted that the victim’s daughter had already testified in court, naming and identifying all accused, with two other direct witnesses yet to give statements.She alleged that the UP government cited minor grounds such as use of lathis instead of guns, lack of personal animosity, and potential communal tension to justify withdrawing the case. “This is motivated not to meet the ends of justice but to subvert the entire judicial process,” Karat wrote.She also questioned whether the governor had a duty to counsel the state government against such a move.“Should the governor not counsel the government against such a step? Is it not the duty of the governor to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law?” she asked.Karat urged the President to intervene and direct the governor to revoke the permission given to the state to withdraw the case. She noted the urgency, as the government affidavit, approved by the governor, was scheduled to be discussed in court on December 12 but was postponed at the prosecution’s request.The Dadri lynching, which sparked nationwide outrage, occurred after a mob attacked Akhlaq and his son following an alleged temple announcement claiming he had slaughtered a cow.

""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

NEW DELHI: Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) on Saturday opposed former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi’s request to transfer criminal cases from the court of Special Judge Vishal Gogne, arguing before a Delhi court that the plea amounted to “forum-shopping” and was meant to “demean the judge” and interfere with the justice system.Appearing before Principal District and Sessions Judge Dinesh Bhatt, Senior Advocate DP Singh, representing the CBI, said the transfer application made unfounded allegations against the judiciary and was an attempt to pressure the trial court. He maintained that an accused has no right to seek a change of forum merely because the case is not proceeding in their favour.“You cannot bulldoze a court. You cannot go forum shopping. You cannot demean a judge,” Singh told the court, stressing that such conduct strikes at the independence and dignity of the judicial process.The CBI counsel submitted that Special Judge Gogne had acted strictly in accordance with procedures laid down by higher courts and established judicial practice. He argued that the transfer plea was filed with the intention of stalling the trial at a critical stage.Addressing Rabri Devi’s allegation that Judge Gogne had intentionally delayed the order on framing of charges in the IRCTC corruption case to align with the enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct for the Bihar elections, Singh rejected the claim as baseless.He explained that the court had merely sought clarifications from the investigating agency, which was part of its judicial duty.“These clarifications were sought for the court’s clarity and conscience. It is the duty of the judge to ask questions,” Singh submitted.Judge Bhatt heard the submissions in detail and scheduled the matter for further hearing on December 15, 2025.In her application, Rabri Devi sought the transfer of four cases pending before Judge Gogne, in which she and several members of her family are named as accused. The cases include the IRCTC scam, the alleged land-for-jobs case, and related money-laundering proceedings.Earlier, on October 13, Judge Gogne framed criminal charges against RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav , Rabri Devi, Tejashwi Yadav, and others in the IRCTC case.Rabri Devi alleged in her plea that the special judge is biased and conducting the trials with a premeditated mindset. She has claimed that he is “unduly inclined” towards the prosecution, creating a reasonable apprehension of bias. The CBI has rejected these allegations, describing them as an effort to scandalise the court and delay the trial.","Rabri Devi seeks transfer of four cases pending before Special Judge Vishal Gogne.

On the afternoon of December 13, 2001, India witnessed a deadly assault on its democracy. A group of Pakistan-trained terrorists drove into the Parliament complex in a stolen white ambassador car and opened fire, leading to a gun battle that lasted nearly half an hour.For millions who watched the chaos unfolding live on television, the threat of terrorism suddenly felt far more real than ever before. For the first time, what had remained confined to the 'pushed its way to the very periphery ofIt was a day that forced India to confront a question it had not asked so urgently until then. How vulnerable was the soul of Indian democracy?The terrorists, armed with automatic rifles, grenades and explosives, moved with a precision that caught security personnel off guard. They had arrived in an ambassador fitted with a counterfeit home ministry sticker and Parliament labels, a deception that helped them pass through the initial barricades.The suspicious movement of the beacon-fitted white car was first spotted by CRPF's woman constable Kamlesh Kumari and Watch and Ward staff JP Yadav when it entered from the main gate on Parliament Street and started speeding.Both JP Yadav and Kamlesh Kumari ran from gate number 11 to stop it, only to fall to the bullets of theKumari was awarded the Ashok Chakra by the President for her valiant effort. The Ashok Chakra is India’s highest peacetime gallantry award given for exemplary courage and self-sacrifice away from the battlefield.After abandoning the car at gate 11, the terrorists ran towards gate number one, where head constable YB Thapa and constable Sukhvinder Singh, taking guard behind a pillar and a wall, fired at one of the terrorists, a(suicide bomber), who blew himself up.Within minutes, the Parliament complex, typically defined by routine movement during the winter session, was transformed into a war-like zone. Gunfire crackled across the grounds. Smoke drifted through the corridors. Officers scrambled for cover as calls for reinforcements echoed across the compound.Realising they had triggered a full-blown response, the attackers scaled a wall near Gate 11, shed their civilian clothes and revealed olive-green fatigues. Each carried a Kalashnikov assault rifle, ammunition and several grenades.Security forces reacted quickly. Personnel from the CRPF, Delhi Police and Parliament Security cordoned off the area and engaged the gunmen. A fierce gunfight erupted as the terrorists attempted to breach deeper into the complex.The confrontation lasted a little under thirty minutes but left an impact far beyond its duration. One terrorist detonated his suicide vest after being shot by security forces. The others were neutralised before they could enter the main building, where hundreds of Members of Parliament (MPs) were gathered.By the end of the encounter, nine people had died, including six security personnel and gardener Desh Raj, who was caught in the sudden barrage of bullets, along with the five terrorists.Eighteen others were injured, among them twelve security personnel and a television cameraman who had been covering the events of the day.The bravery of the security teams prevented what could have escalated into an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Yet the proximity of the attack to the nation’s elected representatives exposed a terrifying reality.India's most protected address had been penetrated with alarming ease!Investigations identified the attackers as Pakistani nationals linked to Hafiz Saeed’s Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Masood Azhar’s Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), two groups that Indian intelligence agencies and global counter-terror networks had already flagged as rising threats in the region.The five terrorists were Hamza, Haider, Rana, Raja and Mohammad, who were trained at the direction of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).The attack was the outcome of a pact between JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar and Zakir-ur-Rehman of LeT, the then Delhi Police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma had said soon after the incident.Indian agencies found strong evidence suggesting that the assault was conceived as a symbolic attack meant to cripple India’s sovereignty. The attackers reportedly intended to storm the main building and take lawmakers hostage or kill them, an outcome that would have pushed the subcontinent into an extreme and unpredictable crisis.The Delhi Police Special Cell took charge of the investigation. Within days, they traced the conspiracy to a network of handlers, facilitators and contacts in Delhi and Kashmir.Mohammed Afzal Guru emerged as the key figure who had arranged logistics for the attackers. He secured the car used in the attack, provided a safe house and coordinated communication between the terrorists and their handlers.His cousin, Shaukat Hussain Guru, along with Shaukat’s wife, Afsan Guru, were arrested for aiding elements of the plot. Delhi University lecturer SAR Geelani was also taken into custody but was later acquitted on appeal.Investigators recovered coded documents, explosives and communication devices from hideouts connected to the group. They also uncovered detailed reconnaissance notes that showed the terrorists had surveyed the Parliament complex days before the attack.Afzal Guru was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death for his role as the main conspirator. After years of legal proceedings and political debate, he was executed in 2013.The Parliament attack led to Operation Parakram, one of the largest military mobilisations on the India-Pakistan border since the 1971 war. Nearly half a million troops were deployed along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border. The two nuclear-armed neighbours stood eyeball to eyeball for almost ten months.India identified Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as the force supporting the terror infrastructure behind the attack. Islamabad, however, denied the charges but faced intense global pressure to take action.General Pervez Musharraf , then Pakistan’s President, condemned terrorism publicly and, in a hogwash attempt, announced a ban on Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other extremist organisations. Musharraf also promised reforms in madrassa regulation, which was, again, a load of baloney.The Parliament attack forced India to rethink its internal security architecture. Parliament received a massive overhaul in surveillance, access control and perimeter security. Agencies adopted more coordinated protocols, and several new counter-terror mechanisms were institutionalised.The attack also exposed weaknesses in intelligence sharing. A series of post-incident reviews led to reforms in how intelligence agencies exchanged information and monitored cross-border terror networks.India’s counter-terror approach became more centralised, structured and technologically driven in the years that followed.Parliament became one of the most heavily guarded zones in the country, with multi-layered access control, biometric passes, expanded CCTV coverage, permanent Quick Reaction Teams and strengthened perimeter checks.Similar upgrades were carried out across other high-security government buildings, including the Seva Teerth (PMO) and Rashtrapati Bhavan.Intelligence-sharing mechanisms between the Intelligence Bureau, R&AW, Delhi Police and state agencies were streamlined to allow real-time information flow.Counter-terror units such as the Special Cell and the National Security Guard saw significant expansion in manpower, training and equipment, with greater emphasis on urban combat readiness, surveillance technology and coordinated response drills.Security forces received modernised weapons, protective gear and communication systems, while airports underwent rigorous audits and enhanced screening protocols to plug vulnerabilities exposed by past terror operations.The passage of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) in 2002 strengthened the legal framework for tackling terror networks and handling terror-related evidence. VIP protection protocols were revised, with tighter security during Parliament sessions and dedicated commando teams for ministers.In 2002, a designated POTA court convicted Afzal Guru of conspiracy and waging war against the nation, holding that the attack could not have been executed without his support, even though he was not part of the armed assault inside Parliament. He was sentenced to death. The same court convicted his cousin, Shaukat Hussain Guru, but acquitted Afsan Guru and SAR Geelani due to the lack of evidence.The Delhi high court upheld Afzal Guru’s death sentence in 2003. In 2005, the Supreme Court confirmed the conviction and sentence, ruling that the chain of circumstantial evidence proved his role in the conspiracy and that the case met the “rarest of rare” standard.Afzal Guru filed a mercy petition with the President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2006. After prolonged delay, the petition was rejected in February 2013. He was executed by hanging at Tihar Jail on February 9, 2013, ending one of India’s most closely scrutinised terror-related legal cases.The execution immediately triggered political reactions across the spectrum over the prolonged delay in carrying out the sentence. While the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government maintained that the hanging followed due legal process, the then home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said all legal and constitutional procedures had been exhausted.Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi also stated that the law had taken its course and urged against politicising the execution.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) welcomed the execution but criticised the government for not acting sooner despite the Supreme Court’s 2005 verdict. Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley described the hanging as “delayed justice,” while then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said it was “better late than never,” questioning why the sentence had remained pending for years.The Parliament attack is not just an event in the archives of India’s national security history. It is a reference point that continues to influence how India perceives, prepares for and responds to terror threats.Every major terror alert, every security drill at critical installations, and every diplomatic exchange with Pakistan carries, somewhere beneath the surface, the weight of December 13, 2001.It remains a reminder of how close India came to a catastrophe that could have altered the country’s constitutional and democratic fabric. It also stands as a testament to the security personnel who prevented that outcome, often at the cost of their own lives.For a generation born after 2001, the Parliament attack may seem like a distant chapter in history. But the recent terror strike in Delhi, after more than a decade, abruptly rekindled that memory, revealing how deeply such attacks have shaped India’s sense of vulnerability, its security framework and its public consciousness.On the evening of November 10, horror pierced through the heart of the Capital. Delhiites followed the development with nerves stretched thin and bated breath as fear surged through the collective memory. Fear that revived chilling reminders of the years when a palpable dread lived rent-free in the subconscious of every citizen, particularly those in metros.The terror incident in the heart of thereopened old wounds from the past, with the attack on Parliament, which is around 6.5 km away from the Red Fort, being the first thought to resurface for many.","A group of Pakistan-trained terrorists drove into the Parliament complex in a stolen white ambassador car and opened fire.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday launched a sharp attack on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee over the chaos at Kolkata’s Salt Lake stadium during Argentine football star Lionel Messi’s appearance, with Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari accusing the state government of gross mismanagement and making three demands, including Banerjee ’s resignation.Reacting to the disorder at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan, Adhikari posted on X, saying, ""Shame on you, Mamata Banerjee ! The 'Khela Hobe' Circus Turns into a TMC Loot-Fest at Yuva Bharati ! What a pathetic spectacle in Kolkata today ! Our football-crazed Bengali Fans, dreaming of a glimpse of the GOAT Lionel Messi, shelled out thousands for tickets, only to be treated like second-class citizens in their own state.

Messi, accompanied by Luis Suárez and Rodrigo De Paul, arrived at the venue around 11.30 am but remained tightly cordoned off by security and VIPs. His brief appearance and early exit sparked anger among spectators, leading to vandalism, slogan-shouting and a police baton charge to control the crowd.Meanwhile, BJP MP and spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi in a press conference said, ""The kind of mismanagement and sophistry took place, ashamed every Indian... Mamata Banerjee tweeted that she is 'deeply disturbed by this event', but I want to clear that it is West Bengal which is deeply devastated under your rule...

This shows that the leadership in these states consider itself above the law...

In a post on X, she apologised to Messi and football fans, saying, “I am deeply disturbed and shocked by the mismanagement witnessed today at Salt Lake stadium.” She announced that a committee headed by retired Calcutta High Court judge Justice Ashim Kumar Ray would investigate the episode, fix responsibility and recommend corrective measures.The disorder also drew criticism from Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose, who termed it a dark day for Kolkata’s sports culture and called for action against the organisers. Ticket prices for the event ranged from Rs 4,500 to Rs 10,000, and many fans said they had spent large sums only to leave disappointed.The episode has since escalated into a political flashpoint, with the BJP accusing the Trinamool Congress of turning a marquee sporting event into what Adhikari described as a ""corrupt circus,"" while the state government has promised accountability through a formal probe.",BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari accuses West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of gross mismanagement of Lionel Messi's visit to Kolkata.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday criticised the Central government after the Union cabinet approved a bill to rename the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee act ( MGNREGA ), questioning why Mahatma Gandhi’s name needed to be dropped and accusing the Centre of focusing on rebranding rather than reform.Reacting to the Cabinet decision, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the government was a “dhurandhar” at renaming schemes and laws. “They renamed the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and the rural LPG distribution programme to Ujjwala. They are experts in re-packaging and branding,” he told PTI.Ramesh questioned the rationale behind the move, saying, “They hate Pandit Nehru but it seems they also hate Mahatma Gandhi. What’s wrong with the name Mahatma Gandhi, why rename the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to Pujya Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme?”PTI citing Sources said the Cabinet on Friday cleared a Bill to rename the scheme as ‘Pujya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojna’ and increase the guaranteed number of workdays from the current 100 to 125 days.Congress general secretary in-charge organisation K C Venugopal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who had earlier described MGNREGA as a “monument of failure”, was now renaming the scheme to claim credit for it.“It’s yet another way of erasing Mahatma Gandhi from our national psyche, especially from the villages, where, he said, India’s soul resides,” he alleged in a post on X.Venugopal also accused the government of neglecting the scheme, saying the renaming was a “cosmetic change”.“MGNREGA workers have been demanding higher wages, but the Centre has been reducing allocated funds for the scheme year after year,” he said, alleging that mounting arrears reflected a “carefully planned strategy to engineer a slow death for the scheme”.“But Mr Modi, rename it all you want, the people know it was Dr Manmohan Singh ji and Smt Sonia Gandhi ji who brought this transformative scheme to every village of India,” Venugopal added.Enacted in 2005, MGNREGA is a flagship rural employment programme that guarantees at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to rural households whose adult members undertake unskilled manual work.",Cabinet on Friday cleared a Bill to rename the scheme as ‘Pujya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojna’ and increase the guaranteed number of workdays from the current 100 to 125 days.

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister and ex-Congress leader Ashwani Kumar claimed that there could not be an effective opposition than Congress, however, the party has ""somewhere lost ground.

Congress will have to strengthen itself from within by looking inwards, by introspecting. For example, Rahul Gandhi, his heart is in the right place. He is an idealist. He speaks for the poor.

NEW DELHI: The storm over the chief ministerial post resurfaced again after Congress MLA H A Iqbal Hussain on Saturday claimed that D K Shivakumar will take over the top job on January 6.Hussain said that DKS should be made the chief minister and that CM Siddaramaiah should vacate the post for him. He predicted that “there is a 99 per cent chance” that DKS will become CM on January 6.When asked about the significance of the date, he said, “I don’t know. It’s just a random number. Everybody is saying this. It can either be January 6 or 9. These are the two dates.”Hussain has been demanding that Shivakumar be made the chief minister. On Friday, he had made his wish public.This comes a day after DKS met over 30 Congress legislators and ministers for a dinner meeting late Thursday night in Belagavi, amid ongoing speculation about potential leadership changes in the state government.According to news agency PTI sources, the dinner gathering included prominent ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya and Dr M C Sudhakar, and several MLAs, including N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai and K Y Nanjegowda.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar further fuelled speculation after claiming that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after the Congress won a landslide victory in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.Amid the ongoing speculation, the party high command had recently instructed both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar to meet over breakfast at each other’s residences.

Tharoor congratulates NDA

'A detailed review will be conducted at all levels'

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA on Saturday made massive gains in Kerala after clinching a majority in the Thiruvananthapuram civic body elections -- held by Left parties for 45 years.Out of 101 wards in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the BJP won 50, the LDF 29, the UDF 19, while two went to independent candidates.Additionally, the NDA retained the Palakkad municipality after a close battle with the Congress-led UDF and wrested the Thrippunithura Municipality from the grand old party.In Thrissur, the BJP won 18 out of the 46 wards in Kodungallur Municipality, eight in Thrissur Corporation, two each in Guruvayoor and Vadakkancherry municipalities, seven in Kunnamkulam Municipality, six in Irinjalakuda Municipality and one in Chalakudy Municipality. It also won four wards in block panchayats and 167 in grama panchayats, but none in the district panchayat in Thrissur district.According to the State Election Commission, the NDA has won 1,402 grama panchayat wards and 53 block panchayat wards across Kerala.These also include 11 wards in the Kollam Corporation, 13 in the Kozhikode Corporation, four in the Kannur Corporation and six in the Kochi Corporation, where it finished third in these local bodies.This comes as the Kerala Assembly election is scheduled for April next year. In the 2021 polls, the BJP had drawn a blank, while the Left Democratic Front retained power with 99 seats. Meanwhile, the United Democratic Front won the remaining 41 seats in the 140-member assembly.Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed the mandate received by the BJP-led NDA in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation a “watershed moment” in Kerala politics and expressed gratitude to BJP workers for the “spectacular results”.“Thank you Thiruvananthapuram! The mandate the BJP-NDA got in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is a watershed moment in Kerala’s politics,” he wrote on X.PM Modi said people were certain that the development aspirations of Kerala could only be addressed by the BJP. “Our party will work towards this vibrant city’s growth and boost ‘Ease of Living’ for the people,” he said, using the hashtag #VikasitaThiruvananthapuram.BJP leader Shaun George expressed confidence that the NDA would make gains in central and south Kerala, claiming a shift of traditional UDF and Kerala Congress voters towards the BJP.“We are very confident that the BJP will secure a good margin in the central Kerala belt, and we will also achieve a strong victory this time in south Kerala. People who have traditionally depended on the UDF and Kerala Congress will shift their support to the BJP this time,” he told news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor congratulated the BJP on its historic performance in Kerala, saying the results show a notable shift in the capital’s political landscape.“What a day of amazing results in the Kerala local self-government elections! The mandate is clear, and the democratic spirit of the state shines through,” Tharoor said on X.“A huge congratulations to @UDFKerala for a truly impressive win across various local bodies! This is a massive endorsement and a powerful signal ahead of the state legislative elections. Hard work, a strong message and anti-incumbency have all clearly paid off to achieve a much better result than in 2020,” the Congress MP said.“I also want to acknowledge the historic performance of the BJP in Thiruvananthapuram, and offer humble congratulations on their significant victory in the city Corporation — a strong showing that marks a notable shift in the capital’s political landscape. I campaigned for a change from 45 years of LDF misrule, but the voters have ultimately rewarded another party that also sought a clear change in governance,” he added.CPM state secretary MV Govindan expressed shock over the result and said a detailed review will be conducted at all levels and necessary corrections will be made.""The LDF has suffered an unexpected setback. A detailed review will be conducted at all levels and necessary corrections will be made. The LDF in Kerala has a history of moving forward by making timely course corrections, and it had effectively overcome the defeat of 2010,"" He said.""There has been no fundamental erosion in the base of the Left Democratic Front. The UDF contested the elections by aligning with communal forces. There were instances where UDF votes went to the BJP and BJP votes were transferred to defeat the LDF,"" he added.""Despite claims of a BJP victory in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the party failed to make significant gains elsewhere. The LDF has won the Pandalam Municipality, which includes key centres linked to Sabarimala. In the previous local body elections, the LDF had secured a massive victory, and the state government has delivered unparalleled achievements to Kerala. Why these achievements did not translate into electoral gains needs to be examined. Possible organisational shortcomings will also be reviewed in detail.

If there was strong anti-LDF sentiment, how could the front have won seven district panchayats?” he further said.","BJP-led NDA makes massive gains in Kerala after clinching majority in civic body elections.

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said. The brothers have turned 'wanted' after fleeing the country following last week's blaze at their club in Goa that claimed 25 lives. They had fled to Phuket, Thailand and were staying at a hotel.Goa police had requested Interpol, through MEA and CBI, for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by Interpol.The regional passport office in Delhi had issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days. Their passports were subsequently declared invalid, easing the execution of Indian request for their detention.According to Goa police, the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on Dec 7, even as firefighting operations were under way. By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.By morning, a Goa police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa police,"" a police officer said.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday (Dec 6) during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

'PM Not Always Wrong': Ex-Congress Leader Ashwani Kumar, Calls Party Revival A National Obligation

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister Ashwani Kumar on Friday said there cannot be an effective opposition in the country without the Congress, but added that the party has “somewhere lost ground” and must revive itself as a “national obligation”.Speaking at the launch of his book Guardians of the Republic, Kumar said the Congress still has a crucial role in Indian democracy but needs to introspect. “Congress is a great party, and there cannot be an effective opposition in the country without it. It still has its influence across the country. But yes, somewhere it has lost ground,” he said.He said the party must focus on its own shortcomings instead of blaming rivals. “It must look inward for the weaknesses rather than finding fault with the opposition parties,” Kumar added.He also cautioned against viewing the present government in absolute terms. “The impression that this regime does everything wrong, that this prime minister does everything wrong, is also not correct,” Kumar said.Kumar also clarified his ideological position after leaving the Congress, saying he continues to respect the party and its leadership. “I may have left the party, but I have the highest personal respect for Sonia Gandhi for unfailingly maintaining civility and decency in public life. When there were so many people among whom she could choose to be a prime minister, she chose Manmohan Singh for his civility and dignity,” Kumar said.","Former Union minister Ashwani Kumar says there cannot be an effective opposition in the country without the Congress.

Rahul Gandhi Demands Unified National Response As Parliament Debates India’s Air Pollution Crisis

NEW DELHI: The air quality in Delhi sharply deteriorated to the ‘severe’ category on Saturday as a toxic greyish haze blanketed the city. The 24-hour average overall AQI released at 4pm was 431, as opposed to 349 a day earlier. However, the AQI subsequently slipped into the ‘severe plus’ category for the first time this year, reaching 452 at 8pm.This prompted CAQM to impose stringent measures under GRAP, first under stage 3 and then stage 4 as the air worsened, on the same day. No respite from hazardous air quality is expected on Sunday. Experts said the AQI spiked due to high emission loads and unfavourable meteorological conditions. The farm fire season is over, while an increase in moisture due to the formation of fog, calm winds, and inversion trapped the pollutants.Among the measures invoked are a ban on construction and demolition, no entry of non-essential trucks, hybrid mode for schools, and a ban on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles.The Delhi govt has directed that all govt and private offices operate at 50% strength, with the rest working from home. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the AQI rose rapidly on Saturday. It was 397 at 9am, in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category, but reached the severe range at 10am at 401.According to the India Meteorological Department, the lowest visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station, was observed at 400 metres at 8am. It improved to 500 metres at 9.30am.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said, “As the atmospheric conditions are turning unfavourable with low wind speed and poor dispersion of pollutants, high emissions from local sources are getting trapped, spiking the peak levels.”CAQM said a feeble western disturbance is approaching north-west India, and the prevailing meteorological condition has marked a reduction in wind speed, at times becoming calm, a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, and an increase in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. “Such conditions during the winter season are conducive to the formation of smog,” it said.","The 24-hour average overall AQI released at 4pm was 431, as opposed to 349 a day earlier.

Messi’s Kolkata Visit Turns Chaotic As Angry Fans Vandalise Banners At Salt Lake Stadium

KOLKATA: Frenzy at dawn. Fury by noon. Chaos by afternoon. Lionel Messi's much-hyped Kolkata appearance collapsed into bedlam at Salt Lake stadium Saturday after tens of thousands of fans who paid steep prices for a glimpse of the football icon saw him for barely minutes - if at all - before he was whisked away, triggering vandalism, pitch invasion and mass outrage.Around 60,000 fans, many in Argentina's blue-and-white stripes with ""Messi"" emblazoned on their backs, packed the stands from early morning. Tickets cost between Rs 5,000 and Rs 16,000. Expectations soared. Tempers snapped.Argentina's World Cup-winning captain stepped onto the pitch at 11.30am to a deafening roar. Within moments, he was engulfed by a crush of VIPs, officials and selfie-seekers. Fifteen minutes later, with the crowd around him refusing to thin out, Messi and Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul were pulled out for security reasons. The stands never got their moment.On the way out, Messi was briefly introduced to former India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, who had just arrived and taken a seat in a makeshift tent on the pitch. Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, scheduled to do a ceremonial lap with Messi, Suarez, De Paul and Ganguly, never entered the stadium. He waited outside, then left as the situation spiralled.When it became clear Messi would not return, the stadium exploded.The stadium — refurbished for the 2017 Under-17 FIFA World Cup — bore the brunt of the anger.Police were overwhelmed. Fearing a stampede, DGP Rajeev Kumar rushed to the venue and led crowd-control efforts for nearly 90 minutes. Officers avoided a lathi-charge, mindful of narrow exits and packed concourses. CM Mamata Banerjee, en route to the stadium, turned back after being briefed on the scenes. “Deeply disturbed and shocked by the mismanagement,” she wrote on X, ordering a probe to fix responsibility and recommend safeguards for future events.For Kolkata, it was a bitter contrast to memory. Messi’s visit in 2011 ended with Argentina beating Venezuela 1-0 at the same venue. This time, the superstar landed in the city early Saturday, attended a sponsor programme at his hotel, then arrived at the stadium smiling, waving and greeting former India players. Surrounded by politicians, celebrities, organisers and VIP pass-holders, he was scarcely visible to the paying crowd. “We never imagined the day would end in such a chaos,” said former India forward Dipendu Biswas, who managed to get his jersey signed.Behind the collapse lay a single, glaring problem: too many people where none should have been. Messi struggled to take a step as hundreds clustered around him .","Messi's much-hyped Kolkata appearance collapsed into bedlam at Salt Lake stadium.

No Pak film made on Lyari because those behind violence still in power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-pak-film-made-on-lyari-because-those-behind-violence-still-in-power/articleshow/125952289.cms,".

1. You have done more than a decade of fieldwork in

Lyari

, written multiple articles and even made a documentary. How did you first get drawn into Lyari as a research site?

2. Lyari’s tumultuous gang history has rarely featured in mainstream Pakistani cinema. Why have

filmmakers

stayed away?

3. There are stories of how

Rehman Dakait

ordered his associates to play football with the severed heads of rival gang members. Does the film’s portrayal of Dakait as the terrifying overlord of the area capture reality?

4. What aspects of Lyari life does your documentary ‘Shadowlands’ highlight—stories that rarely find space next to gang sensationalism?

5. Has the area got a makeover? It’s produced quite a few hip hop stars in the last few years, including female rappers.

6. ‘Dhurandhar’ has divided viewers both in India and Pakistan. It has even been banned in the Gulf.

7. You have studied feminist movements in both India and Pakistan, and in Lyari you did set out to show that feminism is not a dull, bleak affair and can be fun. Tell us about that.

8. You have written about how more women are participating in the fight for Baloch rights. To what extent has social media enabled this shift?

Interestingly, it was my PhD research, which I conducted in the area of Zakir Nagar in Delhi in the early 2000s, that drew me to Lyari. When I first visited Lyari in 2012, I realised that many of the issues I had explored in Zakir Nagar — such as the experiences of marginalisation and stigmatisation of Muslims in Delhi — were echoed by the residents there. Both Zakir Nagar and Lyari were considered dens of crime and terrorism by mainstream media, but the reality was far more complex.While the discrimination in Zakir Nagar was related largely to religious identity, the marginalisation in Lyari was connected more with ethnicity and class. I was drawn to the stories narrated by the residents of this area and by the diversity, vibrancy and rich history of this neighbourhood — an area proudly called ‘Karachi ki maan’ (the pride of Karachi) — by those who call it home.Perhaps the main reason Lyari’s conflict has not been the subject of a feature film or drama series in Pakistan is that those largely responsible for the violence are still in power —namely, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the military establishment, both of whom used Lyari for their own political purposes. The PPP countered the city’s most powerful political party at the time, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), by allying with criminal gangs in Lyari, thus strengthening their power.Furthermore, approximately 50% of Lyari’s 1.5 million residents are Baloch, and the area has long been an important site for Baloch political organising. Many residents believe that the military has an interest in supporting the gangs to counter Baloch nationalism in the area.‘Dhurandhar’ seems to be almost completely based on fantasy. The only thing the film gets right is the fact that Rehman Dakait existed and that he was powerful. However, Rehman is not remembered as a terrifying monster by residents of the area. While he was certainly feared and known to have a great capacity for violence, he was also respected by many in the community and was seen as a kind of Robin Hood figure who supported members of his community through charitable initiatives and social work.When he died, the country’s greatest philanthropist, Abdul Sattar Edhi, even attended his funeral. By the time the infamous football incident took place in 2013, Rehman had long been dead. This brutal act was ordered by Uzair Baloch along with another famous gangster, Baba Ladla.Karachi has gone through many cycles of violence over the past decades. In general, those in power allow the violence to continue as long as it suits their interests. When it starts to go out of their control, an ‘operation’ is launched to return the monopoly of violence back to the state. This is what happened in Lyari as well in 2013. While the dominant narrative after the ‘Karachi Operation’ was that peace had returned to Lyari and Karachi as a whole, few spoke of the thousands of people whose lives had been upended by the violence.‘Shadowlands’ tells the story of two people who lost members of their families during the conflict, either in encounter killings or in inter-gang violence. It shows how the scars of violence continue to colour the lives of residents after the conflict officially subsided and how the seeds of conflict — drugs, poverty, unemployment, and state neglect — remain in the area.One problem with ‘Dhurandhar’ is that it flattens the diversity and vibrancy of the area. Lyari has always been a hub for art and culture. It has also been influenced by global trends, particularly those tied to the African diaspora because it is home to many people who trace their origins to the African continent. I imagine hip hop and rap music resonated with the youth of Lyari because of cultural, political and social similarities shared with other urban areas globally where local forms of the genre have also emerged. In this sense, I would not say Lyari has had a makeover, but the relative peace following the years of gang war has certainly opened a space for art and culture to flourish in the area once again.Although I am not sure exactly what led to the ban, this reflects the growing resentment of Pakistanis (including those in the diaspora) to the caricatured and inaccurate depiction of their country in Bollywood films. Rehman Dakait’s entry song is actually in Arabic, which is not one of Pakistan’s indigenous languages, even if many learn it for religious purposes. It would make much more sense to have a song in Urdu or even Balochi. Arabic only feeds into the orientalist imagination of Pakistan as an ‘Islamic’ and, hence, ‘Arabised’ nation. Such exotic representations reinforce perceptions of Pakistanis as ‘other’.My work on feminism and fun in Lyari was an attempt to demonstrate how the women of Lyari (and women in Pakistan and Muslim women more generally) are not passive victims of violence. Rather, women and girls in Lyari push the boundaries of gender norms in their pursuit of fun and leisure, through quiet, everyday acts of resistance. They might not call this ‘feminism’, but that is not important. What is important is that they are challenging gender boundaries in multiple ways, which are also worth studying.I have researched how Baloch women involved with the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) have been struggling for an end to state violence in Balochistan and for the rights of the Baloch people. They have emerged as leaders of their movement, and this has been partially facilitated by social media. Photos of women leaders such as Mahrang Baloch, who is currently in jail, and videos of their speeches, protests, and rallies are shared widely on various social media platforms. This has inspired other women and girls to join and has allowed the movement to expand and gain support within the province, nationally, and on a global scale.",Lyari’s tumultuous gang history has rarely featured in mainstream Pakistani cinema. ‘Dhurandhar’ has divided viewers both in India and Pakistan. It has even been banned in the Gulf. The only thing the film gets right is the fact that Rehman Dakait existed and that he was powerful.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125952286,imgsize-1024050,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-12.jpg"

J&K LG hands over govt job letters to 39 terror victim families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-lg-hands-over-govt-job-letters-to-39-terror-victim-families/articleshow/125951178.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakeeza Riyaz was still a minor when her father Riyaz Ahmad was abducted by terrorists in Anantnag and tortured to death in 1999. Her mother, unable to cope with the emotional and financial stress caused by loss of the family's sole breadwinner, remarried. Pakeeza was taken in by her grandparents who raised her despite their advancing age. On Saturday, Pakeeza's fortunes finally turned, thanks to J&K administration's decision to rehabilitate her with a govt job.Fozy Jan suffered similarly at the hands of terrorists when they forcibly entered her home in Qazigund, Anantnag in the year 2000 and took away her father and grandfather, only to kill them mercilessly shortly after. The loss of the two primary earning members pushed the family into a financial crisis. Twenty-five years later, she got closure with a govt job offer.Pakeeza and Fozy are two among the 39 next of kin of terror victims from Kashmir division of J&K, to be handed over appointment letters by J&K LG Manoj Sinha, ending their families' wait of more than two decades to be recognised and rehabilitated.Sinha said the move is part of the J&K administration's resolve to deliver justice, jobs and dignity to families torn apart as terrorists tortured and killed their loved ones.The families had to undergo years of hardship and emotional trauma, given that they were left to fend for themselves even as overground workers who aided terrorists were given govt jobs by the previous regimes.""For these families, the long wait for justice has ended today. With concrete steps for rehabilitation, we have restored their dignity and faith in the system,” LG Sinha said after distributing the appointment letters to the next-of-kin of terror victims.Both Shaista of Hyderpora, Srinagar, whose father Abdul Rashid Ganai was murdered in 2000, and Ishtiyaq Ahmad, the son of BSF braveheart Altaf Hussain who was martyred in a terrorist encounter 19 years ago, were handed appointment letters, ending their long battle for justice and bringing them economic stability.Justice was granted thirty years later to the family of Abdul Aziz Dar, a resident of Srinagar who was murdered by terrorists. The family of Late Abdul Rehman Lone, a special police officer (SPO) who was killed in 1999 inside his house, also had balm applied to their 26-year wound. Abdul's brother Md Ashraf Lone, who was forced to abandon studies and work as a labourer to sustain the family, will now lead a life of dignity as a govt employee.Irshad Ahmad Sofi, also an SPO, was killed by terrorists in 1999 at his residence in Bijbehara. He was ""punished"" by them for doing his duty by joining counter-terrorism operations. On Saturday, his sibling Irshad, who had to do odd jobs to make ends meet, was handed over an appointment letter.LG Sinha said that after the Abrogation of Article 370, the terror victim families have found new courage and self-confidence, and now they are speaking out against the terror ecosystem without fear.“For generations, the system had failed these victims by not giving their cases the priority they deserved. We are empowering victim's voices and ensuring they get their dues and rights they deserve. We are also committed for swift and fair justice to perpetrators,” he said.Sinha said that the Narendra Modi govt follows a zero-tolerance policy against terrorism in all its forms. ""Every available resource and means will be used to make J&K terrorism-free and those who are giving sanctuary, safe-haven or any other support to terrorists will have to pay a very heavy price,” he underlined.Appointment letters were handed over on Saturday to 39 other beneficiaries under the compassionate appointment rules and rehabilitation assistance scheme (RAS).As many as 156 family members of terror victims have been provided self-employment opportunities under various schemes, including Mission Yuva, Holistic Agriculture Development Program (HADP) and Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP). Furthermore, 17 encroachments were removed from the properties belonging to terror victim families.Also, 36 terror victim families have been identified for house reconstruction. More families will be identified and included as the process continues. The reconstruction work for the houses of the families whose homes were destroyed due to Pakistani shelling in Uri and Karnah will commence in April.","Pakeeza Riyaz was still a minor when her father Riyaz Ahmad was abducted by terrorists in Anantnag and tortured to death in 1999.

NEW DELHI: A Bill which seeks to set up a single regulator for institutions of higher education is required to facilitate universities and other higher educational institutes become independent and self-governing, officials said.The Bill is likely to be introduced in Parliament next week after it got the Union Cabinet's nod on Friday.The proposed legislation, which was earlier christened the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill, has now been named Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill.A single higher education regulator, which was proposed in the new National Education Policy (NEP), looks to replace the University Grants Commission (UGC), the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE).""The Bill proposes to set up a Higher Education Commission of India to facilitate universities and other higher educational institutes become independent and self-governing institutions and to promote excellence through a robust and transparent system of accreditation and autonomy. It is likely to be introduced (in Parliament) in the coming week,"" an official said.While the UGC presently oversees non-technical higher education in the country, the AICTE oversees technical education, while the NCTE is the regulatory body for teachers' education.The Commission is proposed to be set up as a single higher education regulator, but medical and law colleges will not be brought under its ambit.It is proposed to have three major roles -- regulation, accreditation and setting professional standards, officials said.Funding, which is seen as the fourth vertical, is not proposed to be under the regulator so far. The autonomy for funding is proposed to be with the administrative ministry, they said.","The Bill is likely to be introduced in Parliament next week after it got the Union Cabinet's nod on Friday.

PATNA: About a month after she broke off relations with her family, RJD chief Lalu Prasad's daughter, Rohini Acharya, signalled there was further strain when she appealed to Bihar's govt to ensure that every woman can stay safely in her parental home. Rohini, who lives in Singapore, had donated her kidney to her father Lalu in Dec 2022 for transplant at a Singapore hospital.In a social media post on Thursday, she indirectly praised chief minister Nitish Kumar for distributing Rs 10,000 among women and giving cycles to schoolgirls, but said these steps were inadequate. Rohini said that in Bihar, a deeply rooted patriarchal mindset creates the need for widespread change in both social and political spheres.""Every daughter has the right to grow up with the assurance that her parental home is a safe place, where she can return without fear, guilt, shame, or having to explain herself to anyone,"" she wrote on X, asserting implementing this measure is not just an ""administrative duty"" but a step towards saving countless women from future exploitation and harassment.Her observation comes about a month after she quit RJD and disowned her family members following a verbal spat, allegedly with her brother Tejashwi Yadav over RJD's assembly election disaster. She also alleged she was accused of donating a ""dirty kidney"" to her father after ""extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket"".","Lalu Prasad's daughter, Rohini Acharya, has voiced concerns about women's safety in Bihar.

Mass visa chaos: H-1B families stranded in India for months after US consulates cancel interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mass-visa-chaos-h-1b-families-stranded-in-india-for-months-after-us-consulates-cancel-interviews/articleshow/125910898.cms,"Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated, with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who travelled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: ""Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.""Rajiv S. Khanna, lmanaging attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labelling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India.

A lullaby. A video call. A mother flying alone for the first time. Six months later, those final moments haunt Hiren Dayani, one of dozens of Gujaratis whose lives were ripped apart when Air India Flight 171 crashed seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on June 12.The fallout is pulling families back from the UK, leaving them to rebuild amid grief, mounting costs and visa troubles. At least 10 families have already returned.Hiren's mother Kailashben had been talking to him constantly from the airport, asking strangers for help with immigration through the video call. ""She would create halarda (lullaby) for my son and sing them,"" he said. ""All these memories flood back every time I think about that day."" Hiren has moved to Surat with his wife Namrata and their three-year-old son Vaastu, abandoning seven years of life in London. Namrata, a former NHS employee, has opened a clinic.Hiren Dayani, a clinical research scientist, is searching for work. ""I was months away from Indefinite Leave to Remain,"" he says. ""But everything changed.""Mike Andrews, an aviation lawyer with Beasley Allen Law Firm in US, who represents over 130 affected families, met survivors in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat.He recounted how a family in Leicester lost its main earner and could no longer stay in Wembley. The widow and her three children - 17, 18 and 20 - moved to a cheaper neighbourhood. The children quit school to work.""There has been a fundamental shift in their life trajectory,"" Andrews said. ""We've met many who moved to the UK seeking opportunities but are now returning to India because they simply cannot afford to remain.""Among them is Mobbashera Vahora. Her husband Parvez and their four-year-old daughter Zuveriya died in the crash. Parvez held a full-time job with a major e-commerce company and worked part-time with multiple delivery platforms. He supported his parents in India while trying to secure a future for his young family in East London.Mobbashera was pregnant when the crash happened. Her baby is now five months old. ""We migrated for better prospects for our children,"" she said from her brother's home. ""We dreamed of building a life there, but all of that is lost now."" With UK immigration rules tightening, she sees no path back.For Harish Godhaniya from Devbhumi Dwarka, the decision was blunt. ""I have nobody there anymore,"" he said. He lost his wife Riddhi and three-year-old son Kriyansh. ""What would I do there? We emigrated with dreams of a better life. That day took my whole world."" He has not returned to work since coming home.The immigration struggle is sharpest for Mohammadmiya Mohammadasif Shethwala from Vadodara, who lost his wife Sadikabanu - the primary visa holder - and their daughter Fatima, who was born in the UK. Mohammadmiya works with a logistics firm in Britain, but he must secure qualifying employment by Jan 26 to remain legally.His friend Yusuf said: ""He came back for the last rites, but life in Vadodara was too painful. In the UK, at least he isn't confronted with memories constantly. But without a qualifying job by Jan, he'll have to return.""They are appealing at every forum. ""We have our fingers crossed,"" Yusuf added.Another family in Anand is battling a financial crunch. Their daughter - who held the primary visa - had taken a personal loan from a private bank two years earlier.After her death, they discovered the interest was still accruing. According to a member of the legal team, bank officials have assured a speedy resolution. One after another, stories across Gujarat trace the same arc - lives built slowly abroad collapsing overnight, savings gone, futures uncertain.It has been six months since the Ahmedabad-Gatwick flight carrying 242 people crashed - killing all 12 crew members and 229 of the 230 passengers. Nineteen more died on the ground. For their families, the worst is not behind them. They are still piecing together futures in a world where their most important hopes never made it off the runway.","Air India Flight 171 crashed seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on June 12. fallout is pulling families back from the UK, leaving them to rebuild amid grief, mounting costs and visa troubles.

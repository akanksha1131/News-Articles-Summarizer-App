Marks end of

right to work

, say activists

New Delhi: Protesting the impending repeal of MGNREGA, social rights activists Nikhil Dey and Aruna Roy said “VB-G RAM G” will mark the end of the “right to work” since the job scheme provided every needy poor with a fall-back employment security. Dey said the proposed bill is insidious as the Centre has given itself the power to determine where to implement the scheme under section 5(1), which is in line with the recommendations of some so-called expert committees that the scheme be operated only in a limited number of blocks.NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, a collective of job scheme activist bodies, including Jean Dreze, dubbed the proposed new scheme as “not a reform but a rollback of democratic and constitutional guarantees won by workers through decades of sustained struggle...the GOI is seeking to dismantle a historic rights-based legislation.”Dey, Roy and Dreze, all members of Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council which served as an influential policy body during UPA govt’s decade-long run, had a key role in designing MGNREGA.According to Dey and Roy, states will not be willing to shoulder the burden of 40% expenditure, which will essentially mark the end of MGNREGA, and badly hurt the poor who depend on the programme for survival.“States are starved for resources, and will be reluctant to implement the scheme. The reason MGNREGA worked was because Centre did not depend on states for funds,” they argued.Sounding catastrophic, Dey said the job scheme saved the country by helping poor during all major crises. “In all economic distress, including the global crash of 2008 and Covid, it allowed rural poor India to survive. It is something that all the governments will have to turn to in times of crises because it provides a framework that allows you to reach all the citizens,” he said.Dey said, “MGNREGA covered entire country. It allowed self-selection of those who wanted to work, as against ‘BPL framework’ which suffered from issues of inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries.”Activists Nikhil Dey and Aruna Roy said VB-G RAM G will mark the end of the “right to work”.

Gujarat police

hopelessly botched probe that obscured, rather than unveiled, the truth: SC

New Delhi: It is a case where both the accused and the survivor ended as sufferers of the justice delivery system as injustice was done to the former who had to spend 13 years in jail for a crime he did not commit, while the latter was denied justice as the real perpetrator of sexual assault on her when she was four years old was not brought to book.Noting that the police conducted a “hopelessly botched investigation” and cooked up a story against the accused to protect the real culprit, and lower courts mechanically accepted the prosecution’s version and failed to unveil the truth, an SC bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the accused in the case of sexual assault of a girl in Godhra in 2013.The relief came after the accused, who was sentenced to life imprisonment by trial court and Gujarat HC, had spent 13 years in jail.This court cannot remain oblivious to the sobering reality that such handling of criminal cases leaves scars not merely upon the individuals involved but upon the justice system itself. When investigations are carried out in a manner that betrays their foundational purpose, and trials become mechanical exercises divorced from the quest for truth, the resulting miscarriage of justice reverberates far beyond the confines of the courtroom.It erodes public faith, instils uncertainty in victims, and sends a chilling message to society at large that the pursuit of justice may falter not at the altar of complexity but at the hands of indifference. The criminal law, which must stand as a bulwark protecting the vulnerable, risks becoming an instrument of unintended cruelty when procedural lapses and institutional negligence overshadow substantive justice,” the SC bench said.It expressed deep concern over the way in which Gujarat police conducted the probe. After examining the statements of various witnesses, the court came to conclusion that the entire story implicating the accused for the crime was cooked up after consultations and deliberations on the day after to the incident. The effect of this grave embellishment on the prosecution case was not considered in the correct perspective either by the trial court or HC, the bench said.“A grave and distressing case of brutal sexual assault upon a four-year old girl stands before this court, enveloped in layers of investigative apathy and procedural infirmities. The FIR, despite the informant’s professed complete knowledge of the incident, is bereft of even the most rudimentary details, neither the name of the accused person (appellant herein) nor those of the purported witnesses of the last seen together circumstance find mention. What followed was an investigation hopelessly botched and a trial conducted with a pedantic rigidity that obscured, rather than unveiled, the truth. The highly unnatural conduct of the witnesses, marked by gross insensitivity/rank apathy, contradictions and apparent concoctions raises serious doubts about the reliability of the prosecution’s case. Yet, in face of this disturbing matrix, the accused stands convicted and has remained behind bars for nearly thirteen long years,” it said.The court said the investigating officer failed to secure and preserve crucial forensic material which would have provided objective corroboration and assisted in ascertaining the truth. It said the failure not only weakens the prosecution’s case but also raises a legitimate apprehension that the investigation may not have been carried out with the requisite fairness and diligence and the possibility that “such inaction was intended, or at least operated, to shield the actual perpetrators of the offence cannot be ruled out”.","An SC bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the accused in the case of sexual assault of a girl in Godhra in 2013.

‘Deity’s sleep & rest being disturbed?’

New Delhi: More than a decade after declaring sleep as part of right to life, Supreme Court on Monday agreed to adjudicate whether the new schedule extending ‘darshan’ time for devotees at Banke Bihari temple at Vrindavan disturbed the traditional sleep and rest periods of the main deity.Appearing for the Banke Bihariji Temple Management Committee, senior advocate Shyam Divan complained to a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that the SC-appointed high powered committee (HPC) has altered the strict summer and winter temple opening times followed since time immemorial.He said between Holi and Diwali, the temple opened between 7.45 am to 12 noon and in the evening from 5.30 pm to 9.30 pm, which has been changed by HPC to 7 am to 12.30 pm in the morning and 4.15 pm to 9.30 pm in the evening. The temple opening timings between Diwali and Holi were 8.45 am to 1 pm in the morning and 4.30 pm to 9.30 pm in the evening, which have been changed to 8 am to 1.30 pm in the morning and 4 pm to 9 pm in the evening.“The change in the temple timing has consequently led to change in the timing of the internal rituals which are performed inside the temple including the ritual when the deity wakes up in the morning and when the deity sleeps at night,” Divan said.The temple committee said the HPC’s Sep 19 decision has resulted in altering the deity’s centuries-old sleep and wake up timings. “The sleep and wake-up timings are wedded to tradition and cannot be interfered with in the name of providing darshan to more devotees,” Divan said.The bench said many devotees have complained that in the name of the pre and post-sleep and wakeup rituals, the goswamis put a curtain and allow the rich and influential to offer obeisance to the deities. “What is the harm in extending the darshan time by a couple of hours daily to facilitate more devotees to get darshan,” the bench asked.However, the bench agreed to examine this issue and sought responses of the HPC led by a retired Allahabad HC judge through its member secretary in Mathura district collector, Mathura-Vrindavan Development Authority and the UP govt. It posted further hearings to the first week of Jan.More than a decade after declaring sleep part of right to life, SC Monday agreed to adjudicate whether the schedule extending ‘darshan’ time for devotees at Banke Bihari temple at Vrindavan disturbed the sleep & rest periods of the main deity.",Supreme Court agreed to adjudicate whether the new schedule extending ‘darshan’ time for devotees at Banke Bihari temple at Vrindavan disturbed the traditional sleep and rest periods of the main deity.

"Test eggs for banned antibiotics, orders FSSAI after nitrofurans row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/test-eggs-for-banned-antibiotics-orders-fssai-after-nitrofurans-row/articleshow/125993350.cms,".

New Delhi: The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) on Monday directed its regional offices across the country to collect samples of both branded and unbranded eggs and send them to 10 laboratories for testing to check for the presence of nitrofurans residues.The move follows a controversy over the quality of eggs sold by popular brand Eggoz, with reports raising concerns about possible traces of nitrofurans — a group of antibiotics banned for use in food-producing animals. Health authorities say the fact that residues can still enter eggs if such drugs are used illegally in poultry farming is what has prompted the nationwide sampling exercise.The issue surfaced after an online report flagged concerns over egg quality, triggering public debate and regulatory scrutiny. In response, Eggoz issued a statement maintaining that its products are safe.“As promised, the latest lab reports of Eggoz egg samples (Dec 25) are available, and we are sharing them openly for everyone’s reference at www.eggoz.com. At Eggoz, the safety and trust of our consumers mean everything to us. Thank you for your patience and for giving us the opportunity to clarify the facts. We will continue to uphold the highest standards across our farms and processes,” the egg distributors said in a statement on X.According to information shared by the company, the lab reports indicate that the samples tested were free from banned antibiotics, pesticides and drugs, with results marked “BLQ” — below the limit of quantification — for the substances tested.Medical experts, however, say the wider issue of antibiotic misuse in poultry remains a serious public health concern. Prof Chintamani, chairman, surgical oncology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said nitrofurans are banned worldwide because their residues can persist in eggs even after cooking. Long-term consumption of contaminated eggs has been linked in animal studies to genetic damage and increased cancer risk, besides potential harm to the liver and kidneys.",The move follows a controversy over the quality of eggs sold by popular brand Eggoz.

"Anti-dowry laws suffer from ineffectiveness, misuse: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-dowry-laws-suffer-from-ineffectiveness-misuse-sc/articleshow/125993332.cms,".

New Delhi: Noting that the social evil of dowry still prevails showing the ineffectiveness of the anti-dowry laws and at the same time the law is being misused by women for ulterior motives, Supreme Court Monday said this contradiction needed to be resolved as it is creating judicial tension.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol & N K Singh highlighted this issue while convicting a man and his 94-year old mother in dowry death case when a 20-year old girl burnt to death in 2001 for not fulfilling the demand for a colour television, a motorcycle and Rs 15,000 cash. Bringing the curtain down on the case after almost a quarter of century, the court awarded life imprisonment to the husband but refrained from incarcerating the mother considering her old age.The bench expressed concern over delay in deciding the case and passed a series of directions for social measures to tackle the menace of dowry by spreading awareness among youth as the law had been ineffective in curbing the practice.“While on the one hand, the law suffers from ineffectiveness and so, the malpractice of dowry remains rampant, on the other hand, the provisions of this (Dowry Prohibition) Act have also been used to ventilate ulterior motives along with Section 498-A, IPC.This oscillation between ineffectiveness and misuse creates a judicial tension which needs urgent resolution. While this urgent resolution cannot be stressed upon enough, at the same time it is necessary to be recognised that particularly when it comes to the giving and taking of dowry, this practice unfortunately has deep roots in society, hence, it not being a matter of swift change, instead needs concentrated effort on part of all the involved parties, be it legislature, law enforcement, judiciary, civil society organisations etc,” the bench said.In this case a 20-year old Nasrin was set on fire by pouring kerosene oil on her and she died within a year of her marriage. The trial court convicted both her husband and mother-in-law but Allahabad HC set aside the conviction and acquitted them. The HC decision was based on one part of the deceased father’s statement in which she said that his daughter was happily married.Setting aside HC order and convicting both the accused, SC said, “When the harassment for dowry is proved and so is the fact that such harassment was made soon before her death, then a mere statement of one of the witnesses that she was apparently happy, would not save the Respondents from guilt”.“The HC appears to have been misdirected by the use of the word ‘happily’, at least insofar as the testimony of PW1 (father) is concerned. Reading the entire statement as extracted herein above, clearly establishes that the deceased went back to her matrimonial home having been persuaded and assured by her father. He also states that she had been assaulted and dowry had been demanded from her. Therefore, the use of one word does not colour the entire tenor of the evidence. The sum of the evidence is to be understood, taking into account all aspects testified to therein,” the bench said.As the present case took 24 years to be concluded, SC said there would be many such similar cases and requested all high courts to take stock of the situation, ascertain the number of cases pending dealing with Section 304-B, 498-A from the earliest to the latest for expeditious disposal.","A 20-year old girl burnt to death in 2001 for not fulfilling the demand for a colour television, a motorcycle and Rs 15,000 cash.

Schools across Delhi shifted to hybrid classes for students from Classes 1 to 9 and Class 11 with immediate effect as air quality deteriorated to severe levels and authorities enforced stricter measures under the Graded Response Action Plan, stage IV.The Directorate of Education issued directions to all government, government-aided and unaided recognised private schools, as well as institutions run by NDMC, MCD and the Delhi Cantonment Board, to allow both physical and online attendance wherever feasible.The order stated that schools must conduct classes in a hybrid mode, combining in-person teaching with online lessons, for children up to Class IX and Class XI, while Classes X and XII were excluded from the arrangement.In the circular, the Directorate clarified that the option to attend online classes, where available, would rest with students and their guardians, and schools were instructed to immediately inform parents of the change.District and zonal education officers were directed to visit schools under their jurisdiction to ensure proper compliance with the instructions, according to officials quoted by the TNN in the report.Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the year, with the 24-hour average AQI standing at 431, while readings later crossed 450, pushing pollution into the severe plus category, officials said in statements cited by the TNN.The Commission for Air Quality Management imposed stage III measures earlier in the day before escalating to stage IV as conditions worsened, citing unfavourable meteorological factors, calm winds and pollutant accumulation, according to details shared with the TNN.Alongside school measures, the Delhi government ordered all public and private offices to operate with no more than 50 per cent staff physically present, while the remaining employees were required to work from home.The restrictions also included a ban on construction and demolition activities, limits on non-essential truck entry, and prohibitions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, while essential services such as hospitals, public transport and utilities were exempted, officials told the TNN.Officials said the measures were aimed at preventing further deterioration in air quality, advising children, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses to avoid outdoor activities until pollution levels show sustained improvement, according to advisories referenced by the TNN.Authorities stated that all stages of GRAP remain in force across Delhi-NCR, and enforcement agencies have been instructed to ensure strict implementation of the curbs until further orders, a senior official said in conversation with the TNN. No timeline for easing restrictions was indicated in the communication issued to concerned departments.","Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the year, with the 24-hour average AQI standing at 431, while readings later crossed 450.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement. The region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125969037,imgsize-383411,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/.jpg"

Student loan borrowers in the United States scored a major legal victory this week after a federal judge refused to grant the US Department of Education additional time to process long-pending student loan forgiveness claims under the landmark Sweet v. Cardona settlement, providing hope for thousands of borrowers who have been waiting months, and in some cases years, for relief.As reported by, the ruling affects more than 200,000 borrowers who applied for loan discharge under the Borrower Defense to Repayment programme and have been waiting for years for a decision. The court’s refusal to allow an 18-month delay reinforces a hard January 2026 deadline for relief and sends a strong message on government accountability in student loan administration.Thecase originated as a class action lawsuit filed by student loan borrowers against the first Trump administration. Borrowers alleged that the US Department of Education, under then Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, had unlawfully stalled or arbitrarily denied Borrower Defense to Repayment applications—sometimes leaving claims unresolved for years.Borrower Defense to Repayment allows federal student loan borrowers to seek loan cancellation if their educational institution engaged in misconduct, including misleading claims about job prospects, earnings potential, admissions standards, credit transferability, or the true cost of programmes.After prolonged litigation, the case was resolved in 2022 under the Biden–Harris administration through a binding settlement agreement designed to apply regardless of future political changes.Under the Sweet settlement, borrowers fall into different groups depending on when they submitted their Borrower Defense applications. Those who applied by June 2022 were eligible for automatic or expedited relief. Another group—known as “Post-Class Applicants”—submitted claims between June and November 2022.As per the settlement terms, Post-Class Applicants are entitled to full loan forgiveness if the Education Department fails to process their applications by January 28, 2026. It was this deadline that the department attempted to push back.Last month, the department argued in court that limited staffing and administrative resources made it impossible to review the remaining 200,000 applications on time, and requested an 18-month extension.The court overseeing the settlement firmly rejected the request. In a bench ruling on Thursday, US District Judge William Alsup declined to modify the settlement timeline, siding with borrowers and their legal representatives.“The student loan has been hanging over their head for how many years, how many decades, wrecking their credit,” Judge Alsup said during the hearing, according to. “It’s just not right.”Legal advocates for borrowers welcomed the decision. Eileen Connor, President and Executive Director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending (PPSL), which represents borrowers in the case, said the ruling reaffirmed borrowers’ right to timely justice after years of uncertainty.Following the court’s decision, the Department of Education must adhere to strict timelines. Borrower Defense claims from Post-Class Applicants who attended institutions on a court-approved list must be processed by January 28, 2026. If the department fails to meet this deadline, affected borrowers will automatically qualify for full settlement relief, including cancellation of eligible federal student loans and refunds of past payments.The department has until April 15, 2026, to complete reviews of all remaining Post-Class applications.The ruling comes at a time when federal student loan forgiveness options in the US are becoming more limited. As noted by, recent legislative and regulatory changes backed by congressional Republicans have weakened borrower-friendly rules governing the Borrower Defense programme.In addition, the Education Department has entered into a separate settlement that will eliminate the SAVE income-driven repayment plan, a Biden-era initiative designed to reduce monthly payments and accelerate loan forgiveness for eligible borrowers.Against this backdrop, the Sweet settlement remains one of the most consequential avenues for relief—making the court’s refusal to delay its implementation especially significant for hundreds of thousands of borrowers still awaiting resolution.","Federal court rejects US student loan forgiveness delay, clearing the way for relief to over 200,000 borrowers under the Sweet settlement.

Delhi’s worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi ’s farewell appearance in India, as a section of the crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium voiced its anger at the political leadership even while welcoming the global football icon.As Chief Minister Rekha Gupta stepped onto the stage on Monday to receive Messi during the final leg of the GOAT India Tour, chants of “AQI, AQI” rang out from parts of the stands. The reaction came amid hazardous pollution levels in the national capital, with the Air Quality Index touching 498 in the morning before easing slightly to 427 by evening, remaining in the ‘severe’ category for the third consecutive day. Visibility across the city dropped sharply, with a thick haze obscuring the skyline.The chants contrasted sharply with the celebratory atmosphere inside the stadium, where nearly 25,000 fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of Messi. The Delhi leg marked the conclusion of a tour that had begun chaotically in Kolkata but ended on a more organised note in the capital. Spectators packed the stands, many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with the iconic No. 10, while celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground.Messi, speaking briefly in Spanish, thanked the crowd for the affection shown throughout his India visit. He described the experience as intense but unforgettable, saying the love he received exceeded expectations and promising that he would return to India someday, possibly to play a match.After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the field smiling, watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, and waved repeatedly to the crowd. Alongside Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, he kicked footballs into the stands during a lap of honour and later felicitated the Minerva Academy football team. The reception was notably freer than in Kolkata, where heavy security and political entourages had limited fan interaction.The tightly scripted 30-minute programme revolved largely around Messi. He was joined on stage by Rekha Gupta, ICC chairman Jay Shah , DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia towards the end of the event.While Messi mania dominated the evening, the chants inside the stadium underlined a growing public frustration over Delhi’s air crisis, turning a celebratory sporting moment into a pointed reminder of the capital’s ongoing environmental emergency.",Delhi's worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi’s farewell appearance in India.

Where HAMMER fits in India’s precision strike ecosystem





India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. More than a new addition to the arsenal, HAMMER represents a move away from importing finished munitions towards absorbing the technologies that define modern air warfare.Developed by France’s Safran Electronics & Defense, HAMMER is a modular precision strike system designed to hit targets from stand-off ranges while keeping aircraft outside heavily defended airspace. Its architecture combines guidance kits, propulsion and standard bomb bodies, allowing rapid adaptation across missions and platforms. The system is already combat-proven and integrated with aircraft such as the Rafale.Under a new agreement, Bharat Electronics Limited and Safran will jointly manufacture, customise, supply and maintain HAMMER in India through a 50-50 joint venture. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the Rafale and the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, creating a common precision strike capability across both imported and home-grown fleets.At a time when air power is defined less by numbers and more by accuracy, stand-off reach and controlled escalation, the localisation of HAMMER signals a strategic shift from buying weapons to mastering precision strike technology itself.The Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER precision-guided weapons during Operation Sindoor on 7 May 2025 as part of a carefully calibrated cross-border strike against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22. A total of nine sites were struck, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s primary base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Weapon selection was central to the operation’s objectives. The Indian Air Force employed a layered mix of SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER precision-guided bombs and loitering munitions.Within this mix, HAMMER was used where flexibility and adaptability were essential. Its modular design and multiple guidance options allowed the IAF to tailor strikes based on the nature of individual targets and real-time assessments.HAMMER enabled stand-off engagement without requiring aircraft to fly directly over heavily defended areas. Its off-axis launch capability reduced exposure to Pakistan’s air defence network, particularly in areas close to population centres and sensitive military zones.The weapon’s precision supported the operation’s political and military messaging by reducing the risk of collateral damage. By pairing HAMMER with SCALP, the Indian Air Force demonstrated a layered strike doctrine, with SCALP neutralising deep, hardened targets and HAMMER engaging medium-range sites requiring precision and manoeuvrability.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, officially designated as AASM from the French Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, is a precision-guided air-to-ground stand-off weapon designed to bridge the gap between conventional bombs and cruise missiles.Despite often being described as a missile, HAMMER is fundamentally a guided bomb system. At its core is a standard unguided bomb, which becomes a high-precision strike weapon once fitted with modular guidance and propulsion kits. This design allows air forces to convert existing bomb inventories into modern precision weapons without developing entirely new missiles for each mission profile.The system is built around two main components. The first is a nose-mounted guidance section that determines how the weapon navigates and locks onto its target. Depending on the mission, this guidance kit can combine inertial navigation and GPS for all-weather strikes, infrared imaging for high-precision attacks on fixed targets, or laser guidance for engaging moving targets.The second component is a tail-mounted range extension kit, which includes a solid-fuel rocket booster and manoeuvrable winglets. Once released, the booster ignites to increase stand-off range, while the winglets allow the weapon to alter its flight path, perform sharp turns and attack targets from off-axis angles. In combat, this enables launch aircraft to remain outside heavily defended airspace while still striking accurately.HAMMER kits can be attached to bombs weighing 125 kilograms, 250 kilograms, 500 kilograms and 1,000 kilograms, including widely used Mark 80 series bombs. This scalability allows the same weapon system to be used against a range of targets, from lightly protected structures to hardened bunkers.In operational use, HAMMER has demonstrated the ability to strike targets from significant distances, engage multiple targets in a single sortie and maintain accuracy in contested environments. Its combination of modularity, manoeuvrability and precision makes it particularly suited to modern air operations where speed, flexibility and controlled escalation are critical.In modern air warfare, weapons fall broadly into three categories: unguided bombs, guided bombs and air-to-surface missiles.Unguided bombs are cheap but inaccurate and require aircraft to fly directly over targets. Air-to-surface missiles offer long range and precision but are expensive and limited in numbers.HAMMER sits between these two extremes. It offers missile-like precision and stand-off range while retaining the flexibility and lower cost structure of a guided bomb.This distinction matters. Guided bombs like HAMMER allow air forces to carry larger numbers of precision weapons, adapt them to multiple target types and deploy them from a wide range of aircraft.The defining feature of HAMMER is modularity. Instead of designing a single fixed weapon, Safran developed a system where guidance, propulsion and bomb body can be mixed and matched.The nose-mounted guidance kit determines how the weapon finds and tracks its target. The rear-mounted range extension kit determines how far it can travel after release and how sharply it can manoeuvre.This modular architecture allows the same basic weapon to be used for close air support, deep strike, bunker busting and attacks on moving targets, depending on the guidance kit selected.For India, this means fewer weapon types to manage logistically while retaining operational flexibility.HAMMER is available in three primary guidance configurations.The baseline version combines an inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning System receiver. Data from both systems is fused using Kalman filtering, allowing the weapon to maintain accuracy even if GPS signals are degraded or jammed. This variant achieves a circular error probability of around 10 metres and works in all weather conditions.The second variant adds infrared homing to the INS and GPS combination. This system matches the target area with a reference image stored in the weapon’s memory, allowing accuracy of around one metre. It works day and night in fair weather and is particularly useful against fixed targets with a clear thermal signature.The third variant replaces infrared homing with laser guidance. This allows HAMMER to strike moving targets, provided they are illuminated by a laser designator from an aircraft, drone or ground team. This version was qualified in April 2013.These variants were redesignated in 2010 as SBU-38, SBU-64 and SBU-54 respectively, with the overall system renamed HAMMER for export.HAMMER’s range depends on launch altitude and configuration. Safran cites a range of over 32 nautical miles from high altitude and around 8 nautical miles from low-level release.The winglets and rocket booster allow off-axis launches of up to 90 degrees, meaning the aircraft does not have to point directly at the target. This reduces exposure to enemy air defences.Multiple HAMMER weapons can be released in a single pass against different targets with one trigger press, a capability that significantly enhances strike efficiency.HAMMER entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation on the Rafale platform.Its combat debut came in Afghanistan in April 2008, when a Rafale dropped two HAMMER weapons in support of ground troops.The system gained wider attention during the 2011 Libya campaign. A HAMMER weapon destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2 Galeb aircraft on the runway at Misrata Airport shortly after it landed. Another strike destroyed a Libyan tank at a distance of 55 kilometres. In total, 225 HAMMER weapons were used in Libya.This combat history is critical. Weapons that have been tested in real conflicts carry credibility in terms of reliability, accuracy and resistance to countermeasures.India ordered large numbers of HAMMER weapons in September 2020. Deliveries were completed by November 2020, with the French Air and Space Force transferring part of its own stock to ensure immediate availability.The Indian Air Force initially integrated HAMMER on the Rafale fleet. Work has since begun to integrate it onto the Tejas, a process that involves complex software, avionics and flight control modifications.Successful integration on Tejas would represent a major step in combining imported high-end weapons with indigenous platforms.According to France’s Senate committee on defence manufacturing costs, the total cost of the AASM programme including development and delivery of 2,348 kits was €846 million, placing the per-weapon cost at around $300,000.Earlier figures showed a unit cost of €164,000 excluding development and €252,000 including development. By 2017, Safran reported a unit cost of €120,000 for the AASM Evolution version, with a target of reducing it to €80,000 through larger production runs.For India, domestic production offers the potential to lower costs over time while ensuring availability during crises.India today operates a layered precision strike inventory.Indigenous systems include the Sudarshan Laser Guided Bomb, the Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon, and glide bombs such as Gaurav and Garuthmaa.Imported and jointly developed systems include the SPICE series from Israel, HAMMER from France and the BrahMos-A supersonic cruise missile.HAMMER fills a crucial middle ground between short-range guided bombs and long-range cruise missiles, offering flexibility, precision and affordability.Manufacturing HAMMER in India is not just about supply security. It allows Indian engineers and technicians to gain deep familiarity with guidance systems, propulsion integration and precision strike workflows.This knowledge is transferable to future indigenous weapons programmes and reduces long-term dependence on foreign suppliers for upgrades and maintenance.The deal also strengthens India’s defence partnership with France at a time when New Delhi is diversifying beyond traditional suppliers.The BEL–Safran HAMMER joint venture represents a quiet but important shift in India’s approach to air warfare. Precision, modularity and adaptability are now central to how air power is conceived and deployed.By moving HAMMER production to Indian soil, New Delhi is not merely acquiring a weapon. It is acquiring the ability to understand, modify and eventually design the tools of modern precision strike warfare.","India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. Bharat Electronics Limited and Safran will jointly manufacture, customise, supply and maintain HAMMER in India through a 50-50 joint venture. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the Rafale and the indigenous Tejas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125981989,imgsize-66752,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport were severely disrupted on Monday as dense fog and low visibility led to the cancellation of around 228 flights, with five others diverted, airport authorities said.According to Delhi Airport, the cancellations included 131 departing flights and 97 arriving flights, as visibility levels dropped sharply across the national capital during the early hours of the day.Flight operations are currently being conducted under CAT III conditions, which allow aircraft to land in extremely low visibility but often result in delays and cancellations.Earlier in the day, the ministry of civil aviation issued a travel advisory, urging passengers to check the latest flight status with their airlines before heading to the airport.In a post on X, the ministry said Air Traffic Control and ground teams were “working tirelessly” to minimise disruption, while emphasising that passenger safety remained the top priority.""Heavy Fog Alert for Northern India. Delhi (DEL) & other airports in Northern India are experiencing dense fog, severely affecting visibility.For Passengers: Before heading to the airport, please check the latest flight status with your airline.Check flight information on the airport website/app. Please allow extra travel time,"" civil aviation ministry said.""Safety is our top priority. Our teams & ATC are working tirelessly to minimize disruptions. Thank you for your patience and cooperation,"" it added.Airlines, including IndiGo and Air India, also issued advisories warning that dense fog over Delhi and other parts of northern India could impact schedules.IndiGo said it was closely monitoring weather conditions and urged passengers to regularly check flight updates through official channels, assuring support from its ground and customer service teams. Air India similarly advised passengers to verify flight status before travelling to the airport.The disruption came as Delhi remained shrouded in thick smog and fog, sharply reducing visibility and worsening air quality. The city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in the ‘severe’ category, with readings reported as high as 498, close to the maximum possible level of 500.Several monitoring stations recorded ‘severe’ air quality, with residents complaining of breathlessness, low visibility and heightened health risks.Pollution levels had worsened from Sunday, when the AQI climbed to 461, marking Delhi’s most polluted day this winter and the second-worst December air quality day on record. Weather officials warned that poor visibility and air quality conditions were likely to persist in the coming days.Authorities have advised residents, especially children, the elderly and those with respiratory ailments, to take necessary precautions as the capital continues to battle extreme pollution and fog-related disruptions.","Flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport were severely disrupted on Monday as dense fog and low visibility led to the cancellation of around 228 flights.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Monday showcased a Turkish-made drone that was brought down by the Indian forces on May 10, the final day of the four-day conflict with Pakistan.The reconstructed, armed Yiiha drone was displayed at an event hosted by army chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, on the eve of the 54th Vijay Diwas, commemorating India’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war.The Yiiha, a kamikaze-class drone displayed at the event, was flying at an altitude of around 2,000 metres on May 10. Launched from Lahore International Airport, its intended target was Jalandhar, according to military officials.The unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), carrying a 10-kg explosive payload, was brought down by the Army Air Defence (AAD). Remotely operated, it was designed to detonate on impact.The UCAV has a wingspan of about two metres and is powered by a two-stroke engine with a capacity of 170 cc.Kamikaze-class drones, also known as “suicide drones,” are weapon systems designed to loiter over a target area, searching for a suitable target before carrying out an attack.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, carrying out air strikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. It was followed by four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions, following a ceasefire request by Islamabad.Pakistan used a large number of Yiha single-use attack UCAVs to target various Indian military and civilian installations during the conflict.Almost all the Pakistani drones were shot down by the Indian military.","The reconstructed, armed Yiiha drone was displayed at an event hosted by army chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, on the eve of the 54th Vijay Diwas.

BSF IG Warns Of Looming Threat As 120 Terrorists Wait In PoK Despite Dip In Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies are alarmed and closely monitoring the expansion of terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Satellite imagery and photographs reveal the construction of a new ""dual-use facility"" in the Neelum Valley district.Since November, LeT accelerated the infrastructure build-up of the new centre, named ""Jamia Masjid Ibn Taymiyah wa Markaz,"" being erected in the Sharda area. This facility, sources said, was explicitly designed to function simultaneously as both a religious structure and a command-and-control centre for terrorist activities, raising acute concerns about the deepening entrenchment of terrorist operations in the region.""The project's operational significance was underscored by the recent visit and inspection of the Neelum Valley site by Rizwan Hanif, the Deputy of LeT's PoK unit,"" the source added. According to intelligence sources, this facility is one of four major Markaz (centres) currently under construction by LeT across PoK, with others planned for DhirKot, Bagh; Khaigala, Rawalakot; and Palandri, Sudhanoti.These parallel projects signal a coordinated effort by LeT to dramatically expand its logistical and ideological footprint across the territory while shifting a major chunk of its resources to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The strategy is to create multiple small infrastructures instead of a massive centralised Markaz. Rawalakot has emerged as another major construction hub for terror infrastructure. Many launchpads here were destroyed by the Indian Army in Operation Sindoor.LeT is now readying terrorist launch pads at these locations under the guise of mosques. ""A huge building is being constructed in the Khaigala area of Rawalakot which will act as a launchpad but in reality, this is again a dual-use facility, named Al-Aqsa Markaz. LeT is attempting to portray it as a mosque.

The encounter has since halted, but the area remains under a tight security cordon with all escape routes sealed.The gunfight broke out at village Soan in the Majalta area after security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation following specific intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists believed to be affiliated with the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit, officials said.Inspector General of Police, Jammu, Bhim Sen Tuti said contact was established after police received precise information. “Joint team of Special Operations Group (SOG) of police along with Army and CRPF are on job,” he said.In another post, the IGP said, “a very small SOG team engaged the terrorists! Combing of the forest has been impeded due to darkness and treacherous terrain.”Officials said the encounter began around 6 pm when joint teams of the Army, police and paramilitary forces intensified the search operation in the Soan–Martha area of Majalta tehsil.“As the security forces intensified the search operation, the hiding terrorists opened fire, which was retaliated to, triggering an encounter,” an official said.One terrorist was believed to have been hit in the initial exchange of fire, officials said, adding that intermittent firing continued for some time before the operation was suspended for the night due to poor visibility and difficult terrain. The search operation is expected to resume with the first light of day on Tuesday.Reinforcements have been rushed to the area to strengthen the cordon and prevent the terrorists from escaping, officials added.(With inputs from PTI)",A policeman was killed and a terrorist was believed to be injured in a gunfight with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday evening.

Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday filed its chargesheet in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack case against seven accused, including a Pakistani handler, terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and its proxy, The Resistance Front (TRF), and others.The anti-terror agency presented the chargesheet before the NIA Special Court in Jammu.The 1,597-page chargesheet named the handler, Sajid Jatt, along with three Pakistani terrorists neutralised by security forces during Operation Mahadev at Dachigam in Srinagar in July. They have been identified as Faisal Jatt alias Suleman Shah, Habeeb Tahir alias Jibran, and Hamza Afghani.Further, the chargesheet has arraigned the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and The Resistance Front (TRF) as legal entities for their role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam assault. It has also invoked the penal section against the accused for waging war against India.The development comes nearly six months after the agency arrested two men for harbouring the terrorists who carried out the deadly attack.The men — Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar — were arrested on June 22 for harbouring the terrorists, and have been named in the chargesheet. During interrogation, the duo had reportedly disclosed the identities of the attackers and confirmed they were Pakistani nationals affiliated with the proscribed LeT.On April 22, the three heavily armed terrorists shot dead 26 civilians — all men — including a local and a tourist from Nepal, in Pahalgam’s Baisaran Valley.After announcing a series of diplomatic measures, India responded with Operation Sindoor, carrying out airstrikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. The strikes triggered intense cross-border clashes that were halted after Islamabad sought a ceasefire on May 10.","The 1,597-page chargesheet named the handler, Sajid Jatt, along with three Pakistani terrorists neutralised by security forces in July.

Mahayuti buries hatchet for Mumbai

Thackeray cousins close ranks

Congress’ solo act threat

NEW DELHI: After a delay of nearly three years, the State Election Commission has finally announced dates for Maharashtra's long-pending civic body elections, which have been overdue since 2022. Polling will be held on January 15 for 29 municipal corporations, 32 zilla parishads and 336 panchayat samitis, with results scheduled for January 16.The elections to key urban bodies such as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Pune and Thane are being seen as more than routine local contests, widely viewed as the political mood test for the state.The BMC election is expected to witness the fiercest contest, pitting the ruling BJP-led Mahayuti alliance against a fractured opposition.The BMC’s estimated budget for 2025–26 stands at Rs 74,427 crore, with projected expenditure of Rs 43,162 crore, accounting for nearly 58 per cent of allocations towards development works.This massive financial clout is unmatched by any other municipal body in the country, cementing the BMC’s status as Asia’s wealthiest civic corporation and making control of Mumbai’s local government a prize of enormous political and economic significance.The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance is seeking to present a united front after months of internal friction. The BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar’s NCP have agreed to contest the BMC polls together, setting up coordination committees to resolve seat-sharing disputes.Relations between BJP and Sena had been strained, particularly over allegations of poaching party workers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The Sena had accused BJP’s state leadership of engineering defections.For BJP, BMC remains unfinished business. After narrowly missing out on control in 2017, the party believes its expanded footprint in Maharashtra and favourable alliance arithmetic could finally deliver Mumbai’s civic body.In 2017, the BJP contested all 227 seats independently and won 82, just two fewer than the undivided Shiv Sena. This time, it will contest fewer seats to accommodate its allies. The Shiv Sena has sought 90–100 seats, BJP state election in-charge Chandrashekhar Bawankule has said.BJP and NCP, however, will not contest together in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. ""Ajit Pawar and we cannot contest the elections together in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Both of us understand politics well enough to know that if we contest together, it benefits a third party, and we do not want to allow that to happen. We will contest against each other, but it will be a friendly fight,"" CM Devendra Fadnavis said.One of the most striking political developments ahead of the polls is the growing proximity between Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and MNS leader Raj Thackeray. Once bitter rivals, the cousins now appear aligned in their belief that losing Mumbai would deal a severe blow to the Thackeray political legacy.For Uddhav Thackeray, the BMC represents perhaps his last major opportunity to reclaim political relevance after the 2022 split in the Shiv Sena. For Raj Thackeray, the election is being pitched as a battle to protect Marathi identity, with the MNS projecting itself as the custodian of Mumbai’s linguistic and cultural character.The opposition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), however, appears under strain. The Congress has made it clear it will contest alone if the MNS is included in the alliance, citing concerns over alienating its core support base among minorities, Dalits and north Indian voters in Mumbai.While a solo Congress strategy risks fragmenting the anti-BJP vote, data from the 2024 assembly elections suggests that without MNS support, the opposition may struggle to cross the majority mark of 114 seats in the 227-member BMC, potentially giving the Mahayuti a structural edge.According to reports, Congress leaders have held discussions with Sharad Pawar and leaders of the NCP (SP) on a possible alliance. Pawar has reportedly indicated his preference for keeping the opposition coalition intact and contesting the elections together, including the Raj Thackeray-led MNS.","State Election Commission has finally announced dates for Maharashtra's long- pending civic body elections.

MGNREGA to be replaced with VB–G Ram G: What it is and how it’s different — key FAQs answered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mgnrega-is-now-vbg-ram-g-what-it-is-and-how-its-different-key-faqs-answered/articleshow/125975849.cms,"End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Here are some of the frequently asked questions:

What is VB–G RAM G?





Water security through water-related works

Core-rural infrastructure

Livelihood-related infrastructure

Special works to mitigate extreme weather events

.

How is the new act different from MGNREGA? What makes it better?





Higher Employment Guarantee: Guarantee increases from 100 → 125 days, giving rural households higher income security.

Strategic Infrastructure Focus: MGNREGA works were scattered across many categories without a robust national strategy.

Localised, Spatially Integrated Planning: The new Act mandates Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, prepared by panchayats themselves and integrated with national spatial systems like PM Gati-Shakti.

The new Act focuses on 4 major types of works ensuring durable assets that directly support water security, core rural infrastructure, livelihood-related infrastructure creation and climate adaptation

How will the new scheme benefit the rural economy?





Water Security: Water-related works are prioritised. Mission Amrit Sarovar has already created/rejuvenated 68,000+ water bodies, demonstrating clear agricultural and groundwater impact.

Core Rural Infrastructure: Roads, connectivity and foundational infrastructure boost market access and rural business activity.

Livelihood Infrastructure: Storage, markets, and production assets support income diversification.

Climate Resilience: Infrastructure for water harvesting, flood drainage, and soil conservation protects rural livelihoods.

Higher Employment & Consumption: 125 guaranteed days increase household earnings, stimulating the village economy.

Reduced Distress Migration: With more rural opportunities and durable assets, migration pressures fall.

Digital Formalisation: Digital attendance, digital payments and data-driven planning increase efficiency.

How will the new scheme benefit farmers?





Guaranteed Labour Availability: States may notify periods aggregating up to 60 days during peak sowing/harvesting when MGNREGA work stops. This prevents labour shortages during critical farm operations and avoids labour being diverted away to guaranteed-wage worksites.

Preventing Wage Inflation: Stopping public works during peaks prevents artificial wage inflation that raises food production costs.

Water & Irrigation Assets: Prioritised water works improve irrigation, groundwater and multi-season cropping potential (supported by the 68,000+ Amrit Sarovar water bodies achievement).

Better Connectivity & Storage: Core and livelihood infrastructure helps farmers store produce, reduce losses, and access markets.

Climate Resilience: Flood-drainage, water harvesting and soil conservation protect crops and reduce damage.

How will the new scheme benefit labourers?





Higher Income: 125 guaranteed days = 25% more potential earnings.

Predictable Work: Hyperlocal Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans ensure planned, advance-mapped work availability.

Digital Payments & Protection: Electronic wages (already 99.94% in 2024-25) continue with full biometric and Aadhaar-based verification, eliminating wage theft.

Unemployment Allowance: If work is not given, states must pay unemployment allowance.

Asset Creation Benefits Workers Too: Workers build and benefit from improved roads, water, and livelihood assets.

Why is there a need to change MGNREGA now?





MGNREGA was built for 2005, but rural India has transformed.

Poverty fell sharply from 25.7% (2011–12) to 4.86% (2023–24), supported by rising consumption, incomes and financial access recorded in MPCE and NABARD RECSS surveys.

With stronger social protection, better connectivity, deeper digital access and more diverse rural livelihoods, the old framework no longer matched today’s rural economy.

Given this structural change, MGNREGA’s open-ended model had become outdated.

The Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill modernises the system, raising guaranteed days, refocusing priorities, and building a more accountable, targeted, and relevant employment framework for today’s rural economy.

Why shift from demand-based to normative funding?





Normative funding aligns MGNREGA with the budgeting model used for most Government of India schemes, without reducing the employment guarantee.

A demand-based model leads to unpredictable allocations and mismatched budgeting. Normative funding uses objective parameters, ensuring predictable, rational planning while still guaranteeing that every eligible worker receives employment or unemployment allowance.

Does normative funding weaken the guarantee of 125 days?





Forecasting accuracy shown by FY 2024-25 when allocation matched demand perfectly

States + Centre share responsibility

Special relaxations allowed during disasters

If work is not provided, the unemployment allowance is mandatory

Thus, the right to guaranteed employment remains legally protected.

Were no attempts made to improve MNREGA earlier?





Women’s participation: 48% → 56.74%

Aadhaar-seeded active workers: 76 lakhs → 12.11crore

Workers on APBS: 0 → 11.93crore

Geo-tagged assets: 0 → 6.44 crore+

e-payments: 37% → 99.99%

Individual assets: 17.6% → 62.96%

What were the problems with MNREGA that necessitated a change?





Investigations in 19 districts of West Bengal found non-existent works, rule violations, and fund misuse, leading to a freeze.

Monitoring across 23 states in FY 2025–26 revealed works “not found or not commensurate with expenditure,” machine use where labour was required, and large-scale bypassing of NMMS attendance.

In 2024–25, misappropriation totalled ₹193.67 crore across states. Only 7.61% of households completed 100 days in the post-pandemic period.

These entrenched issues such as leakages, weak verification, and poor compliance required a new framework, not minor tweaks. The GRG Act creates a clean, digitally governed, accountable, and infrastructure-focused system.

What transparency and social protection measures are built into new Act?





AI-based fraud detection

Central + State Steering Committees for oversight

Focus on 4 key verticals for rural development

Enhanced monitoring role for Panchayats

GPS/mobile-based monitoring

real-time MIS dashboards

weekly public disclosures

stronger social audits (twice a year for every GP)

Why shift from a central sector to a centrally sponsored scheme?





States now share cost & responsibility

Better incentives to prevent misuse

Plans tailored to regional conditions through Gram Panchayat Plans

Centre retains standards, while states execute with accountability

This partnership model improves efficiency and reduces misuse.

Will this burden states financially?





Standard ratio: 60:40 (Centre: State)

North-east & Himalayan states/UT: 90:10

UTs without legislature: 100% funded by Central Funds

States already paid 25% materials & 50% admin earlier

Predictable normative allocation aids budgeting

States can request extra support during disasters

Better oversight reduces long-term losses from misappropriation

Why is a 60-day no-work period mandated, and what happens to workers then?





It ensures labour availability during sowing/harvest

Prevents sharp wage inflation that raises food prices

Workers naturally shift to agriculture, which pays higher seasonal wages

60 days is aggregated, not continuous

Workers still get 125 guaranteed days in the remaining ~300 days

Thus, farmers and labourers both benefit.

NEW DELHI: Centre is set to introduce a new rural employment law in the Lok Sabha, proposing to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 represents a major overhaul of MNREGA. Under the proposed law, the government ""establishes a modern statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047, guaranteeing 125 days of wage employment per rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work,"" as per a statement released.The Act aims to create both employment and durable rural infrastructure through four priority verticals:All assets created under the scheme will be consolidated into the Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack, aimed at ""ensuring a unified and coordinated national approach to rural development,"" it said.The new Act represents a major upgrade over MGNREGA, fixing structural weaknesses while enhancing employment, transparency, planning, and accountability.Key improvements include:The Act strengthens the rural economy through productive asset creation, higher incomes, and better resilience:Also read: Rural jobs scheme: MGNREGA to be replaced by VB–G Ram G; Congress asks why remove Mahatma Gandhi's name Farmers benefit directly through both labour availability and better agricultural infrastructure.Labourers gain from higher guaranteed days, better wages, strong protections, and transparent systems.No, the guarantee is strengthened with employment days increased to 125.Major improvements were made, but they could not overcome deeper structural problems. Key gains (FY 13-14 vis-à-vis FY 2025-26):Despite these advances, misappropriation continued, digital attendance was bypassed, and assets often failed to match expenditure.The scale and persistence of these issues showed that MNREGA’s architecture had reached its limits, making a new, modernised Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill necessary.While many attempts were made to improve its functioning, major systemic failures persisted:Because rural employment is inherently local.No. The structure is balanced and sensitive to state capacity.","The new Act mandates Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, prepared by panchayats themselves and integrated with national spatial systems like PM Gati-Shakti.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Monday directed schools to shift students up to Class V from hybrid to fully online mode in view of the capital’s worsening air pollution.According to a circular issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE), physical classes for students from nursery to Class V in all government, government-aided and unaided private recognised schools in Delhi have been discontinued until further orders due to the prevailing high Air Quality Index (AQI).The order applies to all government, government-aided and private recognised schools in Delhi. School heads have been instructed to ensure that online classes are available for younger students and to inform parents and guardians immediately.The circular clarified that classes for Class VI and above will continue without any change and will be conducted as per earlier instructions issued on December 13. District and zonal education officials have also been asked to ensure smooth implementation of the directions.Delhi remained shrouded in dense smog with the AQI touching 498, close to the maximum level of 500. The city's air quality monitoring stations recorded 'severe' levels at 38 locations and 'very poor' at two stations, with Jahangirpuri recording the worst AQI of 498.Several residents complained of breathlessness, low visibility and health risks.Pollution levels have steadily worsened over the past two days, raising concerns especially for children and other vulnerable groups.The situation had worsened from Sunday when the AQI climbed to 461, marking Delhi's most polluted day this winter and the second-worst December air quality day on record.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 to 100 'satisfactory', 101 to 200 'moderate', 201 to 300 'poor', 301 to 400 'very poor' and 401 to 500 'severe'.The Air Quality Early Warning System forecasts that Delhi's air quality is likely to remain in the 'severe' category, with predictions for the next six days showing 'very poor' conditions.The current pollution levels pose serious health risks to the city's population, with authorities advising people to take necessary precautions. The situation remains particularly concerning as the winter season typically sees increased pollution levels in the capital region.","The Delhi government has directed schools to shift students up to Class V from hybrid to fully online mode.

Congress Questions BJP’s Renaming Of MGNREGA, Hits Out At Gandhi Hatred

.





About the proposed law:

NEW DELHI: The Opposition has mounted a sharp attack on the Centre over its move to repeal and replace the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ). Several leaders have questioned the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from one of India’s largest welfare programmes. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday alleged that the proposal is part of a “BJP-RSS conspiracy” to dismantle a rights-based welfare law that benefits crores of rural poor.In a post on X, Kharge wrote: “This is not just about renaming the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. This is a BJP-RSS conspiracy to end MGNREGA.""Kharge alleged that removing Mahatma Gandhi’s name while paying symbolic tributes to him exposed what he called the government’s “hollowness and hypocrisy.” The Congress leader said that the party would oppose the move “in Parliament and on the streets” and would not allow the rights of poor workers to be taken away.""Erasing Gandhi's name on the centenary of the Sangh shows how hollow and hypocritical those are who, like Modi ji, offer flowers to Bapu on foreign soil. The Congress Party will strongly oppose in Parliament and on the streets any such decision of this arrogant regime that is against the poor and workers,"" the veteran leader further wrote.The remarks came after the Centre proposed to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also objected to the proposed legislation and said the Opposition has demanded that the Bill be referred to the appropriate Parliamentary Standing Committee for detailed scrutiny.In a post on X, Ramesh said such far-reaching legislation requires “deep study and wide consultations,” in keeping with parliamentary traditions.“The entire Opposition is demanding that the following three far-reaching Bills be referred to the Standing Committees concerned. We are hopeful that in keeping with the best of Parliamentary traditions and practices, this demand will be agreed to by the Government. The Bills require deep study and wide consultations: Higher Education Commission Bill, Atomic Energy Bill and G-RAM-G Bill,” his post read.Earlier, Ramesh criticised the government’s focus on renaming schemes, accusing it of prioritising branding over substance. He questioned why Mahatma Gandhi’s name was being removed from a programme that has been in place since 2005Speaking to reporters, Ramesh said: ""The Narendra Modi government is unbeatable in changing the names of schemes and laws, no one can match it. The Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was turned into Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the rural LPG distribution program was named Ujjwala... They are experts in packaging, branding, and naming. The surprising thing is that they hate Pandit Nehru, but they hate Mahatma Gandhi so much too; the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme has been running since 2005. .. You are changing its name to the Venerable Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme; what's the problem with the name Mahatma Gandhi?""Other Opposition leaders echoed similar concerns. Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka, who chairs the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, said the BJP had always intended to end MGNREGA.He recalled that the committee had recommended increasing the number of workdays and wages under the scheme and flagged pending dues to states.""I don't know what problem they have with the name of Bapu, but they wanted to finish it because it was a Congress scheme. I head the Parliamentary panel, and we made so many recommendations — to increase the number of days to 150, to increase the wages... the states have pending dues, West Bengal is not getting funds. They have brought a Bill, but why have they removed the name of Mahatma Gandhi?, "" Ulka asked.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also questioned the rationale behind renaming the law.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament House complex, she said: “Whenever the name of a scheme is changed, there are so many changes that have to be made in offices, stationery... for which money is spent. So, what is the benefit? Why is it being done?Why is Mahatma Gandhi's name being removed. Mahatma Gandhi is considered the tallest leader not just in the country but in the world; so, removing his name, I really don't understand what the objective is. What is their intention?”Senior Trinamool Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien termed the move an insult to the Father of the Nation.""But then, are you surprised! These are the same people who hero-worshipped the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi. They want to insult Mahatma Gandhi and remove him from history,"" O'Brien said.CPI(M) general secretary MA Baby alleged that the proposed overhaul was an attempt to mask the dilution of MGNREGA’s rights-based structure.""The Union Government's grandstanding over a total revamp of the MGNREGS is an attempt to hide the startling fact that the basic rights-based framework under which it operated is being dismantled, and the central share brought down drastically. We will fight tooth and nail against this disastrous move both inside and outside Parliament,"" he claimed.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also criticised the government’s move, saying renaming schemes was a long-standing BJP practice.Speaking to reporters, Yadav said: ""The BJP's culture of changing names is very old... In this double-engine government, the engine in Delhi is learning from the engine in Uttar Pradesh... This double-engine government is claiming others' work as its own. They don't have any new work to show.""MGNREGA, enacted in 2005 and renamed in 2009, guarantees up to 100 days of wage employment annually to rural households willing to undertake unskilled manual work.The proposed VB–G RAM G Bill increases this guarantee to 125 days and seeks to establish a broader rural development framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047.Rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, in the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill, acknowledged that MGNREGA has provided assured wage employment for the past 20 years. However, he said further strengthening was necessary in view of socio-economic changes in rural India and the expansion of other social security schemes.The Bill proposes a centrally sponsored framework under which states will design their own schemes within six months of the Act’s implementation, with the Centre making allocations based on defined parameters. Any expenditure beyond the approved allocation would be borne by state governments.",Opposition questions removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from one of India's largest welfare programmes.

What changes?



'BJP-RSS conspiracy': Mallikarjun Kharge



NEW DELHI: The Centre is set to replace the two-decade-old national rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with a new legislative framework titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, 2025. In response to the change, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the government questioning the intentions behind removing Mahatma Gandhi's name.The Bill, aimed at aligning rural livelihoods with the government’s long-term development vision, has been listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha, according to the supplementary list of business issued on Monday.The proposed legislation seeks to dismantle MGNREGA, enacted in 2005, and establish a new statutory regime for rural employment.Priyanka Gandhi questioned the government’s intent behind renaming the scheme, asking whether such a move was necessary in the first place. Speaking to the reporters outside the Parliament complex, she said, ""Why is Mahatma Gandhi's name being removed. Mahatma Gandhi is considered the tallest leader not just in the country but in the world, so removing his name, I really don't understand. What is the objective? What is their intention?""She further went on to argue, ""Whenever the name of a scheme is changed, there are so many changes that have to be made in offices, stationery, for which money is spent. So, what is the benefit? Why is it being done?""Priyanka Gandhi added that the move was wasteful in terms of both money and time, and said the Centre was effectively disrupting its own work by squandering valuable debate time. ""Even when we are debating, it is on other issues, not the real issues of the people. Time is being wasted, money is being wasted, they are disrupting themselves,"" Priyanka Gandhi added.Last week, when reports surfaced about the government renaming the scheme to 'Poojya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojana,' Priyanka Gandhi had said the exercise would be a waste of government resources and questioned what benefit the process would serve.""I can't understand what mentality is behind this. First, this is Mahatma Gandhi's name, and when it is changed, the government's resources are spent on it again,"" Priyanka Gandhi argued, ""From offices to stationery, everything has to be renamed, so this is a big, costly process. So what's the benefit of doing this unnecessarily? I can't understand.""The government would guarantee 125 days of wage employment every financial year to each rural household whose adult members are willing to undertake unskilled manual work. This is an upgrade from the minimum 100 days of wage employment.The bill positions itself as part of a broader “rural development framework aligned with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047”The goal of MGNREGA framed the programme to ""enhance the livelihood security""While the MGNREGA focused on the goal to ""enhance the livelihood security"", the new bill says it aims to promote ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation for a prosperous and resilient rural Bharat"", and lays emphasis on ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation through public works aggregating into forming Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack"".In the statement of objects and reasons, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan acknowledged the role played by MGNREGA over the last 20 years in providing assured wage employment to rural households. However, the new legislation signals a reimagining of rural employment policy as the government seeks to transition from an entitlement-based safety net to what it describes as a future-oriented development mission.The VB-G RAM G Bill would mark the end of one of India’s most expansive social welfare programmes and the beginning of a new chapter in rural employment policy, potentially reshaping how the state supports livelihoods in the countryside.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the proposal is part of a “BJP-RSS conspiracy” to dismantle a rights-based welfare law that benefits crores of rural poor.In a post on X, Kharge wrote: “This is not just about renaming the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.

‘Amit Shah’s Hands Were Shaking’: Rahul Gandhi Hits Out At BJP-RSS, Warns EC In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday distanced himself from the ""vote chori"" issue raised by the Congress , asserting that the ""INDIA bloc has got nothing to do with it"".His remarks came a day after senior Congress leaders attacked the BJP and election commissioners at a ‘Vote Chor Gaddi Chhod’ rally in the national capital, alleging that ""vote chori"" was in the ruling party’s DNA and accusing its leaders of being ""gaddar"" conspiring to take away people’s voting rights.Abdullah’s National Conference is a constituent of the opposition INDIA bloc, in which the Congress is the largest party by the number of opposition MPs in the Lok Sabha.Responding to questions on the Congress campaign and allegations of electoral irregularities, Abdullah said, ""The INDIA bloc has got nothing to do with it. Every political party is at liberty to set its own agenda. The Congress has made 'vote chori' and SIR as its main issues. Who are we to tell them otherwise?""The Congress has claimed it has collected around six crore signatures against alleged ""vote theft"" and plans to submit them to the President of India.Earlier, when the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) was ongoing during the Bihar elections, Abdullah had claimed that the people of Bihar are ""dissatisfied"" with the Election Commission over allegations of 'vote theft.'Abdullah said the Election Commission must stay true to its ideals of independence and fairness.Speaking to the news agency ANI, Omar Abdullah said, ""There are concerns regarding the special dispensation that was created for Bihar, and how useful it will be for the ruling alliance will be shown when the results come out...It has left the people of Bihar very dissatisfied with the conduct of the Election Commission... We have always taken pride in the independence and impartiality of the Election Commission. I think the Election Commission must hold true to those ideals. ..""Later, when the Bihar poll results were declared, in which the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan was routed, Abdullah said the Bihar assembly poll outcome was more surprising for him than his party’s loss in the Budgam bypoll. Nitish Kumar, he said, turned anti-incumbency into pro-incumbency.“It is good for other states to see what Nitish Kumar ji did for voters. He set caste politics aside and focused on women, introducing schemes that helped him politically also... while Congress, emboldened by its ‘vote chori’ campaign, made seat-sharing among INDIA bloc partners more difficult,” said the National Conference chairman.Abdullah also stressed that political interference in institutions should not be tolerated.Political interference in institutions should not be tolerated and needs to be dealt with seriously, he told reporters at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) in response to reports about the interference in the working and staff engagement in a power project allegedly by a BJP MLA.""Political meddling in the functioning of corporations and departments is unfortunate and worrisome. Political interference should not happen. Such matters must be viewed with seriousness. Earlier, these institutions were accountable to an elected government, but now decisions are being taken without that system in place,"" Omar Abdullah alleged.","Abdullah's National Conference is a constituent of the opposition INDIA bloc, in which the Congress is the largest party by the number of opposition MPs in the Lok Sabha.

Rapid expansion: 468 hospitals empanelled under CGHS in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rapid-expansion-468-hospitals-empanelled-under-cghs-in-2025/articleshow/125993288.cms,".

.

New Delhi: The Central Govt Health Scheme (CGHS) has seen strong expansion in five years, with 468 hospitals empanelled nationwide in 2025, far outpacing the 42 hospitals that exited the scheme during the same period. Official data tabled in Parliament showed that despite a rise in exits this year, the overall network has grown sharply, expanding treatment options for lakhs of govt employees and pensioners across the country.A year-wise analysis highlights steady growth with intermittent churn. In 2021, CGHS empanelled 266 hospitals, while 22 exited. Following year saw 275 additions and 20 exits. Expansion accelerated in 2023, when 398 hospitals were empanelled, though exits also rose to 23. In 2024, 363 hospitals joined the network and 13 exited, marking relative stability. The year 2025 stands out for both record empanelment and highest exit count so far — yet still delivers largest net gain in five years.Much of the expansion has come from large, high-demand states. Delhi, which probably is home to the highest number of CGHS beneficiaries, added 189 hospitals in 2025, reflecting both rising CGHS usage and the capital’s dense private healthcare market.UP empanelled 62 hospitals, Rajasthan 31, Haryana 38, Maharashtra 30 and Bengal 42. These additions have significantly widened access, particularly in urban centres where CGHS footfall is heavy.At the same time, exits have been concentrated in a handful of large states. UP recorded 15 exits in 2025, which was around a third of the national number, followed by Karnataka (6), Maharashtra (5) and Delhi (3). Over the past five years, cumulative exits have reached 20 in UP, 19 in Karnataka, 18 in Maharashtra and 11 in Delhi. Beneficiaries say even limited exits can cause disruption, forcing patients to change hospitals mid-treatment, repeat diagnostic tests or travel farther for care — a particular burden for pensioners and those with chronic illnesses.Hospital groups argue that growth in empanelment does not automatically translate into stability. “The numbers show expansion, but retention depends on how smoothly hospitals are paid and how disputes are resolved,” said Association of Heathcare Providers-India member Dr C M Bhagat. He pointed out that while the recent revision of CGHS package rates on Oct 3, effective October 13, 2025, is a step forward, hospitals continue to flag delayed reimbursements and deductions as key reasons for exiting.The health ministry has said CGHS wellness centres are opened based on demand and that cashless treatment is already available to pensioners and other priority groups at empanelled hospitals. As CGHS usage grows in major cities, experts say the challenge ahead is clear: ensuring that rapid expansion is matched by hospital retention and continuity of care, so that beneficiaries experience not just a larger network, but a more reliable one.","Central Govt Health Scheme (CGHS) has seen strong expansion in five years. 468 hospitals empanelled nationwide in 2025, far outpacing the 42 hospitals that exited the scheme during the same period.

New Delhi: The amended atomic energy bill was tabled in LS Monday, paving way for a huge policy shift in India’s atomic sector that is expected to accelerate civil nuclear energy production by opening doors for private players. The sector has till now been the preserve of govt enterprises.Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, introduced by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House, seeks to repeal Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010. It provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board”, Singh said.The new legislation seeks to support large-scale expansion of nuclear energy and radiation applications across power & non-power sectors. It is central to India’s goal of achieving 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. It proposes a new legal framework that includes modern safety regulations, a dedicated nuclear tribunal for dispute resolution, and reforms to the nuclear liability regime to cap risks & attract investment.While private companies and their joint ventures will be allowed to apply for licences to set up and operate nuclear facilities & transport nuclear fuel, critical functions such as uranium enrichment, spent fuel management and heavy water production will remain under the exclusive control of Centre. Govt will retain control over radioactive substances and radiation-generating equipment to address safety hazards.Singh said the bill was aligned with the goal of increasing the share of nuclear energy in India’s overall energy mix, facilitating innovation in nuclear science and technology, &expanding its use in non-power applications, such as healthcare, food, water, agriculture, industry, environment, research and innovation, and emerging areas such as AI, while continuing to honour India’s obligations on safety, security, safeguards & nuclear liability.The amendments are designed to finally implement the stalled Indo-US nuclear agreement, which has led to little progress beyond fuel imports due to liability issues, and enable US reactor construction in India.",The sector has till now been the preserve of govt enterprises.

New Delhi: Bringing into focus the importance of work-life balance in the digital era, NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule has introduced a private member’s bill in Lok Sabha proposing establishing an ‘employees welfare authority’ to confer the right on employees to disconnect from work-related phone calls & e-mails beyond work hours and on holidays.“Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, fosters a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing burnout caused by today’s digital culture,” Sule had said on X after the bill was introduced on Dec 5. Friday is reserved for private member’s bills in Parliament.The ‘statement of objects and reasons’ of the bill says: “According to a report released by World Economic Forum, the proportion of mobile workers who could work from any location, is expected to rise beyond 70%. While this has benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries with it a significant risk of erosion of boundaries between professional and personal life.”The bill emphasises “the need to respect personal space of employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employers’ calls, emails, etc, during out-of-work hours”. It seeks to impose sanctions at the rate of 1% of total employees’ remuneration on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the bill’s provisions.The bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use. To free employees from digital distractions and enable them to truly connect with people around then, it provides for digital detox centres.The bill also takes into consideration the competitive needs of companies and their diverse work cultures. Calling for flexibility in the right to disconnect rules, it leaves it to the companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees for working out-of-work hours.“The bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect,” it stated.",NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule has introduced a bill in Lok Sabha.

India Slams Pakistan As ‘Global Epicentre Of Terror’, Vows To Counter Pak-Sponsored Attacks At UN

NEW DELHI: India on Monday firmly rejected Pakistan ’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council , saying the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral part of India and will always remain so.Speaking at the UNSC Open Debate on 'Leadership for Peace', India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Harish P, said Pakistan’s repeated mention of Jammu and Kashmir reflected an “obsessive focus” on harming India and its people.He said: ""I refer to the statement made by the representative of Pakistan today. India would like to reiterate that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India. They were, are, and will always remain so. Pakistan’s unwarranted reference to Jammu & Kashmir in today’s open debate attests to its obsessive focus on harming India and its people. A serving non-permanent Security Council Member that chooses to further this obsession in all meetings and platforms of the UN in pursuit of its divisive agenda cannot be expected to fulfil its designated responsibilities and obligations.The Indian envoy said India signed the Indus Waters Treaty 65 years ago in good faith and with a spirit of friendship. However, he said Pakistan had violated the spirit of the treaty over the decades by waging three wars and sponsoring thousands of terror attacks against India. He added that tens of thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terrorism over the last four decades.Referring to the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack, the ambassador said, ""The Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, involved religion-based targeted killings of 26 innocent civilians by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. It is in this backdrop that India has finally announced that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, which is a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism. ""India criticised Pakistan's domestic political situation over jailing former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and allowing its armed forces to engineer a ""constitutional coup"" through the new 27th amendment, which granted lifetime immunity to its chief of defence forces Asim Munir.""Pakistan, of course, has a unique way of respecting the will of its people - by jailing a Prime Minister, by banning the ruling political party and by letting its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving lifetime immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,"" Parvathaneni said.He further added that India would continue to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in all its forms with full resolve.",India firmly rejected Pakistan’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council.

"In Jordan, PM backs durable peace, stability in West Asia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-jordan-pm-backs-durable-peace-stability-in-west-asia/articleshow/125992753.cms,"Expressing hope for peace and stability in the West Asia region, PM Narendra Modi underlined the significance of efforts to counter terrorism, extremism and radicalisation in a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II.Abdullah conveyed strong support for India’s fight against terrorism and condemned terror in all its forms and manifestations, said an Indian readout. Modi also reaffirmed India’s support for efforts being made to achieve durable peace in the region.Modi arrived in Amman for what is the first full-fledged bilateral visit by an Indian PM to the country in 37 years. He had in 2018 transited through Jordan on his way to Palestine.The PM is on a three-nation trip to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman. The leaders also discussed efforts to expand cooperation in areas like trade, fertilisers, digital technology and infrastructure.“On Gaza, from the beginning, your role has been active and positive. It is the hope of all of us that peace and stability remain in this region,” said Modi in his opening remarks.According to Jordan, the need to step up the humanitarian response in Gaza and ensure implementation of the agreement to end the war on the Strip was also discussed.“Against terrorism, our shared and clear stance exists. Under your leadership, Jordan has given a strong and strategic message to all of humanity against terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation,” he added.During the restricted meeting earlier, the leaders discussed giving more strength to cooperation in this area, with Modi recalling the king’s participation in 2018, during his India visit, in a conference on Islamic Heritage. “I remember that our first meeting happened in 2015 at an event focused on countering violent extremism on the sidelines of the UN. You had given inspirational remarks on this subject then too. To promote moderation, your efforts are extremely important not just regionally but for global peace as well,” Modi told Abdullah, adding both sides would continue moving forward solidly in this direction together.In a special gesture, on arrival at the airport in Amman, Modi was received by Jordanian PM Jafar Hassan and accorded a ceremonial welcome. This full-fledged bilateral visit to Jordan is taking place after a span of 37 years, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, said MEA in a statement.Noting that India was Jordan’s 3rd largest trading partner, Modi proposed the two countries should aim to enhance bilateral trade to US$ 5 billion over next five years.On the sidelines of the visit, govts of Jordan and India are due to sign MoUs on renewable energy and water resource management, a cultural exchange programme, a letter of intent on cooperation in the field of digital transformation, and a twinning agreement between the city of Petra and Ellora Caves site in India.In his departure statement earlier, PM Modi said that India shares both age-old civilisational ties, as well as extensive contemporary bilateral relations, with the countries he’s visiting.","Modi arrived in Amman for what is the first full-fledged bilateral visit by an Indian PM to the country in 37 years. He had in 2018 transited through Jordan on his way to Palestine. The PM is on a three-nation trip to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125991092,imgsize-71788,width-400,resizemode-4/in-jordan-pm-backs-durable-peace-stability-in-west-asia.jpg"
Stiff penalties mark big policy shift in regulating higher education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stiff-penalties-mark-big-policy-shift-in-regulating-higher-education/articleshow/125992737.cms,".

New Delhi: For the first time, govt proposed a graded penalty regime for higher education institutions, with fines ranging Rs 10-75 lakh for repeated violations, suspension of degree-awarding powers and closure, while illegal institutions could face Rs 2 crore penalty and immediate shutdown, with safeguards to protect enrolled students.The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025, placed in Lok Sabha on Monday marks a decisive shift in how higher education institutions will be regulated, moving away from advisory nudges to a system driven by statutory penalties, mandatory transparency and accreditation-linked autonomy.Under the graded penalty framework, proposed with hard financial consequences for regulatory violations, institutions found violating provisions of the law or its regulations could face fines starting at Rs 10 lakh, escalating to Rs 30 lakh for repeat offences, and going up to Rs 75 lakh for persistent violations. In extreme cases, regulators can recommend suspension of degree-awarding powers, withdrawal of affiliation or closure.Every year UGC , which will cease to exist, used to notify a list of fake universities, but beyond that, no action could be initiated and they continued to function at the cost of unsuspecting students, many of whom were left with invalid degrees and financial losses. The bill introduced a Rs 2 crore penalty for unauthorised institutions operating without govt approval, along with immediate closure.The law mandates that penalties must not adversely affect enrolled students, a safeguard aimed at preventing academic disruption.The bill also redraws the autonomy framework. All higher education institutions will be required to move towards full accreditation, which in turn unlocks graded academic and administrative autonomy.High-performing colleges — once dependent on affiliating universities — can be authorised to grant degrees in their own name, subject to regulatory approval. The model is intended to reduce the burden of over-affiliation and push institutions towards becoming autonomous, multidisciplinary campuses, in line with NEP-2020 goals. Expansion is also regulated. Universities will need prior approval to open off-campuses or constituent colleges, replacing the earlier system of largely unchecked growth.Moreover, unlike earlier regulatory regimes that relied heavily on executive guidelines, the bill has hardwired transparency into statute. Institutions will be legally required to publicly disclose financial statements, audits, faculty details, infrastructure, courses, learning outcomes, governance structures and accreditation status. False or misleading disclosures can trigger regulatory action, with the regulator mandated to act within 60 days. Grievance redressal mechanisms for students are also made compulsory, giving stakeholders a formal channel to challenge institutional misconduct.","The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025, was placed in Lok Sabha on Monday.

MP seeks to cut age of juvenility to 14 in cases of heinous crimes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mp-seeks-to-cut-age-of-juvenility-to-14-in-cases-of-heinous-crimes/articleshow/125992729.cms,".

New Delhi: Citing rise in cases of involvement of younger juveniles in heinous crimes, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari introduced a private member’s bill in LS seeking amendments to Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 to bring down the age for juveniles who have committed heinous crimes from 16 years to 14. This will allow such cases to be open for assessment by Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) for transfer to children’s court for trial as an adult under the criminal justice system.The statement of objects of Tiwari’s bill introduced in LS on Dec 5 states Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, was enacted to provide a child-friendly approach to the adjudication and disposition of matters involving children in conflict with the law. “However, in recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in involvement of juveniles aged 14-16 years in serious and heinous crimes, including rape, murder, and other violent offences,” it said.“The existing provision of treating all children below the age of 18 years as juveniles, regardless of the gravity of the offence, has led to concerns about adequacy of the justice system in addressing such crimes. This amendment seeks to strike a balance between the principles of rehabilitation and accountability, while ensuring that the rights and welfare of children are protected,” it said.","BJP MP Manoj Tiwari introduced a private member’s bill in LS seeking amendments to Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

.

NEW DELHI: Nearly half of the sanctioned positions on pollution control boards and committees across the country remain vacant even as most major cities are reeling under the impact of air pollution, reveals the answer to a recent question in Parliament.The answers to other questions this year show that this has been the case over the last five years. Also, utilisation of funds under the National Clean Air Programme has been particularly poor in the Capital and satellite cities.A question answered in the ongoing session revealed that apart from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), there are 28 state pollution control boards (SPCBs) and 8 pollution control committees (PCCs) that work in the UTs and the NCT of Delhi. Together, their sanctioned strength for scientific and technical posts is 6,932, of which 3,161 or 45.6% were vacant. The vacancy was 16.3% in CPCB as of Nov, 43.8% in PCCs and 47.6% in the SPCBs as of Aug.As for all posts, an answer in March this year showed that of the 11,562 sanctioned positions in the SPCBs and PCCs, there were 5,671 or over 49% vacancies. Vacancies have ranged from 44% to 51% over the last five years.According to the March answer, 12 of the 28 SPCBs had over 50% vacancy.Sikkim topped the list with 100% vacancy and was followed by Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, both lacking more than 70% staff. Kerala was the only large state where the vacancy was less than 10%. The vacancy was 9.3% in Goa, while Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland had no vacancies.Among PCCs, the vacancy was 44.5% in Delhi, while it was 69% in Ladakh and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Lakshadweep had zero vacancies, while only 11.1% of the sanctioned strength of Chandigarh was vacant. We are yet to get a response from the environment ministry on why there are so many vacancies. As and when we do, the story will be updated online.Data from 44 urban agglomerations (UAs) shows that Noida, Delhi and Faridabad were at the bottom of the list when it came to fund utilisation under the National Clean Air Programme.A parliamentary question answered in March showed that of the Rs 42 crore released to the national capital, only 32% was utilised. The proportion was 11.1% for Noida and 39% for Faridabad. In comparison, Surat utilised all of the funds alloted and Chennai 99%, while Kolkata utilised 87%.","Nearly half of the sanctioned positions on pollution control boards and committees across the country remain vacant.

Centre Signals Willingness to Discuss SIR, Asks Opposition Not to Set Timeline

New Delhi: The draft electoral rolls for five states/Union territories - West Bengal, Rajasthan, Goa, Puducherry and Lakshadweep - undergoing phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) are set to be published Tuesday, with sources indicating likely deletions in the range of 7.5-8.5% for all except Lakshadweep, where they may be barely 2.5%.While West Bengal appears set to have around 58 lakh electors removed on account of being dead, permanently shifted, untraceable or registered at multiple places, sources said the number of notices likely to be issued to electors found to have submitted their enumeration form with discrepancies, including not specifying their link to the electoral roll from the last SIR, ""may be far, far more than 58 lakh"". These discrepancies, by now assessed by booth level officers, are on account of the change in SIR rule that did away with the need for the elector to submit documentation at the enumeration stage, to establish their eligibility for enrolment.Depending on how many of those issued notices can satisfy electoral registration officers of their eligibility with requisite documentation proving their citizenship, the EC will reach the ultimate number of electors to be excluded from the final roll. Sources said the number of dead, shifted, duplicate and untraceable electors identified for deletion in Goa, with a total electorate of 11.8 lakh, may be around a lakh (around 8.5%).In Rajasthan again, 7.5-8% of the total 5.46 crore electors may be removed. Lakshadweep will see the lowest percentage of electors (2.5% of its 57,813 electorate) being struck off the roll.Officials said the large number of entries of dead, duplicate and shifted voters could be due to a 2010 amendment in Representation of the People Act, which disallowed any amendment or deletion of a roll entry without proper verification. Though the manner of this verification was to be prescribed in the following rules, this was never done. ""This is why the dead, shifted and multiple entries have remained in the roll, creating scope for bogus voting,"" said an official.EC sources told TOI once the draft roll is published, each collector will share its printed and soft copy with the district-level functionaries of parties. The draft roll will also be uploaded on the district election officer's website.","Draft electoral rolls for West Bengal, Rajasthan, Goa, Puducherry and Lakshadweep are set to be published Tuesday.

Finance firm head burns man alive to fake own death for Rs 1 crore insurance payout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finance-firm-head-burns-man-alive-to-fake-own-death-for-rs-1-crore-insurance-payout/articleshow/125990292.cms,".

Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Ganesh Chavan (35), the district head of a private finance firm, allegedly burnt a drunk man alive in a car in Latur to claim a Rs 1 crore term insurance payout and wipe out mounting debts, police said on Monday.The meticulously planned crime was aimed at ensuring the insurance benefit reached his family and his liabilities got wiped out. Within 24 hours of the crime, the Latur police tracked the accused on Monday using technical analysis and a lead linked to a woman with whom he had an affair.Superintendent of police Amol Tambe said the accused was under financial stress, with loans totalling Rs 97 lakh taken to buy flats in Mumbai and Latur. ""The burden was aggravated by high personal expenses by his wife and the woman he was involved with. He believed that if he was declared dead, the Rs 1 crore term insurance would clear the liabilities. This belief led to a cold-blooded murder,"" Tambe said.The case came to light after the police received a Dial 112 call around 12.30am on Sunday reporting a car on fire on the Ausa-Vanvada Road. Fire tenders extinguished the blaze and the police found a burnt human skeleton inside the vehicle.An accidental death was initially registered and DNA samples were preserved for identification.The car was found to be registered in the name of a relative but was regularly used by Chavan. When contacted, Chavan's wife told the police that he left home around 10pm on Saturday, claiming he was going to hand over a laptop to a friend, and had not returned.Relatives later identified a metal kada from the remains and believed the body was Chavan's. The police agreed to hand over the remains to the family on the condition that they should bury them instead of burning them.However, inconsistencies during the probe raised suspicion that he was alive. The postmortem of the skeleton was conducted at the spot.""After arresting Chavan, he revealed that 50-year-old Govind Yadav, who was heavily under the influence of liquor, sought a lift from him. The accused gave him a lift and later stopped at a dhaba and bought chicken. Chavan drove towards the isolated Vanvada road, assessing the surroundings while Yadav ate a little and fell asleep in the car,"" said local crime branch inspector Sudhakar Bavkar.The police said Chavan then dragged Yadav to the driver's seat, fastened the seat belt tightly, and placed matchsticks and plastic bags on the seat. He poured petrol inside the car, left the fuel tank cap open to accelerate the blaze, splashed petrol outside, and set the vehicle on fire before fleeing on foot.Sub-divisional police officer Kumar Chaudhary said evidence showed the victim was alive when the car was set ablaze. ""The victim was burnt alive while intoxicated, and was unable to resist. Positioning him in the driver's seat was meant to pass off the death as that of the accused,"" he said.Chavan escaped to Kolhapur and then to Vijaydurg in Sindhudurg district. As doubts mounted, the local crime branch joined the probe. LCB inspector Sudhakar Bavkar said phone analysis, travel data, and financial trails exposed the deception. ""Surveillance of a woman with whom the accused had an extra-marital affair provided a vital lead to trace him to Sindhudurg on Monday,"" Bavkar said.Ausa police station inspector R K Dambale said Chavan admitted that he had planned either suicide or murder to trigger the insurance claim. The police said forensic confirmation was underway.","Ganesh Chavan, district head of a private finance firm, allegedly burnt a drunk man alive in a car in Latur.

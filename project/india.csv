NEW DELHI: As the launch of “Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana” completed nine years this month, BJP on Thursday claimed that the welfare measures of the Modi govt have resulted in empowerment of all sections and buoyancy in Indian economy. Party’s spokesperson Tuhin Sinha noted that the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, a scheme providing LPG connections to poor households, has provided 10.3 crore connections so far, with nearly nine crore beneficiaries turning out to be sustained users of the programme.“This negates opposition’s claim that many beneficiaries did not opt for refills after utilising the initial free gas cylinders,” Sinha told reporters. The scheme has led to an expansion in the LPG network with 7,959 more distributorships, overwhelmingly in the rural areas, he said, adding that the per capita consumption was 3.9 cylinders.Sinha said the beneficiaries include 1.8 crore in Uttar Pradesh, 1.2 crore in West Bengal and 1.1 crore in Bihar, adding that it shows the wide popularity of the welfare programme that also led to a drop in the country’s carbon footprint. He also cited several case studies to assert the scheme led to the mitigation of pulmonary diseases among women.",BJP claims welfare measures of Modi govt have resulted in empowerment of all sections.

"27 Maoists killed carried total bounty of 12.3 cr; 25, including 12 women, were for Basavaraju’s protection",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/27-maoists-killed-carried-total-bounty-of-12-3-cr-25-including-12-women-were-for-basavarajus-protection/articleshow/121350603.cms,"Representational AI image

NEW DELHI: The 27 Naxalites killed in Wednesday’s anti-Maoist operation in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh — including top CPI (Maoist) leader Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju — carried a total bounty of over Rs 12.3 crore, which is likely to be distributed among personnel of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) who executed the operation.Among the 27 Maoist cadres neutralised — all now identified — 15 were men and 12 women. As many as 25 were part of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army’s (PLGA) Company No.7, the dedicated armed wing of CPI (Maoist) that handles protection of top central committee leaders like Basavaraju and former general secretary Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathy.“PLGA Company No.7 is estimated to have a total strength of 60. Of these, 25 were in Basavaraju’s security detail. All the 25, including 12 women cadres, one of whom was deputy commander of Company No.7, were neutralised on Wednesday,” a top intelligence officer told TOI.The large women’s component in PLGA units is not unusual. Among the 31 Maoists killed in the operation at Karregutta Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, 16 were women, most of them part of CPI (Maoist)’s most lethal armed wing, the PLGA Battalion No.1. The women guerrillas go through the same rigorous training as their male counterparts, their tough bodies and steely resolve easing their transition into brutal sharp-shooters.There was one important casualty in the Narayanpur operation other than Basavaraju. Jangu Naveen alias Madhu, a senior leader of the Dandkaranya Zone Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), who was likely heading the CPI (Maoist) central committee secretariat, was with Basavaraju when they were challenged by DRG personnel. Hailing from Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, Naveen, 45, was secretary to central committee and central regional bureau (CRB).While Basavaraju carried a total reward of Rs 10 crore, announced by NIA and various state govts, Jangu Naveen had a bounty of Rs 25 lakh. A Rs 10 lakh reward each was declared against four other senior cadres — Sangeeta, Bhoomika, Company No.7 commander Roshan and his deputy Somli. All four were Company Party Company (CYPC) members.The remaining 21 members — all from PLGA Company No.7 — carried a reward of Rs 8 lakh each, with their total bounty adding up to Rs 1.7 crore.“Since this was exclusively a DRG operation, the bounties declared on the 27 killed Maoists will be split among the DRG personnel who were part of it. This will follow the due process, which includes a magisterial inquiry. Since the operation was in Chhattisgarh, the state DGP may write to the other state govts to give the rewards declared by them, to the DRG personnel,” Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI.The age profile of the 26 Maoists killed with Basavaraju show that 15 of them were less than 25 years old, with the youngest being a woman barely 20 years of age.Only five of the 26 Maoists eliminated in Narayanpur hailed from Andhra Pradesh or Telangana; the rest were all from Chhattisgarh, hailing from Bijapur, Sukma, Indravati, West Bastar, South Bastar and Narayanpur.","The 27 Naxalites killed in Wednesday’s anti-Maoist operation in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh carried a total bounty of over Rs 12.3 crore.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed the chargesheet against former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik and five others in connection with the Kiru hydropower corruption case, PTI reported quoting officials.In 2024, the CBI had carried out searches at eight locations across Delhi and Jammu as part of a probe into alleged corruption involving the awarding of civil contracts worth Rs 2,200 crore for the Kiru Hydro Electric Power Project.The investigation stems from a request made by the Jammu and Kashmir government in 2022, seeking a CBI inquiry into suspected irregularities in the awarding of two major contracts. These concerns were initially raised by Satya Pal Malik, who served as the governor of J&K from August 23, 2018, to October 30, 2019. Malik had publicly alleged that he was offered a Rs 300 crore bribe to approve two files, one of which related to the Kiru project.After a CBI search at his residence last year, he denied all corruption allegations. Malik stated that instead of investigating those he accused of corruption, the agency targeted him. “They will not get anything except 4-5 kurtas and pyjamas. The dictator is trying to scare me by misusing government agencies.I am a farmer's son, I will neither be afraid nor bow down,” he posted online.The CBI has booked Navin Kumar Choudhary, then chairman of Chenab Valley Power Projects Private Limited (CVPPPL), along with officials M S Babu, M K Mittal, and Arun Kumar Mishra, and Patel Engineering Limited.

Poll What is more important when managing religious endowment boards? Ensuring minority community representation Maintaining secular management of properties

After countering the Muslim side's argument that non-Muslims could theoretically form a majority in the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards, Centre told Supreme Court Wednesday that an ill-founded attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta exhibited documents, including the minority affairs ministry's written assurance to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its affidavit in SC, to apprise a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih that the council and boards would never lose their minority character as an overwhelming majority of members would always be Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal had taken nearly 30 minutes on Tuesday to highlight apprehension among Muslims about the council and boards losing their minority character by claiming that the govt, through the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, at least theoretically intended to make non-Muslims the majority in these two bodies. He had asked when the govt never attempted to make non-believers in Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity members in their religious endowment boards, why were waqfs of Muslims singled out. He termed it discrimination on the ground of religion, which violated the fundamental right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 15.Mehta said Hindu religious endowment board members entered temples and even supervised rituals.The charity commissioner, who can be non-Hindu, can appoint archakas (pujaris) and remove them for not performing rituals or for immoral activities, and SC had upheld this by terming appointment of archakas as a secular activity, he added.The SG said Hindu personal laws were codified in 1956, but Muslims continued to be governed by Sharia law. Adjudicating a petition highlighting this discrimination, SC in 1996 had said such a comparison was not possible and reforms in personal law and religious activities were a gradual process.""There cannot be any comparison with Hindu religious endowment boards as they deal with religion and rituals. But the boards deal with management of waqf properties, which is a secular activity, and the state has the power to regulate it through legislation. None of the petitioners has challenged Parliament's legislative competence to enact the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025,"" the SG said.He said the JPC had consulted Archaeological Survey of India on ancient monuments being taken out of the purview of waqf. ASI said while religious activities, which have been going on for years, had not been stopped in protected and ancient monuments, waqf boards managing these monuments as waqfs had unilaterally allowed commercial activities in these ancient spaces, hindering preservation and conservation works.Mehta said in certain cases, waqf boards had restrained ASI from carrying out repair and restoration work in ancient monuments.","Centre says attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.

Govt on Waqf Act in SC: Proof of being Muslim in sync with Sharia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-on-waqf-act-in-sc-proof-of-being-muslim-in-sync-with-sharia/articleshow/121348573.cms,"No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 Act: Raj govt to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order.

HC held that such charges could not be formalised as the complainant woman had failed to adduce proof of the male partner having refused to marry her, especially when both had knowingly entered into a long-term physical relationship.The bench allowed the man's appeal against the decision of the fast-track trial court in Sirmaur's Nahan. HC noted that there was not a single clear averment in the complaint by the 30-year-old woman that the man had refused to marry her.The bench noticed that according to the complainant, the marriage was agreed upon in 2014 but put off several times till 2021 when there were alleged demands of dowry from the man's family. However, the HC cited eyewitnesses' statements that the dowry demand was not made by the male partner, and, hence, there was no proof before the trial court to frame charges under the anti-dowry law.",HC held that such charges could not be formalised as the complainant woman had failed to adduce proof of the male partner having refused to marry her.

Rahul took an identical stand, refusing to acknowledge the controversial transactions that have become the prime money laundering charges slapped by the agency against the two.Young Indian took over AJL's loan liability towards Congress for a mere Rs 50 lakh, and in the process took over the company that owned assets across India estimated at over Rs 2,000 crore, according to ED.Both Sonia and Rahul were directors in Young Indian when these transactions happened, the agency said while accusing them of being involved in the conspiracy to siphon off assets of AJL that actually belonged to the Congress party.Based on details of Rahul's interrogation by ED investigators, TOI had in June 2016 exclusively reported that the Congress functionary had blamed the AJL-YI transactions to the late Motilal Vora. The agency was sceptical of the identical statements of mother and son as Sonia was then Congress president and Rahul was a general secretary in the party, besides being the majority shareholders in Young Indian and directors of the company. Vora was the party's treasurer for decades.Significantly, ED noted in its chargesheet that at the time it was transferred to Young Indian for Rs 50 lakh, AJL had an annual rental income of Rs 75 lakh. AJL's annual income shot up significantly after it was owned by the Gandhi family: from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 15 crore per annum by 2021-22.AJL, publisher of Congress mouthpiece National Herald and Quami Awaz, folded operations in 2008 after providing VRS to its remaining staff. However, it continued to make revenue by renting out its premises in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow and other cities. Later, after taking over the company, the promoters/directors of Young Indian further developed these properties and raised the annual rental income to Rs 15 crore.While Sonia told ED that ""she was not aware why a new entity Young Indian was incorporated for assignment of the alleged loan of Rs 90 crore so as to do away with the non-recoverable loan of AJL when the same could have been achieved simply by writing off the loan"", Rahul had said he was not aware where the Rs 50 lakh came from in Young Indian to settle the AJL loan (with Congress).Both Sonia and Rahul refused to produce documentary evidence to support their claim that late Vora was authorised to take the decision of assigning AJL's loan to YI and in return, transferring the entire company and its properties to the new entity privately owned by them.","Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were directors in Young Indian when these transactions happened.

ED sources pointed out that Madras HC, in a detailed order, had struck down the challenge made on the same ground. In its order, HC had addressed the state govt's objection and held that a predicate offence, or FIR, was not mandatory to initiate an investigation under PMLA.Sources also said the two-judge HC bench of Justices S M Subramaniam and K Rajasekar, in its April 23 order, had rejected Tamil Nadu govt's plea that ED, before carrying out any search and seizure operation on a state-owned entity, must take ""prior consent"" from state govt to maintain sanctity of the federal structure.The bench had dismissed three writ petitions filed by TN govt and Tasmac seeking to stop ED investigation into the alleged liquor scam.The HC bench had said the precondition of getting consent from the state before conducting search was ""completely illogical and bereft of conscience"".

How can a search by an investigating agency even hold good if such absurd conditions are made?"" the two judges had asked.On Thursday, SC observed that the agency had transgressed the federal structure.Sources said in searches at various premises of Tasmac on March 6, ED found ""evidence"" of manipulation in supply orders, payment of bribes for allowing sale of liquor above MRP, grant of bar licences and transfer and posting of officials. The documents seized during the raids also revealed collusion of officials where excess charges of Rs 10-30 per bottle was illegally levied at retail outlets, sources said.","SC faulted the agency for conducting searches on Tasmac when no 'predicate offence' had been registered against state govt undertaking.

Delhi Pollution Control Committee's monthly analysis shows that while the river was more polluted at its exit from the city at Asgarpur, it also entered the city at Palla with substantial pollution levels. The samples of the river were collected on May 1, a day before the city recorded heavy rains. The pollution load in major drains like Maharani Bagh, Shahdara and Najafgarh also increased in May.According to DPCC, while fecal coliform has increased since last month, the river also recorded a spike in ammonia, with the ammoniacal nitrogen levels doubling to 5.7mg/litre from 2.3mg/l last month. The fecal coliform level reading was 23 lakh MPN/100ml in May, much higher than the 15 lakh MPN/100ml in April.Experts, however, were concerned about the various test readings published by DPCC. Pankaj Kumar, environmentalist and founder of Earth Warrior, said, ""If fecal coliform is high, then biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) must also increase. However, we see that BOD at Nizamuddin Bridge is 37mg/l and fecal level is 2.4 lakh MPN/100ml. At the next station at Okhla barrage, BOD drops to 23 and fecal coliform increases to 3.3 lakh.DPCC must recheck this rather big anomaly. At Palla, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level is 9.8mg/l and BOD is 4, which seems a bit unlikely because for DO as high as 9.8, BOD must be 1-2mg/l.""Another expert pointed out that high DO levels upstream of Wazirabad could depict algal growth. ""If there is algal growth, then DO increases during the day and drops at night due to respiration. A DO of 9.8 mg/l appears out of proportion. Or it means there are nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen in the water. It is necessary, therefore, to carry out more testing,"" the expert said.A Delhi govt official added, ""Also, at Wazirabad BOD in Feb was 9mg/l, 7mg/l in March and 6mg/l in April and May; these are not even standards for bathing water. Is Delhi Jal Board also monitoring this?"" The permissible BOD for the Yamuna is 3mg/l.","Pollution in the Yamuna spiked in May with a substantial rise in fecal levels, phosphates and ammonia.

He added that India is ready to discuss issue of terrorism with Pakistan and reiterated New Delhi's point on the Kashmir issue that it will only negotiate the return of POK to India.Jaishankar said Operation Sindoor continues because of its clear message that if there are more terror acts like Pahalgam, India will hit terrorists. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan we will hit them where they are... So, there is a message in continuing the operation but continuing the operation is not the same as firing on each other,"" he said.On the religious profiling of Pahalgam attack victims, Jaishankar said, ""Pakistani leadership, especially their army chief, is driven by an extreme religious outlook... So, there is clearly some connect between the views that were expressed and the behaviour that was done.""Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, too, had earlier drawn a link between the religious profiling by terrorists and Pakistan army chief Asim Munir's anti-India speech on April 16 in which he had stressed the differences between Hindus and Muslims.The minister warned against falling for the narrative that Pakistan does not know what is going on.

Penalise if seats blocked in medical PG courses: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/penalise-if-seats-blocked-in-medical-pg-courses-supreme-court/articleshow/121348233.cms,"Seat-blocking puts chance over merit: SC in NEET-UG case

NEW DELHI: In order to infuse transparency and prevent the malpractice of seat-blocking in PG admission in medical colleges, Supreme Court has directed that the raw scores, answer keys and normalisation formulae of NEET-PG examinations must be published and said that strict penalties for seat blocking be enforced.The court said the counselling process was conceived as a transparent, merit-based national mechanism for allocating post-graduate medical seats but over time it has come under increasing scrutiny for facilitating widespread seat blocking. tnnSeat blocking is when candidates temporarily accept seats, only to abandon them later after securing more preferred options. This leads to those seats remaining unavailable in earlier rounds and opening up only in later stages, disadvantaging higher-ranked aspirants, who may have already committed to less preferred choices.""This malpractice distorts the actual availability of seats, fosters inequity among aspirants, and often reduces the process to one governed more by chance than merit. Seat blocking is not merely an isolated wrongdoing - it reflects deeper systemic flaws rooted in fragmented governance, lack of transparency, and weak policy enforcement,"" the bench said.Court directed implementation of a nationally synchronised counselling calendar to align the all-India quota and state rounds and prevent seat blocking across systems. It also said a centralised fee regulation framework under National Medical Commission and pre-counselling fee disclosure by all private/deemed universities, detailing tuition, hostel, caution deposit, and miscellaneous charges be made mandatory.""Enforce strict penalties for seat blocking including forfeiture of security deposit, disqualification from future NEET-PG exams, blacklisting of complicit colleges. Implement Aadhaar-based seat tracking to prevent multiple seat holdings,"" it said.","Supreme Court has directed that the raw scores, answer keys and normalisation formulae of NEET-PG examinations must be published.

NOIDA: Rushing back home from the society park Wednesday evening to avoid intense winds and sudden rain, Sunita (50) and little Advik (2) were buried under a colossal tin sheet that, cut loose by the storm, fell from the terrace of the 21-storey building where they lived on the 6th floor.Sunita and Advik were steps away from the safety of their Sun-4 tower's lobby at Greater Noida's Migsun Ultimo when the sheet thudded down at 8.45pm. Sunita died on the spot. The boy, possibly shielded by his grandmother, was still breathing when he was rushed to hospital, but succumbed later in the night.The tragedy left Migsun Ultimo in shock and triggered a protest by residents against the developer of the society at Omicron 3 roundabout. The tin sheet wasn't the only lethal flying object that fell on the compound. The metal gate to the terrace of another tower, Sun-6, was also dislodged by the storm and landed on the society compound, burying itself several inches into the ground.

The notices were issued on April 28.The disciplinary action follows a violent confrontation between two student groups on April 25 near the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Kaushal Kendra inside Gate Number 8 of the campus. According to the notices, what started as a brawl quickly escalated into large-scale violence, with students and outsiders allegedly using lathis, stones and other dangerous weapons to attack each other and disrupt peace on campus.One of the expulsion orders, addressed to a student from the diploma in civil engineering course, stated: ""The rioting groups pelted stones and bricks on each other near 'Hygenic Point' cafe...

When the security staff and university officials tried to intervene, the mob hurled abuses and used unparliamentary language and also physically assaulted some of the guards on duty.The notice further added that the rioting groups moved from the South Campus to the North Campus through Gate Number 7 and continued attacking students, staff and university property, including the central library. ""They continued their rampage for hours...put the lives of innocent students, staff, faculty members and visitors in danger...This large-scale violence and lawlessness disturbed the peaceful and tranquil environment of the campus and created panic and chaos. ..""""The violence also resulted in disturbance in the lab exams, central library functioning and classroom teachings which ultimately spoiled the academic and research environment of Jamia Millia Islamia,"" the notice stated.The six expelled students belong to different faculties, including the Faculty of Social Sciences, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, MBA and Yoga Studies.

There was no response from Delhi Police regarding a request for details on the action taken in response to the complaint.The expulsion notices also mentioned past disciplinary action against these students, including earlier show-cause notices and a fine imposed after recommendations from the disciplinary authority.Similarly, the show-cause notice issued to the 20 other students cited their involvement as ""one of the key plotters"" of the violence. The notice repeated the same description of events and consequences as in the expulsion notice, noting that their actions amounted to ""criminal conspiracy to disturb the law and order and the regular academic and administrative functioning of the university.""The notice asked the students to respond within seven days: ""You are directed to explain why action should not be taken against you...

Indigo, Air India Cancel Flights Amid Drone Scare Even After Ceasefire | Is Flying Still Safe?

NEW DELHI: The pilot operating IndiGo ’s Delhi-Srinagar flight on Wednesday had sought Lahore air traffic control (ATC) permission to briefly venture into Pakistan airspace to avoid turbulence after encountering a sudden hailstorm.People in the know say Lahore ATC denied this permission and pilot flying the Airbus A321 with 220 people on board declared emergency to Srinagar ATC. The aircraft with over 220 people on board, including Trinamool Congress MPs, finally landed safely in Srinagar but with its radome or nose cone badly damaged in the hailstorm.A senior Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said, “We have sought details from IndiGo” and a probe is on. The aircraft (VT-IMD) is now grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being widely applauded for handling the situation well and ensuring everyone’s safety.In a statement, the airline said: “IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21, 2025, navigated a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport. All customers were attended to upon landing and no injuries were reported. The aircraft is currently undergoing necessary inspection and maintenance in Srinagar and will resume operations once all clearances have been secured.We sincerely thank our customers for their cooperation in ensuring the safe completion of this flight. As always, the safety of our customers and crew remains our highest priority.”The plane had taken off from Delhi at 5 pm on Wednesday and landed in Srinagar safely at 6.46 pm. While Pakistan airspace remains closed for Indian aircraft, in emergency circumstances such permission as sought by the IndiGo pilot should not have been denied for a commercial airline due to safety reasons, say multiple senior pilots.","Lahore ATC refused IndiGo Delhi-Srinagar pilot request to enter airspace & avoid turbulence: Sources.

Crossing the Rubicon: Why Op Sindoor is a turning point - and Pakistan has no playbook left,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-indias-new-normal-against-pakistan-pakistan-nuclear-blackmail-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/121343471.cms,"Why it matters: India declares strategic sovereignty

1. India has shattered the nuclear ceiling myth

Operation Sindoor demystifies the nuclear escalatory ladder and gives India a dominant perch in deterrence dynamics.

2. India now controls the escalation narrative

3. It establishes a precedent for pre-emptive punishment

“This is not a game of vengeance, but a new form of justice,” PM Modi said.

4. It sets a new model for narrative warfare

Modi’s dramatic visit to Adampur with S-400 systems in the backdrop was both theater and signal: India is not hiding; it’s owning the narrative.

Striking with precision-and restraint

The significance of Op Sindoor lies as much in what India did not do as in what it accomplished. Despite capability and provocation, Indian forces refrained from strikes in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa-regions fraught with internal dissent against the Pakistani state.

This decision denied Islamabad the opportunity to rally its fractious peripheries and helped keep the conflict confined to military and terror-linked targets.

This dual-track strategy-kinetic strikes coupled with psychological and informational warfare-signals the arrival of a matured Indian doctrine that understands escalation control and political signaling in equal measure.

Controlling the narrative

Unlike during Balakot, where India’s post-strike silence allowed misinformation to spread, this time New Delhi controlled the information war with surgical clarity. From photographic evidence to live briefings and satellite imagery, India shaped the global narrative. Pakistan’s disinformation campaigns found little traction.

A symbolic moment came when PM Modi landed at the Adampur airbase-previously claimed “destroyed” by Pakistani media-with intact S-400 systems in view. The image was defiance made visual, reinforcing India’s credibility both domestically and internationally.

Zoom in: A surgical strike across domains

India’s targeting methodology broke new ground. The list of hit sites-Bahawalpur, Muridke, Hizbul Mujahideen facilities in PoK-reads like a who’s who of anti-India terror infrastructure.

""We know who you are, where you are, and how to get you,” one senior official told TOI.

The planning was meticulous. Intelligence had narrowed down buildings within terror compounds to individual residences of top jihadi leaders. Ten members of Masood Azhar’s family died. Azhar narrowly escaped an Indian missile. This wasn’t a symbolic strike-it was personal, precise, and punishing.

India deployed loitering munitions-a class of stealth drones designed to evade radar and deliver pinpoint attacks. These drones exposed the vulnerabilities in Pakistan’s Chinese-built air defenses and took out strategic targets, including the HQ-9 system near Lahore.

Water as weapon

Operation Sindoor should be remembered not as a dogfight between airframes, nor as a stumble toward strategic instability. It was a calibrated use of force, intended to signal resolve, degrade terrorist infrastructure, and demonstrate capability – without crossing the line into broader war. In doing so, it has redefined the contours of India’s response toolkit. Dr Walter Ladwig in an article in RUSI

What’s next: Institutionalizing the 'new normal'

India’s Operation Sindoor did not just punish Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. It redrew the entire strategic map of South Asia. With carefully calibrated force and clear political resolve, India called Pakistan’s nuclear bluff-and shifted the regional balance of power decisively in its favour.What began as a swift retaliatory strike evolved into a wider campaign that expanded across air, cyber, naval, and informational domains. This wasn’t another Balakot or surgical strike. It was a meticulously orchestrated assertion of what Prime Minister Narendra Modi later described as “a new form of justice.”PM Modi’s declaration from Bikaner-""Ab toh Modi ki naso mein lahu nahi, garam sindoor beh raha hai""-wasn’t mere political theater. It was a warning: India’s era of strategic restraint is over.Operation Sindoor is not just a military success-it marks India’s formal entry into the league of nations that use calibrated military force as a standard policy tool to achieve national objectives. What’s revolutionary is not just the action, but the doctrine it now represents.For decades, Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal served as a protective umbrella under which it waged asymmetric warfare-sponsoring terror groups, destabilizing Kashmir, and evading conventional retaliation.That assumption no longer holds.Dr Walter Ladwig noted in his analysis for RUSI: “Operation Sindoor added a new approach to India’s strategic toolbox... calibrated force under the nuclear shadow.“By striking presumed nuclear infrastructure, including the Kirana Hills and Noor Khan Airbase, India called Islamabad’s bluff,” wrote Jyotishman Bhagawati in Asia Times.The traditional Indo-Pak cycle-attack, international outcry, de-escalation -now stands broken. India launched multi-day strikes, absorbed Pakistani retaliation, and still dictated the terms and timing of cessation.""We made one thing very clear... their general has to call up our general and say this. And that is what happened,"" said external affairs minister S Jaishankar on the ceasefire.This signals credibility, resolve, and strategic maturity-the three ingredients of sustainable deterrence.Operation Sindoor isn’t a one-off-it’s a doctrinal evolution that’s now baked into India’s response framework. The new threshold is clear: If a terror attack happens, India will hit back-with precision and at scale.Future adversaries-state or non-state-will now calculate costs differently, knowing Indian retaliation is not symbolic, but systematic and scalable.In the age of disinformation, Operation Sindoor shows that India has learned to fight and win the information war. By swiftly releasing satellite imagery, conducting transparent briefings, and openly debunking Pakistani propaganda (like the fake claim of Adampur airbase destruction), India seized the perception battlefield.In perhaps the boldest assertion of geo-strategic leverage, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty-a pact that had survived wars and crises since 1960. Pakistan’s deepening water crisis means this act is not merely symbolic but potentially destabilizing. And it was done without triggering global condemnation.In a single move, India turned geography into a weapon, adding hydro-diplomacy to its arsenal of pressure tools.India’s message isn’t just about retaliation-it’s about sustained pressure across the spectrum.Military: All three services displayed unprecedented jointness. Navy warships patrolled off Karachi, signaling a willingness to broaden the theatre. Vice Admiral AN Pramod said the Navy ensured Pakistan’s air force stayed “bottled up” on the Makran coast.Cyber and informational: According to reports, India restored access to Baloch voices on social platforms, quietly empowering indigenous resistance to Islamabad’s control. No bombs were dropped in Balochistan or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-avoiding giving Pakistan a unifying nationalist cause while exploiting its internal fault lines.Geo-economics: By putting the Indus Waters Treaty in “abeyance,” India introduced a powerful new lever of pressure. As Pakistan faces a deepening water crisis, this move could have long-term strategic ramifications without provoking international backlash.(With inputs from agencies)",The significance of Op Sindoor lies as much in what India did not do as in what it accomplished.

Bangladesh cancels $21 million order given to Indian defence shipyard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-cancels-21-million-order-given-to-indian-defence-shipyard/articleshow/121347595.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the nose-dive in bilateral ties, Bangladesh has cancelled an order worth $21 million (around Rs 180 crore) inked with Kolkata-based defence shipyard Garden Reach Shipbuilding & Engineers (GRSE) last year for the construction of an 800-tonne advanced ocean-going tug.The contract, which included design, construction and delivery of a 61-metre-long tug in 24 months, was the first major deal inked under the $500-million line of credit for defence purchases extended by New Delhi to Dhaka that was operationalised in 2023.The deal for the tug, with the maximum speed with a full load of at least 13 knots, was signed by officials of the Bangladesh Navy's directorate general of defence purchases and GRSE in Dhaka in July last year. The contract had coincided with Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi's four-day visit to Bangladesh to further consolidate defence ties and explore new avenues for maritime cooperation.The ouster of the then PM Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh in Aug last year, however, has hit bilateral ties. India had earlier steadily stepped-up military ties with Bangladesh, which incidentally acquired its first-ever diesel-electric submarines from China a few years ago, to counter Beijing's strategic inroads into the country.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had earlier this year said India and Bangladesh consider each other ""strategically important"" neighbours and any kind of ""animosity"" between the two countries is not in the interest of either.","The contract included design, construction and delivery of a 61-metre-long tug in 24 months.

Advice that breaks the mold



Eyes on the stars, feet on the ground

The academic world constantly flaunts “quantity” and the number of hours studied ostentatiously. But here’s a topper who stole the spotlight not only for his exceptional performance in the CBSE Class 10 board exams, but also for his not-so-followed study strategy. Meet Rudra Pratap Singh , a student of Stone Ridge International School, Rudrapur, who secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams. His secret to success? Consistency and smart work. Shattering all the age-old adages that equate long hours with high scores, Rudra said: “I studied for just two hours a day.”At first glance, Rudra’s story seems like one of prodigious intellect. But a deeper conversation reveals something more universal and profoundly human—a story of clarity, self-discipline, and purpose-driven learning, all while shouldering responsibilities that transcends far beyond textbooks.From training with NASA and ISRO under their Young Scientist and Citizen Science programmes to interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during government-led youth initiatives, Rudra’s resume reads like a page out of an adult professional’s LinkedIn profile.“I’ve worked with the Ministry of Youth Affairs for programmes like Viksit Bharat and Leaders Dialogue,” he said. He also holds certifications in astrophysics from IIT Kanpur and IIT Bhubaneswar, and serves as a Brand Ambassador for KIIT University, Russia.At such a young age, Singh has earmarked his name as the world record-holding author, certified by the World Record Committee (USA) as the youngest writer of juvenile fiction. He perceives this as part of a larger mission. “I’m advocating for youth welfare, teen upliftment, and mental health activism,” he says with the composure of someone twice his age.So what is the secret behind a teenager with international commitments and so many other feathers in his cap finding time to top the board exams?It isn’t something very typical, nor something entirely different, Rudra says—“just prioritisation and consistency.”He didn't believe in marathon study sessions. “Quality over quantity—I never went beyond two hours a day. But I made sure those two hours were fully focused. I broke large tasks into smaller ones and checked them off daily.”Rudra admits to feeling demotivated several times during the journey. “Sometimes I wondered if two hours were enough,” he said. “But then my inner voice reminded me—you’ve made a promise to yourself and to the people who believe in you. That belief became my fuel.”Rudra’s love for learning isn’t confined to math or science. “I’ve always loved social sciences,” he said. His interests in geopolitics and climate science saw him working with Oxford Academy and participating in the UN Climate Science Olympiad. He’s also been a member of the United Nations World Parliament.He allocated separate time for each subject. “I gave 45 minutes each to English, Hindi, and Social Science, and a bit more to Mathematics because solving problems requires practice,” Rudra says. He made sure he was gaining conceptual clarity in every subject.Like every success story, Rudra’s too has its cornerstone. “My family, my teachers, and the environment around me,” he says without a pause. “There were times when my parents believed in me more than I believed in myself.”He credits his online mentors at PhysicsWallah for helping him build strong conceptual clarity and appreciates the flexibility that digital learning offers. “When we study online, we must show our face to the teacher—not just out of respect, but to stay accountable to ourselves.”For someone his age, Rudra is remarkably self-aware. “Motivation is temporary, but when discipline becomes your motivation, it stays.”Rudra’s message to juniors is both enriching and grounded in experience. “People told me, ‘To top CBSE, you have to study more.’ I wanted to prove them wrong—that even with just two hours of focused study a day, it’s possible. And I did.”But here’s the catch: “It only works if you’re consistent, humble, and willing to learn from others. Don’t be overconfident. Learn from your mistakes—and better still, from others’.”He also doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the pressure that comes with expectations. “In some internal exams, I missed two or three questions. It shook me. But I adapted—reduced my time on social media, focused on weak spots, and reminded myself why I began.”Currently in Class 11, Rudra is focused on the PCM stream, but his ambitions are far broader than just cracking an entrance exam. Whether it’s working with ISRO again, continuing his writing, or influencing youth policies, Rudra sees learning as a lifelong journey, not a series of marksheets.And as he moves forward, the lesson he leaves behind is a compelling one—you don’t need long hours, you need deep intent.In an age where academic excellence is too often equated with burnout, Thakur Rudra Pratap Singh stands as proof that with purpose, even two hours a day is enough to chase the stars—and catch them.","Rudra Pratap Singh secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams.

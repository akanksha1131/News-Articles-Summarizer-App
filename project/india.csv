'Sin': BJP accuses Nehru of dropping Maa Durga stanzas from Vande Mataram in 1937; takes 'pungent echo' dig at Rahul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sin-bjp-accuses-nehru-of-dropping-maa-durga-stanzas-from-vande-mataram-in-1937-takes-pungent-echo-dig-at-rahul/articleshow/125148651.cms,"'RJD Put Katta To Congress' Head': PM Modi Slams Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Rally

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.In a social media post on X, BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said that Congress, under Nehru's presidentship, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur session. He also cited Nehru's letter to Subhash Chandra Bose where Nehru said that Vande Matram has nothing to do with Goddess Durga and opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song.""It is imperative for our younger generation to know how the Congress party brazenly pandering to its communal agenda under the Presidentship of Nehru, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur Session, while PM Narendra Modi today will inaugurate the 150th year commemoration & participate in the mass recital of the full version of our glorious Vande Mataram across the nation,"" Kesavan said.""The glorious Vande Mataram became the voice of our nation’s unity and solidarity, celebrating our motherland, instilling nationalistic spirit and fostering patriotism. Chanting it was made a criminal offense by the British. It did not belong to any particular religion or language. But the Congress committed the historic sin and blunder of linking the song with religion. Congress under Nehru citing religious grounds deliberately removed stanzas of Vande Mataram which hailed Goddess Ma Durga,"" he added.The BJP leader also attacked leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, claiming that ""Hindu Virodhi mentality"" of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Congress leader's recent remarks on Chatth Puja.""In a letter dated Sep 1, 1937, Nehru spitefully writes that anybody considering the words in Vande Mataram as anything to do with a Goddess was absurd. He also derisively opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song. Netaji Subash Bose had strongly advocated for the full original version of Vande Mataram. On Oct 20, 1937 Nehru wrote to Netaji Bose claiming that the background of Vande Mataram was likely to irritate Muslims. He went on to say that there does seem to be substance regarding outcry against Vande Mataram and people who are communalistically inclined have been affected by it,"" he said.""In 1937 if Nehru as Congress president blanked out the mention of Goddess Ma Durga by truncating Vande Mataram, Rahul Gandhi in March 2024 maliciously remarked ‘ There is a word called Shakti in Hindu Dharma and we are fighting against Shakti’. The Hindu Virodhi mentality of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Rahul Gandhi who recently demeaned and maligned the sacred Chatth Puja as a drama, hurting the sentiments of crores of devotees,"" he added.This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch year long celebrations to commemorate 150 years of national song at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Friday. He will also release a commemorative stamp and coin during the event.The programme will mark the formal launch of the year-long nationwide commemoration of the composition that inspired India's freedom movement and continues to evoke national pride and unity.Composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, 'Vande Mataram' was first published in the literary journal 'Bangadarshan' on November 7, 1875.""Later, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee incorporated the hymn in his immortal novel 'Anandamath' which was published in 1882. It was set to music by Rabindranath Tagore. It has become an integral part of the nation's civilisational, political and cultural consciousness,"" a government statement said.","Bharatiya Janata Party accuses India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.

"Delhi Flight Delays: Longer wait times, flight delays, Delhi airport ATC hit by technical snag; airlines issue advisory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-atc-software-issue-causing-flight-delays/articleshow/125148789.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flights are facing serious delays at Delhi Airport on Friday due to a software issue in the air traffic control (ATC).

SIR sets Bengal's Muslim marriage register ringing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sir-sets-bengals-muslim-marriage-register-ringing/articleshow/125147109.cms,"Photo/ANI

KOLKATA: Minority-dominated districts in Bengal bordering Bangladesh are now witnessing an unusual trend - married Muslim couples, who read their vows under Islamic law, are rushing to register their marriages under Section 16 of Special Marriage Act, 1954. According to data accessed by TOI, 1,130 Muslim couples applied to register marriages in Bengal between Nov 2024 and Oct 2025.More than half these applications (609) were made between July and Oct, when Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls was underway in neighbouring Bihar. Bengal govt officials linked the spike over the four-month period to increasing anxiety over SIR.Many of these Muslim couples wanted to acquire an additional citizenship document in view of the impending SIR rollout in Bengal, officials at the Bengal Marriage Registrar General office said.Most of these applications were received from North Dinajpur (199) and Malda (197), which share their borders with Bihar, followed by Murshidabad (185) and Cooch Behar (97). All four districts also share their borders with Bangladesh. Kolkata was at the lower end of the data sheet with only 24 such applications. Jhargram (1) and Kalimpong (2) recorded the least number of such applications.According to sources, Muslim marriages in rural Bengal are usually conducted under The Bengal Muhammadan Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1876.For this, the state gives licences to Muhammadan Marriage and Divorce Registrars (MMRs), who are mostly kazis.""Marriage and divorce certificates issued by the kazis are legally valid, but lack uniformity, with MMRs following their personal formats. The address verification process is also vague. Due to this, multiple govt and private bodies do not accept these kazi-issued certificates as valid marriage documents. The certificates that are issued under Special Marriage Act, not only weed out such problems but are the most acceptable marriage document anywhere in India. These are also considered as citizenship proof in many cases,"" an officer said.Another senior official pointed out that marriage and divorce registrations for Muslims were so far done under the 1876 Act because the process was simpler, allowing individuals to quickly marry, divorce and remarry.""While polygamy is banned, because this Act vests a lot of power in the kazis, it can be manipulated to end a marriage quickly and allow remarriage, bypassing the rigours of legal scrutiny or court cases. The Special Marriage Act, however, is more stringent and allows only one marriage at a time,"" the official explained.","1,130 Muslim couples applied to register marriages in Bengal between Nov 2024 and Oct 2025.

SC relaxes rule on advance disclosure of arrest reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-relaxes-rule-on-advance-disclosure-of-arrest-reasons/articleshow/125147098.cms,"NEW DELHI: Carving out an important exception to a constitutional mandate that an accused must be informed in advance in writing about grounds of his arrest, Supreme Court Thursday that said in crimes like hit-and-run cases, police can inform him about grounds of arrest later but at least two hours prior to his production before a magistrate.This clarification came from a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih on a plea filed by Mihir Rajesh Shah, who claimed his arrest in the BMW hit-and-run case of July 7, 2024, was illegal and unconstitutional as he was not informed about the grounds of his arrest prior to Mumbai police taking him into custody.Shah, allegedly under influence of alcohol, was accused of hitting a scooter, impact of which flung the man aside, but the pillion rider was caught under the bonnet and front wheel and dragged for quite a distance resulting in her death. Shah fled the scene without informing police. He had challenged the legality of arrest alleging that he was not informed about the reasons prior to arrest.The bench affirmed the fundamental right of every person to be informed about the grounds of his arrest and that non-communication would render the arrest illegal. It also said that it was the duty of the magistrate, before whom the accused is produced within 24 hours of arrest, to inquire whether the requirement of prior communication of grounds of arrest has been complied with.However, SC said, ""There may be situations wherein it may not be practically possible to supply such grounds of arrest to the arrested person at the time of his arrest or immediately... It may so happen that in the presence of a police officer a cognisable offence is being committed, and the factual matrix presents a tangible and imminent risk of the suspect absconding or committing further offence(s).""Writing the judgment, Justice Masih said, ""The constitutional safeguards, valuable as they are, cannot be interpreted in a manner to allow it to metamorphose into a procedural impediment that handicaps the law enforcing agencies in due lawful discharge of their duties."" A balance between constitutional mandate and effective discharge of responsibilities cast on police must be struck, the bench said. It said, ""We thus hold, that, in cases where the police are already in possession of documentary material furnishing a cogent basis for the arrest, the written grounds of arrest must be furnished to the arrestee on his arrest. """"However, in exceptional circumstances such as offences against body or property committed in flagrante delicto, where informing the grounds of arrest in writing on arrest is rendered impractical, it shall be sufficient for the police officer or other person making the arrest to orally convey the same to the person at the time of arrest,"" it said,SC said the grounds of arrest in such exceptional cases must be communicated to the accused at least two hours prior to his production before a magistrate to enable the lawyer of the accused to study the grounds of arrest and take appropriate steps in accordance with law.","Mihir Rajesh Shah claimed his arrest in the BMW hit-and-run case of July 7, 2024, was illegal and unconstitutional.

The earlier list, which was struck down by HC, had 113 OBC sub-groups with 77 from the Muslim community and 36 from others.The state govt had expeditiously come out with a new list of OBC sub-groups after it was directed by SC to undertake a fresh recruitment process to fill 25,000 posts of teaching and non-teaching staff in govt schools. The earlier recruitment of teachers was quashed by HC with its order being upheld by SC.On a petition by one Amal Chandra Das challenging the new OBC list, an HC bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Rajasekhar Mantha had on June 17 directed that executive notifications issued between May 8 and June 13 on OBC categories would not come into effect till July 31.",Supreme Court asks Calcutta high court not to proceed with the hearing of a PIL challenging West Bengal govt's new list of OBC sub-groups.

Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s 'How Dare You' Retort At IPS Officer Triggers Political Firestorm

PUNE: A major political row erupted in Maharashtra on Thursday over alleged transfer of a 40-acre 'Mahar Watan' land belonging to the state in Pune's Mundhwa area for Rs 300 crore in favour of Amadea Enterprises LLP, a company in which deputy CM Ajit Pawar's son Parth is one of two partners, prompting Mahayuti government to order a probe by a five-member committee and suspend a sub-registrar.The state allegedly waived stamp duty of Rs 21 crore payable for the sale deed registration done in May, alleged activists who claimed the land's market value was Rs 1,800 crore. CM Devendra Fadnavis said he has ordered an inquiry into the land deal. ""Prima facie the issue appears to be serious. I have asked for officials concerned from land records, IGR and other revenue offices to share all the details with me,"" he said.Govt has suspended sub-registrar Ravindra Taru from IGR's Haveli IV sub-registrar office on charges of ""gross irregularity in registering the sale deed and causing loss to the exchequer"". The IGR authorised joint district registrar (class I) and stamp duty collector Santosh Hingane to initiate criminal proceedings against Taru, Sheetal Tejwani (who held power of attorney for the land), and Amadea Enterprises LLP partner Digvijay Patil, named in the sale deed.Ajit distanced himself from the case. In a statement that further stirred the row, he said he had heard something like this 3-4 months ago and had warned against anything wrong being done. ""I had given clear directions that no one should do anything wrong. Directly, as Ajit Pawar, I have no connection with the case by far,"" he said.He also said when children grow up, they begin their own profession. He clarified the address of the company concerned was not his but that of his son, Parth. ""I have never contacted any official regarding favours to be done for my relatives. If anyone is using my name to do anything against the rules, I do not support it,"" Ajit said. He said ""the CM has the right to conduct an inquiry.""Supriya Sule of NCP (SP), however, defended her nephew, saying, ""I believe in Parth, he won't do anything wrong.""Pune district collector Jitendra Dudi told TOI, ""There has been an illegal transaction and necessary inquiry is being carried out. Action will be taken against officials who are part of it.""","The state allegedly waived stamp duty of Rs 21 crore payable for the sale deed registration done in May.

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: NDA is banking on its reinforced alliance and the appeal of its welfare measures in regions going to polls in Bihar on Thursday to turn the tide in its favour in areas where the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) had edged past it in the last assembly election.In 2020, RJD-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against NDA's 59, performing strongly in Shahabad region and key districts such as Patna, Bhojpur, Saran and Siwan.Back then, Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha, who headed RLSP, had fought separately, helping MGB gain ground in several constituencies, including Begusarai and Buxar. With both Paswan and Kushwaha back in NDA, alliance netas now believe their social coalition has been significantly strengthened. They are also counting on the impact of the govt's welfare initiatives - notably the Rs 10,000 cash transfer to over 1.3 crore women - to sway the voters.In 50 seats across Patna, Bhojpur, Buxar, Saran, Siwan and Begusarai, MGB had bagged 35 in 2020. CPI-ML Liberation, with its strong base among the poor across caste lines, had played a crucial role in MGB's success.A BJP neta said the alliance expects a major recovery in these districts as well as in Magadh and Shahabad regions, where polling is scheduled in the second phase on Nov 11.Also read: Key constituencies, top candidates in phase 1 of Bihar elections Home minister Amit Shah's claim that NDA's tally will rise from 125 seats in 2020 to over 160 stems from confidence of improving its performance in regions that favoured MGB earlier, he added.In 2020, Paswan had walked out of NDA and had dented the alliance's vote base, particularly in seats contested byJDU, while Kushwaha's support was tepid. The return of both netas and the rise of deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary within BJP have boosted the morale of the Kushwaha community, the second-largest OBC bloc after Yadavs, comprising about 4.2% of Bihar's population.In the first phase, JDU is contesting 57 seats, BJ and other allies six, while RJD is fighting more than 70, Congress 24 and CPI-ML 14, with VIP, CPI and CPM also in fray.","In 2020, RJD-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against NDA's 59.

Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!





NEW DELHI: Their plan was audacious, modus operandi professional and inspiration crystal clear. This group of alleged cyber criminals in the city weren't just running a con job, they were staging a real-life version of their favourite TV series, Money Heist, even taking on aliases from characters of the Netflix thriller.So, Arpit Mishra adopted the mantle of the cerebral mastermind of the series and was known to his gang as ""professor"". Working under him were key people executing crucial day-to-day operations. Prabhat Vajpayee, who holds a master's degree in computers and used to manage digital communications and perhaps the flow of illicit funds, used the alias, Amanda. Functioning alongside him was Abbas Khan aka Berlin, a core player ensuring the gang kept running smoothly.With the chilling precision of career criminals, the gang duped around 200 people of Rs 50 crore through a fake online trading scheme. According to special CP (law and order) Ravindra Yadav, the operation, code-named Direct Market Account, was an almost perfect digital deception.Posing as elite financial brokers, the syndicate used to lured the targets into their complex web, first securing their faith by making them part of an ""exclusive"" WhatsApp group that promised privileged market tips.""The setup was elaborate: a fake trading platform, phantom shares and the promise of massive returns — a perfect illusion created to secure maximum gains. Funds of unsuspected people were swiftly transferred before the gang locked their accounts, freezing their money and then demanding a fresh ransom under the threat that they would otherwise have to forfeit their entire investment,"" a cop said.This virtual heist, however, came to a sudden halt as police got hot on the gang's trail following a flurry of complaints, and arrested the three suspects. Investigation began when one Rohit filed a case after being duped of Rs 22 lakh.

United States President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he may travel to India next year as the two countries continue discussions on trade.Speaking to reporters at the White House after announcing a move to reduce the prices of weight loss drugs, Trump said his conversations with PM Modi were progressing smoothly. He also reiterated his personal rapport with the prime minister.""He (PM Modi) largely stopped buying from Russia. And he is a friend of mine, and we speak.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

Accommodated request twice, AG not being fair to court: CJI





NEW DELHI: Unaffected by the rebuke from Supreme Court for seeking reference of petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act to a five-judge bench half-way through the final hearing in the matter, attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday, upsetting CJI B R Gavai, who wondered why the top law officer wasn't being direct enough to seek adjournment of the hearing beyond Nov 24, when a new CJI assumes office.Venkataramani, who had already been granted two adjournments to enable him to participate in an international arbitration proceeding, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, requested the bench to adjourn the hearing scheduled for Friday to Monday.The CJI, who on Nov 3 had refused to accept the Centre’s application seeking reference of the case to a five-judge bench and termed it as an attempt to drag the matter beyond his retirement date of Nov 23, told Bhati that the AG is “not being fair to the court” despite the bench, also including Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul Pancholi, accommodating his request for adjournment twice in the past.“If you want to have the hearing after Nov 24 (when Justice Surya Kant takes over as CJI), you should frankly say that,” the CJI said, adding that “every now and then it is told to us that the AG is busy with international arbitration and yet the Centre comes out with a midnight application seeking reference of the case midway through the final hearing to a five-judge bench.”“We have highest regard for the office of the highest law officer.But when we were practising in HCs, we used to give up cases if we were engaged in a part-heard matter before any bench to enable the HC to complete the hearing as scheduled,” CJI remarked. Though the CJI reluctantly agreed to adjourn the case to Monday, he pointed out that the bench needed enough time to write the judgment. The petitions before SC challenged the provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act which put in place a uniform tenure of four years for the chairperson and members of different tribunals, even though SC had ruled that the tenure should be of five years.On Nov 3, the bench had said, “We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.” However, it clarified that “if on consideration of the arguments, we arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-J bench, we will do so”.",Attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday.

What is the Pune land deal controversy?

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday distanced himself from the Pune land deal controversy involving a company linked to his son Parth Pawar, saying he has ""no connection"" with the issue and ""won’t tolerate any wrongdoing. ""Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Pawar said, ""I am not even remotely connected to this (land deal). I only want to say that whatever reports are being run are not known to me. I have no connection with the issue. I had already clarified that I will not tolerate any wrongdoing. I will analyse the details of the case personally.

Officials noted that as the land is government property, it cannot legally be sold to a private entity.According to PTI, Inspector General of Registration Ravindra Binwade said the high-level committee will examine how the transaction was cleared. ""The committee will find out how government land was sold to a private firm and whether the exemption was given as per norms,"" Binwade said.""The documents submitted to claim the exemption will be checked. The committee will see what sort of documents were produced during registration. But as an immediate action, we have suspended a sub-registrar-rank official. If it is government land, the registration should not have taken place,"" he added.Sources in the revenue department said the 7/12 extract, a key property record, lists the land in the name of ‘Mumbai Sarkar’ (Government of Maharashtra). Besides Parth Pawar, Digvijay Patil, in whose name the registration was done, is also listed as a co-partner in Amadea Enterprises.According to the IGR office order, the sub-registrar (Taru) should have ensured that a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the competent authority was attached before registering the property. In this case, the registration was done without an NOC, resulting in ""serious irregularities.""The order further noted that the document was registered for just Rs 500, availing the stamp duty exemption. While some exemptions may apply, the order said a 2% levy—comprising 1% local body cess and 1% metro cess, amounting to about Rs 6 crore—""cannot be waived,"" leading to a loss to the state exchequer.Ajit Pawar has reiterated that he is ""not remotely connected"" to the land transaction, while Parth Pawar, who shares partnership in Amadea Enterprises with Digvijay Patil, has not yet commented on the allegations.","Ajit Pawar: ""I am not even remotely connected to this (land deal) I only want to say that whatever reports are being run are not known to me.

Estimated blocs:

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: A judicial commission set up by Union home ministry to probe the September 24 violence in Leh Thursday said it was not getting a “good response” from the public, and appealed to the people to come forward and depose before it.Addressing a press conference in Leh, IAS officer Tushar Anand, administrative secretary of the inquiry commission, said, “The greater the number of people submitting evidence, the more impartial the investigation will be and that will help ensure justice.”Ananad, who was accompanied by Rigzin Spalgon, joint secretary for the panel, said it would not be possible to conduct a fair inquiry if people did not come forward. “We won’t get information on our own. People must step up and share whatever they know so that we can examine the evidence and make a proper decision,” he said.He said officials and ground-level staff posted at the site during the incident were being identified and once their list was prepared, they would have to depose before the commission. “But, many people may have seen what happened. If they come forward, it will help the inquiry,” he added.The ministry of home affairs announced the commission on Oct 17 after Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the two major political organisations in the Union Territory of Ladakh, demanded a judicial probe headed by a retired Supreme Court judge as a precondition for resuming dialogue with the Centre.The inquiry commission, chaired by retired SC judge Justice B S Chauhan, began its work on Oct 27 and a day later, issued a public notice inviting people to share information related to the Sept 24 incident. The evidence can be submitted till Nov 28, after which the commission will start its hearing.When asked about reports that some people were allegedly forced by security forces to delete their videos and were now afraid to share evidence, the official said: “Even if the videos have been deleted, people can still submit written statements explaining that they were forced to delete them.” “Anyone having information, whether in video, written, or oral form, can submit it through an affidavit,” he added.On Sept 24, police and paramilitary forces allegedly opened fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, after demonstrations turned violent, killing four people and injuring more than 90. Subsequently, more than 70 people, including climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, were arrested.After the announcement of the judicial probe, the Centre held talks with representatives of LAB and KDA on Oct 22 in New Delhi. The two organisations had pulled out from the scheduled talks after the violence.","A judicial commission set up by Union home ministry to probe the September 24 violence in Leh Thursday said it was not getting a ‘good response’ from the public.

Poonam claimed that her conviction was set aside by a higher court and hence her election could not be set aside because of a conviction that no longer existed.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the petitioner's plea to save her from disqualification as non-mention of conviction in a cheque bounce case, which is a not a serious crime or touches upon moral turpitude, would not materially affect the election.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandurkar said, ""Once it is found that there has been non-disclosure of a previous conviction by a candidate, it creates an impediment in the free exercise of electoral right by a voter.A voter is thus deprived of making an informed and advised choice. It would be a case of suppression/non-disclosure by such a candidate, which renders the election void.""The bench said non-furnishing of information pertaining to criminal antecedents has the effect of causing undue influence, which creates an impediment in the free exercise of electoral right by a voter.The court said it was clear that by failing to disclose her conviction under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the petitioner suppressed material information and thus failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of Rule 24-A (1) of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Palika Nirvachan Niyam, 1994.""Acceptance of her nomination form has therefore been rightly held to be improper. She being the returned candidate, her election was rendered void. It is thus obvious that on account of such wrongful acceptance of her nomination form, the election was materially affected,"" it said, while noting that Poonam had contested the bypoll for the councillor post, which fell vacant because of her disqualification, and lost.","Poonam was unseated from the municipal councillor's post in Nagar Parishad, Bhikangaon, Madhya Pradesh.

'BIG ZERO': PM Modi Takes Massive Dig At RJD, Cong's 'Jungle Raj' Report Card for Bihar in Araria

Violence, accusations and counter-claims

The firsts of Bihar elections

Record turnouts

Campaigns pick up more heat



NEW DELHI: The first phase of the Bihar assembly elections on Thursday recorded the state’s highest-ever voter turnout, with 64.66 per cent of 3.75 crore electors exercising their franchise across 121 constituencies.The Election Commission said polling concluded peacefully “in a festive mood with the highest-ever voter turnout of 64.66 per cent in the history of Bihar”. Bihar's chief electoral officer Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said women voters participated in large numbers with “a lot of enthusiasm”.Several prominent leaders, including Yadav, deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, and a number of ministers, were among the 1,314 candidates contesting in this phase.Stray incidents were reported during polling, including an alleged attack on a vehicle in deputy Vijay Kumar Sinha’s convoy. Sinha, seeking a fourth consecutive term from Lakhisarai, alleged that RJD supporters tried to “intimidate” extremely backward class voters.Sinha lashed out at the Lakhisarai Superintendent of Police (SP) and demanded the deployment of a ""special force"" after his convoy was attacked by people he claimed were supporters of the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).He also had a heated verbal spat with RJD MLC Ajay Kumar. The two leaders were seen hurling abuses at each other as their convoys came face-to-face. As the RJD MLC accused Sinha of being a ""criminal"", alleging that he was trying to intimidate voters, Sinha hit back, calling Kumar a ""failed leader"" and ""drunk."" The latter dismissed the ""drunk"" charge, saying that it was ""Mahua"" (local liquor).On the other hand, the RJD alleged on X that voting had been “deliberately slowed down” in areas where the INDIA bloc is believed to have strong support. The Election Commission rejected the accusation.At the Manjhi assembly constituency in the Saran district, a vehicle of CPM candidate Dr Satyendra Yadav, representing the Grand Alliance, was attacked by miscreants during the first phase of polling. The attack resulted in the shattering of his SUV's windows, creating a chaotic atmosphere in the area. The incident occurred in Jaitpur village under Daudpur police station area, while Yadav was on a tour of his constituency.A notable feature of this election was the presence of Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party. Kishor has promised to make Bihar “among the top-ranking ones in the country” and has said he intends to scrap the prohibition law, arguing that it has weakened the state’s resources.For the first time, there was live webcasting of polling in 100% of the polling stations, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi monitoring the feed from the EC control room here. The CEC engaged with the presiding officers and district election officers from the control room to ensure the smooth progress of polling.Another first in this election was the visit of 16 foreign delegates from six countries to Bihar as part of the international election visitors' programme (IEVP), to witness the poll proceedings . The delegates, EC said, hailed the Bihar elections for being one of the most well-organised, transparent, efficient and participative elections, internationally. Over 90,000 'jeevika didis' or female volunteers were deployed to assist the polling personnel in identifying the 'purdahnasheen' (veiled) women electors.The presiding officers updated the voter turnout figures at the close of poll before leaving the polling station, cutting the delay in updation of approximate voter turnout trends. Earlier these figures would land till as late as 11.30 pm on polling day.The Bihar polls witnessed use of colour photos of candidates on EVM ballot papers.In another first, electors could deposit their mobiles at the polling stations. Modified voter information slips ensured easy readability. Given that the voters per polling station was capped at 1200, voting could proceed without any long queues and extra waiting times.Polling took place across 18 districts. Muzaffarpur recorded the highest turnout at 70.96 per cent, followed by Samastipur at 70.63 per cent.Madhepura recorded 67.21 per cent, Vaishali 67.37 per cent, Saharsa 66.84 per cent, Khagaria 66.36 per cent, Lakhisarai 65.05 per cent, Munger 60.40 per cent, Siwan 60.31 per cent, Nalanda 58.91 per cent, and Patna 57.93 per cent. Lower turnout in urban Patna was attributed to areas such as Bankipur, Digha, and Kumhrar.According to the Election Commission, the state’s lowest turnout was 42.6 per cent in the 1951-52 assembly polls, while the previous highest was 62.57 per cent in 2000. The turnout stood at 57.29 per cent in 2020, 56.91 per cent in 2015, and 52.73 per cent in 2010.As the campaign moves into its final phase, caste and community loyalties continue to play a decisive role, with Yadavs, Kushwahas, Kurmis, Brahmins, and Dalits shaping outcomes in several constituencies.The NDA is banking on chief minister Nitish Kumar’s governance record and recent welfare measures such as 125 units of free electricity, Rs 10,000 cash transfers to more than one crore women, and an increase in social security pensions.The opposition countered that voters were ready for change. RJD president Lalu Prasad posted on X, “If a roti is not flipped on a tawa (pan), it gets burnt. Twenty years is a long time. A Tejashwi government is essential to build a new Bihar.”During campaign events for the second phase, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the high female turnout signalled support for the ruling alliance.“Mothers, daughters, and sisters have been the worst sufferers of 'jungle raj'. Today, they seem to have put up a fortress around polling booths to prevent the return of 'jungle raj',” PM Modi said.The polls, conducted after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls that opposition parties criticised for alleged “rigging” and “manipulation”, are being viewed as an early indicator of political sentiment ahead of 2029.The NDA, which has held power in the state for two decades except for brief intervals, is highlighting its record of “sushasan” (good governance). The opposition INDIA bloc is relying on anti-incumbency and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s “jobs-for-every-home” promise to mount its challenge.The second and final phase will take place on November 11, and the counting will be held on November 14.","First phase of Bihar assembly elections recorded the state’s highest-ever voter turnout, with 64.66 per cent of 3.75 crore electors exercising their franchise across 121 constituencies.

Committed to restituting proceeds of crime to rightful claimants: ED on Anil Ambani case

NEW DELHI: Businessman Anil Ambani has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning on Nov 14 in the alleged SBI loan fraud-related money laundering case against him and his Reliance group, in which the agency attached properties worth Rs 7,500 crore last week.This is the second time he will be questioned by ED. On Aug 5, he was questioned for more than eight hours in another money laundering case, where he was asked about his foreign assets and transactions related to his group entities.Just ahead of his questioning in Aug, ED had searched at least 35 premises in Mumbai (July 24-27), covering at least 50 entities and 22 individuals. During the exercise, the agency had seized several documents and digital records.On Monday, ED said it has attached the Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City, spread over 132 acres in the trans-Thane creek industrial area in Navi Mumbai and worth over Rs 4,462 crore, taking the total attachments against Ambani and his group to more than Rs 7,500 crore. The attachments were related to alleged involvement of Ambani and his group entity Reliance Communication Ltd in money laundering case.ED had stressed that it is “committed to restituting proceeds of crime to their rightful claimants”, an assertion that could lead to auction and sale of these attached properties after taking a clearance from courts.The agency claimed that there is more than Rs 40,000 crore outstanding against Ambani and his entities — the money he had borrowed from domestic and foreign lenders since 2010-2012. Banks have declared his group’s loan accounts as fraud. The department had said, “Investigation has revealed that loans taken by one entity from one bank were utilised for repayment of loans taken by other entities from other banks, transfer to related parties and investments in mutual funds, in contravention to terms and conditions of sanction letter of loans.”In its first order on Oct 31, ED attached properties worth over Rs 3,000 crore, which included his Reliance Centre office in Delhi’s Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg area, worth over Rs 2,100 crore, besides flats and offices in cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad. Ambani and RCom, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd and Reliance Home Finance Ltd are among other group entities accused in two CBI FIRs, the basis of ED’s probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.A spokesperson for Ambani had earlier said that “Reliance Centre-Delhi and Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City at Navi Mumbai are RCom’s assets, which are currently undergoing insolvency. Matters pertaining to the resolution of RCom are sub-judice before NCLT and SC”.","Anil Ambani has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning on Nov 14.

JAMMU: Enforcement Directorate sleuths Thursday launched simultaneous raids in six locations of Jammu and Kashmir, including the house of former minister from Kathua, Jatinder Singh alias Babu Singh, as part of investigations into a narco-terror funding case.Officials said the searches were conducted at four places in Srinagar and two in Jammu under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Police had arrested Singh in April 2022 in connection with the case registered at Gandhi Nagar PS.The case dates back to March 30, 2022, when police detained a suspect, Mohammad Shareef Shah from Kashmir, in Jammu with Rs 6.9 lakh hawala money. During interrogation, Shah had allegedly disclosed that Singh had tasked him with collecting the cash from one Omer in Srinagar.On Sept 9, 2023, State Investigation Agency arrested a drug smuggler, Mohammad Sharief Chechi, a close aide of Singh, from Baramulla. In 2024, SIA arrested two more suspects — Selection Grade Constable Mohammad Saifuddin from Jammu, and former sarpanch Farooq Ahmad Jungal from Uri (Baramulla) — for allegedly being part of a cross-border narcotics syndicate involved in terror funding in Jammu. The arrest of the duo took the number of accused in the case to 17.According to an official SIA statement in 2023, investigation revealed a well-organised drug syndicate run by the accused — some of whom were operating from Dubai — aided by other suspects, including Pakistan-based operatives, who were pushing narcotics into India to generate funds to fuel terrorism in J&K. Heroin smuggled from Pakistan in 2021-22 was sold in India, generating over Rs 2 crore, which was deposited in several Srinagar-based bank accounts, the statement claimed.SIA had earlier filed a chargesheet in this case against 12 accused, including Singh, Muhammad Shareef Shah of Larnoo (Anantnag), and Muhammad Hussain Khateeb of Bhaderwah (Doda), currently based in Pakistan. SIA stated that Singh was in touch with terrorists of the proscribed Hizbul Mujahideen outfit and separatists of the unlawful Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. The proceeds of the drug sales were allegedly transferred to bank accounts of Indian citizens working in Dubai as “mules” (illegal carriers of money) to obscure the origin of these funds, the statement said.Officials said further investigation was underway.","Officials said the searches were conducted at four places in Srinagar and two in Jammu.

DEHRADUN/UTTARKASHI: Villages in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region have begun enforcing new wedding norms - limiting women to wearing only three gold ornaments and banning alcohol - as part of a community-led effort ""to bring simplicity and equality back into marriage rituals"". The rules, passed recently by village panchayats in Chakrata's tribal belt and in Uttarkashi's Dunda block, aim to reduce wedding expenses, end displays of wealth and protect families from the rising costs of social expectation.In Chakrata's Kandhad and Indroli villages, the panchayat ruled that women would be permitted to wear only a nose pin, mangalsutra and earrings at weddings. Families that violate the restriction will be fined Rs 50,000, residents said. The resolution, which was passed unanimously, followed informal discussions among women who said the rising cost of gold and social expectations around ornaments were placing a disproportionate burden on poorer households.""For weddings, women are invited for a community meal - it's part of our tradition before the marriage of the elder son,"" said Leeko Devi, 45, from Kandhad. ""But gold had turned that into a burden.Every year, the pressure grew - more ornaments, more judgment. Now, we've decided we'll all wear the same three pieces, and that's enough.""After the ornament rule was adopted, attention turned to liquor. ""We've started talking about banning liquor too,"" Devi said. ""It doesn't add anything meaningful to our ceremonies. It just turns weddings into shows of wealth.""That conversation turned into a decision in Lodara village of Uttarkashi's Dunda block, where the gram sabha passed a resolution earlier this week to ban alcohol at weddings and 'mundan' ceremonies. A fine of Rs 51,000 was approved for violations, and families that serve alcohol will face social boycott.""No one from our village will attend a wedding where liquor is served,"" said Kavita Butola, Lodara's village head. ""The decision came after meetings involving the Mahila Mangal Dal and Yuvak Mangal Dal. People are tired of weddings becoming more about spending than the rituals themselves.""Residents said these steps were necessary to address growing social pressure on families to organise weddings that display wealth, whether through jewellery, catering or alcohol. ""Ornaments used to symbolise happiness,"" said Arjun Singh, a village elder in Kandhad. ""Now they symbolise anxiety. People don't sleep at night before their daughter's wedding, wondering how they'll afford the jewellery and gifts. ""Tikam Singh, 56, who supported both resolutions, said the changes were long overdue. ""There was music, some food, and the rituals. Now it's DJs, imported liquor, staged photos. This isn't us. These rules bring the ceremony back to its centre.""","Villages in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region have begun enforcing new wedding norms.

NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind exercise, CAG will carry out an audit of the ‘multi-modal transport logistics initiative’ to assess the preparedness of the railways to increase its cargo transportation share to 45% in the next five years (2030) from the current 27%.The federal auditor will also assess the railways’ planning for seamless multimodal transportation, which is key to bring down logistics cost, and plans to submit a report in the next year monsoon session of parliament.Additional deputy CAG (railways) Pravir Pandey said it would make recommendations on cutting logistics costs, promoting ease of doing business, ensuring seamless cargo transportation and integrating the digital ecosystem across the chain. “The focus will be on improving the system and efficiency in logistics to bring down cost,” he said.Pandey said CAG is conducting the audit with particular emphasis on ‘first mile and last mile’ connectivity with logistics hubs and origin-destination pairs in the financial year 2025-26. Initial studies have indicated good scope for improvement to make logistics movement seamless across different modes of transportation.CAG has roped in IIM-Mumbai and IIM-Ahmedabad for the report. “CAG, being the auditor of all ministries and departments of the Govt of India, is uniquely positioned to undertake a comprehensive, cross-sectoral audit covering multiple entities involved in the logistics ecosystem,” it said. “Accordingly, an integrated audit group (IAG) has been constituted to carry out coordinated work across key infrastructure verticals, such as railways, infrastructure, ports, shipping and waterways,” CAG said.The federal auditor will also carry out an audit for sustainable rail transport, which aims at achieving net-zero carbon emission by 2030, and also how efficiently IRCTC, the railways’ catering and ticketing wing, is managing plastic waste.In another development, CAG has set up two centralised cadres to build deeper professional expertise and further improve the quality of audit of central govt finances. It has accorded in-principle approval for the creation — Central Revenue Audit (CRA) Cadre and Central Expenditure Audit (CEA) Cadre — within the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. The scheme will be operationalised from January 1, 2026.","In a first-of-its-kind exercise, CAG will carry out an audit of the ‘multi-modal transport logistics initiative’ The federal auditor will also assess the railways’ planning for seamless multimodal transportation, which is key to bring down logistics cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125139711,imgsize-53610,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-40.jpg"

Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday campaigned in favour of party candidate Harmeet Singh Sandhu for the November 11 bypoll for the Tarn Taran assembly seat in Punjab.Addressing a gathering, Kejriwal said Sandhu's victory will give a boost to development in the border region and strengthen the hands of the Bhagwant Mann government.Punjab government is making exemplary efforts to ensure welfare of every section of the society, and a victory from the Tarn Taran seat is important for continuation of the ongoing pace of development in the state, the AAP leader said.Pointing out that no chief minister had visited the border town earlier, due to which it lagged behind in development, Kejriwal said that it was Mann, after assuming office in March 2022, who gave an impetus for the region's progress.Kejriwal lauded the Mann government for transforming some of the government schools into ""Schools of Eminence"".No private school is a match to these government schools, he said, adding that the rest of the government schools will also be renovated in the same manner.The Mann government has brought a major revolution in all the sectors in the last three years, said Kejriwal, urging people to give a mandate in favour of his ""pro-people"" policies by electing AAP candidate Sandhu.In his address, Chief Minister Mann said the state government has taken several ""historic"" initiatives, and expressed confidence that people will vote for AAP in the upcoming bypoll.Coming down heavily on opposition leaders, Mann said they had ""plundered"" the state's resources for their vested political interests.These leaders had ""built their own palaces and business empires at the cost of the people and the state,"" said Mann, adding that any person who looted even a single penny of public money will be made accountable.The chief minister reiterated his government's commitment to bring to book corrupt leaders and officers, however affluent they may be.He also slammed the Congress and the Akalis, accusing them of patronising gangsters.Polling for the Tarn Taran seat will be held on November 11, and the counting of votes will take place on November 14.The seat fell vacant after the death of AAP MLA Kashmir Singh Sohal in June.

NEW DELHI: Year 2025 is set to be either the second or third warmest year on record as an alarming streak of exceptional temperatures continues, driven by record heat-trapping greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said on Thursday.So far, 2024 was the warmest year on record followed by 2023, the previous warmest. Both these years alongwith 2025 may, therefore, now be the three warmest years on record.Releasing its latest update on the state of global climate ahead of the annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belem, Brazil, the global met body noted that the global mean near-surface temperature from Jan to Aug 2025 was 1.42 degree Celsius (± 0.12 degree C) above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) average, which was lower compared to 1.55 degree C (± 0.13 degree C) for the year 2024. The average temperature rise was 1.45 degree C in 2023.The update, based on six international datasets, showed that the 26-month period from June 2023 to Aug 2025 saw an extended streak of monthly record-breaking temperatures (apart from Feb 2025), and 2015 to 2025 will be the warmest 11 years on record in the 176-year observational history.Flagging record-high observed concentrations of the three key GHG in the atmosphere – carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – in 2024, the WMO said that the measurements to date from individual locations suggest that the levels of such concentrations will be even higher in 2025.“This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year’s record increase in GHG levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.She, however, said the science is equally clear that it’s still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5 degree C by the end of the century — the Paris Agreement’s goal of making efforts to limit global warming within that level.Though the year 2024 breached the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree c above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time, one or more individual years exceeding 1.5 degree C does not necessarily mean that pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree C is out of reach. Exceedance of warming levels, as referred to in the Paris deal, can be measured over an extended period, typically decades or longer.Referring to the average temperature rise in 2025, the WMO also flagged that the Arctic sea ice extent after the winter freeze was the lowest on record, Antarctic sea ice extent tracked well below average throughout the year, and long-term sea level rise trend continued.“Each year above 1.5 degree C will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage. We must act now, at great speed and scale, to make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible – and bring temperatures back below 1.5 degree C before the end of the century,” said UN secretary-general António Guterres.","Year 2025 is set to be either the second or third warmest year on record. Warmest year so far was 2024 followed by 2023, the previous warmest. Global mean near-surface temperature from Jan to Aug 2025 was 1.42 degree Celsius (± 0.12 degree C)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125138251,imgsize-84717,width-400,resizemode-4/global-climate-data-visualization.jpg"
Bihar polls: State creates history by clocking 64.7% voter turnout; breaks 75-year-old record,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-state-creates-history-by-clocking-64-7-voter-turnout-breaks-25-year-old-record/articleshow/125129792.cms,"Bihar has achieved a historic 64.7% voter turnout, the highest ever in the state's electoral history. The first phase of the assembly polls concluded peacefully, marked by new initiatives like live webcasting from all polling stations and international delegates praising the organisation. Efforts to assist voters, including veiled women and persons with disabilities, were highlighted.

New Delhi: Bihar created history on Thursday by clocking 64.7% voter turnout, the highest ever in any election held in the state. Since the onset of electoral politics in India in 1951-52, the highest polling percentage recorded in a Lok Sabha poll in Bihar was 64.6% in 1998, and in an assembly poll, 62.6% in the year 2000.The record-breaking turnout follows the special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral roll in Bihar, resulting in the deletion of nearly 65 lakh dead, permanently shifted, untraceable and non-citizen electors. The exercise was initially slammed by the opposition parties as an exercise meant to disenfranchise the weaker sections and minorities. The high turnout in Bihar Phase 1 is however being seen as a validation of SIR by the people of Bihar.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Thursday congratulated the electors of Bihar for the steepest voter turnout since 1951. He thanked them for expressing complete faith in the EC and turning up to vote in such large numbers, while also appreciating the entire election machinery for working with full transparency and dedication.“Bihar has shown the way to the nation, through SIR with zero appeals, the highest voter turnout since 1951, purest electoral roll, enthusiastic participation of electors and a transparent and dedicated election machinery. Democracy has won. It has been an amazing journey for ECI,” said the CEC.Sharing that the first phase of Bihar assembly poll -- covering 121 assembly seats -- had concluded peacefully and with a festive mood, EC said its new initiatives had made voting a ""most pleasant experience for the voters"".For the first time, there was live webcasting of polling in 100% of the polling stations, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi monitoring the feed from the EC control room here. The CEC engaged with the presiding officers and district election officers from the control room to ensure the smooth progress of polling.Another first in this election was the visit of 16 foreign delegates from six countries to Bihar as part of the international election visitors' programme (IEVP), to witness the poll proceedings . The delegates, EC said, hailed the Bihar elections for being one of the most well-organised, transparent, efficient and participative elections, internationally.Over 90,000 'jeevika didis' or female volunteers were deployed to assist the polling personnel in identifying the 'purdahnasheen' (veiled) women electors. The presiding officers updated the voter turnout figures at the close of poll before leaving the polling station, cutting the delay in updation of approximate voter turnout trends. Earlier these figures would land till as late as 11.30 pm on polling day. The Bihar polls witnessed use of colour photos of candidates on EVM ballot papers. In another first, electors could deposit their mobiles at the polling stations. Modified voter information slips ensured easy readability. Given that the voters per polling station was capped at 1200, voting could proceed without any long queues and extra waiting times.Persons with disabilities were facilitated with wheelchairs, deployment of volunteers to assist them and an e-rickshaw facility for them to reach the polling stations.","Bihar has achieved a historic 64.7% voter turnout, the highest ever in the state's electoral history.

NEW DELHI: Two people were killed and three others seriously injured after being hit by a suburban train near Sandhurst Road railway station in south Mumbai on Thursday evening, police said.""Two persons were brought dead to the hospital, while three were injured. Of these, two took discharge against medical advice (DAMA), while one is being treated,"" an official said.The incident occurred around 7 pm, shortly after suburban train services on Central Railway were disrupted due to a flash strike by employees’ unions protesting an FIR against two engineers in connection with the June 9 Mumbra accident that killed four people.According to a railway official, four people, three women and a man had alighted from the wrong side and were walking on the tracks when a down fast local train hit them. The GRP confirmed they had stepped off an up slow local at Sandhurst Road after services were halted by the protest.The June 9 Mumbra crash occurred when two trains passed each other on a sharp curve, causing commuters on the footboards to fall after their backpacks brushed against each other.Following the probe, two Central Railway engineers were booked under Section 125(a)(b) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita for endangering life or personal safety.Later, the railway unions staged a sudden protest at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), halting suburban operations between 5.50 pm and 6.45 pm.Services resumed only after senior officials assured protesters that the issue would be taken up with the state authorities, PTI reported.The disruption led to massive overcrowding during rush hour. Many outstation passengers at Thane were stranded as locals heading to Kalyan and beyond boarded long-distance trains, forcing railway officials to allow alternate travel arrangements.","Four people, three women and a man had alighted from the wrong side and were walking on the tracks when a down fast local train hit them.

NEW DELHI: Akhil Bhartiya Sant Samiti, which claims to represent 127 sects of Sanathan Dharma, moved Supreme Court on Thursday in support of anti-conversion laws framed by different states and whose validity has come under court's scanner.Seeking intervention in the ongoing litigation on a batch of petitions challenging the laws passed by Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the body filed its application through advocate Atulesh Kumar and supported the laws. It contended that the freedom to propagate religion does not confer a right to convert another person and the freedom of conscience of the prospective convert is equally protected.It said the state laws do not forbid voluntary conversion based on free and informed choice and they narrowly regulate only those acts of conversion that are vitiated by force, fraud, allurement, undue influence or sham marriage.""It is submitted that even if propagation is treated as part of religious practice, still proselytisation achieved through force, fraud, coercion, undue influence, allurement or sham marriage cannot be asserted as an essential or integral religious practice.It is further submitted that such practices militate against the basic ethos of the Constitution- dignity, equality, freedom of conscience, and public order-- and offend the founding civilisational principles of mutual respect and non-compulsion in matters of faith. Activities that impair another's freedom of conscience or threaten public order are amenable to regulation, and the State is duty bound to do the same. Accordingly, the impugned statutes do not trench upon core religious tenets but only interdict impermissible means, leaving voluntary, informed choice untouched,"" the petition said.""The impugned statutes are religion-neutral and content-neutral measures of general application that protect freedom of conscience rather than target any creed. They neither proscribe voluntary conversion nor criminalise inter-faith marriage per se; they address only conversions vitiated by defined wrongful means or marriages undertaken solely as an instrumentality for such conversion. The provisions are precisely framed to incorporate appropriate men's rea and graded penalties, and are coupled with procedural safeguards (verification/hearing by designated authorities),"" it said.","Akhil Bhartiya Sant Samiti, which claims to represent 127 sects of Sanathan Dharma, moved Supreme Court on Thursday in support of anti-conversion laws framed by different states.

India could generate 11 mn tonnes of solar waste by 2047: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-could-generate-11-mn-tonnes-of-solar-waste-by-2047-study/articleshow/125136313.cms,"India is projected to generate about 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047, largely from crystalline-silicon modules, according to two studies published on Thursday.Managing this waste would require nearly 300 recycling plants across the country and an investment of around Rs 4,200 crore, said the studies by Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).The studies also said that recovering and reusing materials from discarded solar panels could create a Rs 3,700-crore market opportunity by 2047.If this potential is realised, recovering valuable materials such as silicon, copper, aluminium and silver from solar waste could meet 38 per cent of the sector's manufacturing inputs by 2047 and avoid 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions by replacing virgin resources with recycled ones.India's solar module recycling market is currently at a very early stage, with only a few commercial recyclers operating.The CEEW studies provide India's first comprehensive blueprint for building a domestic solar recycling ecosystem that supports both clean energy and manufacturing self-reliance.Rishabh Jain, Fellow, CEEW, said, ""India's solar revolution can power a new green industrial opportunity. By embedding circularity into our clean energy systems, we can recover critical minerals, strengthen supply chains and create green jobs while turning potential waste into lasting value.Building this circular economy is most important for India's resilient and responsible growth.""The CEEW studies also said that solar recycling in a formal setup remains unviable today, with recyclers facing losses of Rs 10,000-12,000 per tonne.The biggest operational expense is buying back waste modules, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total (around Rs 600 per panel), followed by processing, collection and disposal costs.For recycling to become profitable, modules would need to be priced below Rs 330 or recyclers supported through EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) certificate trading, tax incentives and R&D investments in efficient recovery of silicon and silver, the studies said.Akanksha Tyagi, Programme Lead, CEEW, said, ""Solar recycling can be the bridge between India's clean energy and manufacturing ambitions. Beyond managing waste, it's an opportunity to innovate by designing panels for easier recovery, improving material purity and creating new value chains around critical minerals.""Introducing EPR targets, creating demand for circular products, improving data transparency and designing for recyclability could turn India's solar waste challenge into a green industry opportunity,"" she said.To enable large-scale adoption, the CEEW studies recommend EPR targets for collection and recovery under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, led by the Environment Ministry, and a Circular Solar Taskforce under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to align policy, finance and industry action.They also propose a centralised solar inventory to identify waste hotspots and urge producers to share material data and design modules for easy disassembly.","India is projected to generate about 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047, largely from crystalline-silicon modules.

'Will Cut Off Your Tongue': Bihar Poll Campaign Turns Ugly, AIMIM Candidate Threatens Tejashwi Yadav

For live updates |

NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for the first phase of assembly elections tomorrow, a video from Patna airport has gone viral on social media. The clip shows an unexpected encounter between estranged brothers Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav The video, captured during a podcast shoot by YouTuber Samdish Bhatia, shows Tej Pratap Yadav, chief of the newly formed Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD), inside a garment store browsing Nehru jackets with Samdish when a party worker informs him that his younger brother, Tejashwi Yadav, is also at the airport.Tejashwi, the Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial candidate and RJD leader was seen along with Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani.In the viral clip, Tejashwi smiles and greets the YouTuber, asking, “Shopping karwa rahe hai bhaiya?” (Are you shopping with brother?) to which Samdish replies, “Woh humko gift de rahe hai.” (He’s giving me a gift.)Tejashwi responds, “You’re very lucky,” before shaking hands with the YouTuber. Moments later, the camera pans back to Tej Pratap, who quietly watches the exchange before turning away without a word.When asked by youtuber if the brothers are not on talking terms, Tej Pratap pauses, then softly says he’s “doing fine.”The clip has spread rapidly across social media platforms, with users interpreting the silence between the brothers as both awkward and emotional. Many viewers commented that “political differences may divide leaders, but the bond of brotherhood remains.”A widely shared post read, “All the relationships in the world on one side, and the bond of a brother on the other — a brother is a brother after all.”The moment has struck an emotional chord online, coming just a day before the first phase of polling. With both brothers campaigning for rival fronts — Tejashwi for the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and Tej Pratap leading his own JJD — the scene underscored the widening political and personal rift within the Yadav family.In recent months, tensions between the brothers have been visible. Tej Pratap, who was expelled from the Rashtriya Janata Dal earlier this year for what the party described as “serious breaches of moral and social values,” has repeatedly taken jibes at his younger brother.Just yesterday, he referred to Tejashwi as “still a child” and remarked that “after the elections, we’ll hand him a toy (jhunjhuna)”, suggesting that his brother lacks political maturity.Earlier, Tej Pratap had unfollowed Tejashwi on X, signaling the deepening feud between them.The family feud dates back to earlier controversies involving Tej Pratap. He was expelled from the RJD and reportedly distanced by the Yadav family after a Facebook post in which he claimed to be in a long-term relationship with a woman went viral, sparking a public dispute.The post also reignited discussion about his turbulent marriage with Aishwarya, granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai, who left their home within months of marriage alleging mistreatment. Their divorce case remains pending in court.Since his expulsion, Tej Pratap has launched his own political outfit, the Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD), and has ruled out any reconciliation with the RJD, saying he would “choose death over returning to that party.” He has maintained that he is guided by “principles and self-respect,” not power.The JJD chief is contesting from the Mahua constituency, while Tejashwi is leading the Mahagathbandhan’s statewide campaign alongside Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) leader Mukesh Sahani, who has been named the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial face.Voting for the Bihar Assembly will take place in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results to be declared on November 14.","The video shows Tej Pratap Yadav, chief of the newly formed Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD), inside a garment store.

India Shocked As UAE Frees Mahadev Scam Accused, Cites No Extradition Request Amid Paper Trail

ED seeks MEA help to take up Uppal's release 'at the highest diplomatic level'

NEW DELHI: The perplexing manner in which Ravi Uppal, a high-value accused in the Rs 6,000-crore Mahadev app money laundering case, left Dubai despite a pending extradition request, puts a wrinkle on otherwise smooth UAE-India ties. UAE has also not informed New Delhi of where he has travelled to.Uppal was considered a big catch for Indian enforcement agencies, probing the illegal betting syndicate. Multiple agencies, including ED and CBI, were probing alleged payments of kickbacks of more than Rs 500 crore involving former Chhattisgarh CM and Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel.Uppal was recently released from Dubai police's custody despite the extradition request pending since Dec 2023, when he was arrested on an Interpol Red Corner Notice.India has an extradition treaty with the UAE, and in the past, the latter had extradited high-profile accused, including British national Christian Michel, an arms dealer, held in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper 'scam'.India had sent the extradition request ""duly transmitted through official diplomatic channels"" after Dubai police informed New Delhi of Uppal's arrest in Dec 2023, sources said.""Despite timely submission and verifiable proof of delivery, UAE authorities later claimed that no extradition request had been received and released the accused.This assertion contradicts the documentation available with the Indian side,"" a source said.While Enforcement Directorate (ED) has sought the ministry of external affairs (MEA) help to take up the matter ""at the highest diplomatic level"" to ensure adherence to treaty commitments by the UAE, officials here are perplexed by the manner in which such a high-profile accused has been allowed to disappear from custody despite a formal request for extradition pending and the Interpol's Red Corner Notice still active.UAE authorities have also not informed India about Uppal's destination, which country he has travelled to while leaving the UAE.""MEA guidelines on extradition procedures clearly state that a formal extradition request must be submitted within 45 to 60 days from the date of provisional arrest, and even if the fugitive is released, it does not preclude re-arrest and extradition once the request is received,"" a senior official said. Sourabh Chandrakar, who like Ravi Uppal is a promoter of the syndicate, is also under detention based on a similar Red Corner Notice. A special court in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, had issued a non-bailable warrant against them, leading to the Interpol notice for their arrest, and subsequently, extradition requests.","Ravi Uppal, a high-value accused in the Rs 6,000-crore Mahadev app money laundering case, left Dubai despite a pending extradition request.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday reiterated its demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the transactions of the Adani Group , on the day US authorities charged Gautam Adani with bribery, fraud.""The indictment of Gautam Adani and others by the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) of the US vindicates the demand that the Indian National Congress has been making since Jan 2023 for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the various Modani scams,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.""The INC had asked a hundred questions in its Hum Adani ke Hain (HAHK) series bringing out the various dimensions of these scams and of the intimate nexus that has existed between the PM and his favourite,"" he added.US authorities have charged Adani, amongst the globe's wealthiest individuals, for deceiving investors by hiding information about his company's substantial solar energy venture in India, which allegedly involved bribery.The 62-year-old businessman faces securities fraud charges and conspiracy allegations, as detailed in Wednesday's unsealed indictment. The case centres on a profitable agreement between Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another organisation to provide 12 gigawatts of solar power to India's government, sufficient to power numerous homes and commercial establishments.Ramesh criticised SEBI's investigation approach, stating, ""The SEC's actions also cast poor light on the manner in which its Indian counterpart, namely SEBI, has gone about investigating violations of securities and other laws by the Adani Group and its abject failure to hold the Group to account for the source of its investments, shell companies, etc.""The legal documents reveal that whilst presenting the project favourably to Wall Street investors who invested billions over five years, the accused were simultaneously involved in a USD 265 million bribery scheme in India to secure contracts and funding.Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller noted that Adani and associates aimed to ""obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors.""US Attorney Breon Peace said the defendants “orchestrated an elaborate scheme” and sought to ""enrich themselves at the expense of the integrity of our financial markets.”","The Congress reiterated its demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the transactions of the Adani Group.

Delhi high court stays proceedings against PC in Maxis case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-high-court-stays-proceedings-against-pc-in-maxis-case/articleshow/115511418.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday stayed proceedings against former Union minister P Chidambaram 's alleged involvement in the Aircel Maxis money laundering case. The single judge bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri acted on a plea by him challenging the trial court's decision to take cognisance of the chargesheet filed by the ED against him in the case.""In the present case, the petitioner being a public servant and the commission of offence by him while being a public servant not being in dispute, the challenge to the legality of order taking cognisance and continuation of proceedings for want of sanction in light of allegations levelled in prosecution complaint(s), would require further consideration. At this stage, bearing in mind the import of the aforesaid decision, it is deemed apposite to direct that till the next date of hearing, proceedings before the trial court qua the present petitioner shall remain stayed,"" it said. tnnHigh court also issued notice to ED seeking the agency's reply on Chidambaram's petition. The next hearing of the case has been scheduled for Nov 22. Chidambaram filed a petition in HC contesting trial court's decision to acknowledge ED complaint against him and his son, Karti Chidambaram , in the Aircel-Maxis case. Senior advocate N Hariharan, who represented the ex-minister, argued that the cognisance could not be taken without prosecution sanction.Hariharan said that in the absence of sanction, the continuation of proceedings before trial court is illegal. He submitted Supreme Court has reiterated that in the case of a public servant, the obtainment of prior sanction under Section 197(1) CrPC is mandatory and cognisance taken by trial court is thus contrary to the settled legal position.Referring to an SC judgment, he further submitted that the issue of sanction being central to the continuation of the trial can be raised at any stage. Advocate Zoheb Hossain represented ED.The case pertains to alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approvals granted to Aircel-Maxis deal at the time when Chidambaram was Union finance minister. In 2006, Maxis took over Aircel by acquiring a 74% stake. The deal came under the scanner in 2011 after Aircel owner C Sivasankaran lodged a complaint with CBI alleging he was pressured to sell his stake to Maxis.In July 2018, CBI named P Chidambaram and his son as accused in its supplementary chargesheet. CBI and ED alleged that Chidambaram, as finance minister, granted approval to the deal benefitting certain people and received kickbacks.The chargesheet named a total of 18 people, including Chidambaram, his son, former finance secretaries Ashok Chawla, former Aircel CEO V Srinivasan, and Maxis owners T Ananda Krishnan and Augustus Ralph Marshall.",The Delhi high court on Wednesday stayed proceedings against former Union minister P Chidambaram's alleged involvement in the Aircel Maxis money laundering case.

""Today, Sule is saying this is AI generated, this is not my voice, whereas her own brother is saying that this is her voice,"" Patra said.Stating that along with Sule, Patole has emerged as one of the recipients of illicit money for INDIA bloc's campaign, Patra challenged Rahul Gandhi to address these accusations directly, questioning if he had given directives to Patole. He highlighted a specific transaction and said, ""This transaction of Rs 235 crore is happening from Dubai, what is the reality behind it?""Patra rejected the opposition's claim that BJP was behind the ""conspiracy"".","NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule has denied she was one of the recipients of the Rs 235 crore allegedly routed through cryptocurrency for use in elections.

After the debacle for Indian pollsters in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year and the recently finished Haryana elections, most TV channels refrained from commissioning exit polls for the Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly elections . That apart, exit polls released Wednesday evening after close of polling in Maharashtra and the second phase in Jharkhand hinted at an advantage for NDA in both states. Counting of votes for both states will take place on Nov 23.The list of polls compiled by TOI from news media and posts on X from their official handles showed that six of the 10 exit polls in Maharashtra gave a clear advantage to the NDA (Mahayuti), one predicted a near-equal show while the remaining three gave the opposition INDIA bloc ( Maha Vikas Aghadi ) the edge.In Jharkhand, three of the seven polls gave a clear edge to opposition NDA in the 81-member House, one indicated a close fight, and two gave INDIA majority. One poll gave neither alliance a majority.Among the polls in Maharashtra that put NDA ahead, the maximum number of seats for the combine in the 288-member assembly varied by around 40 seats - from 157 as predicted by P-Marq to 195 by Peoples Pulse. 'Poll Diary', that predicted a maximum of 186 seats for NDA, kept the range at 122-86 - a margin of 64 seats. The same pollster predicted 69-121 seats for INDIA bloc, again a margin of 53 seats.Polls that gave an edge to NDA suggest most seats will be divided between the two alliances, with other parties reduced to single-digit tallies.Polls that predicted either an equal battle or gave the advantage to INDIA gave a higher number of seats to other parties. Dainik Bhaskar, Electoral Edge and SAS predicted an advantage to INDIA, with Electoral Edge giving the fewest seats to NDA, at 118.In Jharkhand too, most exit polls predict an advantage for NDA. Three of the seven polls have given a clear edge to the saffron combine while Times Now- JVC indicates NDA might have an advantage but the INDIA alliance is very close to the majority mark of 41 seats.Dainik Bhaskar has not given clear majority to either alliance, indicating a neck-and-neck contest. Two pollsters have given a majority to the INDIA alliance.",Most TV channels refrained from commissioning exit polls for the Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly elections.

Lawrence's brother Anmol applies for asylum in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawrences-brother-anmol-applies-for-asylum-in-us/articleshow/115506325.cms,"NEW DELHI: Anmol Bishnoi, the younger brother of notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, is learnt to have applied for asylum in the US through his counsel. Bishnoi, detained last week, has been lodged at the Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa, sources said.Known as 'Squirrel Cage Jail', the prison was referenced in an old radio programme called 'Gang Busters'. The prison facility's website had Anmol's details and mentioned his name as Anmol Bishnoi. It said he was being investigated by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which deals with cross-border crime and undocumented immigration.While Anmol's arrest in the US seems triggered by information shared by the Indian govt about his illegal entry into the country, sources, however, suggested that he may have deliberately surrendered to US authorities as a tactical move to seek asylum. This development came after Mumbai police initiated extradition proceedings against him.Sources said before his detention, Anmol Bishnoi had applied for asylum through the US Citizenship and Immigration Services , a division of Department of Homeland Security. Now that he has initiated asylum proceedings through legal channels, it's unlikely that he will be extradited to India or any other country.The US legal system's tendency to grant bail in such cases, coupled with the precedent set by gangster Goldy Brar's release, raises the possibility that Anmol might evade extradition to India. Brar, too, has applied for asylum, sources said.Also, there is a possibility that Canada police may try to get access to him in connection with some gang-related cases being investigated by RCMP.FBI is learnt to be in the process of verifying Anmol's identity, possibly through a voice sample or a DNA match, sources said. The US agency officials, who had earlier this month confirmed his presence in America, are in touch with Indian agencies for subsequent processes, including his deportation.Anmol, who has a red notice issued against him by Interpol, is an accused in several high-profile cases, including the recent murder of former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique and the firing incident outside Bollywood actor Salman Khan's residence in Mumbai.Anmol has also been accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Sidhu Moosewala who was killed on May 29, 2022.",Anmol Bishnoi is learnt to have applied for asylum in the US through his counsel.

NEW DELHI: The BJP is all set to retain power in Maharashtra with its Mahayuti allies - Shiv Sena and NCP- and could be in for a very close contest in Jharkhand, according to exit poll predictions for the two states. The poll of polls projects clear lead for the Mahayuti with 155 seats while the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance could get 122 seats in the 288-member state assembly. The others may get 11 seats. However, in Jharkhand, the contest is likely to be close. According to the poll of polls prediction for the state, the BJP-led NDA will win 40 seats which is just one short to hit the majority in the 81-member assembly while chief minister Hemant Soren-led INDIA bloc could bag 37 seats.In Maharashtra, three pollsters - Peoples Pulse, Matrize and Chankya Strategies have predicted clear majority for the Mahayuti while the rest three - P-Marq, Dainik Bhaskar and Poll Diary have predicted Mahayuti ahead of the MVA, but short of majority.The Matrize exit poll predicted 150-170 seats for the BJP and allies in Maharashtra with a 48 per cent vote share, it gave the Congress and other allies only 110-130 seats with a vote share of 42 per cent. The poll gave others 8 to 10 seats, with a vote share of 10 per cent.People's Pulse gave NDA's Mahayuti a whopping 175-195 seats while giving only 85-112 seats to MVA and 7-12 to others in Maharashtra. P-MARQ has predicted a total of 137-157 seats for the Mahayuti and 126-146 seats for INDIA Bloc's MVA. Exit polls by Poll Diary predicted the NDA to win in 122-186 seats and the MVA 69-121 while forecasting 12-29 seats for others in Maharashtra. Chanakya Strategies, another pollster, has predicted 152-160 seats for Mahayuti and 130-138 seats for MVA while giving 6-8 seats for others in Maharashtra.In the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP had emerged as the single largest party with 105 seats and its ally the Shiv Sena had won 56. However, the two allies could not agree on the chief minister's post following which Uddhav Thackeray parted ways with the BJP. He went on to form the MVA government with the help of Congress and the NCP which had won 44 and 54 seats respectively. In 2022, the BJP extracted its revenge after Eknath Shinde split the Shiv Sena to ensure the fall of the MVA government. Shinde was made the chief minister by the BJP. A year later, Ajit Pawar rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and split the NCP to complete the Mahayuti.In Jharkhand, the BJP is projected ahead of the JMM-led INDIA bloc by several pollsters while one has predicted a clean sweep for chief minister Hemant Soren. The poll of exit polls for Jharkhand predicts 40 seats for the BJP-led NDA and 38 for the JMM-led INDIA bloc in the state.The Matrize Exit poll has predicted 42-47 seats for NDA and 25-30 seats for the INDIA bloc while giving 0-4 seats to others. People's Pulse has projected 44-53 seats for NDA and 25-37 seats for INDIA Bloc. It has given 5-9 seats to others. Chanakya Strategies exit poll says BJP-led NDA is likely to win 45-50 seats in the state while JMM-led alliance could win 35-38 seats. It said others could get 3-5 seats. Times Now-JVC has predicted 40-44 seats for BJP-led NDA and 30-40 seats for INDIA bloc.However, Axis My India has predicted a clean sweep for the JMM-led alliance in Jharkhand and projected that the INDIA bloc will win 53 seats. The pollster has given NDA 25 seats and Jharkhand Loktantrik Krantikari Morcha (JKLM) two seats. According to the projections, JLKM could end up damaging the prospects of NDA in the state by walking away with a large chunk of Mahto votes.The only polling agency forecasting a hung house in Jharkhand is Dainik Bhaskar. It shows people’s mandate vertically divided with both alliances settling between 36-40 seats, moderately shorter than the halfway mark of 41.In the 2019 assembly elections, the JMM had emerged as the single largest party in Jharkhand with 30 seats, while the BJP could manage only 25. JMM formed a government in alliance with the Congress which had won 16 seats and the RJD which had one seat.It will be interesting to see how the exit polls fare when the votes are counted on November 23. With two big back to back exit poll failures this year, all political parties, and, even the pollsters, would wait for the final results with bated breath.","The BJP is all set to retain power in Maharashtra with its Mahayuti allies - Shiv Sena and NCP- and could be in for a very close contest in Jharkhand.

Pollution making North India weather more smog-prone: US study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-making-north-india-weather-more-smog-prone-us-study/articleshow/115503097.cms,"Seasonal weather conditions like calm winds and low temperatures are known to aggravate air pollution over north India at this time of year. But research suggests that increasing pollution has amplified some of these meteorological factors over the past few decades - which, in turn, may intensify smog further.This pollution-weather loop is likely contributing to the current extreme haze in Delhi and other parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain, say experts. A study published last year showed that soot, black carbon and other kinds of aerosol pollution is magnifying the 'temperature inversion' effect often seen in winter, in which warm air traps colder air on the surface below, preventing pollution from dissipating. That's because these aerosols have a warming effect on the lower troposphere - the lowest part of the atmosphere - while cooling the air on the surface below.Aerosol pollution raises the stability of the lower troposphere and aggravates the temperature inversion that is happening naturally, said Ritesh Gautam, a senior researcher at Environmental Defence Fund in the US, who led the study along with NASA researchers. ""This amplification effect seems to be strengthening decade on decade,"" Gautam said. The study found a nine-fold increase since 1980 in the number of days when visibility is less than 500 metres during Nov. There was a five-old increase in such days in Dec-Jan, including in Delhi.Researchers looked at data over four decades to understand the interaction of pollution and atmosphere over the Indo-Gangetic plain. They found aerosol pollution in Nov increased by around 90% between 2002 and 2019, likely due to the rise of crop burning. Exceptionally high aerosol pollution rose in Dec-Jan, too, by around 40%.Those two decades saw a correspondingly large warming of the lower troposphere. The stability in this layer also showed an increase, with the height of the planetary boundary layer dropping since 1980. This layer acts like a dome confining the pollution to the ground, so any increase in its stability or decrease in its height would prolong or intensify smoggy conditions on the ground.""The stability does not allow air to move out,"" said S N Tripathi, a senior scientist at IIT Kanpur. Another factor is increased relative humidity, perhaps due to increased irrigation. More moisture in the air means more droplets of fog or smog can form. The study found a 20% rise in surface humidity since 1980.All these factors are coming together to create a ""multiple whammy"" for Delhi and other parts of north India, said Gautam. ""You can't control the weather, but you can control the amount of pollution that is combining with the weather to produce this severe smog,"" he said.The physics of this feedback cycle between pollution and atmospheric stability is known, but Gautam's study provides evidence of its effect over time, said Tripathi, who was not involved in that study. The long-term rise in lower tropospheric stability and relative humidity is also due to climate variability, said Chandra Venkatraman, an aerosol specialist at IIT Bombay. How much this meteorological change contributes to extreme smog is unclear.Emissions remain the main driver of pollution, she noted. ""Unabated emissions and increased secondary aerosol production under high stability and relative humidity conditions is leading to the extreme PM2.5 conditions over north India and Pakistan,"" she said. Transboundary pollution may also be playing a role in Delhi's current crisis, said Tripathi, adding that there seems to be a large pollution spike over Lahore.","Aerosol pollution is magnifying the 'temperature inversion' effect often seen in winter. Warm air traps colder air on the surface below, preventing pollution from dissipating. Researchers looked at data over four decades to understand the interaction of pollution and atmosphere.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115503185,imgsize-485686,width-400,resizemode-4/115503185.jpg"

Biren Singh's vow to crack down on 'militants' fails to stem stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biren-singhs-vow-to-crack-down-on-militants-fails-to-stem-stir/articleshow/115506086.cms,"(With inputs from HC Vanlalruata in Aizawl)

A pause in Meitei protests Wednesday after the BJP-led govt's assurance of ""a comprehensive crackdown"" on Kuki militant groups in Manipur's hill districts within a week proved short-lived as multiple organisations in Imphal valley declared their agitation would continue until they saw results on the ground.The uproar came amid an indefinite curfew in Imphal East, Imphal West and Kakching and the administration's decision to extend the mobile internet blackout across seven districts for three more days. Curfew had been eased for five hours from 5am. In the evening, the state govt announced that schools in all valley districts would be shut till Nov 23.Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI) had announced suspension of its indefinite sit-in at Ima Market in the heart of Imphal for a week by citing N Biren Singh govt's assurances on its demands, but was apparently forced to back-track by Meitei protest groups unwilling to take the administration's word for it.This came a day after COCOMI rejected an eight-point NDA resolution adopted by 27 MLAs Monday night to go all out against the Kuki militants suspected of killing six Meitei inmates - three women and as many children - of a shelter for the displaced in Jiribam. The organisation gave the state govt 24 hours to announce operations against all Kuki militant outfits bound by the tripartite Suspension of Operations agreement, holding them accountable for over 18 months of ethnic bloodletting.""We will observe how the (revised) resolution passed by the legislators is implemented. Further action will be decided after that,"" COCOMI coordinator Somorendro Thokchom told the media.While security forces go after Kuki militants in the hill districts, NIA would probe the abduction and killing of six shelter inmates, COCOMI was assured.But protesters, including Meira Paibis (women activists) from Keisampat Thiyam Leikai, promptly resumed the sit-in against what they termed an ""inadequate response"" from the state govt to repeated attacks by militants.At Kongba in Imphal East, a demonstration by 12 Clubs Wangkhei Road demanded action against the state's 10 Kuki MLAs, seven of them of BJP, for allegedly supporting militant activity. Similar protests were organised at Ayangpalli Road and Wangkhei Puja Lampak, with participants calling for action against all Kuki-Zo and Hmar militants.","Meitei groups in Manipur valley declare their agitation will continue until they see results on the ground.

Agreed to work on rebuilding trust: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on China talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agreed-to-work-on-rebuilding-trust-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-on-china-talks/articleshow/115505832.cms,"NEW DELHI: With over 1,20,000 Chinese soldiers with heavy weapon systems still amassed along the long frontier with India, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday told his Chinese counterpart Admiral Dong Jun that it is now crucial to move forward from the recent troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh to de-escalation to build greater trust and confidence between the two countries.""We need to focus on cooperation rather than conflict,"" Singh said at the delegation-level meeting with the Chinese defence minister on the sidelines of the Asean defence ministers' meeting-plus in Vientiane.Describing the 50-minute bilateral meeting as ""extremely productive"", defence minister Rajnath Singh said the two sides ""agreed to work together towards a roadmap for rebuilding mutual trust and understanding"". ""Amicable relations"" between India and China, the two most populated nations in the world and major engines of global growth, would have ""positive implications"" for global peace and prosperity as well as help stabilise the world economy, he said.The meeting comes after Indian and Chinese troops disengaged at the remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last month and then resumed ""coordinated"" patrolling in the two areas.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had also held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of G20 summit in Brazil two days ago, where the next steps towards normalising the overall bilateral relations, like resumption of direct flights and the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra as well as data sharing on trans-border rivers, were discussed.The Depsang-Demchok disengagement, of course, is only the first step towards restoring normalcy along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. India wants it to be followed by de-escalation and then de-induction of troops ranged against each other.Sources told TOI that latest surveillance and intelligence inputs show China continues to deploy around 22 to 23 combined arms brigades (CABs) in forward locations and training areas along the western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) sectors of the LAC. Each CAB has around 4,500-5,000 soldiers with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery, and surface-to-air missile systems, among other weapon systems.Moreover, People's Liberation Army (PLA) also continues with its ""heightened activity"" across Yangtse, Asaphila, Longju, and Fish Tail-1 & 2 areas in Arunachal Pradesh, sources said. At the bilateral, Singh reiterated India's consistent stand throughout the stand-off - which erupted after PLA made multiple intrusions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020 - that border issues cannot be separated from the overall bilateral relations.Singh also called for reflecting on the lessons learnt from the ""unfortunate border clashes"" at Galwan Valley in June 2020, taking measures to prevent recurrence of such events, and safeguarding peace and tranquillity along the border. Singh emphasised he looked forward to greater trust and confidence-building between the two sides through de-escalation. With the Depsang-Demchok disengagement, there is no longer any eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which will prevent any sudden inadvertent vertical escalation on the ground. But there is still a long way to go before the forward deployed rival troops go back to their peacetime locations.","Rajnath Singh tells his Chinese counterpart Admiral Dong Jun that it is now crucial to move forward from the recent troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh to de-escalation.

The agency also summoned Gaurav Mehta to join the investigation.This comes hours after the Enforcement Directorate conducted searches at the Raipur premises of Gaurav Mehta in connection with the Bitcoin transactions case. The investigation is part of a broader money laundering probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Maharashtra and Delhi police had registered multiple cases against Variable Tech Pte Ltd, Late Amit Bhardwaj and Ajay Bhardwaj and others for allegedly running multi-level-marketing (MLM) schemes through which they allegedly collected around Rs 6,600 crore in the form of Bitcoins in 2017 from gullible people while offering 10 per cent monthly return in the cryptocurrency.Bitcoins, a cryptocurrency, are not controlled by any central bank of any country.Earlier on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party accused NCP MP Supriya Sule and Congress leader Nana Patole of using Bitcoins to fund the ongoing Maharashtra Assembly elections. The BJP also released a purported audio recording claiming to be Sule's voice, which she has denied.According to ED sources, Mehta is accused of collecting funds worth 6,600 crore in Bitcoin as far back as 2017, luring investors with promises of 10% monthly returns. The investigation stems from police complaints filed in Maharashtra and Delhi.Officials believe Mehta's activities may be tied to larger financial operations potentially influencing the election process. The ED is expected to intensify its probe into the alleged misuse of cryptocurrencies.","Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday lodged an FIR in the alleged Maharashtra Bitcoin scam.

In areas such as Malabar Hill, Kandivli East, Borivali, and Vile Parle, Gujarati community's influence often aligns with BJP's strongholds. Conversely, Marathi-majority neighbourhoods of Shivaji Park, Lalbaug and Worli form the backbone of Shiv Sena's traditional base.This poll season, many parties leaned into the ""Marathi vs Gujarati"" narrative, invoking the exodus of industries to Gujarat in a bid to consolidate Marathi votes.Addressing a rally on the eve of the polls, Uddhav Thackeray underscored the Gujarat undercurrent in the elections. Criticising Modi and Shah for allegedly creating a divide, he appealed to Gujaratis to ""identify their real enemies,"" warning that this polarisation would have long-term consequences for their community.On Wednesday, though, the electorate seemed unimpressed by divisive rhetoric. ""We live peacefully here, side by side. Politicians may try to divide us, but we know better,"" said Hasmukh Mehta, a retired banker from Pant Nagar. For Priyanka Shah, a 20-year-old from Tilak Road, her decision was rooted in development, not identity. ""I voted for infrastructure, for better roads and public spaces.

Moreover, it would have been improbable for the appellant to ascertain the complainant's residential address, as mentioned in the FIR unless such information had been voluntarily provided by the complainant herself.

The man approached Delhi HC for quashing of criminal proceedings but his plea was rejected and he moved the apex court. Allowing his plea, the top court said, ""The relationship between the appellant and the complainant was consensual in nature. In fact, they wanted to fructify the relationship into marriage. It is in that context that they indulged in sexual activity. Therefore, there cannot be a case of criminal intimidation involved as against the complainant.

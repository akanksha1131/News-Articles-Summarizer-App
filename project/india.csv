NEW DELHI: ""Mujahideens involved in the Mumbai attacks should receive Pakistan's highest posthumous military honors,"" reads the transcript of an intercepted conversation which Tahawwur Rana had with David Coleman Headley . The disturbing transcripts were cited by US justice department as crucial evidence in Rana's conviction order way back in 2013.A physician, an immigration entrepreneur, a hardline radical with an entrenched hatred for India and a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist managing finances for the outfit - Tahawwur Rana has many faces. He was a confidant of ISI's Major Iqbal plotting the audacious sea-borne terror attack in Mumbai which was seen by the then govt as an undeclared war by Pakistan and had triggered demands for retaliation.Rana alongside Headley established the groundwork for the Mumbai attacks, which was the deadliest of a series of terror runs organised by ISI through outfits like Lashkar and Indian Mujahideen. Rana had arrived in Mumbai via Dubai before the attacks to ensure arrangements were precisely executed, say investigators. ""He had checked into Hotel Renaissance in Powai during his visit to India between Nov 11 and 21 in 2008. The attacks occurred five days after he departed,"" states a police document.With decks cleared for Rana's extradition, India's endeavours since 2019 have finally yielded results. While it has been 16 years, the ghastly memories of the deadliest terror attack, which had caught the Indian security establishment napping, continue to be an impediment in normalisation of ties with Pakistan.","Tahawwur Rana was a confidant of ISI's Major Iqbal plotting the audacious sea- borne terror attack in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: A groom's greed for dowry gold tore apart his marriage within three days, entailed dowry harassment prosecution for 19 years, incarceration for three months, and now the Supreme Court has asked him to pay a compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the bride, who has since married another and settled abroad.The marsriage took place on Feb 3, 2006. The parents of the bride presented her 60 sovereigns of gold and the groom 10 sovereigns.But the groom, an infotech professional, acted pricey and demanded an additional 30 sovereigns for him to participate in the post-marriage ceremonies at the bride's place.Midway through the reception, the groom's father took him away from the 'mandap' accusing the bride's parents of not presenting the 100 sovereigns. The woman, a corporate executive, could take no more of her husband's greed-based tantrums and decided to lodge a complaint under Section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prevention Act. The trial court at Saidapet (TN) convicted the groom under provisions of IPC and DP Act and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment with a fine of Rs 3,000 under Section 498A of IPC and a sentence of one year under Sec 4 of DP Act. An additional sessions judge upheld the conviction and sentence.Madras HC confirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to two years. When the groom appealed against the HC verdict in SC, he was asked to surrender and lodged in jail for nearly three months before SC granted him bail.Noting that the groom had already undergone three months of incarceration during the trial and after the HC judgment, the bench said, ""The marriage was solemnised on March 31, 2006, and the couple lived together for three days. As noticed from the HC order, the de facto complainant (bride) is married and settled abroad. The case was prolonged for nearly 19 years. Both the groom and bride have moved on in life.""Reducing the sentence to the period of incarceration already undergone, court directed the man to deposit Rs 3 lakh within four weeks before the Saidapet trial court and directed the court to ensure this money was paid to the woman for the harassment she suffered at the hands of the groom. SC said if the money is not paid, then the case would be listed again for further hearing.","A groom's greed for dowry gold tore apart his marriage within three days, entailed dowry harassment prosecution for 19 years, incarceration for three months.

Police have confirmed that fingerprints collected from Khan's apartment match those of the accused.Khan provided his statement to the police on Friday, recounting the events leading to the stabbing.

‘One Nation One Election’ plan promises to redefine terms of good governance: President Murmu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-nation-one-election-plan-promises-to-redefine-terms-of-good-governance-president-murmu/articleshow/117560700.cms,"President Droupadi Murmu on Saturday lauded the tireless efforts of the farming community, labourers, scientists as well as young Indians for their invaluable contributions to the country’s tangible progress, which has started to influence global economic trends.

NEW DELHI: President of India Droupadi Murmu on Saturday strongly advocated for the "" One Nation One Election "" plan saying that the proposed reform “promises to redefine the terms of good governance”. She said it has the potential to promote “consistency in governance, prevent policy paralysis, mitigate resource diversion, and reduce financial burden” on the exchequer.In her address to the nation on the eve of the 76th Republic Day, Murmu highlighted the reform measures being taken by the govt to weed out remanants of the “colonial mindset” that persisted even after Independence. “We won freedom in 1947, but many relics of a colonial mindset persisted among us for long. Of late, we have been witnessing concerted efforts to change that mindset,” Murmu said as she cited the decision to replace the British -era criminal laws with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita , the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam.She went on to highlight that based also on “Indian traditions of jurisprudence”, the new criminal laws place the delivery of justice instead of punishment at the centre of the criminal justice system.“Reforms of such magnitude require an audacity of vision,” Murmu asserted. “Another measure that promises to redefine the terms of good governance is the bill introduced in Parliament to synchronise election schedules in the country,” she added.“The ‘One Nation One Election’ plan can promote consistency in governance, prevent policy paralysis, mitigate resource diversion, and reduce the financial burden, apart from offering many other benefits,” Murmu said.Murmu spoke of a fresh engagement with “our civilisational heritage” as she drew attention to the ongoing Mahakumbh and said that it can be seen as an “expression of the richness of that heritage”. She highlighted the govt’s decision recognising Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, Pali and Prakrit as classical languages.Reflecting on 75 years of the Constitution, Murmu said it is marked by an all-round progress of a young republic. “At the time of Independence and even later, large parts of the country had faced extreme poverty and also hunger. But one thing we were not deprived of was our belief in ourselves. India’s economy today influences the global economic trends. India is taking leadership positions in international forums,” she said.“The Constitution has become a living document because civic virtues have been part of our moral compass for millennia. For 75 years now, it has guided the path of our progress,” Murmu asserted as she expressed gratitude to Dr B R Ambedkar, who chaired the drafting committee.The President also pointed to the high economic growth rate of recent years and inclusive welfare measures like making basic necessities such as housing and access to clean drinking water entitlements for citizens.She also referred to efforts made to support marginalised communities, particularly those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC).She lauded the innovative use of technology in finance, noting that digital payment systems and direct benefit transfers have enhanced transparency and inclusion. “The banking system has been in a healthy condition after a series of bold measures such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, effecting a substantial reduction in the Non-Performing Assets of Scheduled Commercial Banks,” Murmu said.In her address, Murmu also reflected on India’s growing success in sports. “The achievements in the sports during the year 2024 were capped by D Gukesh, who became the youngest World Chess Champion,” she added..Reflecting on India's historical journey, she urged citizens to remember the brave souls who sacrificed their lives for the nation's freedom, highlighting the 150th birth anniversary of tribal icon Bhagwan Birsa Munda, whose contributions to the freedom movement are now receiving due recognition.","President of India Droupadi Murmu on Saturday strongly advocated for the ""One Nation One Election "" plan.

There will be no optional questions, and the test duration will return to three hours. The medical entrance exam will now consist of 180 compulsory questions to be attempted within 180 minutes. Additionally, NTA clarified in another notice that the APAAR (Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry) ID is not mandatory, following its January 14 directive for aspirants to update their Aadhaar credentials and integrate their APAAR. However, these piecemeal notices have left candidates confused as they await the start of registrations. Previously, NTA would announce registrations and provide all relevant details in a single information bulletin. Already behind schedule, it is reported that after being reprimanded by the ministry of education, NTA only recently initiated communication regarding the requisition and selection of exam centres.NTA stated that the flexible format introduced in 2021 to accommodate pandemic-related challenges—allowing candidates to attempt 180 questions out of 200—was applicable only until the 2024 exams. From 2025 onwards, all NEET-UG question papers will contain 180 compulsory questions (45 each for Physics and Chemistry, and 90 for Biology) with a total duration of three hours.While the exam format is reverting to its pre-Covid structure, the registration dates for NEET-UG 2025 remain unannounced. By comparison, for the 2020 exam, the online registration period was from December 15, 2019, to January 1, 2020, with a correction window between January 15 and 31, 2020.NTA released the syllabus for NEET-UG 2025 in December 2024, issued a notice about Aadhaar and APAAR on January 14, and announced on January 16 that the exam would be conducted in pen-paper mode. This was followed by two more notices (one again on APAAR) on Saturday.“There are multiple public notices, giving the impression that registration has already started. Ten or eleven days ago, NTA issued a notice on APAAR ID , and today another one stating it is not mandatory. At the end of each notice, they direct us to check the official website for regular updates. Instead of issuing multiple notices with fragmented information, which creates confusion, NTA should release a comprehensive information bulletin as it did in the past,” said an aspirant.According to NTA sources, the agency is far from ready, as it has yet to finalise exam centres. It has been learnt that the MoE has reprimanded NTA over delays in requisitioning and preparing centres. “When NTA informed the ministry on the status, officials clearly conveyed that the process was already behind schedule,” said a source. Following the ministry’s intervention, NTA sent its first communication on the matter only a couple of days ago.The Centre has directed NTA to ensure stringent security measures at the selected centres and adhere to recommendations made by the high-level committee led by former ISRO Chairperson K Radhakrishnan. These include prioritising government-run institutions, such as schools and higher education facilities, as exam venues.The credibility of NTA faced significant scrutiny following the NEET-UG 2024 exam, which was marred by allegations of paper leaks. These incidents led to widespread criticism of the agency’s processes and security protocols, severely damaging its reputation and raising concerns over its operational efficacy.","The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) for 2025 will revert to its pre-Covid pattern.

Rana known to have worked with Headley, a key conspirator of Mumbai attacks

NEW DELHI: US Supreme Court has refused to entertain Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana's plea against extradition to India, clearing the way for Indian investigators to bring him to the country. The review petition was turned down on Jan 21, removing the last hurdle in the extradition of Pakistani native and Canadian national Rana, an aide of Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley , one of the main conspirators of the 26/11 attacks .The writ was filed in Nov last year against an earlier order of a lower court that had ruled in favour of his extradition to India. ""Petition DENIED,"" Supreme Court said, according to reports from the US.Rana had been sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2011 for conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist plot to behead a Danish newspaper's employees and providing material support to LeT, the UN proscribed terror group responsible for the Nov 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed. Headley, who had pleaded guilty in the Mumbai case, had testified as a govt witness in Rana's trial.Headley testified that he travelled to Chicago and advised Rana, his long-time friend, to look for potential targets for terror attacks in India.Rana lost legal battles in several federal courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the North Circuit in San Francisco.Former US ambassador Eric Garcetti had told TOI in an interview last year that US authorities had built an airtight case for his extradition to India and that he expected him to be extradited soon, citing it as an example of strong counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries.""In the Rana case, we have done everything the right way. Every court has so far upheld the work that India and the US are doing together on this extradition,"" he had said.Rana, who is currently in detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, is known to have worked with Headley, one of the main conspirators of the attacks. Headley obtained Rana's consent to open an office of First World Immigration Services as a cover for his activities in India.Earlier, US govt had argued in the court that the petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. US solicitor general Elizabeth B Prelogar said this in its filing before the Supreme Court on Dec 16, according to an agency report from Washington. She said Rana was not entitled to relief from extradition to India in this case.In his petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Rana argued that he was tried and acquitted in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) on charges relating to the 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai.""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case,"" it said. Prelogar disagreed.""The govt does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the govt's prosecution in this case.

KOLKATA: It was amongst the most momentous concerts in Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar 's illustrious career when he received the official announcement of being a Padma Shri recipient. The 63-year-old sarod virtuoso , who was performing in concert with Pt Bickram Ghosh at the IIT Kharagpur’s Spring Fest on Saturday, dedicated it to the rich heritage of Indian classical music .The Sangeet Natak award winner, who initiated his musical tutelage with mandolin under his grandfather Bibhuti Ranjan Majumdar, was a disciple of Ustad Bahadur Khan before he received talim from Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. Talking about his unpretentious middle-class household and how it necessitated an extraordinary leap of faith to pursue this vocation, Majumdar said, ""My mother served as a schoolteacher whilst my father played the sitar for light music productions. Baba had other responsibilities and could not fulfil his personal aspiration of being a classical musician. But he yearned for me to fulfil his dream.”According to him, the Padma awards are an aspiration for individuals across the globe. “I do not hail from a lineage of practising classical musicians. Since childhood, I felt a divine connection with music and practised hard. With no godfather in the realm of Indian classical music, it was an extraordinary gamble for me to pursue this vocation. My gurus’ ‘talim’ and parents’ blessings and sacrifice have enabled me to achieve this milestone,” he said.This accolade, he said, not merely recognises his proficiency but the endeavours of everyone who believed in his music. “It bestows upon me a greater responsibility to propagate Indian classical music and empowers me to dispel the myth that the young generation is disinterested in pursuing this art form. I dedicate the award to our rich heritage,” he said.Many of his contemporaries and juniors in Indian classical music have previously been honoured with the Padma award. Has the accolade arrived rather belatedly? “It is easy to proclaim that one doesn’t anticipate any honours. However, the reality is that the only recourse is to persevere diligently and trust that everything has its destined moment,” he said.The sarod player wishes that his father, Ranjan Majumdar, was alive to witness this day. “I also miss Ustad Zakir Hussain, Ustad Rashid Khan and Pt Subhankar Banerjee. They would have been overjoyed with this news. I am fortunate to have those like Bickram by my side now. He gave me the warmest embrace after receiving the news,” he said.",The 63-year-old sarod virtuoso was performing in concert with Pt Bickram Ghosh at the IIT Kharagpur’s Spring Fest on Saturday.

Cops yet to do facial analysis test

NEW DELHI: The simple case of 'burglary gone wrong' at actor Saif Ali Khan 's residence in which he was injured continues to raise questions with the arrest of a Bangladeshi national and medical report from the hospital.The actor, who was discharged three days ago after undergoing surgery at Lilavati Hospital, gave his statement to the police. Meanwhile, opposition leaders in Maharashtra have jumped in, raising questions regarding the attack and the arrest. The father of the accused has also termed it a ""false"" arrest.On Thursday, Bandra police took Saif's statement regarding the violent encounter with an intruder at his 11th-floor residence in Satguru Sharan. The actor said, ""My grip loosened after the stranger stabbed me repeatedly on my back with a knife after I overpowered him.""According to Saif, his household members and staff were terrified when they spotted the armed trespasser. He immediately moved to confront the intruder to safeguard his younger son Jehangir and the staff. In his statement, Saif mentioned that he and Kareena were in their bedroom, and Taimur was in another room with a nurse. Their younger son Jehangir was in a different bedroom with staff nurse Eliyamma Phillip and a domestic helper when Phillip spotted the intruder.A medical report from Lilavati Hospital disclosed details of the injuries Saif sustained during the break-in on January 16. The actor suffered five distinct wounds on his back, wrist, neck, shoulder, and elbow.The report highlighted:The question raised on the day of the attack remains a mystery as different versions come up. Initially, it was reported that there were no drivers available at that hour at Saif's residence and no car was ready. He was taken to the hospital by his younger son Ibrahim in an auto.The auto driver who transported Saif to Lilavati Hospital, approximately 2 km from the actor's residence at Satguru Sharan building in Bandra, mentioned that the actor was with a ""small child"", presumably his seven-year-old son Taimur, along with another individual.The driver, who works night shifts in the Bandra-Khar area, said he spotted one of the actor's domestic help waving at him near Satguru Sharan. ""It was a scene of panic. The actor sat inside, his son in the middle and (Hari) on the side before we left for the hospital,"" he recalled, describing how a blood-soaked Khan struggled to walk. Upon reaching the hospital, the staff immediately attended to him and took him on a stretcher.The neurosurgeon who operated on Saif also said that the actor arrived at the hospital in an auto with his seven-year-old son, Taimur Ali Khan , and a caretaker. ""I was the first one to meet Saif Ali Khan when he came to the hospital. He was drenched in blood, but he walked in like a lion with his small child, Taimur. Saif Ali Khan is a real hero,"" the doctor had said.However, the medical report sent to Bandra Police indicated that Saif was probably taken to the hospital by Afsar Zaidi, his manager and close associate who operates a celebrity management firm.According to the report, Zaidi accompanied Saif to the hospital on January 16 with the admission process completed at 4.11 am.The medical documentation from Lilavati Hospital submitted to the police listed Zaidi's name in the section designated for friends.The medical form has also led to many questioning an alleged 'delay' in Saif reaching the hospital. According to the medical report, the time of the attack was 2.30 am. The actor was, however, admitted to the hospital at 4.11 am.Saif Ali Khan 's home is just 2.3 km (10-15 minutes) away from the hospital.Md Ruhul Amin, father of accused Shariful Islam Sajjad , asserted his son's innocence and appealed to Indian authorities for his immediate release and claimed the photo in the CCTV released by police did not match his son.Shariful Islam hails from Rajabaria village in Jhalakathi, a southern Bangladeshi district located over 200 km away from Dhaka.""I have come to know through various YouTube channels and journalists via telephone that my 30-year-old son Shariful Islam Sajjad has been arrested in India for assaulting actor Saif Ali Khan,"" Md Ruhul Amin told ANI.""My son was arrested on suspicion because of his resemblance to the person involved in the attacks. My son is innocent,"" he added.Md Ruhul Amin expressed his intention to seek assistance from the Bangladesh government through diplomatic channels.""I will go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh after 3 or 4 days and request the Bangladesh government to take diplomatic initiative to free my son,"" he said.A day after Maharashtra cabinet minister and BJP leader Nitesh Rane stirred controversy as he questioned if Saif was assaulted or if the attack was staged, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said the arrested person and the one in the CCTV footage were not the same.""The attack on Saif Ali Khan, it has been stated that the person shown in the CCTV footage and the person who has been arrested are different. I have also seen the photos and they are not the same. The police need to clarify this immediately,"" he said.The police said forensic analysis confirmed that Fakir was linked to the crime. Fingerprints found at multiple locations inside the actor’s flat match those of Fakir.The police, however, while seeking an extension of his custody, told the court that it is yet to conduct a facial recognition test to ascertain if he was the same as the person seen on CCTV footage.The police also need to match the suspect’s footprints to those found at the crime scene and recover the shoes Fakir wore during the attack and the missing portion of the knife used.","A medical report from Lilavati Hospital disclosed details of the injuries Saif sustained during the break-in on January 16.

"‘Indigenous’ bullet trains to run on Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow “indigenous trains”, with a maximum design speed of 280 kmph, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two “indigenous” high-speed trains by the end of 2026. These trains will have the Vande Bharat base and will be designed to run on standard gauge tracks.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains , which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even, when our own high-speed trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the indigenous trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, would meet the expectation of passengers.","The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two ‘indigenous’ high-speed trains by the end of 2026.

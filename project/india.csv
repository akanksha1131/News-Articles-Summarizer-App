"Has National Dam Safety Authority examined safety of Mullaperiyar? SC seeks response from Union government, NDSA, seeks AG‚Äôs assistance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/has-national-dam-safety-authority-examined-safety-of-mullaperiyar-sc-seeks-response-from-union-government-ndsa-seeks-ags-assistance/articleshow/117070937.cms,"NEW DELHI: Issues relating to safety of 130-year-old Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, owned by Tamil Nadu and a cause of constant friction between the two states, continues to resurface before the Supreme Court either as an inter-state dispute or through PILs.A fresh PIL by five advocates led by Mathews J Nedumpara on Wednesday apprehended grave danger to millions of people in Kerala living downstream Mullaperiyar dam as it questioned the dam safety and doubted correctness of two earlier SC judgments allowing raising the water storage level in the dam from 136 feet to 142 feet.A bench comprising Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan was informed by Tamil Nadu that under the Dam Safety Act, 2021, the central govt was to set up national dam safety authority (NDSA) and national committee on dam safety (NCDS) which were to work with state governments to determine and suggest remedial measures for strengthening of dams whose safety are in question.The bench wondered as to how the central government could on its won constitute a supervisory committee for examining the safety audit of Mullaperiyar dam when such a move is not backed by the 2021 legislation.It asked the NDSA and the ministry of Jal Shakti to file their affidavits on steps taken since 2021 to evaluate the safety of Mullaperiyar dam under the provisions of Dam Safety Act and explain whether the supervisory committee appointed by the ministry was envisaged under the legislation.The bench requested attorney general R Venkataramani to assist the court in the case. It criticised the Union government for being in slumber since 2021 when it was informed that no relevant rules and regulations under the Act have been framed till date.Nedumpara-led petitioners said they were concerned about the protection of their lives and properties of five million citizens which will be at grave risk in the event of the Mullaperiyar dam breaching.They said the dam, made of limestone and surkhi, was commissioned in the year 1895 with an estimated lifespan of 50 years. They requested the court to direct the Centre, Tamil Nadu and Kerala to work together to resolve the safety concerns over the dam.After reports about damage to the dam was published in Kerala press in 1979, the Central Water Commission held meetings with TN and Kerala and opined that after completion of emergency and medium-term measures, the water level in the dam can be raised up to 145 ft.On the directions of the SC in April 2000, the ministry of water resources constituted an expert committee which in its March 2001 report opined that after implementation of strengthening measures, the water level in the dam could be raised from 136 ft to 142 ft. The SC in its February 27, 2006, order had permitted TN to raise water level to 142 ft.However, Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act in March 2006 prohibited raising the water level beyond 136 ft. SC in May 2014 declared the Kerala law unconstitutional and had directed the Centre to set up a three-member supervisory committee about safety of the dam on raising the water level to 142 ft.","Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, owned by Tamil Nadu, is a cause of constant friction between the two states.

CHENNAI: Asserting that Tamil Nadu was safe for women and children, chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday assured ""swift investigation and filing of chargesheet within 60 days"" in the Anna University rape case . In a bid to counter the AIADMK offensive on the issue, he raked up the Pollachi sexual assault case .""Govt will make every effort to try the case quickly through a special court and ensure that the perpetrator gets maximum punishment,"" he said in the assembly.Stalin's criticism of previous AIADMK govt's handling of the Pollachi sexual assault case during its tenure sparked commotion, with party members staging a walkout.Responding to a special calling attention motion regarding the Anna University rape case, the CM described it as ""a horrific act"". ""If the investigation reveals that more culprits were involved, whoever they are, strict action will be taken without any mercy,"" he said, commending police for quick action in arresting Gnanasekaran. With the opposition intensifying the 'who is that sir?' campaign, Stalin said parties could provide any evidence to the special investigation team of the high court.On allegations of Gnanasekaran being a member of the governing DMK, Stalin said he was only a party sympathiser. ""We do not deny that. He might have taken photographs with ministers and politicians... whoever it may be, even if they are DMK persons, we will take action. There is no change in that stand. He is a sympathiser and that is the truth. We did not protect him. He was arrested immediately.""Stalin accused the opposition of indulging in ""cheap activities"" for publicity and political gains in a sensitive case involving a student, and said his govt would deal with crimes against women with an iron fist. ""Many are trying to create a conspiracy theory by using this incident to say women are completely unsafe,"" the CM said. He added surveillance cameras helped identify and arrest the accused and refuted claims of inadequate security. On the leak of the FIR, he blamed the National Informatics Centre of Union govt, while adding that state police addressed the technical glitch promptly.The CM accused AIADMK of inaction despite evidence in the Pollachi case, in which a gang sexually assaulted women over two years. The truth emerged only after CBI took over the case, he said. ""The probe clearly said the incident was committed by AIADMK members.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has expressed his strong support for Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli , stating that if he was captain he would ""fight with the team management"" to ensure Kohli remains in the squad despite his recent struggles in Test cricket.Clarke made these remarks on the Beyond23 Cricket podcast, where he discussed Kohli's form during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and his overall importance to the Indian team.Clarke acknowledged that Kohli hadn't scored as many runs as he would have liked in his recent Test matches but emphasized the batter's immense talent and impact. ""It's Virat Kohli! This guy can make a double hundred tomorrow. He's that good a player. This guy could play, he should play until he's had enough. If he retires from Test cricket right now, there's only one team losing out, it's India,"" Clarke remarked.Kohli scored a century in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but struggled to make significant contributions in the subsequent matches. Despite this, Clarke stressed that he would back Kohli without hesitation. ""If I was captain of any team that Virat Kohli was in, even though I know he didn't make as many runs as he would have liked, I'm fighting for him to stay in my team,"" Clarke said.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 The Indian batter's repeated dismissals outside off-stump during the series drew criticism from fans, with many recalling how Sachin Tendulkar famously avoided the cover drives during his iconic double hundred at the SCG. However, Clarke pointed out the fundamental differences between the two players.""Sachin was a different player to Virat Kohli. A lot of people during this Australian summer were saying Sachin did it in a Test match. He got out cover driving a couple of times and then let it go to make a 200 at the SCG. Sachin is a different player to Virat. Virat's greatest strength is bat on ball. He just plays it in a different way,"" Clarke explained.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Schedule Clarke's remarks highlight his belief in Kohli's enduring abilities and value to the Indian Test side, reinforcing the idea that Kohli's presence on the field is a significant asset despite a lean patch in form.","Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has expressed his strong support for Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli.

In another sign of India‚Äôs deepening ties with the Taliban, foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Afghanistan's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai, conveying India‚Äôs readiness to respond to the urgent development needs of the Afghan people and getting an assurance that the Taliban would not allow Afghan territory to be used against India.This was the highest level of engagement India has had so far with the Taliban since the latter took control of Kabul in 2021. India was represented so far at the level of joint secretary in meetings with the dispensation in Kabul.Interestingly, the meeting in Dubai also took place in the middle of Afghanistan‚Äôs fast deteriorating ties with Islamabad over the activities of Pakistan Taliban and Pakistan‚Äôs retaliatory air strikes on Afghanistan soil. India had earlier this week expressed solidarity with Afghanistan on the issue, saying Pakistan has developed a habit of blaming neighbours for its internal problems.‚ÄúThe Afghan side underlined its sensitivities to India's security concerns. The two sides agreed to remain in touch and continue regular contacts at various levels,‚Äù said an Indian readout on the Misri-Muttaqi meeting. Misri raised concerns about the activities of Pakistan based terror groups like LeT and JeM and Muttaqi assured him Afghanistan will do nothing to undermine India‚Äôs security.In the meeting, India agreed to Afghanistan‚Äôs request for material support in the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees. Misri also told the Afghan minister India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance programme. This is significant as India‚Äôs support so far was limited to providing humanitarian aid. The Taliban have for quite some time been assuring India of enough security to not just allow it to further strengthen its diplomatic presence in Kabul but also reopen its consulates and resume work on development projects.While the MEA joint secretary who handles Afghanistan, JP Singh, has travelled to Afghanistan on several occasions, Dubai was thought of as the right venue for the first real high-level engagement as it was convenient apparently for both sides to meet there. Like all major powers, India doesn‚Äôt officially recognise the Taliban regime, not least because of its inability to ensure an inclusive government and its treatment of women and girls. The UAE government, which has strong ties with both India and the Taliban, was happy to facilitate the meeting.‚ÄúForeign Secretary underlined India‚Äôs historic friendship with the Afghan people and the strong people to people contacts between the two countries. The two sides evaluated the ongoing Indian humanitarian assistance programmes,‚Äù said the Indian readout. The Taliban said in their own readout they called for enhancing trade, political and diplomatic ties and for facilitating visas for Afghan businessmen, students and patients.The government‚Äôs decision to send 50000 MT of wheat to the drought-affected Afghanistan in late 2021, despite Taliban‚Äôs past animosity towards India, led to the start of the present detente. Muttaqi appreciated and thanked the Indian leadership for continuing to engage and support the people of Afghanistan, said the Indian government.‚ÄúThe two sides also discussed strengthening of sports (cricket) cooperation, which is highly valued by the young generation of Afghanistan,‚Äù said the government, adding they also agreed to promote the use of Chabahar port for supporting trade and commercial activities, including for the purpose of humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.‚ÄúIt may be recalled that in response to the needs of the Afghan people, India decided to extend humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. India has so far dispatched several shipments consisting of 50,000 MTs of wheat, 300 tons of medicines, 27 tons of earthquake relief aid, 40,000 litres of pesticides, 100 million polio doses, 1.5 million doses of COVID Vaccine, 11,000 units of hygiene kits for the drug de-addiction programme, 500 units of winter clothing and 1.2 tons of stationery kits, etc,‚Äù recalled India in its statement.",India's foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Afghanistan's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai.

Satellites are safe,‚Äù Isro said around 9pm Wednesday.The space agency had initiated the drift on the chaser spacecraft ‚Äî the two satellites are designated chaser and target ‚Äî at about 8:05pm.After the launch on December 30, Isro has been preparing for the docking, which requires multiple steps/stages, each of which was monitored from the ground and given a go-ahead before proceeding to the next.On January 6, a day before the first docking attempt was scheduled, Isro had found that the docking process requires further validation through ground simulations based on an abort scenario it identified on the day. And the docking was rescheduled for January 9.Docking in space is a complex process and so far, only three other countries ‚Äî the US, Russia and China ‚Äî have mastered it.","The two Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) satellites that Isro was hoping to unite early Thursday have drifted too far apart.

NEW DELHI: In a big boost to connectivity in Kashmir, PM Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the 6.5-km Z-Morh road tunnel between Gagangir and Sonmarg in the Valley on Lohri (January 13) to make Sonamarg an all-weather tourist destination. The Indian Railways on Wednesday also successfully operated a train at 110 kmph on USBRL‚Äôs Katra-Banihal section, paving the way for train operations between Katra and Srinagar.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the final stage of inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety for the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) was conducted on Wednesday. He added that the specially designed Jammu-Srinagar Vande Bharat with eight coaches, equipped with anti freezing features, will be operational soon.Sharing details of the Z-Morh tunnel project‚Äôs inauguration, sources said the PM is scheduled to physically inaugurate the tunnel. At present, the Gagangir-Sonamarg stretch gets blocked by heavy snowfall and avalanches during winters. The two-lane tunnel will bring down travel time to barely 15 minutes, compared to hours taken by vehicles to cover the zig-zag road.Once the adjacent Zoji-La tunnel is completed, the travel between Srinagar and Leh will be seamless and will provide connectivity to Baltal (Amarnath cave shrine), Kargil and other places in the Ladakh region. It will also allow faster and smoother movement of military vehicles to the border.Just when the Z-Morh tunnel was almost complete for opening, terrorists attacked the workers‚Äô camp at Gagangir last Oct. In the indiscriminate firing, seven civilians, including six non-local workers of the infrastructure company building the tunnel, were killed. ‚ÄúThe project is now ready for inauguration and security issues have been addressed,‚Äù a source said.On the 272-km USBRL project, costing around Rs 40,000 crore, Vaishnaw said the government has given priority to safety before opening the rail link to Kashmir with the rest of the country. He said the redevelopment of the Jammu station will be complete by Aug and it will have eight platforms and modern amenities. ‚ÄúIt was a very challenging project and the toughest challenge was to give foundation support to the world's highest arch bridge (359 m) on the Chenab river and country‚Äôs longest transportation tunnel,‚Äù he said.Vaishnaw added that snow removal train, which will move ahead of passenger and freight trains, will make sure that services on this strategic route runs all through the year. The railways has also used anti-vibration seismic devices in the project as this region falls under Zone-V earthquake vulnerability. The dampers will absorb the tremors, and thus, maintain faster and safer travel.",PM Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the 6.5-km Z-Morh road tunnel between Gagangir and Sonmarg in the Valley on Lohri (January 13) The Indian Railways on Wednesday also successfully operated a train at 110 kmph on USBRL‚Äôs Katra- Banihal section.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117063672,imgsize-1403471,width-400,resizemode-4/117063672.jpg"

In doing so, they are insulting the wisdom and intelligence of Rahul Gandhi's predecessors, such as Mrs. Indira Gandhi, his mother Mrs. Sonia Gandhi and other senior Congress leaders like Dr. Manmohan Singh,"" she told news agency PTI.""If Pranab Mukherjee were indeed aligned with the RSS, why did Congress entrust him with so many different and highly significant responsibilities over 45 years? Was Mrs. Indira Gandhi not intelligent enough to see through that? Was Mrs. Sonia Gandhi unaware of such things? These are baseless statements, and if certain Congress members are making them, it shows their lack of knowledge about Congress's history and parliamentary democracy,"" she said.""In a parliamentary democracy, different ideologies can coexist and dialogue between them is essential ‚Äî this is one of the strongest pillars of parliamentary democracy. Those making such remarks clearly lack understanding and are exposing their ignorance and prejudice through their statements,"" Sharmistha Mukherjee added.In a social media post on X, Ali had alleged that the honour was given to the former President because ""his love"" for the RSS.""The Modi government has indulged in dirty politics over death and has rejected the demand of the entire nation for space for Manmohan Singh at Rajghat memorial site and has given land at the same place for Pranab Mukherjee's memorial.

Delhi assembly elections: Congress braces for 'lonely' battle as key INDIA bloc partners back Arvind Kejriwal's AAP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-assembly-elections-congress-braces-for-lonely-battle-as-key-india-bloc-partners-back-arvind-kejriwals-aap/articleshow/117057482.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is all set for a lonely political battle in Delhi with at least two key INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc partners backing Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in the assembly elections. The Congress and the AAP were allies during the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi but will be contesting the assembly elections as rivals.Kejriwal on Wednesday said that Mamata Banerjee had announced to back AAP in Delhi assembly elections and thanked the Trinamool chief for her support. ""TMC has announced support to AAP in Delhi elections . I am personally grateful to Mamata Didi. Thank you Didi. U have always supported and blessed us in our good and bad times,"" the AAP chief said in a post on X. Reacting to Kejriwal's post, senior TMC leader Derek O' Brien said, ""We have your back @AamAadmiParty"".Yesterday TMC leader Kunal Ghosh had said that the people of Delhi will defeat the BJP in the assembly polls. ""We hope that AAP government comes back there and BJP is defeated. The people of Delhi will defeat BJP,"" Ghosh said.Mamata's support would come as big boost to Kejriwal as he faces a determined BJP in the February 5 elections. The Trinamool chief is the second regional leader to come out in support of AAP for the Delhi assembly elections.Earlier, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav had announced support for Arvind Kejriwal's party in Delhi elections. ""The way the AAP government has worked, we feel that they should get another chance to work here,"" Akhilesh had said at a ""Mahila Adalat"" campaign of AAP in the presence of Arvind Kejriwal. Akhilesh Yadav's two-line appeal was a clear hint that the SP was backing AAP and not the Congress in the Delhi assembly elections.For the Congress, this political isolation is not new. The party, weakened by its electoral losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, faces a strong challenge from the regional allies within the INDIA bloc. The stand taken by Mamata and Akhilesh does not come as a surprise as several INDIA bloc allies have openly differed with the Congress over various issues in the recent past.Mamata Banerjee has been the most vocal critic of the Congress and had openly questioned the functioning of the INDIA bloc under the grand-old-party. Mamata even signalled her intent to take charge of the alliance and found support of several leaders including Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad.""What can I do if they cannot run the show? I do not lead the front. Those who are in leadership positions there should think about it. But still, I am maintaining my connections with the regional and national parties. If given the responsibility, though I do not want that, I can run it from West Bengal,"" Mamata had said.Akhilesh Yadav, who contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh in alliance with the Congress, charted a separate path on some key issues during the winter session of Parliament. The Samajwadi Party refused to join Congress's offensive on the Adani ""bribery"" issue as Akhilesh maintained that the incidence of violence in Sambhal was far more important and deserved greater attention.The Congress, which has been literally wiped out of Delhi, faces an uphill battle as it desperately tries to regain its lost political space. In the last two assembly elections, the party could not open its account and saw its vote share dip to alarming lows. The Congress, which has announced candidates for several seats, is promising a host of welfare schemes to people of Delhi in line with the recent trend of wooing voters.On Wednesday, the party promised a ""Jeevan Raksha Yojana"" for free health insurance of up to Rs 25 lakh if voted to power in Delhi. Senior Congress leader and former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot claims the proposed scheme would be a game-changer for the party. The party had earlier announced the 'Pyaari Didi Yojana', promising a monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,500 to women if voted to power in the national capital.These schemes notwithstanding, it would need a Herculean effort for the grand-old-party to make its presence felt in Delhi. Ironically, none of its senior leaders, including the Gandhis, are anywhere on the ground to take up this challenge. In the absence of senior leadership, the all-out offensive against Arvind Kejriwal by Delhi Congress leaders has already created ripples in the INDIA bloc with AAP accusing the grand-old-party of helping the BJP.The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) has echoed similar concerns. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut expressed concerns over the intense battle between AAP and Congress and said that the fight should be against the BJP in the national capital and the country.""Congress and AAP were fighting the Lok Sabha elections together. However, the situation which has formed in the Vidhan Sabha (assembly) elections, it looks as if they are trying to help the BJP. Our fight should be against the BJP - in Delhi and the country,"" Raut said. The senior Shiv Sena (UBT) leader also objected to Congress labelling former Kejriwal as ""deshdrohi"".Clearly, the Congress needs to chart a clear course and not leave the Delhi campaign to its state leaders. If the party is indeed serious to challenge Kejriwal's dominance, its national leadership should go out in the field all guns blazing.",The Congress and the AAP were allies during the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi. The Trinamool chief is the second regional leader to come out in support of AAP for the Delhi assembly elections. The stand taken by Mamata and Akhilesh does not come as a surprise as several INDIA bloc allies have openly differed with the Congress over various issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117058188,imgsize-79284,width-400,resizemode-4/117058188.jpg"

One person entered politics, and the public, swayed by his smooth talk, crowned him with power. But as soon as he came to power, he shattered the public's trust.

NEW DELHI: China's recent display of two new-generation stealth fighter jets, which sent shock waves around the globe at the country's astonishing pace of military modernisation, found mention in the IAF chief 's remarks on Tuesday, which saw him stress the need for India to strongly push for self-reliance in defence R&D and production along with greater private sector participation even though it will involve much higher costs.""The world today is in a precarious position dominated by conflicts and contests. We have our own security concerns on the western and northern borders with increased militarisation by China and Pakistan,"" Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said at the annual Subroto Mukherjee seminar here.""China is investing heavily in its air force the recent unveiling of its new stealth aircraft is a case in point,"" he added, while also expressing frustration at the extremely slow pace of delivery of the indigenous Tejas fighter. On December 26, China conducted the maiden flights of what are probably two new 6th-generation fighters at Chengdu. Videos of the tailless, stealthy advanced combat aircraft cruising at low altitudes shocked even the US, which is yet to finalise its own 6th-generation fighter project. China already has 5th-generation fighters in the Chengdu J-20 jets, which it has also deployed at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.India is still far away from producing even a 5th-generation fighter, with the PM-headed cabinet committee on security clearing the development of the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore, only in March last year. As per projected timelines, the first AMCA prototype will make its maiden flight in four to five years, with production and induction beginning only after 2035. At present, India is struggling to produce the 4th-generation Tejas Mark-1A fighters because of the continuing delay in supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by US major General Electric. Down to 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorised 42.5 to tackle challenges from China and Pakistan, IAF wants to induct at least 180 Tejas Mark-1A and 108 Mark-2 jets in the run-up to the AMCA.The IAF chief said, ""R&D loses its relevance in case it is not able to meet time-lines. Technology delayed is technology denied. There has to be an increased aptitude for acceptance of risks involved and failures in R&D."" He added, ""Atmanirbharta will come at a cost and we should accept it. We may have to spend more and buy at a higher rate if required - amortising of the R&D part and limited numbers will push the cost up - but will give the much needed self-reliance.""",China's recent display of two new-generation stealth fighter jets sent shock waves around the globe.

NEW DELHI: With the Election Commission rubbishing doubts raised by the opposition over the inclusion of 50 lakh voters in four months in Maharashtra, Congress on Wednesday alleged the total eligible voters in the state during the assembly polls exceeded its adult population projected by the Modi govt. It said even a 100% voter registration in the state would be unprecedented and suspect.A day earlier, the CEC had asserted that the voter addition process is foolproof to prevent fake voter additions , in response to complaints from Congress and other opposition parties.Congress data analytics department chief Praveen Chakravarty said, ""We have a simple one line response to the CEC - if the process is so robust, how is it that the total eligible electors in Maharashtra seems to be more than the total adult population as estimated by the Modi govt's own report?"" He said the Nov 2019 report of the National Commission on Population of the health and family welfare ministry projected Maharashtra's estimated adult population in 2024 at 9.5 crore, while the EC stated that the total enrolled electors for Maharashtra polls was 9.7 crore. Aadhaar enrolment data also reinforces the fact that voters exceeded the population, he said.""The EC seems to have enrolled 16 lakh more voters than the entire adult population in Maharashtra. Even if estimates vary, is it possible that the EC has registered 100% or more of all eligible voters in a state?"" he asked.Chakravarty said analysis of other states shows that on an average, only 90% of eligible population are enrolled as electors by the EC. ""While all the other questions that we raised in our letter dated Dec 10, 2024, about mysterious addition of new voters remain unanswered, just this one simple datapoint that the EC may have registered more electors than adult population quashes the CEC's claim that the process of voter addition and deletion is very robust and unquestionable,"" he argued.",The Election Commission has rubbished doubts raised by the opposition over the inclusion of 50 lakh voters in four months in Maharashtra.

Homes with under-14 kids see fewer females in labour force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/homes-with-under-14-kids-see-fewer-females-in-labour-force/articleshow/117066700.cms,"The phenomenon is more pronounced in urban than in rural areas, the study found

NEW DELHI: Reinforcing how care provisions at home significantly affect women's choice of entering the labour force, an analysis of government data shows that Female Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) is lower among households with children under 14 years of age. Moreover, this phenomenon is more pronounced in urban than in rural areas.Also the presence of children affect female LFPR more significantly in the age bracket of 20 to 35 years, compared to later years. These findings are part of an observation analysis of the Periodic Labour Force Survey from 2017-18 to 2022-23 released last month as part of the Economic Advisory Council to the PM (EAC-PM) working paper series. The analysis is authored by EAC-PM member Shamika Ravi and economist Mudit Kapoor.The research shows that female LFPR in urban areas is almost always and everywhere lower than female LFPR in rural areas. ""This major gap between rural and urban areas reflects the pressures of household responsibilities,"" it said.Highlighting a significant resurgence in female LFPR across Indian states, especially in rural areas, since 2017-18, the analysis also brings into focus that married women in rural areas showed higher participation growth compared with unmarried women. There are, however, significant regional and interstate variations.The overall results also draw attention to the female LFPR peaking at 30-40 years of age and declining sharply after. The male LFPR, on the other hand, remains high (100%) from ages 30-50, declining gradually thereafter. ""Marital status is a significant determinant of LFPR for both women and men. Married men consistently exhibit higher LFPR across states and age groups, while marriage significantly reduces female LFPR, especially in urban areas,"" the research said.Another striking result which is consistent across states and regions of India is that married men are significantly more likely to participate in the labour force than men who are not currently married and this result is persistent for all ages of men, across all states and areas (rural and urban).The research in its conclusion also highlights there have been numerous govt schemes, especially targeting rural women over the last 10 years like the Mudra loans, the ""Drone Didi"" scheme and SHGs mobilised under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana.""Our paper measures the final outcome of these initiatives as a cumulative and significant growth in female LFPR across India and in particular in rural areas. Rigorous research, however, is needed to evaluate these programmes' impact and to explore the persistent inter-state and rural-urban disparities in India's female LFPR,"" the authors said.","The phenomenon is more pronounced in urban than in rural areas, the study found.

Special focus will be on minorities, Dalits and weaker sections, which were the party's core votebank that moved to AAP in 2013, when the three-term Sheila Dikshit-led govt was ruthlessly ousted.As the battle between Congress and AAP has been building up into bitter attacks from both sides with every passing day, former Delhi CM and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal's posts on X, since the announcement of poll dates, profusely thanking Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and West Bengal CM and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee for their ""support"", have yet again brought into focus the differences brewing among allies of the INDIA bloc.However, Congress tried to downplay the development with party sources dismissing the remarks as reflective of the AAP supremo being on the backfoot and attempting to woo minority and Dalit voters by highlighting that he has the support of SP and TMC.On Wednesday, Kejriwal in a post on X said, ""TMC has announced support to AAP in Delhi elections. I am personally grateful to Mamata didi. Thank you didi. You have always supported and blessed us in our good and bad times."" TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien shared Kejriwal's post and said, ""We have your back AAP."" TMC state general secretary Nilanjan Das also replied to Kejriwal, saying, ""Best wishes to AAP"", and shared a photo of the West Bengal CM with Kejriwal.On Tuesday, Kejriwal shared a post of a news channel where it was claimed that SP has come forward to give support to AAP in the Delhi elections. In his post, he said he was very thankful to Akhilesh Yadav for always supporting AAP.Amid noise of Congress's growing isolation in the INDIA bloc as allies like TMC and SP are seen to be rallying around AAP, Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said, ""There is no official statement from TMC and SP leaderships where they have come out to say that they are supporting AAP in Delhi. So, I will not comment on them"". He lashed out at Kejriwal's posts on X on TMC and SP, saying, ""It reflects he is weak.

CHANDIGARH: A shepherd leads his flock of sheep and goats to greener pastures in the remote highlands of Pir Panjal range in Jammu and Kashmir. Beside him trots his loyal Gaddi dog 'Bhola'. With a shoulder height of around 28 inches and a sturdy weight of about 40kg, the furry friend is a powerful presence, his thick, weather-resistant coat protecting him against the harsh mountain cold.As the flock ascends the steep, rocky trails, Bhola remains vigilant - his sharp eyes scanning the dense forest edges for any signs of wild predators such as leopards or wolves. Later in the afternoon, a distant growl echoes. Instantly, Bhola's posture shifts. He stands tall, muscles tensed, ready to confront any threat. A wolf appears at the ridge. Bhola barks - his deep, commanding voice carrying across the mountains. The wolf retreats. As the sun sets, the flock settles down for the night, with Bhola standing guard, ensuring the safety of his charges in the heart of the rugged Himalayas.Bhola's loyalty to his owner and the flock is unwavering, embodying the very traits that make the Gaddi dog an essential part of the shepherding tradition in the Himalayas.The Gaddi dog is now officially recognised as a registered breed by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR). This recognition makes the dog the fourth indigenous canine breed to be registered, following the Rajapalayam and Chippiparai from Tamil Nadu and the Mudhol from Karnataka. The recognition follows years of scientific study and a formal application process initiated by Himachal's department of animal husbandry in Dec 2022. The NBAGR team conducted extensive evaluations and engaged with local shepherds to understand the breed better.",The Gaddi dog is now officially recognised as a registered breed by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources.

KOCHI: Kerala high court on Wednesday suspended the sentence of four accused, including a former CPM MLA , who were sentenced to five years imprisonment in connection with the murder of two Youth Congress workers at Periya in Kasaragod district five years ago.A bench of Justices P B Suresh Kumar and Jobin Sebastian put on hold the five-year sentence of former MLA and CPM district functionary K V Kunhiraman, Kanhangad block panchayat president K Manikandan, Raghavan Velutholi, and A V Bhaskaran on their appeal against their conviction and subsequent punishment. The high court said that when there was only a fixed term of sentence and the appeal was not likely to be heard before completing it, under normal circumstances, ""the execution of the sentence passed against the accused shall be suspended and they shall be enlarged on bail"".The bench said that presently, the HC was taking up for hearing and disposal various other criminal cases in which accused persons were in custody since 2018.""In other words, the above appeal (of the accused) was not likely to be taken up for hearing before the applicants complete their fixed term of sentence. That apart, it has been the practice of this court to suspend the execution of term sentences in cases of similar nature.The case pertains to the murder of Youth Congress workers Kripesh, 19, and Sarath Lal P K, 24, allegedly by CPM workers on Feb 17, 2019.","The case pertains to the murder of Youth Congress workers Kripesh, 19, and Sarath Lal P K, 24, allegedly by CPM workers on Feb 17, 2019.

Bombay HC: Can't a woman with 'intellect deficit' be mom?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-cant-a-woman-with-intellect-deficit-be-mom/articleshow/117065502.cms,"Representative image/AI generated

MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday questioned why a young woman into her 21st week of pregnancy who has been diagnosed with borderline ""intellect deficit"" should have no right to motherhood.A HC-appointed medical board had found the woman only with an intellect deficit, but not of unsound mind. A division bench of Justices R V Ghuge and Rajesh Patil noted that the report submitted Wednesday only indicated that the 27-year-old woman had a borderline case of intellectual disability . Her IQ is 75, and the report found no foetal anomalies either.""Nobody can be super-intelligent. We are all human beings, and everybody has different levels of intelligence,"" the court remarked, adding that merely being of less-than-average intelligence does not mean she has no right to be a mother. ""If we say that persons with below-average intelligence do not have the right to be parents, it would be against the law.""The woman's father petitioned HC for permission to terminate her pregnancy on the ground that she was mentally unsound and unmarried. The woman declined to give her consent for the MTP and wanted to continue with her pregnancy. HC, on Jan 3, after hearing his lawyer SK Dubey and additional govt pleader Prachi Tatake, called for a medical board of the J J Hospital to examine her foetus, and submit its report.The medical board found her fit to continue her pregnancy but said MTP was also possible. Tatake cited several judgments, including one by Justice Bhushan Gavai of Supreme Court, stating that the woman's consent was important and that the foetus in the womb now also had fundamental rights. Under the law, if a woman is of unsound mind for pregnancies beyond 20 weeks, MTP could be considered, but here it was a ""borderline case,"" HC said, calling for her parents to try and reach out to the man she had a relationship with to see if they could marry.""They are both adults. It is not an offence,"" the court said. The woman is an adopted child , and HC stated that as parents, they have a duty to look after her interests."," Bombay high court questions why a young woman into her 21st week of pregnancy should have no right to motherhood.

RTI portal 'glitch' frustrates applicants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rti-portal-glitch-frustrates-applicants/articleshow/117065020.cms,"RTI

Citizens using RTI have not been able to access status reports on their applications from the RTI portal since the start of the year. The portal asks for a one-time password (OTP), which is supposed to be sent to the applicant's email. But, RTI activists, told TOI, the OTP is either not received or if they get it, it doesn't work. Despite repeated complaints to the RTI helpline and to the department of personnel and training, the 'glitch' has not been fixed.""The method followed earlier was more user friendly. Why do they need to add one more step to access information, which is a citizen's right? Why is an OTP needed after entering the RTI application number, email ID and the security code for viewing the RTI reply/status?"" asked Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist.When the applicant tries to find out the status of their application, they get a message stating: ""Email OTP may take time. As soon as you enter the email OTP you can see the status of the RTI request/appeal. Time limit for OTP is not there.""""I am able to file an RTI application seeking information, but I cannot check the status as the site asks for an OTP. But I did not get any OTP. Without it, there is no way I can check the status of my application,"" said another frequent user of the RTI portal, Dr Aman Kaushik.""For bank transactions, you get the OTP almost immediately. Why is govt unable to do the same for the RTI portal? And how can they say that there is no time limit for the OTP? I got an SMS message on my phone informing me that the reply to my RTI application is ready. But there is no way I can access it because of this OTP mess,"" said Dr Babu, adding that not only has this made seeking information through RTI more complicated, it has also delayed the whole process, negating the right of a citizen under the RTI law .There was no response to the helpline complaints or to TOI's queries to the Press Information Bureau regarding the dysfunctional RTI portal.","Citizens using RTI have not been able to access status reports on their applications since the start of the year.

"Frame by March 14 scheme for cashless treatment of accident victims during golden hour, orders Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frame-by-march-14-scheme-for-cashless-treatment-of-accident-victims-during-golden-hour-orders-supreme-court/articleshow/117064951.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre to make a scheme by March 14 to provide cashless treatment to victims of road accidents during the golden hour, which is essential to protect lives but is being refused by hospitals for various reasons, including worries about payments.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said that no further time would be given to govt to frame the scheme as Centre was obliged to do it under the Motor Vehicles Act ""The provision made in Section 162 for framing a scheme for providing cashless treatment in the golden hour seeks to uphold and protect the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. Moreover, it is a statutory obligation of the central govt to frame the scheme. More than reasonable time was available to govt to frame the scheme,"" it said, adding that once the scheme was implemented, lives of many who succumb to injuries simply because they don't receive treatment in the golden hour could be saved.""We, therefore, direct the central govt to make a scheme as expeditiously as possible and, in any event, by March 14, 2025,"" the court said.As it was brought to court's notice that a concept note circulated by govt on the scheme provides for payment of a maximum amount of Rs 1.5 lakh and treatment will be given for only seven days, the court said, ""We find that these two concerns must be addressed while framing the scheme. The scheme must be such that it serves the object of saving lives by providing medical treatment in the golden hour"".The court noted that a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund was created to provide treatment during the golden hour but the scheme does not exist and 1,662 claimants received compensation between April 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024.","Hospitals are refusing to provide cashless treatment to road accident victims. Supreme Court says no further time will be given to govt to frame the scheme. Centre was obliged to do it under the Motor Vehicles Act, it said.

The statement by Nathalie G. Drouin, the National Security and Intelligence Advisor to the Canadian PM

NEW DELHI: Canada on Friday issued a statement clarifying that it has no evidence linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, or National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to criminal activities in the country.""On October 14, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India,"" statement issued by intelligence advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau read as.""The government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada. Any suggestion to the contrary is both speculative and inaccurate,"" it added.This comes after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October had publicly accused India of conducting covert operations in Canada that posed a significant threat to public safety. Trudeau claimed that Canadian officials had made multiple attempts to collaborate with Indian authorities but faced consistent refusals.The Canadian Prime Minister stated that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had compelling evidence linking Indian government agents to activities such as information-gathering and coercion, including involvement in serious criminal acts. Trudeau condemned these actions and called for respect for Canada's sovereignty.India had categorically rejected these allegations, labelling them as baseless and politically motivated. The ministry of external affairs said that Trudeau’s government was using anti-India rhetoric for domestic political gains. They pointed to his past actions, including associations with political groups that advocate for separatism in India, as evidence of his longstanding hostility towards India.The MEA also criticised Canada for providing a platform to extremist elements, especially in light of the investigation into Nijjar’s murder.Following this, India expelled six Canadian diplomats and recalled its High Commissioner from Canada. The MEA summoned Canada’s charge d’affaires, Stewart Wheeler, to express discontent over the allegations and warned that further retaliatory actions could follow. India’s government, meanwhile, dismissed the claims of Modi’s involvement in Nijjar’s death as “ludicrous” and said that the accusations were designed to serve political purposes, further straining already tense relations.","Canada says it has no evidence linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, or National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to criminal activities in the country.

Opposition demand for JPC set to make Parliament winter session stormy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-demand-for-jpc-set-to-make-parliament-winter-session-stormy/articleshow/115547812.cms,"NEW DELHI: The upcoming winter session of Parliament from Nov 25, days after the high-stakes elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, is poised to be stormy with opposition likely to raise the indictment of Gautam Adani by US agencies.A pointer to likely turbulence came on Thursday when leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi demanded the setting up of a JPC to examine the allegations. The demand is unlikely to be accepted.""The leader of opposition in Lok Sabha will now start a drama when the Parliament's winter session begins and try to disrupt its proceedings and target the economy,"" BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said in what was seen as a pointer to the govt's stance.Some parties in opposition may not join in the stir, but that is unlikely to be a deterrent for Congress and others.The winter session was already set to be contentious with the opposition set to resist important business on govt's legislative agenda - a constitutional amendment bill to pursue the 'one nation, one election' plan and the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The addition of the fresh Adani controversy will only charge the political atmosphere, making the session a focal point for both policy and political drama.Earlier, allegations by American shortseller Hindenburg Research of stock manipulation and accounting fraud had triggered a week of chaos in Parliament, with opposition demanding a debate and investigation.BJP, on its part, had previously managed to navigate these storms by either downplaying the opposition's demands or by rallying enough support to ensure business as usual. The indictment of Adani in the US marks a fresh challenge, especially with the political climate already charged by heated electioneering in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.",Opposition likely to raise the indictment of Gautam Adani by US agencies.

"Gautam Adani indictment: 4 states named by US had governments led by Congress and its allies, says BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gautam-adani-indictment-4-states-named-by-us-had-governments-led-by-congress-and-its-allies-says-bjp/articleshow/115547783.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday aggressively responded to Rahul Gandhi's allegations against PM Narendra Modi over the indictment of Gautam Adani in the US, accusing the Congress functionary of seeking to undermine the PM without any justification.While staying clear of the charges against the Adani group by US agencies, BJP MP and spokesperson Sambit Patra said the states allegedly involved in the said bribery - Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh - were governed by opposition parties during the period in question (July 2021 to Feb 2022).""All four states that have been named in the document neither had our chief ministers nor a govt supported by us. They all had govts of Congress and its allies,"" he said. This, according to Patra, suggested that if there was any malpractice, it occurred under the watch of opposition-led states, not under BJP governance.Patra accused Congress of hypocrisy and sought answers from Rahul. ""As Chhattisgarh chief minister, why did Bhupesh Baghel take Rs 25,000 crore investment from Adani Group? As Rajasthan CM, why did Ashok Gehlot take Rs 65,000 crore investment from Adani Group? Why did your CM in Karnataka Siddaramaiah sign an MoU with Adani Group for Rs 1,00,000 crore investment? In Bengal, where you have nexus, Adani group has invested Rs 35,000 crore. Tamil Nadu has an investment of Rs 4,500 crore,"" he said.""On Oct 19, 2024, why did Telangana CM Revanth Reddy take a grant of Rs 100 crore for skill development from Adani Foundation? While according to you he is a corrupt person. Congress and Rahul Gandhi should answer all these questions,"" he said, adding that the law would take its course on the allegations against Adani.Patra said Rahul's allegations Thursday fitted the pattern of him, his mother Sonia Gandhi and Congress trying to tarnish Modi's image since 2002, a reference to the communal riots in Gujarat when Modi was chief minister, but in vain.The spokesman said Rahul alleged corruption in the Rafale deal in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had also gone after the central govt over the Covid vaccines issue, adding the Supreme Court had dismissed the bribery charges in procurement of the fighter jet.Instead of levelling allegations in pressers, Rahul should move courts and lodge cases if he believed that there was any wrongdoing, he added.Patra said BJP had repeatedly moved courts and received favourable judgments in its demand for an investigation into charges of corruption against the previous Congress-led UPA govt. He said Rahul has been trying to target the Indian economy by making all kinds of allegations and over 2.5 crore investors lost a lot of money as the stock market tanked on Thursday.Patra also objected to Rahul's claim that his party had to do the job of judiciary as well, saying it amounted to contempt of court. ""He does not understand legalities and technicalities around an issue and merely repeats what he is briefed by advisors,"" he added.","BJP MP and spokesperson Sambit Patra said the states allegedly involved in the said bribery were governed by opposition parties during the period in question.

"Combination drugs more effective in BP treatment, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/combination-drugs-more-effective-in-bp-treatment-says-study/articleshow/115547725.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a finding that could change the way hypertension is managed among Indians, a new study has shown that single pills containing a combination of Blood Pressure (BP)-lowering medications are safe and effective.It is important because conventional practice encourages initiating a patient on a single BP-lowering medication, increasing its dosage depending on whether BP is under control or not and, if both fail, introducing other combinations, Dr Ambuj Roy, professor of cardiology at AIIMS and co-lead of the study, said.In the study, carried out by AIIMS Delhi, Centre for Chronic Disease Control Delhi and Imperial College London, researchers assigned nearly 2,000 persons suffering from high BP to one of three treatment groups - to receive a single pill, often called a polypill, that included a combination of two commonly recommended medications .Each of the three participant groups was prescribed a pill combining two of these medications: an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril), which prevent the arteries from narrowing; calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), which prevent calcium from entering the heart muscle and arteries; and/or diuretics (indapamide), which help the body excrete excess salt and water.As per American Heart Association (AHA), the primary outcome measured 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure after taking the pill daily for six months. The analysis found all three combinations lowered blood pressure equally, with about 70% participants achieving blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg, statement says. More than 40% of participants achieved the strictertarget of less than 130/80 mm Hg, it adds.","Single pills containing a combination of Blood Pressure (BP)-lowering medications are safe and effective.

"High BP, irregular heartbeat up severe stroke risk: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-bp-irregular-heartbeat-up-severe-stroke-risk-study/articleshow/115547690.cms,"NEW DELHI: If you have high blood pressure , irregular heartbeat or smoking habit, you may be at a higher risk of severe stroke.In comparison, a new study published in the journal Neurology suggests, people with other risk factors, for example diabetes, physical inactivity, stress and alcohol use, have a lower risk of severe symptoms if they were to suffer from the neurological condition.Stroke happens when blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, either due to blockage in blood supply to the brain (ischaemic stroke) or leakage of blood from a burst vessel in the brain (haemorrhagic stroke). It can lead to complications such as difficulty swallowing, paralysis, memory loss, confusion and the loss of vision among others. The Neurology study says their findings emphasise the importance of hypertension control in stroke prevention , especially in lower- and middle-income nations that have rapidly increasing rates of hypertension and strokes at younger age.According to World Stroke Organisation , consistently high or elevated blood pressure makes the circulatory system - the heart, arteries and blood vessels - work harder at their job of moving blood around the body. ""This extra work causes damage that can make your blood vessels, including those in your brain, harder and narrower over time. This process, known as atherosclerosis, increases the risk of blockages in the blood vessels in your brain. If the blood supply to an area of the brain is cut off or restricted, it can lead to permanent brain damage, or death. Atherosclerosis can also increase the pressure the blood flows through blood vessels in the brain causing them to burst and bleed. This is called a hemorrhagic stroke which can also cause permanent damage to the brain or death,"" WSO explains.Dr Kameshwar Prasad, head of neurology division at Fortis Vasant Kunj, said high BP and smoking may cause severe stroke compared to other factors such as diabetes because they affect the large and medium-sized arteries in contrast to diabetes which has greater effect on small arteries. ""The message to public is that all adults should have BP checked at least once in two years and after 40 years of age once in a year to avoid a severe stroke,"" he said.Dr Prasad, who was with AIIMS earlier, carried out a survey in Delhi as part of their global study to identify the role of lifestyle, genetic changes and other factors behind stroke as well as dementia. It revealed nearly 70% of people over 50 years old have high BP. Smoking prevalence was found in 20% of the respondents. Dr Prasad said atrial fibrillation or irregular heartbeat was uncommon but its frequency is known to increase as age increases.The former AIIMS professor said timely administration of drugs to dissolve the clot can save many patients. ""Some patients may also benefit from minimally invasive surgery to remove the blood clot,"" he added.","Stroke happens when blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off.

But for students in the US now, it appears to be getting worse by the day.While as per US norms students are allowed to take up only on-campus work, many used to find part-time (illegal) work outside to cover their expenses. But with such part-time work too becoming difficult to find in the current market, to make ends meet a lot of students have turned to finding jobs next door - babysitting.Students from Telangana, Andhra and elsewhere are now tapping into the Indian community settled there to find a way out of a financial hole.This is also a preferred option for many girls as it provides for a safer work environment and they get paid anywhere between $13 and $18 per hour, with some even covering food, accommodation, or both.""I babysit a six-year-old boy for about eight hours a day and get paid $13 an hour. I also get a meal for taking care of the boy,"" said a student from the Hyderabad studying in Ohio, adding that it was way better than working in a local store or gas station .Another Telugu student in Connecticut said she is provided with food and accommodation by her employer. ""I have to take care of a two-and-a-half-year-old six days a week. For those six days, food and accommodation are taken care of by the girl's parents.

"After five-day 'severe' spell, Delhi's air quality improves to 'very poor'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-five-day-severe-spell-citys-air-quality-improves-to-very-poor/articleshow/115541085.cms,"Low wind speeds unfavourable for much AQI relief over next few days

In Gurgaon, mercury to drop by 2-4°C in two day

New Delhi: The city's air quality turned very poor on Thursday. Despite being toxic, it was still seen as an improvement since the city was suffering under severe AQI for the past five days.As the fog moved with shallow haze and a thin smog layer with winds up to 6-8 kmph, the city's air quality began to show some improvement since late Wednesday evening. The AQI was 376 at 11 am, which, despite light winds, managed to reach 372 by 3 pm. The air quality in some areas, however, remained within severe levels. GRAP-IV measures , meant for severe-plus AQI continued to be in place.The average AQI on Thursday was 371 against 418 a day earlier, which despite being a marginal improvement, was worse in the region as Greater Noida saw an AQI of 212, Noida 253, Gurgaon 298, Faridabad 320 and Ghaziabad 291.However, the improvement is unaccounted for since the pollution levels are still very high and way above the normal mark even as the city continued wearing a shroud of smog and toxic haze.According to weather analysts, chances of smog formation will be slightly less due to dry westerly winds; however, the air quality may not see substantial improvement either. ""The winds may catch up marginally, the city will see westerly winds which are dry so the moisture levels will remain low. Thus, smog formation may drop as well. However, due to the drop in the temperatures, dispersion of pollution would be marginal as well,"" said Mahesh Palwat, Vice Chairman, Climate Change and Meteorology, Skymet.The air quality early warning system expects AQI to remain very poor for the next few days. ""The ventilation index lower than 6000 m2/s with average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to be in the very poor category on Nov 22 to Nov 24, 2024. The outlook for the subsequent 6 days: The air quality is likely to be in the very poor category,"" stated IITM's air quality early warning system.The PM2.5 levels in the city on Thursday till 7 pm oscillated between 168.5 to 196.8 microgram per cubic metre, against a 24-hour national standard of 60 microgram per cubic metre, and 15 units for WHO standards. The PM10 levels hovered between 289.6 and 321.3 microgram per cubic metre, against a national standard of 100 units and 45 units as per WHO standards.Meanwhile, the GRAP-IV measures continue to be in force since Monday, with a ban on construction activities barring essential projects. The entry of trucks also continues to be banned, except for those carrying essential items. Physical classes continue to be discontinued, with non-essential govt offices working at 50% strength.As the city woke up to a sunny day with light fog, the maximum temperature on Thursday reached 26.4 degrees Celsius, 1.2 degrees higher than Wednesday. The minimum temperature also increased slightly, settling at 11 degrees Celsius. It was recorded at 10.8 degrees the previous day.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) withdrew its 'yellow' alert for 'dense' to 'very dense' fog in the region.According to IMD's forecast, the minimum temperature may plummet by 2-4 degrees Celsius over the next two days. However, temperatures across the northern plains remain above the usual levels for this time of year, and this trend is expected to continue for the next fortnight, after which temperatures are predicted to decrease gradually.","In Gurgaon, mercury to drop by 2-4°C in two days.

2 city cops reunite 104 missing kids with their families in 9 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-city-cops-reunite-104-missing-kids-with-their-families-in-9-months/articleshow/115542085.cms,"NEW DELHI: Head constables Seema Devi and Suman Hooda pulled off a commendable feat in tracing 104 missing children in the last nine months. They travelled to remote areas in Haryana, Bihar and UP to find the children. Their challenges were many, including the families not having recent photographs of the children, language barriers, unfamiliar locations and reticent locals in the places they visited in other states. Despite such impediments, the duo successfully tracked down the children and reunited them with their families.The cops are posted with the anti-human trafficking unit in outer north district. Devi told TOI that the rescues took place between March and Nov under Operation Milap . In some of the remote locales, the major challenge was topography and unfamiliarity with the people and the place. They had to ask for assistance from the local police. ""There were cases when phone numbers that the children had used to contact people were switched off. In such instances, we took the help of the cyber team to determine the last location of the phone,"" she said.Devi recalled a notable case: ""A 13-year-old girl from Bawana went missing. Her youngest brother informed us that she had called him using several phone numbers, claiming she was fine. However, he suspected foul play since she was using different numbers. We investigated the case and tracked her to Jarcha in Noida. There, we found her doing household chores. We rescued her immediately.""In the new places, the women had to win the trust of the locals, which took time, after which they could conduct door-to-door searches. Devi said that outdated photos made it impossible to identify some kids on many occasions. When the families didn't have the latest photographs of their kids, the rescued youngsters, most of them aged 4 to 17 years, had to be physically identified by the parents.Hooda, who joined AHTU in March, said they felt immense pride and relief in being able to reunite children with their families. ""We don't have fixed duty hours. Whenever we receive information about missing kids, we just leave our homes. There are days when I don't see my kids,"" she smiled.Listing some difficulties, she said that it is a challenge to locate missing children in villages that are off the radar. ""We have walked for kilometres because of lack of transportation in such areas. Many people are ready to help us, but there are also those who think assisting police can lead to legal trouble,"" said Hooda.The head constable disclosed how they often obtained crucial clues from beggars and hawkers at railway stations. Showing them photographs of the missing children often elicited information about their sighting. Hooda pointed out how 13- to 17-year-olds were particularly vulnerable to the influence of strangers they met on social media. According to the cops, reasons for children going missing included elopement, drug addiction, lack of parental care, and insufficient education.Devi has two children of her own, aged 16 and 10. ""When I am away for a couple of days, my younger son misses me a lot,"" she said. As a mother, she said it was important for parents to talk to kids and be aware of what they were doing.DCP (outer north) Nidhin Valsan said, ""We are extremely proud of the exceptional work done by Seema and Suman in Operation Milap. Their achievement reinforces our resolve to combat child trafficking and guard our community,"" he said.","Head constables Seema Devi and Suman Hooda travelled to remote areas in Haryana, Bihar and UP to find the children.

Decoding US charges against Gautam Adani and others: 10 points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decoding-us-charges-against-gautam-adani-and-others-10-points/articleshow/115534659.cms,"Adani group head Gautam Adani (Image Credit: Adani's X account)

Why US authorities took action

Here is all you need to know about:

NEW DELHI: Gautam Adani and his conglomerate, the Adani Group , are at the center of a major legal and financial storm following an indictment by US prosecutors. The charges allege that Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani, and other associates orchestrated a $265 million bribery scheme to secure lucrative solar energy contracts in India. Between 2020 and 2024, the accused reportedly bribed Indian officials to gain business advantages while misleading US investors and financial institutions about their anti-corruption practices.The charges against Adani and others have been filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a prominent federal court known for handling high-profile cases involving corporate fraud, securities violations, and international corruption. This court, based in Brooklyn, has jurisdiction over cases that involve violations of US federal law, especially those with connections to international financial systems and foreign bribery under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).The prosecution is led by the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Breon Peace, who oversees cases related to white-collar crimes, organized fraud, and cross-border offenses.The US indictment stems from the involvement of American investors and financial markets in the alleged fraud. Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), US law prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials if their activities involve US financial systems or investors.In this case: Funds were raised from US investors and allegations pointed to fraudulent disclosures made in connection with securities offerings.1. What are the main allegations against Gautam Adani and the Adani Group?US prosecutors have charged Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani, and others with a $265 million bribery scheme to secure solar energy contracts in India. The indictment alleges that Adani Group executives paid bribes to Indian government officials between 2020 and 2024 and concealed these activities from US investors. The charges include securities fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, and misleading investors about anti-corruption practices.2. How did the alleged bribery scheme operate?The indictment details that executives used encrypted communication, mobile tracking, and coded language to discuss and execute the bribery plan. Bribes were calculated at approximately $30,000 per megawatt for solar projects and disguised as ""development fees."" In some instances, Azure Power, a related company, transferred projects to Adani Green Energy as part of the bribery scheme.3. What are the financial implications of the indictment on Adani Group companies?The charges have triggered a massive sell-off in Adani Group stocks, with the conglomerate losing about $27 billion in market value. Shares of Adani Enterprises fell by 23%, and Adani Green Energy declined by 19%. The group also canceled a $600 million bond offering due to the negative market reaction.4. What is the political fallout from these allegations in India?The indictment has intensified political tensions. Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, have called for Adani’s arrest and an investigation into his alleged ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Critics argue the case underscores a broader issue of corruption and favoritism within the Indian government, though the BJP denies these claims and emphasizes legal processes should take their course.5. What is the Adani Group’s response to the charges?The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless"" and politically motivated. A group statement emphasized its commitment to governance, transparency, and regulatory compliance, asserting that it would seek all possible legal recourse to contest the charges.6. How were US federal authorities involved in the investigation?The US investigation included the FBI seizing electronic evidence from Sagar Adani in 2023 and uncovering extensive documentation of the bribery scheme, including PowerPoint presentations and encrypted communications. The US authorities have also issued arrest warrants for Gautam and Sagar Adani.7. What are the international implications of this case?This case has highlighted cross-border enforcement of anti-corruption laws, particularly the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It also affects international investor confidence in Indian conglomerates, with Adani’s global reputation and access to capital markets now under significant scrutiny.8. How does this relate to previous allegations against Adani Group?The Adani Group faced similar scrutiny in 2023 when Hindenburg Research accused it of stock price manipulation and improper use of tax havens. While the group denied those allegations, the current indictment adds legal weight to concerns about its business practices.9. What role does Azure Power play in this case?Azure Power, formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is implicated as a co-conspirator. Executives from Azure allegedly collaborated with Adani executives to plan and facilitate bribes. Azure has since stated that individuals named in the indictment are no longer associated with the company.10. What’s next for Gautam Adani and the Adani Group?Legal experts suggest Adani could pursue dismissal of the indictment or negotiate a settlement with US authorities. Meanwhile, Indian authorities may face pressure to initiate their investigations. Market analysts predict continued volatility in Adani Group stocks as the case unfolds.(With inputs from others)","Gautam Adani and his conglomerate, the Adani Group, are at the center of a major legal and financial storm.

Worst day since Hindenburg: Adani's US indictment wipes Rs 2.2 lakh crore in m-cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worst-day-since-hindenburg-m-cap-crashes-2-2-lakh-crore/articleshow/115542252.cms,"MUMBAI: Adani Group companies recorded their worst trading day in terms of market value on Thursday since the Hindenburg crisis in early 2023. The conglomerate's combined market value slid by Rs 2.2 lakh crore after the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission pressed widespread bribery charges against the group's chairman and main promoter Gautam Adani and several related entities.In comparison, on Jan 27, 2023 - two days after the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research had alleged corporate malfeasance against the group's companies and associated people - the group's market cap had dipped by Rs 3.2 lakh crore, a TOI analysis of BSE data showed. Thursday's development also left Gautam Adani poorer by $12.1 billion (about Rs 1 lakh crore), with the Gujarat-based businessman's net worth now down at nearly $58 billion, data from Forbes showed.Currently, Adani is the 25th richest billionaire in the list, which is topped by US innovator-cum-businessman Elon Musk with a personal net worth at close to $316 billion. Among Indians, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, is the richest with personal net worth of $96.5 billion.Among the Adani Group companies, flagship Adani Enterprises fell by nearly 23% while its market cap eroded by about Rs 73,600 crore. Other companies from the group saw a dip too, with Adani Green Energy's stock price falling by nearly 19% and its market value by about Rs 42,000 crore. Adani Green is at the center of the US DOJ's bribery allegations against the group's chairman and related entities.Among other stocks from the group, Adani Energy Solutions lost the maximum possible 20%, Adani Ports 13.5%, Adani Wilmar the maximum possible 10%, Ambuja Cements 12% and Adani Total Gas 10.4%, BSE data showed.At a media conference with Goldman Sachs's equity strategist for emerging markets during the day, the analyst at the financial major said that its team was watching developments at the Adani Group 'very closely'. The US DOJ indictments and the investigations by the US SEC against some of the group's top executives were 'bad for investor sentiment', he said. Among the Adani Group's stocks, Goldman Sachs has a 'buy' rating on Adani Ports & SEZ.Outside of the Adani Group stocks, leading indices were back on their sliding path on Thursday as the intensity of selling by foreign funds increased. The simmering geopolitical tension in Europe also weighed on investor sentiment, market players said.As the negatives from Adani group's stocks weighed on investor sentiment on Dalal Street, the sensex opened lower and briefly broke below the 77K mark to touch an intraday low at 76,803 points. At close, it was a tad higher from its earlier low and settled the session at 77,156 points, down 423 points. On the NSE, Nifty too treaded a similar path and closed at 23,350 points, down 169 points.""Indian stock indices experienced a significant decline on Thursday, pressured by bribery charges against Gautam Adani, which further weakened already fragile investor sentiment amid unfavourable global conditions,"" said Devarsh Vakil, deputy head (retail research), HDFC Securities.The day's selling was again led by foreign portfolio investors who recorded a net outflow of Rs 5,321 crore. In contrast, as has been the trend in recent weeks, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 4,200 crore, BSE data showed. So far in the month, FPIs have net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 33,000 crore through the secondary market, official data showed.During the day, several banking stocks witnessed heavy selling pressure. According to Siddhartha Khemka, head of research (wealth management), Motilal Oswal Financial Services, some banking stocks came under heavy selling pressure as investors were concerned about their exposure to Adani Group companies.Among the larger banks, Bank of Baroda closed 3.6% lower, Canara Bank 3.3% and SBI was down 2.6%.

I believe, be it space or sea, these should not be subjects of universal conflict but of universal co-operation,'' Modi said.

""Today, there are many such challenges like terrorism, drugs, cyber crime, and only by facing them we will be able to improve the future of our future generations. And, this is possible only when we give centrestage to Democracy First- Humanity First,'' said Modi, adding that this was the time for Global South awakening and for developing countries to stay united.""This is an opportunity for us to work together and create a new global order,"" said Modi, adding India has always worked on the basis of trust, transparency, and principles.The PM also said India stood for global development and peace.

In the counter-attack, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also name-dropped George Soros to target the Congress leader.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya slammed Gandhi for speaking the same language as George Soros and accused the Congress leader of launching an assault on India Inc on behalf of the investor.Taking to X, Malviya said, ""Isn’t it a coincidence that Rahul Gandhi and George Soros (Feb 16, 2023) are speaking the same language? It can’t be a mere coincidence that the Hindenburg report emerged just when Adani was raising 20,000 crore through a FPO in Feb 2023.""Malviya also posted an old video of George Soros in which he was accusing PM Modi and Adani of being ""close allies"" with intertwined fate.""Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined. Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards. Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,"" Soros said in the video.Using the video, Malviya further questioned the timing of the US Justice Department's observation amid Donald Trump's impending presidency and Adani planning a US $600 million denominated bond offering.""And it can’t be a coincidence again that the US Justice Department’s observation comes, amidst US President-elect Donald Trump’s charge of the outgoing regime stacking/misusing the Department of Justice, and Adani planning a US $600 million denominated bond offering?"" Malviya said.""In both the instances, Congress and Rahul Gandhi led the charge, like subservient slaves of George Soros. What is Rahul Gandhi’s interest in launching an assault on India Inc on behalf of a geriatric investor?"" he added.Earlier, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra also came down heavily on Gandhi and said that it is his tactic to attack India and structures that defend the country as he did in the Rafale issue.While addressing a presser, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the Congress leader mentioned that they are doing the work of judiciary while talking about the charges against Adani and added, ""Where the mother-son duo (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) is out on bail they are doing the work of judiciary! Half of them are out on bail and they are doing the work of judiciary!""The remarks came after Gandhi addressed the US prosecutors' allegations that Adani and associates paid $250 million in bribes to Indian officials. He said that the businessman had violated both Indian and American laws.Taking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poll rhetoric of 'ek hain, safe hain,' the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said that PM Modi lacked the ""ability to arrest Adani"" as the whole ""BJP structure was funded by Adani.""Meanwhile, the Adani Group has rejected the charges made by US prosecutors.""The allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green are baseless and denied,"" the conglomerate said in a statement, adding that ""all possible legal recourse will be sought,"" the statement read.The indictment accuses Adani and multiple subordinates of paying huge sums of more than $250 million in bribes to government officials for lucrative solar energy supply contracts.The deals were projected to generate more than $2 billion in profits after tax over roughly 20 years.""The Adani Group has always upheld and is steadfastly committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance, transparency and regulatory compliance across all jurisdictions of its operations,"" the statement added.

We will soon give a date for clause by clause discussion on its recommendations,"" Pal said after an almost six-hour meeting of the JPC, during which the minority affairs ministry presented a detailed justification for the proposed amendments proposed by the govt in the Waqf Act.Opposition MPs will meet LS Speaker Om Birla on Nov 25 the first day of the Parliament session , seeking an extension. They said they needed more time to raise questions and seek clarifications. Pal said the panel has engaged in an exhaustive deliberation with a gamut of stakeholders, and all members were given the opportunity to pose questions and seek replies, as he suggested that all that is left now is for the panel to discuss the report. ""I hope there will be a consensus,"" he said, a possibility highly unlikely due to opposition members' relentless objections to a host of the Bill's proposals.The proposed law is seen by them as a part of the BJP-led govt's political agenda. MPs from Congress, TMC, DMK, AAP and AIMIM have repeatedly questioned Pal's choice of stakeholders, and have even complained to Birlathe speaker over his alleged unilateral conduct and implementation of the govt's agenda. Pal has dismissed the charges, asserting that he has allowed every stakeholder and all opposition MPs to record their views.He said if opposition MPs want to meet Birla, it is their right. The speaker had constituted the committee, and whatever he decides will be acceptable to all, Pal added.The minority affairs ministry has deposed before the committee for nearly 29 hours over five days, and nearly 1,000 slides covering members' views and the ministry's replies and stand have been prepared, Pal said, rebutting the opposition's charge of inadequate deliberations.

"Eye on China, Rajnath Singh calls for talks to resolve global disputes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-rajnath-singh-calls-for-talks-to-resolve-global-disputes/articleshow/115544322.cms,"Rajnath Singh

NEW DELHI: China’s expansionist muscle-flexing and 'grey zone' tactics in the Indo-Pacific continue to figure prominently on the radar screens of the ' Quad ' and other countries, with defence minister Rajnath Singh once again stressing India firmly stands for freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and adherence to international law for peace and prosperity in the region.Making this clear at the ongoing Asean defence ministers' meeting-plus (ADMM-Plus) at Vientiane on Thursday, a day after he told Chinese defence minister Admiral Dong Jun that de-escalation must now follow the recent troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh, Singh said open dialogue and peaceful negotiations were the only way forward in resolving complex international issues ranging from border disputes to trade agreements.It’s time Buddhist doctrines of peaceful co-existence were embraced more closely by all, as the world is increasingly getting polarised into blocks and camps, leading to increasing strain on the established world order, he said, with Dong and others listening.""The power of dialogue has always proven effective, yielding tangible results that contribute to stability and harmony on the global stage. India believes genuine long-term solutions to global problems can only be achieved when nations engage constructively, respecting each other’s perspectives and working toward shared goals in the spirit of cooperation,"" he added.The statement came in the backdrop of China’s continuing use of strong-arm tactics, below the threshold of a full-scale war, to push unreasonable territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific, be it the land borders with India or the South and East China Seas.While India does not want the Quad to acquire an overt military dimension, it has steadily enhanced defence cooperation and military interoperability with its members, the US, Australia and Japan, as well as with other like-minded countries, including those in the Asean.This found reflection in Singh’s bilateral meetings with his US, Australian and South Korean counterparts on the sidelines of the Asean meet on Thursday. Singh and Australian defence minister Pat Conroy announced an arrangement on air-to-air refuelling between their armed forces as part of their expanding military interoperability, while stressing their shared interests in ensuring ""stability and security"" in the Indian Ocean Region.Under the new pact, KC-30A multi-role tankers will provide mid-air refuelling to Indian military aircraft, including the P-8I long-range maritime patrol planes, to increase their operational ""reach and persistence"" in the Indo-Pacific. The two countries, incidentally, also just concluded their joint `AustraHind’ military exercise at Aundh, Pune.With US secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin, Singh discussed the “remarkable progress” made in bilateral defence-industrial cooperation, including the proposed co-production of GE-F414 jet engines for Tejas fighters, ground mobility systems like the Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles and munitions, as well as “ongoing efforts to deepen the military partnership and interoperability to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific”.The 'Quad' leaders’ summit in Washington on Sept 21 had declared that the four countries as “leading maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific” would be a force for the good in the region, where “no country dominates and no country is dominated”, with an eye firmly on China.Singh emphasised the need for India and the US to work together on the agreed deliverables during the summit. These include the new regional maritime initiative for training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI), the first-ever Quad-at-sea ship observer mission, and the launch of a Quad Indo-Pacific logistics network pilot project to support civilian response to natural disasters more rapidly and efficiently across the Indo-Pacific region.","India firmly stands for freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and adherence to international law in the region.

SC: Divert traffic via green land for metro work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-divert-traffic-via-green-land-for-metro-work/articleshow/115542246.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court recommended the use of 1.23 hectare in the forest and morphological ridge for the temporary diversion of traffic through two routes to facilitate the construction of Neb Sarai metro station .This station is being constructed for the new corridor from Aerocity to Tughlaqabad, known as Golden Line. The morphological ridge has ridge-like features and is given the same protection as the notified area. After CEC's nod, the project needs the final approval from the Supreme Court. Ridge Management Board approved the project in April. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that due to the non-availability of wider alternate roads in the area, vehicular traffic and construction vehicles would have to pass through the construction zone of the proposed underground Neb Sarai metro station on Ignou main road. Due to the higher depth of the station - around 40m - huge machinery was mobilised at the construction site, leaving negligible space for the movement of traffic, it added.""To reduce the delay in the construction of the project, DMRC sought permission for the temporary diversion of traffic through two alternate routes involving Ridge Reserve Forest and Morphological Ridge Area to ease the traffic situation,"" said CEC.During a site visit in Sept, CEC travelled on both routes on foot. For the proposed route one, the committee suggested a shorter loop to reduce the requirement of forest land.CEC, in its report dated Nov 6, recommended the proposal of DMRC to the apex court, considering that the ""project is in public interest and the land being used for construction of the temporary routes is bare minimum required"". It also noted that the proposal was site-specific and the work of this metro station couldn't be completed without appropriate diversion of traffic.The committee asked DMRC to take necessary measures to prevent encroachment of ridge areas. CEC also directed DMRC to ensure that no tree is damaged or felled and return the ridge land in its original form after the construction.In the first route, the traffic coming from Ignou and moving towards Mehrauli-Badarpur Road or Saket metro, which is one-way traffic, will bypass the proposed Neb Sarai station by entering Freedom Fighter Enclave Gate no. 3 and connect with Westend Marg on the other side after passing through Delhi Tourism Area near Garden of Five Senses.The second route will bypass the proposed station by entering Freedom Fighter Enclave Gate no. 3 and pass through an open plot that is khasra numbers 96 and 97 near Subhash Chandra Bose Statue Park and further passing through Saidulajab Park, which will merge with the existing traffic at Westend Marg and meet Mehrauli-Badarpur Road.Two routes have been proposed as a backup in case of any emergency situations on one of them, such as the breakdown of a vehicle, movement of an ambulance, etc.","The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court recommended the use of 1.23 hectare in the forest and morphological ridge for the temporary diversion of traffic.

NEW DELHI: Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.According to Today's Chanakya exit poll predictions, Mahayuti is projected to secure 175 ± 11 seats, while the Congress-led Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) is expected to win 100 ± 11 seats. The agency has projected 13 ± 5 seats for other parties and independents.Meanwhile, Axis My India also predicted 178-200 seats for Mahayuti and 82-102 for MVA. The agency has predicted 6-12 seats for others and Independents.The Axis My India exit poll results have also revealed that Eknath Shinde is the preferred chief minister choice at 31 per cent, followed by Uddhav Thackeray at 18 per cent and Devendra Fadnavis at 12 per cent.With this, the Mahayuti is now projected to win 168 seats, according to the poll of polls, MVA 109 and others are likely to get 11 seats.The two exit poll results are in line with the projections released a day earlier where most polls on predicted victory for the BJP-led alliance in Maharashtra.On Wednesday, three pollsters - Peoples Pulse, Matrize and Chankya Strategies predicted clear majority for the Mahayuti while three - P-Marq, Dainik Bhaskar and Poll Diary predicted Mahayuti ahead of the MVA, but short of majority.The Matrize exit poll predicted 150-170 seats for the BJP and allies in Maharashtra with a 48 per cent vote share, it gave the Congress and other allies only 110-130 seats with a vote share of 42 per cent. The poll gave others 8 to 10 seats, with a vote share of 10 per cent. People's Pulse gave NDA's Mahayuti a whopping 175-195 seats while giving only 85-112 seats to MVA and 7-12 to others in Maharashtra.The actual results will be announced by the Election Commission on November 23.During the 2019 assembly elections, BJP had secured its position as the dominant party by winning 105 seats, whilst their alliance partner Shiv Sena obtained 56 seats. A disagreement over the chief minister's position led to Uddhav Thackeray's separation from the BJP. Subsequently, he established the MVA administration with support from Congress and the NCP, which had secured 44 and 54 seats respectively.The BJP orchestrated its response in 2022 when Eknath Shinde caused a division within the Shiv Sena, leading to the MVA government's collapse. The BJP then appointed Shinde as the chief minister. The following year, Ajit Pawar's rebellion against his uncle Sharad Pawar and the subsequent NCP split resulted in the formation of the Mahayuti.",Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.

ED lists ministers who may walk free after SC 'prior nod' order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-lists-ministers-who-may-walk-free-after-sc-prior-nod-order/articleshow/115547280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former FM P Chidambaram and ex-Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal are among politicians facing serious money laundering charges who have rushed to courts, or are in the process of doing so, demanding dropping of chargesheets filed against them based on a recent Supreme Court verdict asking ED to take prior sanction from govt to prosecute them.ED is making a list of all such accused who may be discharged in money laundering cases as a result of the SC order, if it is not reviewed. Kejriwal's colleague and AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan was the first to get a reprieve when a trial court last week did not take cognisance of the chargesheet against him as ED had not taken prior sanction from govt. Khan was granted bail by the court for the same reason.There are multiple money laundering cases against Chidambaram, some a decade old. Chargesheet against him in Aircel-Maxis case was filed in 2018, in which he has now approached higher courts seeking it to be dropped as he said sanction was not taken to prosecute him even though he was a public servant at that point. On Thursday, Delhi HC refused Kejriwal's plea on the same ground and asked ED to respond. A special court had taken cognisance of the chargesheet filed against Kejriwal in July.Framing of charges have been delayed against both Chidambaram and Kejriwal as they have repeatedly approached higher courts seeking to inspect 'unrelied upon documents' by the agency, and also challenged certain provisions of the PMLA , sources said.As reported by TOI on Thursday, ED is likely to approach SC seeking review of its judgment that has led to this confusion as the anti-money laundering investigations are always a result of registration of a predicate offence by some other agency, like economic offences wing of state police or CBI. Prosecution complaints (chargesheets) filed by ED are evidence of money laundering produced by the agency through details of financial transactions and other evidence.Sources said ambiguity in the SC judgment is whether ED needs to take fresh sanction under PMLA when the same has already been taken in the predicate offence registered by another agency, and chargesheets have been filed by them.The applicability of Section 197(1) of CrPC to ED cases, as mandated by the SC order, has been made through provisions of Section 65 of PMLA which states that CrPC will apply ""in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act"".","ED is making a list of all such accused who may be discharged in money laundering cases as a result of the SC order, if it is not reviewed.

Lawrence's brother Anmol applies for asylum in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawrences-brother-anmol-applies-for-asylum-in-us/articleshow/115506325.cms,"NEW DELHI: Anmol Bishnoi, the younger brother of notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, is learnt to have applied for asylum in the US through his counsel. Bishnoi, detained last week, has been lodged at the Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa, sources said.Known as 'Squirrel Cage Jail', the prison was referenced in an old radio programme called 'Gang Busters'. The prison facility's website had Anmol's details and mentioned his name as Anmol Bishnoi. It said he was being investigated by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which deals with cross-border crime and undocumented immigration.While Anmol's arrest in the US seems triggered by information shared by the Indian govt about his illegal entry into the country, sources, however, suggested that he may have deliberately surrendered to US authorities as a tactical move to seek asylum. This development came after Mumbai police initiated extradition proceedings against him.Sources said before his detention, Anmol Bishnoi had applied for asylum through the US Citizenship and Immigration Services , a division of Department of Homeland Security. Now that he has initiated asylum proceedings through legal channels, it's unlikely that he will be extradited to India or any other country.The US legal system's tendency to grant bail in such cases, coupled with the precedent set by gangster Goldy Brar's release, raises the possibility that Anmol might evade extradition to India. Brar, too, has applied for asylum, sources said.Also, there is a possibility that Canada police may try to get access to him in connection with some gang-related cases being investigated by RCMP.FBI is learnt to be in the process of verifying Anmol's identity, possibly through a voice sample or a DNA match, sources said. The US agency officials, who had earlier this month confirmed his presence in America, are in touch with Indian agencies for subsequent processes, including his deportation.Anmol, who has a red notice issued against him by Interpol, is an accused in several high-profile cases, including the recent murder of former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique and the firing incident outside Bollywood actor Salman Khan's residence in Mumbai.Anmol has also been accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Sidhu Moosewala who was killed on May 29, 2022.",Anmol Bishnoi is learnt to have applied for asylum in the US through his counsel.

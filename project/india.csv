NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Samajwadi Party chief and MLA Abu Azmi has written to assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar requesting the revocation of his suspension.Azmi, who was suspended on Wednesday over his remarks on Mughal ruler Aurangzeb , argued that his statement was misinterpreted and taken out of context.In his letter, Azmi stated, ""Everything I said was based on quotes from various historians and writers. I did not make any controversial remarks about Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. I deeply respect both Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj .""Azmi was suspended for the remainder of the ongoing budget session after he claimed in an interview that India flourished under Aurangzeb's rule and described the Mughal emperor as a great administrator.His remarks sparked controversy, leading to his suspension. Following the decision, Azmi took to social media, calling the action against him ""unfair"" and questioning whether ""two sets of laws"" existed in the state. He also compared his case to that of BJP leaders Prashant Kortkar and Rahul Sholapurkar.In his earlier statement, Azmi had said Aurangzeb should not be viewed solely as a tyrant but also as an administrator who contributed to India's expansion.He added that the conflict between Aurangzeb and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was political rather than religious. While Azmi later apologised for his remarks, he maintained that his words had been misrepresented and reiterated that his comments were based on historical accounts.",Abu Azmi has written to assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar requesting the revocation of his suspension.

Google marked International Women’s Day 2025 with a special Doodle honouring the achievements of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The artwork highlights key breakthroughs and discoveries made by female pioneers in these fields, celebrating their impact despite historical challenges.Women have long played a crucial role in STEM, yet their participation has remained disproportionately low since the 18th century’s Age of Enlightenment, when scientific and technological advancements became more structured disciplines. Scholars and policymakers have noted that these fields have traditionally been dominated by men, with women facing barriers to entry, recognition, and career advancement. The Doodle serves as a tribute to those who have pushed boundaries and made significant contributions, paving the way for future generations. Notable figures include Marie Curie, who won two Nobel Prizes for her groundbreaking work in radioactivity; Ada Lovelace, often regarded as the first computer programmer; and Katherine Johnson, whose calculations were critical to NASA’s early space missions.In recent years, efforts have increased to close the gender gap in STEM through education, policy changes, and advocacy. Initiatives promoting women’s involvement in science and technology continue to challenge stereotypes and create more opportunities for aspiring female professionals. Google’s latest tribute aligns with these efforts, aiming to inspire young women to pursue careers in these fields.International Women’s Day (IWD) is observed annually on 8 March to celebrate the achievements of women across various spheres, including social, economic, cultural, and political domains. The day also serves as a call to action for gender equality and women’s rights.The origins of IWD trace back to the early 20th century when women’s movements worldwide began advocating for better working conditions, voting rights, and equal opportunities. The United Nations officially recognised the day in 1977, and it has since grown into a global event marked by rallies, discussions, and campaigns aimed at addressing gender disparities.","Google marked International Women’s Day 2025 with a special Doodle honouring the achievements of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) The artwork highlights key breakthroughs and discoveries made by female pioneers in these fields.

NEW DELHI: US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick called upon India to open up the agricultural sector for trade, saying ""it just can't stay closed"".The farm sector has remained a no-go area for government that has cited domestic sensitivities, even as US has insisted on greater access for American nuts, fruits and poultry. ""Indian market for agriculture has to open up... How you do that and the scale by which you do that, may be, do quotas, may be do limits. You can be smarter when you have your most important trading partner on the other side of the table,"" he said, indicating that the US acknowledged that an open-ended liberalisation may not be feasible.While suggesting that India should ""step out of the model"" he repeatedly called for a bilateral deal , arguing that a pact ""with the largest consuming economy in the world"" would be beneficial.Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Lutnick sought a ""grand deal"": ""Let's bring India's tariff policy towards America down, and America will invite India to have really an extraordinary opportunity and relationship with us.""Responding to a question on the larger India-US ties amid too much emphasis on trade and tariffs during Trump's second term, he said: ""there are plenty of levers that govts can pull while doing business with each other... India has historically bought significant amounts of its military (equipment) from Russia. We think that is something that needs to end.""He then went on to say that India was the 'I' in BRICS, the group that also includes Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa, where Beijing had proposed a common currency, something that Trump is unhappy with, seeing it as an attempt reduce importance of the dollar. ""These are the kind of things that don't create the love and affection that we feel deeply towards India. We would like those things to end and we would trade to be more fair and we would like to create an incredible and strong relationship with India,"" the US commerce secretary said.On China, he said: ""China has very high tariffs.

You can't even sell anything in India...They have agreed, by the way; they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done,"" he said.This comes amidst reports of Tesla eyeing zero tariffs as it is set to enter Indian markets in the coming months. India currently imposes vehicle import duties of up to 110%, a rate Tesla CEO Elon Musk has condemned as among the highest in the world. The steep tariffs previously led Tesla to abandon its plans to enter India's automobile market, which ranks as the third-largest globally.Justifying the tariff threat being levied on Canada, China, Mexico and India, set to take effect from April 2, Trump said, ""Our country has been ripped off by everybody and that stops now. I had it stopped in my first term and we're going to really stop it now because it has been very unfair. Our country from an economic standpoint, a financial standpoint and a trade standpoint, has been absolutely ripped off by almost every country in the world.""India has resorted to a cautious route in the trade war, while Canada, China and Mexico have gone all out with slapping reciprocal tariffs on the US and filing complaints with the World Trade Organisation.""The two governments are in the process of advancing discussions on a multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement.

NEW DELHI: US president Donald Trump on Friday said India had agreed to bring tariffs ""way down"", while claiming credit for the move in yet another tirade against several ""high-tariff"" countries.""India charges us massive tariffs, you can't even sell anything in India, it's almost restrictive... By the way, they have agreed to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done,"" he told reporters in the White House.The comments came at a time when an Indian team led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is in the US to work out the contours of a bilateral agreement. So far, govt has remained tight-lipped about the negotiations that are currently underway.Trump's statement came hours after US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick sought a ""grand"" deal that included farm products, while suggesting India stop defence purchases from Russia. ""It's time to do something big...something that connects India and US together, but...on a broad scale, not product by product, but rather the whole thing,"" he said at the India Today Conclave.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick called upon India to open up the agricultural sector for trade, saying “it just can’t stay closed”.The farm sector has remained a no-go area for govt that has cited domestic sensitivities, even as US has insisted on greater access for American nuts, fruits and poultry. “Indian market for agriculture has to open up... How you do that and the scale by which you do that, may be, do quotas, may be do limits. You can be smarter when you have your most important trading partner on the other side of the table,” he said, indicating that the US acknowledged that an open-ended liberalisation may not be feasible.While suggesting that India should “step out of the model” he repeatedly called for a bilateral deal, arguing that a pact “with the largest consuming economy in the world” would be beneficial. Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Lutnick sought a “grand deal”: “Let’s bring India’s tariff policy towards America down, and America will invite India to have really an extraordinary opportuni ty and relationship with us.”Responding to a question on the larger India-US ties amid too much emphasis on trade and tariffs during Trump’s second term, he said: “there are plenty of lev ers that govts can pull while doing business with each other… India has historically bought significant amounts of its military (equipment) from Russia. We think that is something that needs to end.”He then went on to say that India was the ‘I’ in BRICS, the group that also includes Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa, where Beijing had proposed a common currency, something that Trump is unhappy with, seeing it as an attempt reduce importance of the dollar. “These are the kind of things that don’t create the love and affection that we feel deeply towards India. We would like those things to end and we would trade to be more fair and we would like to create an incredible and strong relationship with India,” the US commerce secretary said.On China, he said: “China has very high tariffs. Tariffs we have put today is because of opioid production… when we get to April 2, we will talk of a broader range of tariffs.”","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick called upon India to open up the agricultural sector for trade, saying “it just can’t stay closed” The farm sector has remained a no-go area for govt that has cited domestic sensitivities, even as US has insisted on greater access.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118796861,imgsize-861635,width-400,resizemode-4/118796861.jpg"

Can’t you find a safe house in Delhi, judge asks Agusta accused

NEW DELHI: Christian Michel James , one of the alleged middlemen in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case who was granted bail by Delhi high court earlier this week, appeared before a city court on Friday and submitted that he could not accept it and wanted to go back to custody as Delhi was unsafe for him.Saying that because of ""security risks"", he would rather finish his sentence and leave India instead of being released on bail, he submitted before the court of special judge Sanjeev Aggarwal, ""I can't accept the bail. It's unsafe. Every time I step out of Tihar, something happens. The problem I am having is with police. I'd rather talk to you in private.""When the judge asked about his well-being, James said Delhi was just a larger prison for him. He mentioned something happened in AIIMS that he would rather talk to the court about in private.Christian Michel James was extradited from the UAE in 2018 in Rs 3600-crore money laundering case registered by ED. Later in the day, the court imposed the necessary bail conditions for releasing him. After James asked the court to talk in private, the judge sent the mediapersons and police outside the courtroom.Earlier this week, while granting him bail, HC said it was an exceptional situation where the accused was in custody for over 6.2 years but the trial had not yet commenced due to incomplete investigation. On Feb 18, Supreme Court had granted him bail in a related CBI case subject to terms and conditions decided by the trial court. In both cases, the court directed James to furnish a personal bond and surety of Rs 5 lakh each, at which James said, “How can a person who has been in jail for six years produce local sureties?”When James said that he did not want to be released on bail, the judge said, “Can’t you find a safehouse in Delhi?” James was extradited from Dubai in Dec 2018 and was subsequently arrested by CBI and ED. James is among the three alleged middlemen being probed and the other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa. CBI, in its chargesheet, claimed an estimated loss of 398.21 million euros (about Rs 2,666 crore) to the exchequer due to the deal that was signed on Feb 8, 2010, for the supply of VVIP choppers worth 556.262 million euros.

JAMMU: Chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday presented a Rs 1.12-lakh crore budget for 2025-26, the first by an elected government in J&K in seven years, as he heaped praise on PM Narendra Modi, promised all-round growth and ladled out a salad of sops for disadvantaged groups.Terming the document a roadmap for growth and a true reflection of people’s aspirations, Omar said J&K was at the cusp of a new era of peace and prosperity, with a semblance of normality returning after over 30 years of turmoil.Attired in a traditional suit and a skull cap, Omar started his 90-minute budget speech in the assembly in English, with a Persian couplet “Tan Hama Daag Daag Shud–Punmba Kuja Kuja Neham (my entire body is covered with bruises, where should I apply the balm)” amid thumping of benches by legislators of his National Conference (NC).The last budget was tabled in 2018 under the then PDP-BJP govt in the erstwhile state of J&K, which was accorded Union Territory status following the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019.Omar, who has retained the finance portfolio with himself, also praised Union home minister Amit Shah and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for support in various areas. He said the improved environment was contributing to progress, with J&K’s economy expanding from Rs 1,64,103 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 2,45,022 crore in 2023-24. “GDP for 2025-26 is projected at Rs 2,884,22 crore, reflecting a growth of 9.5% over the previous year,” Omar added.Revealing other key fiscal indicators, the CM pegged the tax-GDP ratio at 7.5% for 2025-26 and fiscal deficit at 3% of J&K’s GDP. “This is substantially lower than 5.5% in 2024-25 (RE). Expected revenue receipts are Rs 97,982 crore and capital receipts Rs 14,328 crore. Similarly, revenue expenditure is estimated to be Rs 79,703 crore and capital expenditure Rs 32,607 crore,” the CM said, focusing on a zero-deficit revenue account budget.An additional Rs 41,000 crore is to flow as central assistance and Rs 13,522 crore as centrally sponsored schemes and Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP). “J&K continues to face significant infrastructure deficits. I met Prime Minister (Modi), home minister (Shah), and finance minister (Sitaraman) on multiple occasions. Our efforts have paid off -- the central govt has approved special assistance for J&K and will support fiscal reforms to enhance revenue and expenditure management,” Omar said.Marriage assistance for women under the AAY category will be raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Omar topped this up with free bus rides for women. “On International Women’s Day (March 8), I will announce free ridership for women on all govt-owned transport, including e-buses, starting April 1, 2025. This will enhance access to education and employment while ensuring safer, more affordable travel,” the CM said.Marriage assistance for women under the AAY category will be raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Omar topped this up with free bus rides for women from April to “enhance access to education and employment while ensuring safer, more affordable travel”.Pensions have been enhanced to Rs 1,250 per month for people above 60yrs, Rs 1,500 for those between 60 and 80, and Rs 2,000 per month for those aged 80 and above. The payouts were last fixed at Rs 1,000 in 2016.Buoyed by record-breaking 2.36 crore tourist footfalls in 2024, Omar unveiled a slew of initiatives for the sector. “Tourism’s contribution to GSDP will be increased from 7% to 15% in 4-5 years,” the CM said.Omar’s rivals were not persuaded. PDP said the budget exposed the “gap” between the promises Omar’s NC had made during assembly elections last year and the reality of its governance. BJP dismissed it as a “complete failure”.By limiting the food and free power benefits only to AAY ration card holders, the govt has excluded a vast majority of the state’s population, PDP argued. Peoples’ Conference chief Sajad Lone described the budget as a “disappointment”. “Same old style of parroting of centrally sponsored schemes with Hindi nomenclature,” Lone said.(With inputs from agencies)","Chief minister Omar Abdullah presented a Rs 1.12-lakh crore budget for 2025-26.

NEW DELHI: Is Nitish Kumar losing his cool way too often these days? On Friday, the Bihar chief minister lost his temper inside the state legislative council and surprised many with his choice of words to refer to former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi .""Jab iske husband doob gaye to apni wife ko bana diya (When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post))"", Nitish said referring to Lalu Prasad's move to make Rabri Devi the chief minister after he was forced to resign from the post following an arrest warrant in a fodder scam case.It all started after RJD MLC Urmila Thakur, citing the example of her Begusarai district said ""in many villages, girls are deprived of education as reaching the nearest school requires them to walk four to five kilometers"".This irked Nitish Kumar, who lashed out at the opposition and said: ""Do you people even know what we have done for girls' education? Village girls hardly went to schools in Bihar until we came to power.""When Urmila Thakur objected, Nitish stepped up his attack.""The education system had collapsed during the RJD government. It was I who revived it,” the CM said. ""What did the RJD government do for women? Where did women study earlier? They barely had access to primary education,” he added.Then the Bihar chief minister went on to launch a frontal attack on Rabri Devi and mocked at the way she was made the chief minister by her husband Lalu Prasad.Also read: 'Mahila has no problems': Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's remark sparks spat with opposition women lawmakers - watch Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav strongly objected to the language used by Nitish Kumar for his parents and once again raised questions over Bihar chief minister's health. ""I pity the condition of chief minister and I don't want to comment any more on this aspect. His falling health has proved that he is not fit to run Bihar anymore,"" Tejashwi said.""There should be some decency in language when you are holding the post of chief minister. Rabri Devi became the chief minister before him and that too of undivided Bihar and he is referring to her as ""re"" and ""tu"","" he added.""Nitish Kumar should know that Rabri Deviji was the first woman chief minister of the state. She is elder to Nitish both in age and also in relationship,"" the RJD leader said.And while targeting Nitish over his health suits Tejashwi's politics, senior political analyst N K Choudhary has a different take on the changed behaviour of Bihar chief minister.""Nitish Kumar is perhaps reacting to the challenges he faces to his undisputed leadership for the first time. Nitish enjoyed unbridled power for over 15 years but realises that political dynamics in the state has changed,"" says Choudhary, who is also a former professor of Patna University.Also read: 'I made your father': Bihar CM Nitish to Tejashwi Yadav amid big showdown in assembly ""No one could question Nitish Kumar and there was no challenge to his authority all these years. This perhaps led to some arrogance. Also, the social system that gave him power increased his ego over the years. So, now when questions are raised over his governance or his development claims are criticised, Nitish reacts very strongly,"" says N K Choudhary.""Even Lalu Prasad, during his prime enjoyed a lot of power and would often say ""I am the king,"" he adds.Whatever be the reason, those who have followed Nitish Kumar and seen his politics over the years, do feel that there is a perceptible change in his behaviour. In fact, one of the biggest factors that differentiated Nitish from his arch rival Lalu Prasad, who is also a mass leader, was the grace with which the JD(U) chief handled his critics and the opposition.With elections scheduled later this year in Bihar, Tejashwi has stepped up his attack on Nitish. However, the strong reactions from Bihar chief minister seem to suggest that he is not ready to take such political attacks lying low. May be Nitish feels offence is the best defence. More so, as his dominance in Bihar politics is perhaps on the decline. However, what Nitish needs to realise that his frequent outbursts will give the opposition an opportunity to raise more questions on his health - a narrative that not just suits RJD's Tejashwi, but also the BJP. The saffron party, which is now the senior partner in the Bihar alliance, would be keen to lead the alliance once the Nitish era comes to an end.(With inputs from agencies)","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lost his temper inside the state legislative council.

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan

Pakistan is grappling with a severe resurgence of terrorism with its homegrown Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerging as one of the deadliest terrorist organisations globally, as per the Global Terrorism Index 2025.According to the report, the four terrorist groups responsible for the most deaths globally in 2024 were Islamic State (IS), Jamaat Nusrat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and al-Shabaab.Deaths attributed to these groups increased by 11 per cent to 4,204 deaths in 2024, or 80 per cent of deaths that were attributed to a specific group. In 2014, these four groups were responsible for less than 40 per cent of terrorism deaths that were attributed to a group, highlighting the large global shifts in terrorism over the past decade.Islamic State (IS) and its affiliates remained the world's deadliest terrorist group in 2024, and is active in 23 countries, one more than in 2023. Deaths attributed to the group and its affiliates declined by ten per cent, from 1,996 to 1,805 deaths.Of the major terrorist organisations, TTP was responsible for the largest increase in deaths, which rose by 90 per cent to 558 deaths, said the report.The report noted that Pakistan recorded the second-largest increase in terrorism deaths in 2024, with the toll rising by 45 per cent to 1,081.Terrorism has increased significantly in Pakistan since the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, with the number of attacks increasing fivefold since 2021.The most recent surge in terrorism in Pakistan was primarily driven by increased TTP activity, which is aligned with the Afghan Taliban. Deaths attributed to the group nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.In 2024, the TTP was responsible for 558 deaths across 482 attacks, marking it as the third deadliest terrorist group globally. This resurgence follows a period of reduced activity between 2017 and 2021. The number of attacks attributed to the TTP reached a record high in 2024, with deaths at their highest level since 2011.The group's activity is largely concentrated along Pakistan’s northern border with Afghanistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 96 percent of the TTP's attacks occurred.TTP activity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa more than doubled in the past year, escalating from 182 attacks resulting in 265 deaths in 2023 to 462 attacks and 545 deaths in 2024. The deadliest attack in 2024 saw TTP militants killing 16 Pakistani soldiers at an army outpost, claimed as retaliation for the killing of senior TTP commanders.The TTP's primary targets align with its anti-state objectives, focusing on police and military personnel, who accounted for 51 percent and 16 percent of attacks, respectively.Civilians were also frequently targeted, comprising 16 percent of attacks and 19 percent of terrorism-related deaths.Armed attacks remain the TTP’s most common tactic, accounting for nearly two-thirds of attacks and 72 percent of deaths. Bombings have also increased, nearly tripling compared to the previous year.The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, was formed in 2007.Sharing a common ideology with the Afghan Taliban, the TTP aims to overthrow the Pakistani government through acts of terrorism against the armed forces and state members. The group operates primarily along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, comprising numerous smaller Islamist armed militant groups.Following the TTP's deadliest attack in December 2014, where 141 people, mostly children, were killed in a school, the Pakistani government launched the National Action Plan (NAP) to combat terrorism.In June 2024, Operation Azm-e-Istehkam was initiated to accelerate the NAP's implementation, involving airstrikes targeting militants and key insurgent leaders. However, these actions have been met with controversy, including claims of civilian casualties during strikes in Afghanistan’s Paktika province.Despite not holding direct territorial control, the TTP maintains significant influence in regions such as North and South Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The group leverages the mountainous terrain to facilitate movement and sustain operational mobility across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.","Terrorism has increased significantly in Pakistan since the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, with the number of attacks increasing fivefold since 2021.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission EC on Friday announced that it will resolve the longstanding issue of duplicate Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers within the next three months. In an official statement, the commission acknowledged the presence of multiple voters with the same EPIC numbers due to past discrepancies in the allotment process. This comes as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Congress raised the issue accusing the poll body of voters list manipulation to favor the BJP.In an official statement, the EC clarified that despite duplication, all electors linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can only vote at that designated location, ensuring no misuse of duplicate IDs. A sample verification of over 100 voters with identical EPIC numbers confirmed that they were genuine electors.""Irrespective of an EPIC number, an elector who is linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can cast his vote at that polling station only and nowhere else,"" the commission stated in its official release.The poll body said the issue arose due to incorrect series usage when the EPIC system was introduced in the year 2000. Since individual states and union territories managed electoral roll databases independently, errors in numbering went undetected at the national level.""It is a matter of electoral integrity. We have taken cognizance of the issue and are committed to ensuring a unique national EPIC number for all voters,"" said Anuj Chandak, director at the election commission.To rectify this, the commission said it will ensure a unique national EPIC number for all existing voters with duplicate numbers and for new electors in the future.Within minutes of the statement, Mamata's TMC reacted strongly alleging that the poll body's remark was in fact admission of the guilt.""Election Commission of India has finally admitted & accepted their guilt that duplicate EPIC numbers have been allotted to multiple people.

"Amid tariff-for-tariff response from Canada, China, Mexico, India takes a cautious route in trade war",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-tariff-for-tariff-response-from-canada-china-mexico-india-takes-a-cautious-route-in-trade-war/articleshow/118789431.cms,"Is Tesla eyeing no tariffs?

Amid trade war, will India emerge as the winner?

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday addressed the tariff imposition threat from US President Donald Trump from April 2. The MEA said the country intended to ""reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers "" with the intention to ""deepen India-US two-way trade"".Amid stern response from Canada, China and Mexica, who have imposed reciprocal tariffs on the States and have also filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation, India, in its cautious response said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""Trump has repeatedly said that India is a high-tariff nation and has expressed his intentions to pull off a tit-for-tat. ""And the big one will be on April 2, when reciprocal tariffs, so if India or China, or any of the countries that really...India is a very high tariff nation,"" he said on Friday.The MEA response comes in amid reports of Trump administration pushing for India’s consent to eliminate tariffs on automobile imports as part of a proposed bilateral trade deal. However, India remains cautious about bringing the duties down to zero immediately, though it is open to considering potential reductions, sources told Reuters.India imposes import duties of up to 110% on vehicles, a tariff Tesla CEO Elon Musk has criticized as one of the highest globally. The steep duties previously prompted the electric vehicle giant to shelve its plans to enter India's automobile market, the third-largest in the world.According to the think tank GTRI, emerging trade barriers present India with an opportunity to explore alternative sourcing options, particularly from Canada, where key commodities may now be more competitively priced.Canada plays a vital role in supplying essential imports that align with India's high-demand sectors. Earlier in 2024, the US imported substantial volumes of crude petroleum oil ($103 billion), refined petroleum oil ($12.9 billion), and fertilizers ($3.1 billion) from Canada, highlighting its strong export capacity.India’s own import needs are significant across key commodities, including crude oil ($140.3 billion), gold ($42.5 billion), copper ($2.8 billion), ethylene polymers ($2.2 billion), plastics ($1.3 billion), and fertilizers ($1.3 billion). With Canada already exporting copper cathodes ($1.3 billion), gold ($4.3 billion), ethylene polymers ($2.2 billion), and plastics ($2.1 billion), it could emerge as a key supplier for India's growing demand.It noted that escalating trade tensions could work in India's favor by boosting exports and attracting greater American investments. Srivastava highlighted that during his first term, Trump scrapped NAFTA in favor of the USMCA in 2018-19, arguing that the older agreement was outdated and harmful to American workers.","The MEA said the country intended to ""reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers"" with the intention to ""deepen India-US two-way trade"" The MEA response comes in amid reports of Trump administration pushing for India’s consent to eliminate tariffs on automobile imports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118789904,imgsize-1074727,width-400,resizemode-4/118789904.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam on Friday claimed that the state unit of Congress is going through a severe monetary crunch leading to nonpayment of rent and electricity bill of the party office. Former state president of the grand-old-party, who joined Eknath Shinde months before the assembly elections said that the incompetence of the state and the national leadership of the party led to this situation.""The Mumbai Congress is just one step away from being shut down. The current ineffective and incompetent leaders of the Mumbai Congress are to blame for this situation. The office, which operates in the premises of the Maharashtra government's PWD department, has not paid rent for several years, resulting in an outstanding bill of 18 lakh rupees. The electricity bill has reached nearly 5 lakh rupees, and the electricity supply company eventually removed the meter and disconnected the power,"" Nirupam said.""This situation reflects the lack of leadership and capability among the leaders. For about 9 to 10 months, Mumbai Congress employees have not received their salaries. The party is in a silent mode with no events being organized, mainly because the leadership has completely failed,"" he added.Further, taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, Nirupam said that leaders seldom meet party workers in the state and make a video for YouTube and leave. He blamed the Congress' alliance with Thackeray’s party, Shiv Sena (UBT), for its decline.""Rahul Gandhi yesterday came to Mumbai not as a Congress leader but as a YouTuber to make a video in Dharavi. While the Mumbai Congress' condition is getting worse, their leaders are more busy making videos,"" Nirupam said""This is the result of effective leadership. In 2019, when the alliance between Shiv Sena and Congress was forming, I advised against it, warning that the Congress party would gradually weaken. Five to six years later, this prediction is coming true, with only three MLAs remaining, who rely heavily on Muslim votes. Currently, in Mumbai, Uddhav Thackeray's party is the first choice because they appear strong. The Mumbai Congress and the Congress party have become subordinate to Uddhav Thackeray's party, and the incompetence of Delhi's leaders is evident. They have accepted that they cannot stand on their own and rely on allies, leading to the party's downfall. In the coming days, the Congress party in Maharashtra will face a similar fate as it did in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar,"" he added.This comes days after Harshwardhan Sapkal became the new chief of the party's Maharashtra unit. Sapkal takes over from Nana Patole, who had resigned following the party's poor performance in the Maharashtra Assembly elections.In the 2024 assembly elections, the Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP won 235 of the 288 seats, with BJP securing 132 alone. Shinde's Sena secured 57 seats and Ajit Pawar's NCP got 41 seats.On the other hand, it was a disappointing show by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) which was hoping for a grand comeback.

PUNE: Maharashtra's Economic Survey 2024-25 released Friday by deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar revealed an alarming decline in the number of beneficiaries and financial allocations across women's welfare schemes .Shakti Sadan facilities , which provide rehabilitation services to trafficking victims and vulnerable women, recorded a dramatic 57% drop in inmates - from 3,902 in 2023-24 to 1,672 in the current fiscal. Similarly, govt women hostels, shelter homes and protective homes collectively served 4,527 women in 2024-25, 32% down from 6,654 the previous year. The funding for these facilities was slashed by 36%, from Rs 15.31 crore to Rs 9.82 crore.The report states that women counselling centres experienced one of the biggest funding cuts, with allocations reduced by 69% (from Rs 4.20 crore to just Rs 1.32 crore), while their beneficiary count fell by 29% - from 25,734 to 18,322.Protection services for domestic violence victims saw a 17% decrease in no. of beneficiaries (from 11,722 to 9,704) & a 20% reduction in funding (from Rs 30.95 cr to Rs 24.63 cr).Sakhi Nivas accommodations for working women dipped 20%, from 5,483 to 4,411. Govt had recently announced plans for more such homes. Even Manodhairya Yojana, which showed 13% rise in beneficiaries - from 374 to 422 - saw its budget slashed 59%, from Rs 48 cr to Rs 19.48 crore.The survey provides no explanation for the substantial reductions across most programmes, raising serious questions about govt's commitment to women's welfare at a time when many advocacy groups report an increasing demand for such services.","Economic Survey 2024-25 released Friday by deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar revealed an alarming decline in the number of beneficiaries and financial allocations across women's welfare schemes.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Friday presented his record 16th budget, allocating Rs 4,535 crore for minority welfare programmes - an increase of 33% over Rs 3,409 crore last year - igniting a political firestorm with BJP branding it 'halal budget' and accusing Congress govt of practising ""appeasement"" politics.However, a big takeaway from the budget, with a total outlay of over Rs 4 lakh crore, was a massive increase in capital expenditure by 25%, compared to just 2% last year. Within capital expenditure, the two biggest increases are in public works (187%) and urban development (173%). The CM made a specific mention of Bengaluru, saying the yearly grant of Rs 3,000 crore being provided to the city will be enhanced to Rs 7,000 crore.The state economic survey released Friday estimates that Karnataka will grow by 7.4% this fiscal, higher than India's growth of 6.4%. Agriculture has made a sharp turnaround because of good rains. Services grew by 8.9%, higher than the 7.9% in the previous fiscal. This was led by IT-related services that grew by 11.1%, up from 10.2% in 2023-24. Despite the significantly higher capital allocations, Siddaramaiah has managed to keep the fiscal deficit at 2.95% of state GDP, just below the limit mandated under Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act.Among the schemes for minorities in the budget is the revival of 'Shaadi Bhagya' in a new avatar - which entails a dole of Rs 50,000 to each eligible couple from economically weaker sections - and introduction of reservation for Muslims in govt contracts up to Rs 2 crore. Waqf minister BZ Zameer Khan justified minorities welfare schemes, saying the allocation was ""minimal"".BJP spokesperson Anil Antony slammed the quota provided to minorities, saying it is unconstitutional and a huge deviation from the principles of Dr B R Ambedkar, who strongly opposed reservations based on religious grounds. ""Congress is now disregarding its past credentials and is evolving into a modern version of Jinnah's Muslim League,"" he added. Antony cited provisions in the budget, including Rs 6,000 per month for imams, Rs 150 crore for development of waqf properties, reinstatement of the scrapped 4% Muslim quota and 4% reservation in every govt contract worth up to Rs 2 crore.

Schools, teachers, parents and students have submitted their views individually and jointly.Proponents argue the initiative offers flexibility and a chance to improve scores. ""If a student underperforms in one exam, they can attempt the second to improve marks. Those failing specific subjects can reattempt or replace them,"" said a student from Podar International School, Bengaluru.However, critics, according to an official, warn the system may increase stress.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission, responding to concerns raised by some political parties regarding duplication in electors photo identity card (EPIC) numbers, announced on Friday that it would resolve the ""decades-old issue"" within the next three months.Sharing that a recent sample inquiry of over 100 electors had revealed those with duplicate EPIC numbers to be genuine electors, EC said it has, following detailed consultations with technical teams and the concerned chief electoral officers (CEOs), set a three-month timeframe to ensure the allotment of a unique national EPIC number to the existing electors having duplicate EPIC number and to all future electors.The three-month deadline - which will ensure that all duplicate entries are corrected before next assembly poll becomes due in Bihar - was fixed as the number of duplicate EPIC issued across the country was found to be small.EC reiterated that ""irrespective of an EPIC number, an elector linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can cast his vote at that polling station only ."" Given that EPIC is issued to a voter solely on the basis of his inclusion in the electoral roll and any changes can be made during the annual or pre-poll roll updation, followed by a two-stage appellate process, it revealed that just 90 appeals - including 89 filed with district election officer, the first appellate authority, and one with chief electoral officer (CEO), the second and final appellate authority - were filed across the country at the last annual summary roll revision taken up between Aug 7, 2024 and Jan 10, 2025.All the 90 appeals were filed in the sole state of Maharashtra. Though TMC has been at the forefront of flagging cases of duplicate EPIC numbers allotted to voters in West Bengal, the state did not see a single appeal being filed with the concerned DM/DEO or the state CEO.Explaining the reason behind the duplication , EC said that since the allotment of EPIC series in the year 2000 to the states/UTs, some electoral registration officers (EROs) did not use the correct series.

SURAT: Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused previous governments on Friday of neglecting the plight of the poor and using the ""Garibi Hatao"" slogan merely as a vote-grabbing gimmick without bringing any real change.On a two-day visit to Gujarat, Modi addressed a gathering in Surat's Limbayat area after participating in the Food Security Saturation Campaign. He began his tour by inaugurating and performing a ground-breaking ceremony for development and infrastructure projects worth Rs 2,587 crore in Silvassa town of the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, including a 450-bed NAMO Hospital.He took a swipe at the opposition, saying those who failed to win even a single seat in recent elections ""wouldn't even know how many zeroes were are in Rs 32 lakh crore (amount disbursed as loans under PM Mudra Yojana over the past decade).""Modi said the BJP-led NDA govt has lifted over 25 crore people out of poverty through various welfare schemes launched in the last 10 years. ""Jise kisi ne nahin puchha, use Modi ne puja hai (Those ignored by all, Modi has honoured them),"" he said, drawing applause.In a veiled dig at previous Congress govts, Modi said, ""For decades, people were fed up with hollow slogans of 'Garibi Hatao'. These slogans were revived whenever elections were near, but poverty only deepened.""Speaking on food security reforms, Modi said that 10 years ago, nearly five crore bogus ration cards were in circulation, allowing a nexus of looters to siphon off food meant for the poor. ""We cleaned up this mess, deleted those fake beneficiaries, and linked the entire system with Aadhaar cards to ensure that every grain reaches the rightful beneficiary,"" he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused previous governments of neglecting the plight of the poor.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday slammed Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin over his recent remark urging couples to have more children immediately to secure greater representation of the state in Parliament amid concerns over the upcoming delimitation exercise.Puri dismissed the idea that states with higher birth rates would automatically benefit from the process, asserting that India's governance system was mature and democratic.""It doesn't work like that; those states who produce more kids will benefit more during delimitation. We are not only the world's largest democracy but also the world's most mature governance system,"" Puri said while interacting with women journalists on the eve of International Women’s Day , according to the news agency ANI.His remarks come in response to Stalin’s remark on Monday, where he urged Tamil Nadu’s residents to reconsider family planning norms, citing concerns that the proposed delimitation exercise could reduce the state’s political representation.Speaking at a wedding ceremony, Stalin said, ""Before, we used to say don't give birth to a child immediately, no need to rush. But now, it is not necessary, we shouldn't say that also… because it is being said that the number of MPs would be decided based on population. The situation created is more population, more MPs. But we have achieved success by focusing on family planning. Now I won't say don't rush to give birth to a child; give birth to a child immediately.""Stalin’s comments were based on the growing political debate over the Centre’s plans for delimitation, a constitutional process that redraws parliamentary and assembly constituencies to reflect population changes.The exercise, governed by Articles 82 and 170 of the Indian Constitution , is intended to ensure fair representation, but Stalin and other southern leaders argue it could disproportionately favour states with higher population growth, reducing seats for states like Tamil Nadu, which have successfully controlled their population through family planning policies.He has also written to several chief ministers and former chief ministers, warning that delimitation could “diminish the influence of states like Tamil Nadu, which have successfully controlled their population, in shaping the nation's future.”In his letter, Stalin called the Centre’s plan “a blatant assault on federalism” and accused it of punishing well-governed states. He also criticised the Union government for failing to provide clarity on the methodology behind the proposed changes, questioning whether the calculation of seats would truly be fair. ""When the very foundation of our democracy is at stake, can we accept such vague assurances? When our states' future hangs in the balance, do we not deserve transparent dialogue?"" he asked.The delimitation exercise, originally anticipated after the 2031 Census, could now take place earlier due to delays in the 2021 Census.If implemented as per the next Census data, southern states fear they will lose parliamentary seats, while states with higher birth rates could gain more representation in the Lok Sabha .Stalin has proposed a Joint Action Committee with representatives from affected states to develop a collective strategy and ensure that delimitation does not penalise states that have successfully implemented population control .","Hardeep Singh Puri slams Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin over his recent remark urging couples to have more children immediately.

"Crowd management: Station directors to control ticket sale as per station capacity, available trains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crowd-management-station-directors-to-control-ticket-sale-as-per-station-capacity-available-trains/articleshow/118791820.cms,"Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Women's Day wishes, messages and quotes !



NEW DELHI: Now station directors will control the sale of tickets as per station capacity and available trains, a high-level meeting chaired by railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw decided on Friday. Besides this, there will be permanent waiting areas outside 60 busy stations and wider foot-over bridges, moves that will help in better crowd management .Station directors, who are the overall in-charge of their stations, will be financially empowered to take on-the-spot decisions to improve facilities.The decisions come barely weeks after a stampede at the New Delhi station claimed 18 lives. Though a probe into the incident is underway, one of the probable reasons was the sale of a high number of tickets from its counters.In an official statement, the railway ministry said the high-level committee held detailed deliberations on crowd control at stations, particularly at 60 locations where footfall is exceptionally high during certain festive periods. It added that permanent outside waiting areas will be created at these stations which “periodically face heavy crowd”. Pilot projects have been started at New Delhi, Anand Vihar, Varanasi, Ayodhya and Patna stations.“With this arrangement in place, sudden crowding will be contained within the waiting area. Passengers will be allowed to go to platforms only when trains arrive there. This will decongest stations,” a ministry spokesperson said.As per the decisions, there will be complete access control at these 60 stations. While passengers with confirmed tickets will be given direct access to platforms, those without a ticket or with a waiting list ticket will have to be in the waiting area. All unauthorised entry points will also be sealed.Another major decision was to construct wider foot-over bridges (FOB). Two new designs — for 12-metre-wide (40 feet) and six-metre-wide (20 feet) standard FOBs — have been developed. These wide bridges with ramps were effective in crowd management during the Maha Kumbh.Moreover, war rooms will be developed at large stations, and officers of all departments will work in the room if there is a surge in people at the stations. The ministry has also decided to use communication equipment such as walkie-talkies, announcement systems, and calling systems at stations that face crowding. “A newly designed ID card for staffers and service persons, a new uniform that will make staffers easily identifiable in a crisis situation, and appointment of a senior officer as station director at major stations were the other measures that would be implemented,” the ministry said.","Station directors will be financially empowered to take on-the-spot decisions to improve facilities. The decisions come barely weeks after a stampede at the New Delhi station claimed 18 lives. Pilot projects have been started at New Delhi, Anand Vihar, Varanasi, Ayodhya and Patna stations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118791816,imgsize-924948,width-400,resizemode-4/118791816.jpg"

In the annals of political faux pas, Mitt Romney’s infamous ‘47%’ comment or Hillary Clinton branding Trump supporters as ‘deplorables’ stand out as classic cases of plain speaking gone horribly wrong—instances where opponents easily cast them as out-of-touch elitists. But perhaps no self-goal in Indian politics has been as monumental as Mani Shankar Aiyar ’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Modi may well have ascended to the Prime Ministership without that gaffe, but Aiyar ’s ill-timed comment ensured that the crumbling edifice of UPA-2 was buried six feet under. Narendra Modi, who had always sought to play on the theme of the entitled versus the commoner, lapped up the ‘chaiwala’ moniker like a fish to water.If that was not enough, Aiyar repeated history just a few years later, once again helping PM Modi secure his home turf. In 2017, as the BJP grappled with anti-incumbency, the Patel agitation, and Dalit uprisings in Gujarat, Aiyar’s ‘neech aadmi’ remark gifted Modi the perfect opportunity to reframe the election as a question of Gujarati(pride). The result? A last-minute consolidation of core voters, allowing the BJP to scrape through in a tough contest. A red-faced Congress suspended Aiyar, but the damage was already done.While that may have been the formal break between Aiyar and the Congress, the former Union minister has continued to embarrass the party. The latest episode? A backhanded compliment to Rajiv Gandhi, where Aiyar, in his characteristic bluntness, detailed how the former Prime Minister had flunked at Cambridge and later at Imperial College, London. It provided fresh ammunition to the BJP, all too keen to puncture the image of the technocratic PM, who has been widely hailed for bringing the first wave of the IT revolution to the country.Furious Congress leaders wasted no time in denouncing Aiyar—Maharashtra’s Nana Patole labelled him “mentally unstable,” Harish Khare called him “frustrated,” and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot dismissed him as(crazy).Whether Aiyar is crazy or simply unfiltered remains up for debate. What is clear, however, is his unwavering desire for validation from the Gandhis. Despite the controversy, he expressed hope that Rahul Gandhi would take notice of him. Ironically, it was Rahul himself who, during an AICC session in 2014, praised Aiyar’s role in solidifying the Panchayati Raj system. In 2004, Rahul had apparently told Aiyar's wife that he would always listen to the ex-bureaucrat because his father trusted Mani. Yet, Aiyar himself admits that in all these years, he has had only one meaningful conversation with Rahul and just two with Priyanka. He claims he has long been ready to mentor Rahul, but that the Congress leader seems averse to taking his advice, likely due to his age. He even goes on to say that Rahul Gandhi probably despises him, even though Aiyar maintains that his relationship with the Gandhis remains intact!Aiyar’s connection with the Gandhis, however, is indisputable. He was one of Rajiv Gandhi’s closest aides, serving as his joint secretary, and has extensively chronicled his legacy. Even last year, he published a book arguing that Rajiv Gandhi remains one of India’s most misunderstood Prime Ministers. Aiyar’s loyalty to Rajiv appears unquestionable, making it unlikely that he intended to damage his legacy. Instead, his real problem is that he is a relic of a bygone political era—one in which intellectual acerbity was tolerated, if not encouraged.In today’s-obsessed generation with decreasing attention spans, where media organisations are fishing for viral outrage, Aiyar's verbose, long-winded explanations of his ideals leave too many loose ends. Even though thehas shifted with the BJP being in power for over a decade, Aiyar has held onto his pacifist ideals and commitment to secularism. Thus, the man who embarked on aduring the Ayodhya movement and accused then-PM Narasimha Rao of parroting the BJP's line on Hinduism faced brutal public pushback when he said Modi must be removed to improve Indo-Pak relations. Similarly, his attempt to explain the reason behind theattack also led to controversy. Perhaps a simple condemnation without qualifiers would have been easier, but then, it wouldn’t have been Mani Aiyar.In today’s world, political correctness reigns supreme. Aiyar’s brand of public discourse—witty yet sharp, opinionated yet unfiltered—has long since expired. His comments, mocking Hansraj College with his elitepedigree, his dyed-in-the-wool liberal stance regarding what he believed were ‘alleged’ Chinese incursions, his opposition to nuclear weapons, and his resistance to liberalisation, are now seen as political liabilities rather than intellectual contributions.Even as sports minister, he went against the tide, opposing India’s hosting of the Commonwealth Games, describing them as a colossal waste of money.It is a testament to his political gumption that he managed to win three elections from Mayiladuthurai (1991, 1999, and 2004). It is no mean feat for a person born in Lahore, schooled at Doon and Welham’s, later attending St. Stephen’s and Cambridge, to also find acceptance with the electorate despite his anglicised persona. In 2010, he made it to the Rajya Sabha, but his relationship with the Congress leadership gradually soured, leaving him out in the cold.In another political system—perhaps in the US—Aiyar, a self-proclaimed 'secular fundamentalist,' might have found space as India’s equivalent of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a left-liberal figure leading an ideological movement. But in India, where political pragmatism trumps ideological rigidity, he stuck out like a sore thumb. A more strategic Congress leadership could have harnessed Aiyar’s intellect and commitment to rural empowerment to craft an alternative policy vision, challenging the ruling government’s policies. As an IFS officer, he served in Pakistan and was the first consul general of India in Karachi. His insights could have been leveraged to shape opposition's foreign policy towards India's neighbourhood. Instead, he has been relegated to a running meme—a political grenade who periodically explodes, causing maximum collateral damage to his own party.In many ways, his trajectory mirrors that of Sam Pitroda , another Congress veteran known for his verbal misadventures. But unlike Pitroda, who still enjoys official roles in the Congress, Aiyar remains an outsider, waiting for his next moment of unfiltered candour.Perhaps the world is simply not ready for another Mani Shankar Aiyar. Or perhaps, just maybe, Aiyar has outlived his political relevance—a man out of sync with his time, clinging to an era that no longer exists. In some ways, the Congress, despite all its grandstanding about being a melting pot of ideas, failed to accommodate Aiyar. Another man who does not shy away from speaking his own mind—a diplomat-turned-politician who runs his own successful campaign—Shashi Tharoor, may end up sharing Aiyar’s fate if he does not play by the rules.","Mani Shankar Aiyar’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi helped the BJP secure his home turf.

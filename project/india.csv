'Will call PM Modi': Brazil's Lula snubs Trump amid tariff row; rejects offer to reach out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-call-pm-modi-brazils-lula-snubs-trump-amid-tariff-row-rejects-offer-to-reach-out/articleshow/123132286.cms,"Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has said he will confront Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs head-on, while reaffirming Brazil’s global standing by announcing plans to personally contact world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ““I will call him, I will call Xi Jinping, I will call Prime Minister Modi. I just won’t call Putin, because Putin can’t travel right now,” Lula said during a public event in Brasília, according to TRT Global. “I will call Trump to invite him to come to the COP because I want to know what he thinks about the climate issue. I will have the courtesy to call.”Despite tensions between Brasília and Washington, Lula has made it clear that his administration would use every available avenue – including the World Trade Organization – to challenge Trump’s new 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. “In 2025, we will resort to all possible measures, starting with the WTO, to defend our interests,” he said.Trump’s decision, signed into effect last week, comes amid his vocal defence of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who faces prosecution for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election. Lula has rejected any suggestion that the legal proceedings against Bolsonaro are up for negotiation.“Maybe he doesn't know that here in Brazil, the judiciary is independent,” Lula told The New York Times. “The former president is being tried with a full right to a defence. ”Lula also said Trump's justification for the tariffs, supposedly to protect Bolsonaro and punish judicial overreach, was an attack on Brazil’s sovereignty. “There’s no reason to be afraid,” Lula said in the Times interview. “But at no point will Brazil negotiate as if it were a small country up against a big country.”Brazil’s economy appears better equipped than most to absorb the blow, with Reuters noting that exemptions for key exports like aircraft and orange juice mean the tariffs would affect just under 36% of Brazilian exports to the US by value. Lula’s government is also preparing aid for sectors hit hardest, and trade with China and BRICS nations now makes up a far greater share of Brazil’s exports.Still, Lula warned of the political costs of Trump’s unilateral move. “Neither the American people nor the Brazilian people deserve this,” he said. “We are going to move from a 201-year-old diplomatic relationship of win-win to a political relationship of lose-lose.”","Lula says he will personally contact world leaders, including Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: National Security Advisor Ajit Doval reached Moscow on Tuesday to hold talks on strategic partnership, defence, and security cooperation between India and Russia, Russian news agency TASS reported.His visit comes as the Trump-led US administration continues to issue trade threats to countries closely aligned with Russia, including India.This is a scheduled visit with discussions focused on defence cooperation between the two nations. ""The current escalation of the geopolitical situation will also be discussed. Apart from that the topics will include such pressing matters as supplies of Russian oil [to India],"" the source told TASS.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on India as a “penalty.” He also said India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together,” prompting India to reiterate that it remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy.Trump further stated that India has ""always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia,"" and is ""Russia’s largest buyer of energy, along with China.""On Monday, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) described criticism from the US and EU over India’s imports of Russian oil as “unjustified,” pointing out that Western countries had previously supported such trade to stabilise global energy markets and still continue purchasing goods and services from Russia.“India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the MEA said, noting that the US and EU have continued trade with Russia, including in energy and key commodities, despite publicly opposing the Ukraine conflict.The MEA also pointed to “double standards,” highlighting that EU trade with Russia in 2024 was significantly higher than India’s.","National Security Advisor Ajit Doval reached Moscow on Tuesday to hold talks on strategic partnership, defence, and security cooperation.

Officials said even the number of all delayed projects has been reduced by around 16% in first four months of the current financial year due to stricter and regular monitoring.""The target is to reduce the number of delayed projects significantly as these cause cost escalation and deprive people of the desired benefit,"" said an official.TOI has learnt that there is a monthly meeting of all highway building agencies to expedite project execution.Among the major factors impacting the projects, land acquisition is the leading one (28% of cases), followed by issues relating to contractors (19%) and forest clearances (13%). Officials said there is special thrust on completing projects where small works are pending to reduce overall number of delayed projects significantly.Data show while total number of delayed NH projects stood at 690 in April 2024, it went down to 686 in April 2025 and to around 580 by July-end. Over 50% of projects are delayed by up to six months, while more than one-third are delayed by 1-3 years.Officials said the factors delaying project execution also impact new works being bid out.

As per the new norm, bids cannot be opened for a project unless the highway building agency has at least 80% of the required land in its possession.","Delay in land acquisition, issues relating to contractors and pending statutory clearances have been identified as main reasons that have held up these projects.

Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south. In a sharp rebuke, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the move reflected Washington’s inability to cope with a shifting global order.""Sanctions and restrictions have unfortunately become a defining feature of the current historical period,"" Zakharova said in response to a media query on the US decision to tighten tariffs against countries in the Global South.""Unable to accept the erosion of its dominance in an emerging multipolar international order, Washington continues to pursue a neocolonial agenda, employing politically motivated economic pressure against those who choose an independent course on the international stage.""Zakharova asserted that no sanctions or tariff wars would stop the evolution of the international system. ""Nonetheless, we firmly believe that no tariff wars or sanctions can halt the natural course of history. We are supported by a vast number of partners, like-minded states, and allies, particularly among the countries of the Global South and, above all, within Brics, who share this perspective,"" she said.Zakharova accused the United States of violating the very principles of free trade it once championed, pointing to what she called ""politically driven protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariff barriers.""She named Brazil—Russia’s strategic partner in Latin America—as one of the main victims of such policies, and said these actions amount to interference in other countries' internal affairs and pose a broader threat to global economic stability.""We stand ready to deepen cooperation with them to resist unlawful unilateral sanctions and to help shape a genuinely multipolar, just, and equitable international order,” Zakharova said.Her remarks came in response to Trump’s statement on Truth Social, where he accused India of profiting from reselling Russian oil and declared that the US would “substantially raise the tariff paid by India.”India has pushed back strongly, calling the criticism ""unjustified and unreasonable."" The Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi said that India’s imports are driven by national interest and energy security, and pointed to ongoing US and EU trade with Russia in energy and other sectors.","Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south.

Connor McDavid Trade Bombshell to the Bruins: NHL insiders say it could guarantee a Stanley Cup win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavid-trade-bombshell-to-the-bruins-nhl-insiders-say-it-could-guarantee-a-stanley-cup-win/articleshow/123077767.cms,"Insiders call Connor McDavid a “Stanley Cup cheat code” (Imagn Images)

Bruins insiders make bold Stanley Cup prediction if Connor McDavid lands in Boston

Should Bruins TRADE Pavel Zacha? | Bruins Beat

Connor McDavid’s uncertain future has the entire NHL holding its breath

As NHL free agency and trade talks ramp up, one name continues to dominate every rumor mill—Connor McDavid. With his contract situation still unresolved in Edmonton, speculation is heating up across the league. Among the teams linked to the Oilers captain, the Boston Bruins have now entered the conversation—and some local media believe a potential McDavid deal could change everything.During the August 1 episode of Bruins Beat, reporters Evan Marinofsky and Conor Ryan briefly entertained the fantasy of Connor McDavid wearing a black and gold jersey. Marinofsky tossed out the question, “What if McDavid ended up with the Bruins?” Ryan’s response was immediate and emphatic: “I mean, they’d win a cup. They would, yeah.”That may sound like a stretch—but Ryan doubled down. Calling McDavid “the easiest cheat code,” he drew a parallel to another generational athlete: “I think McDavid is so dominant now that he’s kind of like LeBron during his prime, right? Where, like just him alone, you’re going to be in the third round if not in the final.”Ryan also acknowledged the financial weight that a McDavid contract would carry—likely in the ballpark of $15.5 to $16 million per year, a new NHL record.Yet he argued that even at that cost, McDavid would be worth every penny.After another playoff letdown for the Oilers in June, Connor McDavid’s long-term commitment to Edmonton has come under question. The 2024 Conn Smythe winner has recorded at least 90 points in all nine of his NHL seasons—yet remains without a Stanley Cup. His contract talks have reportedly stalled, and the league is taking notice.Connor McDavid made his priorities clear in a recent interview: “Winning is the most important thing… If I feel there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem.” That statement leaves the door open for other franchises—like the Bruins—to make their pitch. Whether Boston is a serious contender or just a fan-fueled fantasy, one thing is certain: until McDavid re-signs, the NHL rumor machine won’t slow down.Also Read: Connor McDavid to the Maple Leafs? Rumors swirl as NHL insider insists it’s Toronto or nowhere The Oilers are expected to have $45 million in open contract space next offseason, so there won't be much excuse for not giving McDavid something between $16-20 million per year.Connor McDavid is one of only two players – after fellow Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky in 1982 – to unanimously win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player.","Bruins Beat hosts Evan Marinofsky and Conor Ryan speculate about Connor McDavid.

"Uttarkashi mayhem: In Dharali, the calendar is written in floods; here, clock ticks to the roar of Kheer Gad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uttarakhand-flash-flood-dharali-mountain-village-that-marks-calendar-by-number-of-times-it-sinks-river-arrives-unannounced-and-dragging-centuries-of-stone/articleshow/123130541.cms,"



DEHRADUN: In Dharali, disaster isn't the exception. It's the architecture. And each time the Kheer Gad river roars to life, villagers climb to the roof and wait - not for rescue, but to see what's left standing when the river leaves.The river doesn't knock before entering the hamlet near Gangotri on the old Indo-Tibetan Silk route. It doesn't announce itself with thunder or rain, just arrives - sudden, swollen, dragging centuries of stone behind it.In this village tucked into a crease of Uttarkashi, flood isn't a headline. It's a season in the calendar. Locals mark the years not by festivals or elections, but by the floods: the one in 2010 that soaked the school walls, the one in 2012 that swallowed a shop, another in 2018 that buried apple orchards under boulders taller than men. The Kheer Gad, a seemingly harmless trickle for most of the year, turns violent when cloudbursts hit Srikanth Parvat. And when it does, it doesn't rise - it lunges.Despite the frequency and intensity of these disasters, Dharali had been extraordinarily fortunate so far: in all recorded incidents between 2010 and 2018, no lives were lost. The river took homes, orchards, roads, and livelihoods - but never a person.Dharali, with a population just over 500, sits along the Char Dham yatra route, 20km before the Gangotri shrine.In summer, its guesthouses and dhabas are packed with pilgrims and tourists, more than doubling the population; by mid-July, the rains begin and the village watches the stream. The 2018 flood - the worst before Tuesday's - came in the early hours, leaving behind silence and the smell of wet iron. Nearly two dozen homes and hotels were reduced to rubble, two hectares of apple orchards disappeared under muck, and the road to the shrine was choked with silt and broken tin roofs.Lokendra Bisht, an Uttarkashi resident, remembers 2018 clearly. ""We dug out furniture from mud two days later,"" he told TOI. ""That time, no one died. But the loss - of homes, of work - it stayed with us longer than the flood."" He remembered 2012 the same way: quieter, but damaging. The Kheer Gad had risen again, this time pushing through homes and shops without warning.The pattern has grown hard to ignore. Over those years, the Kheer Gad behaved less like a stream and more like a fuse - short, volatile, and primed to detonate without warning. And each year, the debris has crept closer to the village centre. The stream begins on Srikanth Parvat and empties into the Bhagirathi river just downstream. The short run belies its power. When it floods, Dharali becomes a basin.Before the recent floods etched Dharali into disaster maps, destruction had already marked the valleys around it. In 1978, a dam breach near Dabrani, roughly 35km downstream, sent a rush of water through villages along the Bhagirathi. In 1984, a cloudburst over the Gyansu nala - just 15km from Dharali - triggered a flood that turned fields into silt flats overnight. And in 2003, a section of Varunavat mountain peeled off above Uttarkashi town, 40km away, burying homes and snapping roads. Dharali was spared each time, but the events traced a ring around it - as if the landscape had been circling the village, waiting.And the pushing hasn't stopped. A 2013 report by the Uttarakhand Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre classified Dharali and nearby villages like Sukhi and Jhala as high-risk zones. The warnings were clear, but so were the incentives to ignore them. Hotels continued to rise on riverbeds. Pilgrim traffic swelled. Roads were widened. Slopes were cut.Experts who have studied the region's topography have dire warnings. With glacial melt accelerating and rainfall patterns shifting, cloudbursts are now more frequent, and the consequences more immediate. ""People think the mountain breaks in one night,"" a geologist from the Wadia Institute once said. ""But in reality, it's been breaking slowly for years.""","Dharali is a hamlet near Gangotri on the old Indo-Tibetan Silk route. Locals mark the years not by festivals or elections, but by the floods. The Kheer Gad, a seemingly harmless trickle for most of the year, turns violent when cloudbursts hit Srikanth Parvat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123130779,imgsize-45354,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/123130779.jpg"

'Kaan Khol Ke Sun Lo...': Mamata Threatens EC, BJP Over Bengali Harassment, Voter Roll ‘Conspiracy’

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday suspended four officials posted in West Bengal for allegedly sharing login credentials of their elector roll (ER) database with ""unauthorised persons"".Taking note of the grave lapses committed by the officers, the poll body said that action came after Bengal's chief electoral officer informed the ECI ""about the wrongful addition of names in the electoral rolls by the four officers"" in Baruipur Purba.The four officials suspended were posted in the capacity of the electoral registration officer (ERO) and assistant electoral registration officer (AERO), who are responsible for the preparation, revision and correction of the electoral rolls.The Election Commission said that suitable disciplinary proceedings will be initiated against Debottam Dutta Choudhury (ERO), Tathagata Mondal (AERO), Biplab Sarkar (ERO) and Sudipta Das (AERO), adding that FIRs will be lodged against them ""for their actions, which potentially amount to criminal misconduct"".The poll body said that FIR will also be lodged against the casual data entry operator Surojit Halder.A few days ago, the ECI gave the nod to FIRs against two electoral registration officers (EROs) in Bengal for anomalies in the voters' list.The two officers shared their passwords with data entry operators, which allowed the latter to feed 102 bogus voters' data into the EC portal.TOI reported that the EROs of Nandakumar in East Midnapore and Rajarhat-Gopalpur in North 24 Parganas were questioned by EC and were under scrutiny for failing to give a satisfactory reply to the commission.The office of the chief electoral officer sent a report to the EC, indicating that names of non-existent voters were entered directly by data entry operators by using the passwords of the two EROs. The two EROs have admitted to sharing the passwords.In this case, it was found that even booth level officers (BLOs) were not sent to verify the names. The lack of physical verification allowed the electoral rolls to be inflated with bogus voters, sources said. The district electoral officers were then asked to probe the malpractices.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday suspended four officials posted in West Bengal.

'Don't burn relations with strong ally': Nikki Haley slams Trump for threatening India ties over Russian oil; accuses US of giving China 'pass',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/burn-relations-with-strong-ally-nikki-haley-slams-trump-for-threatening-india-ties-over-russian-oil-accuses-us-of-giving-china-pass/articleshow/123123648.cms,"Indian-American Republican leader and former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley

Indian-American Republican leader Nikki Haley criticised President Donald Trump for threatening to increase tariffs on Russian oil imports from India, warning that such a move could damage ties with a key American ally while giving China leniency.In a post on X on Tuesday, Haley took aim at what she sees as an uneven approach from the Trump administration. “India should not be buying oil from Russia. But China, an adversary and the number one buyer of Russian and Iranian oil, got a 90-day tariff pause,” she wrote.“Don’t give China a pass and burn a relationship with a strong ally like India,"" she added.Her remarks came after Trump, in a press briefing Tuesday, threatened to “very substantially” increase tariffs on Indian goods, following the 25% duty imposed just last week. He also rejected India’s reported offer of zero tariffs on American goods, saying, “That’s not good enough, because of what they’re doing with oil.”The White House has pointed to the growing US trade deficit with India as justification for the move, accusing New Delhi of maintaining high tariffs on American goods and limiting market access. India’s continued imports of Russian crude and military hardware have also drawn scrutiny.India is now the largest seaborne buyer of Russian crude oil, importing nearly 1.75 million barrels per day in the first half of 2025, up 1% from the same period last year.While US initially welcomed India's role in helping stabilise global oil supplies, Trump now claims those purchases are helping finance President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.India, however, has remained firm in its stance. India’s ministry of commerce and industry responded to Trump’s announcement by reaffirming that national interest remains the country’s top priority.“The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,” the ministry said in a statement.New Delhi has also made it clear that its agriculture and dairy sectors remain off the table in any trade negotiations — a position it has consistently maintained in all prior trade agreements.","Indian-American Republican leader Nikki Haley criticised President Donald Trump for threatening to increase tariffs on Russian oil imports from India.

NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) will not extend invitations to the embassies of Pakistan, Turkey and Bangladesh for its 100th anniversary celebrations, though it is reaching out to other diplomatic missions it has been in touch with. The list of invitees also includes representatives of minority communities, sports and cultural icons, thought leaders, and entrepreneurs from emerging fields such as Indian knowledge systems and start-ups.The highlight of the centenary year will be a three-day dialogue in Delhi from August 26, led by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, focusing on the Sangh’s century-long journey, its role in nation-building and its vision for “new horizons.”Bhagwat’s Delhi address will be part of a series of four major events in the run-up to the Vijayadashami centenary on October 2. Similar dialogues are scheduled in Bengaluru in November, Kolkata thereafter, and Mumbai. Each will feature two days of lectures by Bhagwat and a third day devoted to a pre-submitted question-and-answer session. The discussions will cover the Sangh’s experiences over the past century, its core ideas, and its priorities for the coming decades.The Delhi programme will begin at 5.30 pm each day and will also delve into the “Panch Parivartan” (Five Transformations) agenda of the centenary year. Bhagwat is expected to touch on issues such as India shaping its future on indigenous strengths rather than colonial-era benchmarks, unexplored capacities in various fields, and the country’s evolving global role.According to RSS Prachar Pramukh Sunil Ambekar, the invitation list spans around 17 main categories and 138 sub-categories, including social, economic, religious, spiritual, sports, arts, media and intellectual leaders. “Our aim is that the entire country should move forward together on its development journey. We want dialogue with all sections of society,” he said.Ambekar added that while outreach to some foreign missions is underway, certain countries will be excluded. “We are in contact with many embassies, but in the current context Pakistan, will not be invited,” he said. According to RSS sources countries like Bangladesh and Turkey are also not going to be invited. The outreach also covers young innovators in technology, language promotion and entrepreneurship.He said over 1,000 pramukh nagarik goshtis (eminent citizen meetings) will be held across districts in addition to the flagship city events. “Through these programmes we are trying to connect people from all walks of life, and we hope all types of people will participate in these discussions,” Ambekar added.","The highlight of the centenary year will be a three-day dialogue in Delhi from August 26.

But all four corporations decided to go ahead with the protest.The strike is being held over demands including the release of 38 months of unpaid salaries, implementation of wage revision from January 1, 2024, opposition to privatisation, end to worker harassment, and a demand that company drivers be assigned to electric buses as well.Talks between the government and transport unions had failed before the strike.The high court had issued an interim stay on the strike on Monday, saying that a complete halt of public transport would cause hardship to the public. However, the unions have decided to go ahead with their protest.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah had urged the workers to cancel the strike. However, union leaders said the government’s offer to clear only two years of arrears was not acceptable and that there was no clear assurance on salary revision.KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation president H V Anantha Subbarao said, as quoted by PTI, ""We are not satisfied.

Walk into your embassy in person. Don’t just email or call. Explain everything clearly.” He added, “Ask for an emergency certificate. If your flight is close, they can issue one in hours.”Reflecting on the situation, he noted, “I’ve never had my passport stolen before. But now I’ve seen firsthand how quickly things can flip. And also, how supportive the Indian embassy and the Web3 community around me can be in tough times.”He concluded the post by stating that he is now safe at home and shared the story in the hope that it helps others navigate a similar situation.","Ayush Panchmiya lost his passport, US visa, credit cards, and cash while in Barcelona, Spain.

NEW DELHI: Security forces have recovered a cache of arms and explosives including Chinese grenades and an IED manual from a stony cave in the Kalaroos area of Kupwara district following a joint three-day operation, officials said on Monday.The Border Security Force, Indian Army, and Jammu and Kashmir Police carried out the operation between August 2 and 4. According to a statement from BSF Kashmir, “In a 3-day joint search operation in Kalaroos, Kupwara (J&K), BSF, Army and police uncovered a stony cave on 04 Aug 2025. 12 Chinese grenades, Chinese pistol with ammunition, Kenwood radio set, Urdu IED manual and fire sticks recovered from the hideout and foiled the nefarious plan of the terrorist. ”As per intelligence inputs, 'terrorists were directed by their Pakistani handlers to use these to target state police and other security forces in the coming days'.The joint forces said the recovery points to cross-border terror support and efforts to revive militant activity in North Kashmir.In South Kashmir, operations are also underway in the Akhal Devsar area of Kulgam district for the fourth consecutive day.One terrorist has been killed so far in a firefight. On Saturday, security forces engaged in an overnight encounter with militants in the Akhal area. The Indian Army’s Chinar Corps posted on X: “OP AKHAL, Kulgam.

India mulls new pilot training system as air traffic booms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-mulls-new-pilot-training-system-as-air-traffic-booms/articleshow/123128116.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is considering revamping pilot training by gradually moving away from the current system, where a student has to first earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL) and then do type rating separately for a specific aircraft, to a unified ""multi-crew pilot licence"" (MPL) system.Directorate General of Civil Aviation will hold a meeting with stakeholders on the issue on Wednesday. If approved, both systems will co-exist, and operators will have the flexibility to choose what best meets their requirements of safety and operational efficiency.This is the second big change India is contemplating in this field, after proposing to make students who from Class 12 arts and commerce streams eligible to pursue CPL - a field reserved for science students with physics and maths in 12th since mid-1990s. As the fastest growing aviation market globally, govt is clearly keen to take steps to meet Indian carriers' requirement for pilots in coming years.At the moment, cadet pilots have to first do CPL that involves, among other things, flying training aircraft for 200 hours. They then need to do simulator-based type rating for specific aircraft like Airbus A320 or Boeing 737.MPL will require them to fly a small training plane for about 70 hours.Then they will do simulator training for 140 to 160 hours. Subsequently, airlines will induct them as trainees on that type of aircraft. Approved by International Civil Aviation Organisation, MPL has been adopted by over 50 airlines globally, like Lufthansa, Etihad, flyDubai and Singapore Airlines.""We will evaluate both the systems and take a considered view on what is best in terms of ensuring high training standards and meeting airline requirements. MPL was considered by us in the past too. There has again been a request to consider the same and that is being done,"" said senior govt officials. If approved, MPL will be introduced gradually over 2-3 years and CPL will continue to exist for non-airline students.An integrated programme, MPL ""lays emphasis on developing key competencies that are essential to safely operate modern commercial aircraft. It can be tailored to specific aircraft type and the operational philosophy of airlines which will ensure a steady stream of pilots"", said a senior pilot.""MPL should have been adopted several years ago to meet India's growing aviation needs... MPL aligns better with modern airline operational realities than the current CPL system which is outdated for a fast-developing aviation sector. India needs 2,000-plus new pilots annually over the next decade,"" said another captain.Opposing MPL, a senior captain said: ""Our regulatory system lacks necessary robustness to adequately oversee and enforce MPL program standards consistently.""","India is considering revamping pilot training by gradually moving away from the current system. A student has to first earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL) and then do type rating separately for a specific aircraft. If approved, both systems will co-exist, and operators will have the flexibility to choose what best meets their requirements.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123128139,imgsize-436350,width-400,resizemode-4/123128139.jpg"

It also directed that an FIR be filed against them for ""criminal misconduct"".In a letter sent to the West Bengal chief secretary on Tuesday, the poll panel said it has ""taken serious note of the grave lapses and has decided the officers shall be placed under suspension for their failure in supervising the election related work... and suitable disciplinary proceedings initiated against them without any delay"".The action against West Bengal civil service officers and EROs of Baruipur Purba AC and Moyna AC, Debottam Dutta Choudhury and Biplab Sarkar, respectively, and assistant EROs Tathagat Mondal and Sudipta Das, came after the state chief electoral officer (CEO) reported that they had been disposing of applications for inclusion in the electoral roll without proper verification or allowing a window for claims and objections. They also violated the policy of data security by sharing their login credentials for the electoral roll database with unauthorised persons.

"Central green nod not needed for constructions of 20,000-150,000 sqm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/central-green-nod-not-needed-for-constructions-of-20000-150000-sqm/articleshow/123127694.cms,"Development activities can't be stalled altogether, says SC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Tuesday reactivated stalled construction activities related to housing, industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels with covered area between 20,000 and 1,50,000 square metres by ruling that these can go ahead with the state environmental authority's nod, exempting them from the rigours of securing environmental clearance from the Centre.On Feb 24, SC had ex parte stayed the Jan 29 central notification on environmental clearance norms for building and construction projects on a plea by NGO Vanashakti, which alleged that dilutions in norms would damage nature and forests. This had stalled thousands of projects - educational, industrial and national - across the country.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran upheld the environment ministry's notification and said no central environmental nod would be required for these categories of constructions.SC quoted additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who said the Centre did not have wherewithal to carry out environment scrutiny of projects in states.However, the bench struck down total exemption from environmental scrutiny to industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels in the Jan 29 notification of the environment and forest ministry. Supreme Court said these could be constructed after clearance from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).Importantly, the bench resolved an ambiguity over which authority - State or Centre - should grant clearance to projects located in eco-sensitive areas, wildlife protected areas, critically and severely polluted areas (CPA/SPA) and those near inter-state boundaries. SC upheld the notification granting the power to the state.Appearing for Godrej's real estate arm, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the regime exempting such projects from central nod has been in place since 2006 and that the Jan 29 notification was introducing no new concept.He was supported by senior advocate Atmaram Nadkarni, who appeared for CREDAI, the apex body of private real estate developers.CJI Gavai and Justice Chandran said, ""No country can progress without development. Duty to protect the environment and ecology is paramount, but development activities cannot be stalled altogether.""Bhati informed the bench that because of the ex parte stay granted by the SC bench led by Justice A S Oka on Feb 24, thousands of building construction projects across the country in the educational and industrial sector have been stalled and applications seeking clearance are piling up before SEIAA, with Maharashtra alone having more than 700 such pending applications.When the bench asked NGO Vanashakti's counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan why SEIAA be not permitted to give clearance to such projects, the counsel said it would dilute the stringent environment protection regime for constructing huge projects with covered areas of nearly 2 lakh to 15 lakh square feet. It should be subjected to environmental clearance from the Centre, he further said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that environmental impact assessment authorities at the central and state levels have similar expertise and pointed out the qualifications of members comprising the two authorities.","Construction activities related to housing, industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels with covered area between 20,000 and 1,50,000 square metres can go ahead with state environmental authority's nod.

NEW DELHI: Enraged by what it termed ""one of the worst and most erroneous orders we have come across"", Supreme Court has pulled up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case. Questioning Kumar's competence in deciding criminal cases, SC, in an unprecedented order, directed he shouldn't be given any criminal case for adjudication till he retires, and must be made to sit with a seasoned judge of the HC in a division bench.""The judge has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what's wrong with judiciary at the level of HC,"" Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said.SC said at times ""we are left wondering whether such orders are passed on some extraneous considerations or it is sheer ignorance of law. Whatever it be, passing of such absurd and erroneous orders is unpardonable"". It said the erroneous order was not an exception as Justice Kumar had passed similarly unpardonable ones over a period of time, which left them with no option but to take the extreme step.The case pertains to sale of goods and payment between two businessmen.The seller had delivered goods worth Rs 52.34 lakh out of which he was paid Rs 47.75 lakh. As the balance amount was not paid, he lodged a criminal case, leading to the other businessman to move HC for quashing the case.While allowing criminal proceedings in the case, a single bench of Justice Kumar justified his decision, saying that the complainant would not be in a position to pursue the civil litigation as it will take years and he will have to put more money to pursue the litigation. ""To be more precise, it would seem like good money chasing bad money. If this court allows the matter to be referred to civil court on account of civil dispute between the parties, it would amount to travesty of justice and O.P. no.2 (complainant) would suffer irreparable loss and he might even not be in a position to emerge from the financial constraints to pursue the matter,"" he had said.Expressing shock over the stand taken by the judge the SC bench said, ""Is it the understanding of the high court that ultimately if the accused is convicted, the trial court would award him the balance amount? The observations recorded... are shocking. It is an extremely sad day for one and all to read the observations... It was expected of the high court to know the well-settled position of law that in cases of civil dispute a complainant cannot be permitted to resort to criminal proceedings as the same would amount to abuse of process of law.""It was expected of the HC to understand the nature of the allegations levelled in the complaint. In substance the HC has said in so many words that the criminal proceedings instituted by the complainant in a case of pure civil dispute is justified because it may take considerable time for the complainant to recover the balance amount by preferring a civil suit,"" it said.The bench quashed the order and directed that the case be reconsidered by the HC but by another judge.""The chief justice of the high court shall immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the judge concerned. The chief justice shall make the judge concerned sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge of the HC. We further direct that the judge concerned shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office. If at all he is to be made to sit as a single judge, he shall not be assigned any criminal determination,"" the apex court said.","Supreme Court pulls up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case.

The bench accepted the plea of Supreme Court Advocates On Record Association president Vipin Nair who submitted that BCI should first hold an inquiry on the alleged role of lawyers and thereafter police could be roped in for further investigation if some outsider was involved.In this murky case, a litigant managed to get a favourable order from the SC after a 'ghost' opponent propped up in court proceedings who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for the top court to quash orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant.Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before the SC. Both the parties are blaming each other for playing with the court and, interestingly, both of them pressed for police investigation.The SC has already recalled its order which was passed on the basis of the alleged fake compromise.","The Bar Council of India has been given eight weeks to look into the controversy and file a report.

ED opposes release of Agusta case accused,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-opposes-release-of-agusta-case-accused/articleshow/123127421.cms,"NEW DELHI: ED told a Delhi court Tuesday that submissions by Christian Michel James , alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam, for his release in a money laundering case linked to the deal are ""misleading"" and ""devoid of merits"".ED's stand came after James's counsel informed special judge Sanjay Jindal Monday that his client had already undergone the maximum sentence prescribed for the offences for which he was extradited to India from UAE in 2018. Therefore, he argued that he is entitled to be released under section 436-A of CrPC.This section deals with the maximum period for which an undertrial prisoner can be detained. It states if an undertrial is detained for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum imprisonment specified for the offence, the person should be released on personal bonds, potentially with or without sureties. This provision applies to offences not punishable by death. In its reply, ED cited Article 17 of the 'Extradition Treaty' with the UAE.","Christian Michel James is alleged middleman in AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam.

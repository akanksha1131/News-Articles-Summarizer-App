Earlier, politics was done by making false promises, now Modi ji has changed it into the politics of development. PM Modi wants to take the country towards a 'Viksit Bharat' and people want to walk with PM Modi's developed India.""""Why to date no Prime Minister could think about a developed India. Only Narendra Modi thought that the countries that became independent after us have also become developed but India is still struggling for basic facilities. That is why the goal of a 'Viksit Bharat' was decided by Modi ji,"" the Haryana BJP leader said.Meanwhile, the campaign for the first phase of assembly polls in Jharkhand ended on Monday.Jharkhand will go to the polls in two phases on November 13 and 20. 43 out of the total 81 seats will go to the polls in the first phase.Campaigning in the state, Union Home Minister Amit Shah launched a scathing attack on Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren and accused him of ""humiliating"" Champai Soren.""Champai Soren has been loyal for so many years, standing with Hemantji, but how he was humiliated and removed is not just an insult to Champai Soren but an insult to the entire tribal community. The main issue was that Champai Soren stated that corruption should stop, but the JMM was not willing to end it,"" he alleged.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a road show in Ranchi and two rallies--one in Bokaro and another in Gumla--where he slammed Congress and its allies for ""attempting to create a divide between SCs, STs, and OBCs.""The Maharashtra Assembly elections will take place on November 20, votes will be counted on November 23.The opposition MVA coalition, comprising Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and the Nationalist Congress Party (SCP), aims to reclaim power in the state, challenging the Mahayuti alliance, which includes Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Ajit Pawar-led NCP.In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena secured 56, and Congress 44.

PUNE: Even as many sitting MLAs across Maharashtra face anti-incumbency, there are 12 who have managed to win their seats for more than five consecutive terms, including three who remained undefeated seven times in a row from the same constituency. At least 11 are back in the poll arena.Late PWPI leader Ganpatrao Deshmukh was the longest-serving MLA in Maharashtra’s history, as he was elected to the state assembly for 11 consecutive terms from Sangola.

Talk of anti-conversion law in Maharashtra worries church leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talk-of-anti-conversion-law-in-maharashtra-worries-church-leaders/articleshow/115196509.cms,"Representative photo

MUMBAI: For the minority Christian community in Maharashtra, the election offers difficult choices, especially after home minister Amit Shah’s statement that a BJP govt in the state will implement the anti-conversion law and never allow quota for minorities. Despite the fact that no Christian candidate has been fielded by major political parties in Mumbai, community leaders are advising members to vote in large numbers on Nov 20.Cyril Dara, core member of a federation of NGOs named Samast Christi Samaj, said, “Christians are targeted by anti-conversion laws, which create an environment where conversion to a minority religion is very dangerous, and sharing the gospel can lead to persecution.”Bishop Allwyn D’Silva, in-charge of the social apostolate of the Archdiocese, echoed the need to “vote in parties that respect the Constitution”. “We must invoke the conscience of people regarding issues like communal tension, worsening economic inequality, lack of jobs, and multiple injustices like the anti-conversion bill.”Herbert Barretto, president, Maharashtrian East Indian Christian Federation, said, “The community is unhappy with Congress, NCP and both Shiv Senas for ignoring our members during distribution of tickets.”Melwyn Fernandes of AOCC also expressed hurt over the “exclusion of Christian candidates from Congress party’s list” despite its claims of “secularism, and the community’s loyalty”.Fr Frazer Mascarenhas SJ, an educational administrator and Catholic priest, said, “In these elections, Christians are more interested in voting because of increasing violence against different groups, apparent breakdown of law and order, and abuse of laws like UAPA and PMLA. Other factors include economic distress, lack of jobs, hate speeches and the deterioration of democratic institutions like media, even judiciary, as in the case of Prof Saibaba and Fr Stan Swamy.”","Despite the fact that no Christian candidate has been fielded by major political parties in Mumbai, community leaders are advising members to vote in large numbers on Nov 20.

NAGPUR: As Maharashtra gears up for assembly elections, data reveals a stark under representation of Muslim candidates who make up only about 10% of the total contestants, according to the state’s election department. Of 4,136 candidates vying for seats in 288 constituencies, only 420 are Muslims, and more than half of these are running as independents.Major parties have fielded relatively few. Congress has put forth only nine Muslim candidates, while BJP has fielded none. However, NCP led by Ajit Pawar has given tickets to five, deviating from ally BJP’s approach.Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM has fielded the highest number of Muslim candidates among the parties, with 16, while smaller parties account for 150. Of the 420 Muslim candidates, 218 are running as independents.A TOI analysis of the data found that over 150 constituencies do not have a single Muslim candidate, while nearly 50 constituencies have just one in the race. The numbers thin out even further in many areas, though five constituencies are deviations, featuring seven Muslim candidates each.Malegaon Central stands as an exception to the state’s broader trends, as all its 13 candidates are Muslims. Aurangabad East also has a higher-than-average number of minority candidates — 17 of the 29 contesting in this seat are Muslim, three of whom are women.Across Maharashtra, Muslim women are severely underrepresented, making up only 22 of the total candidate pool. This means that roughly .5% of all candidates are Muslim women. Out of 288 constituencies, 270 do not have even one Muslim woman candidate, whether independent or party-affiliated.According to former state cabinet minister Anees Ahemad, the financial demands of elections make it “out of reach for most middle-class candidates, particularly from minority communities”. He said: “We need to encourage minority women to step forward, but the high cost often holds them back.”","Of 4,136 candidates vying for seats in 288 constituencies, only 420 are Muslims.

Book Rahul & Kharge for bid to mislead electorate: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/book-rahul-kharge-for-bid-to-mislead-electorate-bjp/articleshow/115196449.cms,"Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Maharashtra polls, BJP has approached EC, accusing Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of violating the model code of conduct (MCC). On November 6, during a rally in Maharashtra, Gandhi made “objectionable” statements, BJP said in its formal complaint on Monday.The BJP’s complaint highlights what it describes as “gross violations” of the MCC and relevant electoral laws, emphasising that Gandhi’s comments reflect a “malicious and slanderous campaign” against the party. The complaint specifically accuses Gandhi of spreading false information about BJP and its ideological parent, RSS.According to BJP, Gandhi claimed that BJP and RSS intend to “erase” the Constitution. Additionally, Gandhi reportedly alleged that only members of RSS can qualify for high-ranking university positions, disregarding other qualifications.BJP requested EC to “reprimand, censure and restrain Gandhi from handing out lies” from making further statements during the campaigning that BJP considers unfounded. The party also sought an FIR against Kharge and Gandhi for what it views as a persistent campaign to mislead the electorate.The complaint argues “Gandhi with his statements is inciting youths of Maharashtra which is immensely dangerous for the unity and integrity of the nation”.Among the statements flagged, Gandhi allegedly claimed that industries like Apple and Boeing are relocating operations to other states at Maharashtra’s expense, a claim the BJP calls “unverified” and “misleading”.BJP carrying out vicious communal propaganda: CongressAccusing the governing BJP of vicious communal propaganda in Jharkhand and Maharashtra, Congress Monday said the Election Commission has accepted the party’s complaints about specific instances of campaign violations and ordered FIRs to be lodged. The party demanded that BJP be censured if the communal advertisements continue in the future.A Congress delegation met EC with eight complaints, and claimed that the poll watchdog accepted all its eight petitions as valid and initiated proceedings to redress the grievances. The EC later in a statement said, that an FIR has been registered for posting false and misleading videos on ‘BJ Jharkhand’ social media platform.Lok Sabha MP Sasikanth Senthil, who led the Congress team, said the party told the watchdog that there is a pattern in the communal propaganda through social media posts by the BJP, which happens even without elections, and the only objective is to divide society for political advantage. “It is way beyond what the country is used to. We told EC that if this is repeated, then there should be strong strictures against this party,” he added.Senthil said while the advertisements in Jharkhand social media were very communal, the one on the official party handle in Maharashtra showed a Congress leader and a community in very bad light. He added that EC ordered that the advertisements and posts be taken down and also ordered police cases to be filed. Also, Congress said it repeated the earlier complaint that a governor (Raghubar Das) is involved in the political campaign in Jharkhand. “The ECI promised to take cognisance and order a probe,” the party added.","BJP has approached EC, accusing Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of violating the model code of conduct (MCC) On November 6, during a rally in Maharashtra, Gandhi made “objectionable” statements, BJP said in its formal complaint on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115196459,imgsize-56314,width-400,resizemode-4/115196459.jpg"

Waqf Bill JPC’s study tours put off amid oppn decision to boycott trips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-bill-jpcs-study-tours-put-off-amid-oppn-decision-to-boycott-trips/articleshow/115192453.cms,"JPC chairperson and BJP MP Jagdambika Pal

NEW DELHI: With opposition MPs “boycotting” the scheduled study tour of members of the joint parliamentary committee on the Waqf Bill , the LS Secretariat has postponed the trips to Kolkata, Patna and Lucknow from Nov 12 to Nov 14, with a notification being issued on Monday.The secretariat decided to defer the meetings at the three cities after those at Guwahati and Bhubaneswar were washed out as just five (all from BJP) of the 31 members of the panel attended them — the meetings had failed to garner the required quorum.The panel’s opposition members had earlier met LS Speaker Om Birla and requested him to postpone the tours planned between Nov 9 and Nov 14 as MPs were visiting their constituencies.On Saturday, some opposition MPs had written to Birla, expressing dismay that despite their meeting with him over the panel’s functioning , JPC chairperson and BJP MP Jagdambika Pal had gone ahead with the state tours according to the schedule that he had set.After the tours were postponed, TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee on Monday said, “We had requested for deferment of the tours, as we were caught up with elections in many of states. Also, most often, JPC meetings in Delhi have few members from the governing side attending, hence with opposition members staying away, we had warned of lack of quorum at the meetings. However, finally good sense seems to have prevailed, and it is welcome.”In their letter to the speaker, the members had said, “To our utter surprise, we found that the tour commencing from Nov 9 has not been deferred. In such view of the matter, we thought it prudent to boycott the said tour.”The members announced their decision at a press conference in Kolkata, which was held by Banerjee. In their letter to Birla, they had said they would make their decision public. Banerjee, DMK's A Raja and Congress's Mohammad Jawed were among those who wrote to the speaker.Following claims by the opposition MPs that tour meetings being led by Pal lacked quorum, JPC chairman Jagdambika Pal on Sunday refuted the charge saying “study tours” of parliamentary panels are an informal exercise and are not bound by formalities like meeting the quorum.","The LS Secretariat has postponed the trips to Kolkata, Patna and Lucknow from Nov 12 to Nov 14.

DEHRADUN: Untreated effluent discharged from a sewage treatment plant (STP) is polluting Ganga near its source, a report submitted to National Green Tribunal (NGT) has revealed. The report, based on findings from Uttarakhand government, was presented during a tribunal hearing on pollution control in Ganga in Uttarakhand.The NGT, which had requested a report from the state and related authorities, passed an order on Nov 5 and has scheduled the matter for further discussion on Feb 13 next year.The original application, filed by environmentalist M C Mehta, focuses on preventing and controlling pollution in Ganga and its tributaries. The NGT is addressing the pollution in each state through which Ganga flows.A bench comprising NGT chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava, Justice Sudhir Agarwal, and expert member A Senthil Vel noted the submission from an advocate representing one of the intervening applicants, saying, “She (the advocate) has submitted that even the originating point of the pious river Ganga is polluted by the STP discharge .”According to this submission, sewage samples from the 1 million litres per day (MLD) capacity STP at Gangotri contained faecal coliform (FC) bacteria with a most probable number (MPN) of 540/100 ml. FC levels reflect contamination from human and animal waste. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) standards state that water with an MPN below 500/100 ml is suitable for organised outdoor bathing.The tribunal directed Uttarakhand’s chief secretary to review the situation and ensure compliance by submitting a detailed status report.","Untreated effluent discharged from a sewage treatment plant is polluting Ganga near its source.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday castigated the AAP govt in Punjab for its “lame excuses” to delay elections to grassroots level governance institutions — municipal corporations, municipal councils and nagar panchayats — even though the five-year tenure of most of the 42 such bodies expired years ago.“Non-holding of elections since 2020 is a serious lapse. Your affidavit before the (Punjab and Haryana) high court is full of lame excuses. These are all false and baseless reasons given by the Punjab govt for not holding elections. Hold elections or face action,” warned a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan.Senior advocate A M Singhvi attempted to diffuse the situation by telling the bench that the state cannot escape holding elections, but sought time till Dec 31 to initiate the process as the delimitation exercise had to be carried out. The fresh delimitation process initiated by the state govt was quashed by the HC.When advocate general Gurminder Singh pitched in to say that without delimitation several villages would be deprived of voting, the bench said, “We hope the state govt understands the mandate of Article 243U that warrants completion of the elections to the civic bodies before expiry of its five-year tenure. The ground of delimitation is not available to the state to defer elections, as has been laid down by two SC judgements.”The bench also expressed surprise as to how the state election commission is a co-petitioner with the Punjab govt in the appeal against the HC judgement. “Where is the independence of the EC,” the bench said and directed the state election commission and the Punjab govt to issue notification for civic body elections within two weeks and complete the process, including declaration of results, within eight weeks of issuance of the notification.The bench said only three out of 42 civic bodies have an elected body. “When the constitutional mandate is to hold elections prior to expiry of the five-year tenure, the state is seeing ghosts and not holding elections for the last four years. These are serious lapses,” it said. Elections to the three civic bodies were held in Jan 2023.","The five-year tenure of most of the 42 such bodies expired years ago. “Non- holding of elections since 2020 is a serious lapse.

Manipur violence: Indefinite curfew imposed in Jiribam district following intense gunfight with militants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur-violence-indefinite-curfew-imposed-in-jiribam-district-following-intense-gunfight-with-militants/articleshow/115189642.cms,"11 militants killed in gunfight with security forces in Manipur

NEW DELHI: An indefinite curfew has been imposed across the entire Jiribam district, effective immediately, in response to escalating violence and to maintain order, as confirmed by Manipur authorities. This measure follows a deadly clash between suspected militants and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in the Jakurador Karong area of Borobekra sub-division.On Monday afternoon, eleven suspected militants were killed in a fierce firefight with CRPF personnel after the armed assailants launched an assault, setting fire to local shops and homes and attacking a nearby CRPF camp. The militants initiated the attack on Borobekra police station around 2:30 p.m., then advanced towards the Jakurador Karong area, escalating tensions in a region already affected by recent clashes.Two CRPF personnel were injured in the exchange of fire, with one in critical condition who was evacuated to Silchar Medical College in Assam for urgent treatment. According to officials, the firefight lasted approximately 40 to 45 minutes, during which security forces retaliated heavily to bring the situation under control.In a post on X, the Manipur Police shared details of the incident, stating, “The CRPF Post located at Jakuradhor and Borobekra Police Station (located nearby), Jiribam District were attacked by armed militants. The security forces retaliated strongly.” The post also mentioned that following the gunfight, the bodies of ten militants, along with weapons including AK-47 rifles, SLRs, and an RPG, were recovered from the site.Authorities are investigating reports of five civilians who remain unaccounted for. It is unclear if they were abducted or went into hiding amidst the violence. The bodies of the slain militants were taken to Borobekra police station for identification and investigation.The attack underscores the ongoing tension in Manipur, where violence has surged in recent months. Jiribam has seen frequent skirmishes since violence first erupted in June, leaving communities on edge. Last week, the killing of a 31-year-old woman in Zairon Hmar village added to these tensions, and clashes across the region have continued despite efforts to restore order.Manipur’s Director General of Police (DGP) Rajiv Singh emphasized the government’s commitment to peace, citing cooperation with security forces and local communities to address these ""challenging times."" He noted a reduction in violence since the ethnic tensions began on May 3, 2023, after protests led by the All Tribal Students Union (ATSU) sparked widespread unrest over Meitei community demands for Scheduled Tribe status.Efforts toward peace were made recently when leaders from the Kuki, Meitei, and Naga communities engaged in dialogue in New Delhi. The Ministry of Home Affairs facilitated the discussions, bringing together MLAs and ministers who jointly called for unity and peace, marking a crucial step toward healing and stability in Manipur.","An indefinite curfew has been imposed across the entire Jiribam district, effective immediately.

NEW DELHI: The Kerala government on Monday suspended two IAS officers , K Gopalakrishnan and N Prasanth , for alleged breaches of conduct. According to official sources, Gopalakrishnan was suspended for creating a religion-based WhatsApp group , while disciplinary action was taken against Prasanth for reportedly criticizing a senior officer.The controversy began on October 31, when several IAS officers in the Kerala cadre were unexpectedly added to a new WhatsApp group named "" Mallu Hindu Officers ."" The group, allegedly created by K Gopalakrishnan, included only Hindu officers, prompting immediate objections. Many officers viewed the group as a breach of the secular values that government officials are expected to uphold, and the group was deleted the following day.In response, Gopalakrishnan claimed his phone had been hacked, resulting in the unauthorized formation of several WhatsApp groups using his contacts. He filed a police complaint , asserting that he had no involvement in creating the controversial group.The incident follows another high-profile controversy involving IPS officer MR Ajith Kumar, who was recently transferred from his role as ADGP (law and order). Kumar reportedly met with senior RSS leaders without the approval of Kerala’s ruling LDF government, which faced mounting pressure to act after the CPI, an LDF ally, took a strong stance on the issue. While the government has not officially confirmed this as the reason for his transfer, the timing has raised questions.“This is the first time a WhatsApp group among officers has been created based on religious lines,” a senior officer told The Times of India, speaking on condition of anonymity. Typically, WhatsApp groups among officials are based on seniority, department, or regional ties, he explained, adding that most are inactive or serve practical, administrative functions.The formation of a group with a religious angle drew the attention of state and central intelligence agencies , who were alerted by officers added to the group. Evidence provided by these officers reportedly led intelligence authorities to take the matter seriously, and an investigation is now underway.","K Gopalakrishnan was suspended for creating a religion-based WhatsApp group. disciplinary action was taken against Prasanth for reportedly criticizing a senior officer.

Security forces gunned down 10 “armed militants” in Manipur’s Jiribam district Monday in swift retaliation to two CRPF posts coming under attack around 3pm, capping days of attacks by suspected tribal gunmen on civilian targets in one of the flashpoints of the ethnic strife.Sanjeev Kumar, a CRPF constable wounded in the militant assault, was airlifted to Silchar Medical College in neighbouring Assam, while two civilians were “unaccounted for” after the tumult of gunfire from both sides, sources said.Manipur Police, which joined CRPF in the largest counter-offensive against suspected militants in recent months, said three Kalashnikov rifles, four SLRs, two INSAS rifles, an RPG, a pump-action gun, bullet-proof helmets, and magazines were found beside the bodies of the militants.The tribal Kuki-Zo council disputed the number of casualties cited by police, saying “about 11 village volunteers died at the hands of CRPF personnel”. It declared a total shutdown in the area from 5am to 6pm Tuesday “in honour of the victims and to express our collective grief and solidarity for those who were brutally shot dead”. Hmar Students’ Association, too, denounced what it alleged was “the brutal murder of 11 Hmar village volunteers”.A security mop-up was underway till late Monday in the vicinity of Jakuradhor and Borobekra police stations, to which the CRPF posts were attached. Reinforcements from the Assam Rifles, CRPF and police have been dispatched to the site, officials said.The Hmar association said the “11 village volunteers” killed in the CRPF-police offensive were from Jakhradawr in Jiribam. “They were captured, herded together and murdered by combined forces under the influence of Meitei militants.

Los Alamos Daily Post

MUMBAI: Unknown possibly to many, just 48 hours after Donald Trump was formally declared presidential election winner, the US conducted on Nov 8 a flight test related to its nuclear weapons programme.Los Alamos National Laboratory -- one of the main centres of US nuclear weapons development -- launched a payload code named Cyclone-1 to evaluate how new components and technologies behave when released by a missile and in a space environment.The weapon-related payload was flown by Denver-based UP Aerospace’s SpaceLoft-20 rocket , and the lift-off was from Spaceport America in New Mexico.“The primary mission of the laboratory is ensuring safety, security and reliability of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile,” Stephen Judd, Los Alamos’s mission manager has been quoted as saying to. “To do this successfully requires flight testing to determine how things perform in environments similar to those experienced during a missile launch,” Judd added.Significantly, the crucial test comes at a time when the US is upgrading its nuclear warheads and designing new ones.According to Judd, flight testing allows for data gathering about how systems behave in various environments, such as different accelerations, pressures, velocities, and temperatures. Upon the rocket reaching its apogee -- the point furthest from earth -- the research payload was released and monitored by laboratory scientists through its descent back to Earth.During this flight, an onboard telemetry system transmitted in-flight information regarding the payload’s performance and its functionality. The Los Alamos lab is preparing for another four launches between this year-end and mid-Sept 2025.",The US conducted a flight test related to its nuclear weapons programme.

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive the first of its two guided-missile warships being built in Russia by the end of this month, following a long delay due to ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. However, the delivery of 2 remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defense missile systems is likely to be delayed until 2026, and lease of a nuclear-powered attack submarine until 2028.The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad for the last few months, defence sources told TOI.The warship will then be commissioned as INS Tushil by defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is slated to visit the country early-Dec for India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meet.“The second frigate, Tamal, will be handed over early next year. Both the stealth frigates will be packed with weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, and sensors to undertake a variety of missions,” a source said. India in Oct 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement for procurement of four Grigorovich-class frigates , with the first two to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard (GSL) with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, with the first being “launched” as Triput in July this year. These four warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted in the Navy from 2003-04 onwards.Delivery of fourth and fifth squadrons of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, in turn, will take place only by 2026. “India has asked Russia for faster delivery. But it looks difficult because Russia’s entire defence-industrial production is geared towards Ukraine war,” another source said.IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan, as reported by TOI earlier.On underwater front, India in the past has operated two nuclear-powered attack submarines armed with conventional weapons (called SSNs), INS Chakra-1 and INS Chakra-2, after leasing them from Russia. Then, in March 2019, India inked an over $3 billion (Rs 21,000 crore) deal with Russia to lease a more advanced SSN for 10 years, but its delivery has also been delayed beyond 2027. “Russia has been asked to deliver the SSN earlier, but it is doubtful before 2028,” the source said.The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9, incidentally, cleared the indigenous project to build two SSNs at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore, but it will take at least a decade for them to roll out.India had of course commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBNs) as INS Arighaat in August and plans to induct the third as INS Aridhaman early next year, in a major boost for strategic deterrence.","The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad.

RANCHI: Union home minister Amit Shah accused chief minister Hemant Soren ’s coalition govt of patronising illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Jharkhand for vote-bank politics , while pledging that the BJP would bring a law to prevent the transfer of land to all infiltrators who marry off tribal girls.“The entire tribal community is against the infiltrators and their atrocities,” he said and promised that BJP, if elected, would reclaim all such land grabbed by illegal immigrants.Earlier, while unveiling BJP’s manifesto for Jharkhand on Nov 3, Home minister Shah had accused illegal Bangladeshi immigrants of grabbing tribal land “by marrying tribal girls through false pretensions”. He had promised that BJP govt “will identify and deport each infiltrator and take back the land they’d usurped from the tribal people”.On the final day of campaigning for the first phase of Jharkhand assembly elections on Nov 13, the Union Home minister addressed two rallies — one at Tamar in Ranchi district and another in Seraikela, both reserved for STs.Shah alleged that the JMM-Cong-RJD alliance is against tribal people as it had unceremoniously removed former chief minister Champai Soren for speaking out against govt policies.“Hemant Soren’s party JMM removed Champai from the CM’s post because he spoke about the illegal infiltration of the Bangladeshis in the state. JMM humiliated Champai by dethroning him for telling the truth. But BJP honours him for pointing out the facts,” the union home minister said.Champai is seeking to retain the Seraikela seat for the seventh time, now as a BJP candidate. In Tamar, BJP ally JD(U)’s Raja Peter, who defeated Shibu Soren in 2008, is the NDA nominee. At both rallies, Shah also levelled corruption charges against the coalition govt, citing how central agencies confiscated piles of money from INDIA bloc functionaries.",Union home minister Amit Shah accused chief minister Hemant Soren ’s coalition govt of patronising illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Jharkhand for vote-bank politics.

HARIDWAR: A row erupted in Haridwar after the district administration invited three Muslim MLAs from the region for an event at Har-ki-Pauri ghat to mark the state foundation day, a move allegedly opposed by Ganga Sabha , the body administering the ghat. It argued that the three legislators should not have been invited as “non-Hindus are not allowed entry at the ghat since long, and the British had also made it a rule under the Haridwar Municipal Act of 1935.”The event, held on Monday in the presence of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and a host of other BJP leaders, featured cultural performances and a light show. As part of protocol, Haridwar district administration had invited Congress MLA from Piran Kaliyar Furqan Ahmed, BSP MLA from Laksar Mohammad Shahzad, and Congress MLA from Manglaur Qazi Nizamuddin. However, none of the MLAs attended.A Ganga Sabha member told TOI, “Some issues were raised but it was confirmed that none of the MLAs were coming.” He refused to comment further saying, “Everything went well.”State coordinator of Bajrang Dal, Anuj Walia, said, “We strongly opposed inviting the MLAs... The administration accepted the mistake and told us that the MLAs will not come.”Mohammad Shahzad said, “We don’t care about the resistance by right-wing outfits... We know the sanctity of Ganga and Har-ki-Pauri and we respect it. I do not go to govt events as BJP leaders hijack them and elected representatives are not entertained.”Qazi Nizamuddin said that he and Ahmed were not in the state when the event took place. “I have been campaigning in Maharashtra for the past few weeks.

Though the party released a manifesto with Congress and RJD earlier, “Adkhikar Patra” clarifies its stance on issues like employment, social security, women’s rights and flagship schemes.Reiterating its commitment to increase reservation for OBCs in govt jobs from 14% to 27% while allowing 28% reservation for STs and 12% for SCs, JMM also promised to give 33% reservation to women in govt positions. It proposed a reduction in LPG cylinder prices to Rs 450, and promised to increase the amount given under Maiya Samman Yojna to eligible women to Rs 2,500 per month. “We will also increase the amount paid as pension to widows, elderly people and specially-abled persons to Rs 2,500 per month while ensuring that health insurance coverage is available to even those working in the unorganised sector.”Stressing on employment, JMM released a department-wise plan for the appointment of two lakh youths. It also said it would cancel the previous govt’s land bank scheme and issue land titles to the landless besides issuing caste and residential certificates to those who have no land records within six months of coming to office.","JMM patriarch Shibu Soren has stayed away from the electoral campaign so far.

NAGPUR/NASIK: Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray expressed outrage after his bags were checked by officials deployed by EC at Wani, Yavatmal , ahead of a rally Saturday. A video circulated by the party shows Thackeray’s bags being examined, a move he termed “biased” and questioned whether such checks were conducted on PM Modi, Amit Shah, Eknath Shinde or Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar.“I don’t mind if you check my water cans, fuel tank, or even my urine pot,” he said to the officials, “but make sure you’re checking Modi and Shah’s bags as well and send me those videos.” Thackeray questioned why functionaries from his party were subjected to such scrutiny while BJP netas were allegedly not.Responding to Thackeray’s comments, Yavatmal collector Pankaj Ashiya said, “This process is conducted in accordance with EC’s instructions. Three days ago, when Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis visited Yavatmal district, his helicopter and bag were also inspected.”Later, addressing the rally in Darwha for Congress candidate Manikrao Thakre, Thackeray claimed the agency is biased as it had assigned his party’s name and symbol to other factions, a reference to CM Shinde’s group. Thackeray claimed an official informally mentioned Modi and Shah’s bags were checked previously but said it should be standard practice to verify the bags of all political leaders equally.“If these BJP star campaigners are here only to campaign, they should be treated like any other candidate’s representative,” Thackeray argued. “Justice should be equal for all. Don’t salute them as PM or CM here — they’re here as party campaigners, not as heads of govt.” Thackeray also called on EC to ensure a level playing field, adding if they don’t have the courage to apply the same rules for all leaders, his Shiv Sainiks would conduct the checks themselves.","Uddhav Thackeray's bags were checked by officials deployed by EC at Wani, Yavatmal.

Congress party has openly opposed the quota system and the language they have used for SC/ST/OBC people was clumsy,” the PM said while interacting virtually with BJP volunteers from Jharkhand under the ‘Mera Booth Sabse Majboot’ programme.BJP circulated the Congress advertisement, saying that in 1991, the party was preparing to end reservations meant for SCs, STs and OBCs. “This ad was one such attempt. It exposes their nefarious plans. Recently, during his US visit, Rahul Gandhi again spoke about scrapping reservations. Left to the Congress, there would be no reservations for backwards. Muslims alone will corner all benefits,” BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said in a post on X.Modi said no one dared talk about reservations when Congress was in office. “There was a time when Congress was in power from panchayat to Parliament... then none dared to talk about quota and Congress used to suppress those who demanded it. From Jawaharlal Nehru to Rahul Gandhi, all had opposed reservation in govt jobs. For years, Dalit and Adivasi society was divided until they got the identity as SC and SC. Even OBC people got their due only in 1990,” he said.Modi said people of Jharkhand were determined to bring change. The biggest reason for this, he said, was that JMM, Congress and RJD had attacked Jharkhand’s “roti, beti and maati” — a reference to BJP’s charges of corruption under the JMM-Congress coalition, infiltration of Bangladeshis and the rise in atrocities on women and loss of land belonging to tribals.“They talked big in the last five years, but today the people of Jharkhand are seeing that most of their promises are false,” Modi said.","BJP circulated the Congress advertisement, saying that in 1991, the party was preparing to end reservations meant for SCs, STs and OBCs. “This ad was one such attempt.

Our govt got a resolution passed to increase the reservation limits in the state assembly and sent the proposal to the governor.

He is the head of a ‘math’ and wears a dress donned by sadhus. But sadhus must be compassionate and unite people to safeguard humanity. However, he said, ‘Batoge toh katoge’. You must now understand that ‘daroge toh maroge’,” he said.Kharge also said, “(Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma) came here and tried to intimidate locals — those working with Congress or its allies. ‘Lekin hum darne wale nahin hain.

Once again you have to show your power to help our alliance form the state govt to fight such divisive forces.”Hailing the five-year tenure of Hemant government, Kharge said the administration focused on staying united and working for the welfare of the people despite BJP’s attempts to topple the government. “We tried to deliver all promises we made, unlike the jumlas of BJP.”",Mallikarjun Kharge: BJP trying to polarise voters ahead of Jharkhand election.

All-year firecracker ban? Supreme Court asks Delhi to decide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-year-firecracker-ban-supreme-court-asks-delhi-to-decide/articleshow/115195407.cms,"Supreme Court

Police could’ve been more proactive in enforcing firecracker ban: SC

NEW DELHI: Observing that it is the fundamental right of every citizen to live in a pollution-free environment and that no religion promotes activities which cause pollution, Supreme Court Monday directed Delhi govt to decide by Nov 25 on a perpetual ban on selling and bursting of all kinds of firecrackers throughout the year in the national capital and not just on Diwali.It also sought a response from NCR states — Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab — on banning firecrackers in their territories as a measure to deal with the pollution crisis.Though the AAP govt sought time till Jan to take a decision after holding consultations with all stakeholders, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and A G Masih said the govt had to take a decision fast and set a deadline of Nov 25.It also directed the Delhi police commissioner to form a special squad of officers to enforce the ban, both in the open market and on online portals. “The right to live in a pollution-free atmosphere is a fundamental right of every citizen which is protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. We are prima facie of the view that no religion encourages any activity which creates pollution. If firecrackers are burnt in this fashion, it also affects the fundamental right to health of citizens. We direct Delhi govt to take a decision on or before Nov 25,” the bench said.As Delhi govt and Delhi Police blamed each other for incessant bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night, the bench said action taken by both of them was mere eyewash. Responding to the apex court’s query on non-compliance of its ban on firecrackers, Delhi govt said it had passed an order on Oct 14 banning sale and bursting of all kinds of firecrackers and expressed helplessness in enforcing the order as it was the duty of Delhi Police.Delhi Police, however, blamed the govt for passing the ban order too late when the festive season had already begun. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the bench it was difficult to enforce the order as the ban was imposed just a fortnight before Diwali and by that time, the market was flooded with firecrackers. “Until Oct 14, we did not have control over it. We can enforce ban only after the decision was taken,” she told the courtAgreeing with Bhati’s submission that the ban was imposed too late, the court, however, said police could have been more proactive and should have informed all licence holders to forthwith stop the sale of firecrackers. It directed the police commissioner to form a separate squad to stop selling of firecrackers in the open market or on online portals and asked him to file a personal affidavit on compliance of its order.“We direct the commissioner of police to immediately take action of informing all concerned about the said ban to ensure that during the subsistence of the ban, no licence holder manufacturers, stores or sells firecrackers. Delhi Police must immediately inform those entities that sell firecrackers online to stop sale and delivery of firecrackers within the limits of National Capital Territory of Delhi. We direct the commissioner of police to set up a special cell for implementation of the order of ban and to hold SHOs of all local police stations responsible for enforcing the ban through the year,” the court said.The SC had put a blanket ban on selling of firecrackers in the NCR in Nov 2016 and directed the Centre to suspend all licences allowing sale of fireworks. Later, it extended the ban across the country and allowed only green crackers. As its ban order was not effective, SC had in 2021 directed that top bureaucrats, including the chief secretary and the police commissioner of the area concerned, and other officials would be held personally liable for violation of its order.Noting that its various directions was not being implemented, the court had last year said responsibility had to be fixed and suggested that the police commissioner be held responsible for any violation.",Police could’ve been more proactive in enforcing firecracker ban: SC.

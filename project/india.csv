Inputs from Anuja Jaiswal, Lata Mishra and Eshan K

The discovery of human metapneumovirus , or HMPV, goes back to 2000, when a group of Dutch scientists set out to find what caused acute respiratory infections in humans. They found an unknown pathogen.By 2001, the Dutch scientists had sequenced the metapneumovirus using a complex mix of specialised culture and molecular techniques. But, later, serological studies (analysis of blood serum) of 28 children threw up something more interesting — the virus had been in circulation in the Netherlands since 1958. And it had spiked before. In fact, in the first months of 2023, the US recorded a spurt in HMPV detections.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, a professor of microbiology at BJ Medical College in Pune, said: “Our bodies have adapted to their (virus’s) presence over time. In most cases, infections for all viruses remain asymptomatic or mild, but for some individuals — especially those with underlying medical conditions — they can lead to severe illness and hospitalisation. This was true for Covid-19, and it’s also true for HMPV. But unlike Covid-19, HMPV has been around for a long time and there is no evidence to suggest that it is spreading in India at a faster speed than before.”Senior expert Dr GC Khilnani, too, noted that “the virus poses significant risk to immunocompromised individuals and older adults”. Khilnani is a member of the WHO technical advisory group on global air pollution and health, and chairman of PSRI Institute of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine.Dr Sandeep Budhiraja of Max Healthcare explained that HMPV elderly individuals with existing health conditions like diabetes, heart disease or kidney failure have to be especially careful. While healthy adults experience mild symptoms, elderly patients may develop serious complications.What are the symptoms? HMPV spreads among humans via respiratory droplets. Incubation period is believed to be between 3 and 5 days, but can vary. According to the US CDC, there is currently no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and there’s no vaccine against it either. Managing the illness involves supportive care.Common cold-like symptomsPneumonia or bronchopneumoniaTesting for HMPV often involves advanced methods like the BioFire panel that can detect multiple pathogens, including HMPV, in a single test. Many private labs in India conduct this test, but the cost runs into thousands of rupees.Experts said HMPV is more common in the paediatric population, predominately in children less than two years of age.About 5% to 10% of paediatric patients may end up in hospital due to HMPV-triggered acute lower respiratory tract infections. On average, doctors say children less than 6 months old who contract HMPV infection are three times as likely to be hospitalised compared with those between 6 months and 5 years.Dr Amitav Banerjee, former field epidemiologist in the Indian Armed Forces, said: “The recent surge in China is due to ‘immunity debt’, that is, the children born during the pandemic did not get exposed to the virus in the first few months of life due to restrictive non-pharmacological interventions. They are immune naive and vulnerable, giving rise to a large number of cases.”Dr Karyakarte pointed out that the weather, too, has a role to play. “The mucus in our nasal passages, which serves as a protective barrier against pathogens, becomes less effective in cold, dry air. Reduced moisture in the mucus compromises this natural defence, making it easier for viruses to directly contact and infect nasal cells.”A pioneering 2003 study by BJ Medical College and NIV-Pune confirmed HMPV in children in Pune. The study found a 19.2% positivity rate in 26 paediatric cases. Four of the five positive cases were infants under one year. There were both mild and severe infection patterns.In a 2006 AIIMS study, 12% of children under five years with acute respiratory illness (ARI) tested positive for HMPV. Most of these cases occurred during winter months.A 2013 NIV Pune study analysed 224 clinical samples and identified multiple HMPV strains (A2, B1, and B2 lineages). A2 and B2 were found to be predominant subtypes.A 2014 Assam study found HMPV in 20 of 276 children (7.2%) under the age of 5 who had ARI symptoms. The study also noted that the highest prevalence of HMPV was detected in Jan (46.7%) followed by Dec (16.7%).A 2024 ICMR study in Gorakhpur examined 100 paediatric patients with respiratory illness of whom 4% tested positive for HMPV. Among the positive cases, one fatality was reported.➤ Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds➤ Avoid close contact with people who are sick➤ Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands➤ Cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing h Stay at home when sick➤ Regularly clean surfaces such as doorknobs, tables, etc","Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been in circulation in the Netherlands since 1958. HMPV is more common in the paediatric population, predominately in children less than two years of age. There is no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPv and there’s no vaccine against it either.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117007570,imgsize-1101344,width-400,resizemode-4/117007570.jpg"

Lobuche, located near the Khumbu Glacier in Nepal, lies approximately 150 kilometres east of Kathmandu and is close to the Everest Base Camp.China's earthquake monitoring agency recorded the quake's magnitude as 6.8, with the epicentral region at an altitude of about 4,200 metres (13,800 feet), according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.Further, as per NCS data, two more earthquakes struck the region later in the morning.One of magnitude 4.7 was recorded at 7:02 AM IST, with its epicenter at latitude 28.60 degrees North and longitude 87.68 degrees East, at a depth of 10 kilometers.Another earthquake of magnitude 4.9 occurred at 7:07 AM IST, with its epicenter at latitude 28.68 degrees North and longitude 87.54 degrees East, at a depth of 30 kilometers.Nepal, according to experts, is exposed to earthquakes as it is in a seismically active zone, which makes quakes inevitable.The last time Nepal felt such a strong earthquake was on April 25, 2015, when a 7.8 magnitude quake killed some 9,000 people, the worst in Nepal's history, and damaged about 1 million structures. The previous deadliest earthquake that struck the region was in 1934 with over 8,000 fatalities.A day earlier, on Monday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 hit Afghanistan at 12.47 pm IST, the National Centre of Seismology (NCS) reported. The quake occurred at a depth of 120 kilometres, with its epicentre recorded at Latitude 36.55 N and Longitude 67.86 E.","A massive earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck near the Tibet-Nepal border on Tuesday morning.

"Transformer stolen, UP village in dark for weeks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/transformer-stolen-up-village-in-dark-for-weeks/articleshow/117004563.cms,"BAREILLY: For more than 3 weeks, over 5,000 residents of Soraha in UP's Budaun district have been in darkness in severe winter cold, thanks to the theft of a 250kVA transformer that supplied power to the village. The theft came to light on December 14, when villagers, on their routine walks, found the transformer missing. It had been stripped of everything that could be sold - copper wires, oil, and other metal segments - and dumped under straw in nearby fields. No replacement has been provided yet.Village head Satpal Singh told TOI, ""Lack of electricity is affecting studies, especially with UP board exams scheduled for next month. Without power, inverters and mobile phones are useless, and submersible pumps for water are not operational."" Residents have repeatedly appealed to the electricity department and district officials for a quick resolution.Executive engineer Narendra Chaudhary said that the department had taken steps to assist the village temporarily. ""A supply connection has been arranged from a nearby village to alleviate the problem. Most transformer thefts occur during winter, so we've sought increased patrolling from police. A report has been filed, and we hope that police will solve the case soon,"" Chaudhary said.However, many villagers dispute the claim of an alternate power supply. ""The electricity department is providing false information. Power supply has not been restored, and we have been living in darkness since the theft,"" Pramod Gupta, a resident, said on Monday.Ughaiti SHO Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, told TOI, ""The electricity department reported the theft on Dec 14, and an FIR has been registered against unknown persons. We are investigating the case and have received some leads. Mobile phone activity & CCTV footage from the area are being analysed.

Singhvi said if elections are held and someone else gets elected, and at the same time SC sets aside Singh's expulsion, it would give rise to an incongruent situation of having two elected candidates for the same seat. SC should stay the elections scheduled for later this month, he pleaded.SC refused to postpone the elections, but said it would schedule the final hearing of Singh's writ petition on Jan 9. Singhvi said, ""Freedom of speech inside a House has been given wide latitude."" The bench said, ""This is how freedom of speech is used inside the House? You (Singhvi) are also a Member of Parliament. Do you subscribe to the use of such language against opponents inside a House?"" Singhvi said he does not subscribe to such language, but expulsion for use of such language would make the opposition benches empty. ""For a similar use of language by another MLC, he was merely suspended. But in the case of Singh, it was expulsion.""The Ethics Committee of the legislative council in its report had recommended removal of Singh, stating that ""Being the chief whip of the opposition, his legislative responsibility and adaptation of rules and regulations should be more than others. But his behaviour was otherwise.After coming into the well, he raised unrestrained slogans, hindered the functioning of the House, disrespected the instruction for the Chair, used defamatory words for the leader of the House, trying to humiliate him, and in a way damaged the dignity of the legislative council.""

7 cases of HMPV detected; no cause for concern: Nadda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-cases-of-hmpv-detected-no-cause-for-concern-nadda/articleshow/117004366.cms,"India reported Monday seven cases of human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) infection in children - two each in Bengaluru, Nagpur and Tamil Nadu, and one in Ahmedabad -amid a surge in respiratory illnesses in China. However, Union health minister J P Nadda allayed concerns, saying the rise in cases won't lead to a Covid-like outbreak.""HMPV is not a new virus. It was first identified in 2001, and it has been circulating around the world for many years,"" Nadda said.Experts said HMPV rarely requires hospitalisation, and timely intervention can prevent complications.Nadda said the health ministry, along with Indian Council of Medical Research and National Centre for Disease Control, was monitoring the situation in China and neighbouring countries. ""WHO has taken cognisance of the situation and will share its report shortly with us,"" he said.ICMR confirmed two cases at Bangalore Baptist Hospital. A three-month-old girl from Bengaluru, admitted with fever and cold in December, tested positive and has since recovered and been discharged.The second case of HMPV, detected on January 3, involves an eight-month-old boy admitted for fever following an injury. He tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and is currently recovering. Both children have a history of bronchopneumonia and neither has travelled abroad, suggesting they contracted the infection locally.A two-month-old from Dungarpur in Rajasthan was admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad on Dec 24 with respiratory illness and diagnosed with HMPV on Dec 26. Dr Bhavin Solanki of AMC said the hospital reported the case late, and the patient was isolated. Two children, aged seven and 13, tested positive at Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences in Nagpur. They were initially treated for suspected H1N1 (swine flu) with Tamiflu, but PCR tests confirmed HMPV on Jan 3. The kids recovered through outpatient treatment.Although the hospital reported the cases, Nagpur Municipal Corporation decided to re-test the samples at AIIMS Nagpur. These cases were discussed in an ICMR video conference Monday.Tamil Nadu health secretary Supriya Sahu said the state has two active cases - in Chennai and Salem - and the condition of both is stable. ""HMPV infections are self-limiting and resolve with symptomatic care, including adequate hydration and rest,"" she said.First identified in 2001 in the Netherlands, HMPV causes illnesses from mild respiratory infections to severe conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In India, its prevalence varies between 1% and 19% across regions.Health minister Nadda said HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets and can affect all age groups. ""The virus spreads more during winter and early spring months,"" he said. ""Our health systems and surveillance networks remain vigilant, ensuring the country is ready to respond promptly to any emerging health challenges. There is no reason to worry. We are closely monitoring the situation,"" he assured.ICMR chair for disease elimination, Dr Rajni Kant, said HMPV is a known cause of respiratory illness in children and confirmed its presence in different parts of India. ""ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Gorakhpur, tested respiratory pathogens in 100 under-five patients... at BRD Medical College in 2022. Out of 100 enrolled paediatric patients, four (4%) were found HMPV positive,"" Kant said.Karnataka health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said the virus is likely a local strain unrelated to the outbreak in China. ""Referring to any recent case as the 'first' is misleading. I don't think we should be pressing the panic button."" A Karnataka health official highlighted the potential severity of HMPV in vulnerable populations, particularly children under five, the elderly, and immunosuppressed people. ""About 10% of adult patients admitted with pneumonia test positive for HMPV, and 4-6% of viral illnesses in children are caused by this virus,"" the official said.Current data from ICMR and Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) confirmed no unusual surge in influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory illness cases in the country.A five-month-old boy in Kolkata, who travelled from Mumbai, was the last known case of HMPV in Bengal requiring intensive care. He was admitted to a private hospital with symptoms such as high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and respiratory distress.

Infant's minor fall leads to unexpected HMPV diagnosis

BENGALURU: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has confirmed two cases of Human Metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) in Karnataka through routine surveillance. Both cases, detected at Bengaluru Baptist Hospital, were identified as part of ICMR’s ongoing monitoring of respiratory illnesses across the country.The first case involves a 3-month-old female infant diagnosed with HMPV after being admitted with bronchopneumonia. The baby has since been discharged.The second case is an 8-month-old male infant who tested positive on January 3, 2025, also with a history of bronchopneumonia. The infant is now recovering. Neither of the patients has any international travel history.ICMR and the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) have emphasized that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and no unusual surge in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) cases has been reported.BBMP health commissioner Suralkar Vikas Kishore stated, “The hospital initially flagged the cases, and subsequent tests confirmed the infection. Further monitoring will help assess viral load and spread.”Medical reports confirm the diagnosis through Multiplex PCR testing, which detects microbial RNA/DNA in significant concentrations.A senior official from the Health and Family Welfare Department added, “Detailed investigations are ongoing to assess the virus’s impact. If needed, enhanced testing and control measures will be implemented.”The Union Health Ministry, in coordination with ICMR, continues to monitor HMPV trends. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also providing updates on the global situation, including the outbreak in China.Amid rising concerns over outbreaks of the HMPV infection, several state governments have issued health advisories.In response, the Maharashtra health department has urged residents to cover their mouths and noses while coughing or sneezing, wash their hands frequently with soap, and avoid public spaces if symptomatic.Meanwhile, Delhi's health officials have also issued guidelines to address the potential health risks posed by Human MetaPneumoVirus (HMPV) and other respiratory illnesses. Dr. Vandana Bagga, Director General of Health Services, held consultations with chief district medical officers and the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officers to discuss preparedness for respiratory illnesses in Delhi.According to the advisory, hospitals are required to report cases of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) through the IHIP portal. They must also isolate suspected cases and adhere to standard safety protocols. Hospitals are further instructed to maintain proper documentation for SARI cases and laboratory-confirmed influenza instances to ensure accurate tracking.To manage mild cases, hospitals must stock essential medications, including paracetamol, antihistamines, bronchodilators, cough syrups, and oxygen supplies.HMPV, a respiratory virus that causes upper respiratory tract infections similar to the common cold, primarily affects young children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems, especially during the winter months. It can have severe consequences for immunocompromised people.An infant’s seemingly minor fall has sparked a health mystery for his family after he developed a fever and tested positive for the HMPV virus at Bangalore Baptist Hospital. Despite no visible injuries from the fall, the unexpected diagnosis has left the parents bewildered. Struggling with unanswered questions, they are seeking clearer communication about virus transmission and infection control measures.",Indian Council of Medical Research confirms two cases of Human Metapneumovirus ( HMPV) in Karnataka.

Sullivan meets PM Modi

NEW DELHI: The United States is finalising the removal of longstanding regulations that have hindered civil nuclear cooperation between Indian nuclear entities and US companies, announced national security advisor Jake Sullivan during his visit to India. Sullivan described the move as a significant step in cementing the bilateral partnership, which he said was long overdue.""Although former President Bush and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid out a vision of civil nuclear cooperation nearly 20 years ago, we have yet to fully realise it,"" Sullivan said, adding that the Biden administration has determined it is ""past time to take the next major step."" He confirmed that the necessary paperwork is being finalised, enabling Indian entities previously on restricted US lists to collaborate with American private sector players, scientists, and technologists.""The United States is now finalizing the necessary steps to remove long standing regulations that have prevented civil nuclear cooperation between India's leading nuclear entities and US companies,"" he said while speaking at IIT Delhi.Sullivan said that the decision reflects the progress made in the strategic partnership and India's transparent engagement over the last four years.""The formal paperwork will be done soon, but this will be an opportunity to turn the page on some of the frictions of the past and create opportunities for entities that have been on restricted lists in the United States to come off those lists and enter into deep collaboration with the United States, with our private sector, with our scientists and technologists to move civil nuclear cooperation forward together,"" he said.The announcement comes as Sullivan concludes his two-day visit to India, during which he held discussions with national security advisor Ajit Doval. Sullivan credited Doval for his role in advancing the US-India relationship, noting their ""deep personal and professional relationship"" developed over the past four years.""This is likely the last trip overseas that I will lead as NSA and I cannot think of a better way to end my tenure in the White House, visiting India on my final overseas trip to mark the advances that we have made together over the past four years,"" Sullivan said.He predicted that within the next decade, joint initiatives could see American and Indian firms working together on advanced semiconductor technologies and conducting research in space exploration.Sullivan’s agenda also included a visit to the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where he met with entrepreneurs and discussed the US-India alliance on innovation under the iCET initiative.

NEW DELHI: Three cases of the Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) were detected on Monday, among which two were reported in Karnataka and one in Gujarat.The virus, which is reported to have originated in China, serves as a reminiscence of the Covid pandemic, has alerted governments globally, with Beijing raising concerns about a surge in respiratory infections that has led to overcrowded hospitals and overwhelmed health systems.The two infants, who are reported to have HMPV, are a three-month-old girl and a six-month-old boy. While the girl has a history of bronchopneumonia, the boy was admitted with symptoms of fever and breathlessness before testing positive for the virus.In Gujarat, the virus was detected in a two-month-old boy, who was admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad on December 24 with symptoms of respiratory infection, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the HMPV belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, the same family as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It typically causes upper and lower respiratory infections, presenting symptoms similar to a common cold or flu.Union health minister JP Nadda reassured the public regarding the HMPV virus, stating that the ministry is closely monitoring the situation and there is no cause for concern. Nadda clarified that HMPV, first identified in 2001, is not a new virus and has been circulating globally for years.""It was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world since many years,"" he said.He explained that it spreads through the air, affecting all age groups, particularly during winter and early spring. The ministry is also monitoring HMPV developments in China and neighbouring countries, with no surge in cases reported in India.""The health systems and surveillance networks of the country remain vigilant, ensuring the country is ready to respond promptly to any emerging health challenges. There is no reason to worry. We are closely monitoring the situation,"" Nadda said in his video statement.On Saturday, the Karnataka health ministry had issued a statement stating that Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) primarily affects children, causing cold-like symptoms such as cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. The ministry advised the public to cover their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing, wash hands frequently with soap, and avoid public places if symptomatic. It also recommended not reusing tissues or handkerchiefs, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and refraining from sharing towels or linen.The statement added that while there is no specific antiviral treatment for the virus, but symptom management focuses on ""alleviating symptoms with supportive care like rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications for pain, fever, and congestion.""Delhi health authorities issued an advisory to ensure preparedness for potential health challenges linked to HMPV on Sunday.According to a statement, Dr Vandana Bagga, Director General of Health Services, convened a meeting with chief district medical officers and the state programme officer of IDSP on Sunday to discuss preparedness to address respiratory illnesses in Delhi.The Union health ministry remains vigilant and continues to monitor the situation through all available surveillance channels. Additionally, the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR )will keep track of HMPV circulation trends throughout the year.India is well-prepared to handle respiratory illnesses and surveillance shows no unusual surge in the country, according to the government. In a joint monitoring group (JMG) meeting under the chairmanship of DGHS, ministry of health and family welfare, experts had detailed discussions around the spread of respiratory illnesses in China, where, according to them, it is not unusual in view of the ongoing flu season.The ICMR network also tests for other respiratory viruses such as Adenovirus, RSV, HMPV etc. and these pathogens also do not show an unusual increase in the tested samples.The number of laboratories testing for HMPV will be enhanced by ICMR as part of a precautionary measure. The ICMR will also be monitoring trends of HMPV for the entire year, according to health ministry.Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) for the surveillance of Influenza is already in place in India through both ICMR and IDSP networks and the data from both indicates no unusual surge in ILI and SARI cases.There are no reported cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in Andhra Pradesh, a health official said on Sunday, assuring the public that there is no need to panic about the virus.Public Health and Family Welfare Director K Padmavathi stated that the virus spreads from person to person, similar to Covid-19, primarily affecting children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immunity.In response, the Maharashtra health department has urged residents to cover their mouths and noses while coughing or sneezing, wash their hands frequently with soap, and avoid public spaces if symptomatic.","Three cases of the Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) were detected on Monday, among which two were reported in Karnataka and one in Gujarat.

Financial burden and emotional stress are said to have forced the couple to take the extreme step.Preliminary investigation suggested Anup Kumar and Rakhi (35) poisoned their five-year-old autistic daughter Anupriya and two-year-old son Priyansh, before hanging themselves. The family was from Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, and was staying in a rented house in Sadashivanagar.On Monday, when a woman employed by the couple to take care of the children came for work, she discovered Anup hanging and raised an alarm. Neighbours rushed in and found the others dead in another room. The woman, Reshma, told police she was asked to come a little early as the family had planned to leave for Puducherry. Police checked Kumar's laptop and mobile phone and found that he had sent an email around midnight to his elder brother Amit.Based on the contents of the mail and the statements of those known to the family, police said Anup's financial troubles began after his maternal uncle Rakesh lured him into investing around Rs 25 lakh on a piece of land in Prayagraj to start a petrol bunk in 2018. The business remained a non-starter and his hard-earned money was stuck.After Anupriya was admitted to a pre-school, the couple got their daughter's medical examination done on teachers' insistence. The results suggested she was autistic. Most of Anup's salary was spent on daughter's treatment. The financial strain took a toll on his mental health.

Investigators suspect that officials from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Land Records Department, and City Survey Office played a pivotal role in manipulating maps.TOI has learnt that SIT found that the forged maps facilitated illegal construction on 267 properties, with permissions issued in 32 cases under the BMC Act. Many permissions were granted by Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and MHADA based on falsified documents.Investigators revealed that the syndicate used forged maps to modify land classifications during 2012-2020, allowing construction in areas marked as CRZ or NDZ. The scam was allegedly orchestrated by altering entries in official City Survey maps and leveraging fabricated records to show pre-1964 structures, which are protected under CRZ regulations.The SIT also found that 205 RTI applications were filed to create an illusion of legitimacy around the altered records. Fifteen landowners were questioned during the probe, with four admitting to seeking Puttawallu's assistance in altering their properties' classification. The scam came to light after a farmer from Erangal, Malad, Vaibhav Thakur, reported illegal construction on his ancestral agricultural land in 2016.","A Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing manipulation of documents for plots in ecologically sensitive Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) and no development zones (NDZ) in Mumbai has found 63 more forged records.

It failed because the two did not participate in the visarjan. On Oct 12, Siddique was leaving Zeeshan's office at Nirmal Nagar in Bandra (East) five minutes after his son had left. He was gunned down a little after he stepped outside, near Nirmal Nagar police station.The chargesheet named 26 arrested accused and highlighted the involvement of three absconding suspects, Mohammad Yasin Akhtar alias Sikandar, Shubham Lonkar alias Shubbu and Anmol Singh Bishnoi alias Bhanu.It said Bishnoi masterminded the murder as part of a calculated move to assert dominance, instill fear and expand his extortion racket.The 4,590-page chargesheet, which was submitted by the anti-extortion cell before the special MCOCA court, did not mention jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi Police sources said they found no evidence of Lawrence Bishnoi's involvement.

Bijapur maoist attack: How did 70kg IED go undetected? SOP questions swirl around after Maoist attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bijapur-maoist-attack-questions-around-sop-swirl-after-reds-blow-up-convoy/articleshow/117004039.cms,"RAIPUR: Another IED attack. Another homecoming team blown apart. And the same questions.Were standard operating procedures (SOPs) followed? How did a 60-70kg IED go undetected? If a road-opening party had sanitised the route, why didn’t they spot the danger lurking in the bushes? A Maoist IED team would have to be somewhere nearby — within sight of the convoy — to manually trigger the explosion just as the vehicle passed over the spot.These questions are swirling around after the Bijapur blast, just as they did in the aftermath of the IED explosion that killed 10 jawans and their driver in Dantewada in April 2023, and the April 2011 Tekulguda massacre in which 25 security personnel were killed. Even the Dantewada ambush of April 2010, in which 76 policemen were killed, was unleashed on troops returning.The jawans blown up in Bijapur Monday were battle-weary but jubilant, having neutralised five Maoists in a gruelling 2-day operation. Police say a road opening party had checked the route just prior to the convoy’s arrival on that stretch. The vehicle that was targeted was the seventh in a cavalcade of eight vehicles. The jawans would have felt secure in the knowledge that an ROP had gone the same way.Brig Basant Kumar Ponwar (retd), who spent 18 years in Bastar training security personnel at Jungle Warfare College to “fight a guerrilla like a guerrilla”, says the return journey is the most crucial part of the operation. “After victory, lethargy takes over. They can’t let down their guard after initial victory in a war zone, or they become the easiest of targets. The most important aspect is to ensure SOPs are followed. To ensure that the ROP has cleared 50-150 yards on both sides of the road in a ‘V’ formation. Did sniffer dogs track the route? A secure corridor has to be given to vehicles and a mobile patrol is supposed to be there on the axis to monitor movement,” the former Army commando said.As per preliminary probe, the use of light motor vehicles for jawans to return was the first blunder. The second was to assume that Kutru would be a safer route.Apart from this convoy of eight, the other vehicles took other routes through Pamed.Police said two trees, standing on opposite sides of the road, were markers for Maoists for where the IED was buried. Hiding in the trees, a Maoist, posing as a villager, would have triggered the explosion.The IED attack is a wake-up call for security forces and administration.“Regular patrols, clearing the axis and extensive use of tracker dogs has to be ensured. Mining industries have to be given strict instructions that explosives don’t end up in the wrong hands,” asked Brig Ponwar.","Questions are swirling around after the Bijapur blast.

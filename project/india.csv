Supreme Court upholds BJP govt’s decision to cancel constable recruitment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-upholds-bjp-govts-decision-to-cancel-constable-recruitment/articleshow/118914697.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has said the north-eastern states, which is a confluence of people belonging to a mosaic of tribes, castes and ethnicity, must foster diversity and inclusivity in public services by ensuring representation to candidates from hills and historically backward classes.The court, which is still dealing with cases relating to Kuki-Meitei ethnic clashes in Manipur which had erupted in May 2023 over apprehensions of grant of scheduled tribe status to Meiteis, last week upheld BJP government’s 2016 decision to cancel Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government’s poll-eve interview-based recruitment of constables for Assam Forest Protection Force as no one from 16 districts of the state got selected.Setting aside concurrent judgments of single judge and division bench of the Gauhati HC directing the state to give appointment to the 104 selected candidates, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan said two reasons – the selections being only based on interview which is prone to manipulation and non-selection of any candidate belonging to 16 districts – weigh in favour of cancellation of the examination.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, “Fostering diversity and inclusivity in public service, ensuring that there is representation from almost all the districts including from the hills and historically backward classes without, however, compromising merit should be the commitment of all govts of the north-Eastern states of the country.”The bench expressed surprise that though the notification for recruitment was published in 2014, the selection process was carried out in 2016. Immediately after the change in government, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF) wrote to the government complaining that the process was not fair and smacked of nepotism.Finding that the selection process had “a coat of discernible taint suggesting impropriety and bias”, the bench said, “The decision taken by the successor Government of cancelling the process initiated by the earlier govt cannot be said to be disproportionate and incommensurate with the illegalities/irregularities detected.”“We, thus, unhesitatingly arrive at the conclusion that based on the note of the PCCF dated 4th July, 2016 and the recommendation made by him for cancellation of the select list, the decision of the Government to approve the said note and, thereby, cancel the select list did not stand vitiated to attract its invalidation either by application of the doctrine of Wednesbury unreasonableness or proportionality,” the bench said. While directing the state to fill the 104 posts of constables through a transparent process.",The Supreme Court has said the north-eastern states must foster diversity and inclusivity in public services. The court is still dealing with cases relating to Kuki-Meitei ethnic clashes in Manipur which erupted in May 2023 over apprehensions of grant of scheduled tribe status to Meiteis.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118914869,imgsize-21068,width-400,resizemode-4/118914869.jpg"

Lalit shares Vanuatu broadcaster statement saying citizenship call only after court order

LONDON: Lalit Modi , who is wanted for criminal offences in India, has challenged Vanuatu govt's decision to revoke the passport it had granted him and will argue his case in a court in the south-western Pacific island in person.UK sources close to Modi told TOI on Tuesday that he has filed a case in the Vanuatu court appealing the decision of PM Jotham Napat to cancel his citizenship. Modi, an Indian national, is currently in Vanuatu fighting the case, from where he has been tweeting photos of its beaches and praising it as a “heavenly country”.TOI has learnt that there is no extradition request for Modi as of now. “He went to the high commission of India in London to surrender his Indian passport in order to take up Vanuatu citizenship but they refused to give him a surrender certificate. They said it was because of due diligence and checks had to be made,” a source said.The Vanuatu PM’s office issued a statement on Monday saying Napat had instructed Citizenship Commission to “begin proceedings” to cancel Lalit Modi’s Vanuatu passport. The commission is a constitutional body responsible for reviewing, approving, deferring or rejecting citizenship applications. It also has the power to revoke citizenship if granted in violation of Citizenship Act, or other relevant laws.Lalit shared a statement on his X handle, written by Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation on Facebook in Bislama. The English translation read, “The chairman of Vanuatu Citizenship Commission said his office will wait for outcome of court before making a decision on Lalit Modi’s citizenship as a NiVanuatu. Chairman of citizenship commission Charles Maniel made this statement following an order issued by PM Jotham Napat to Citizenship Commission to start the process of cancelling Lalit’s Vanuatu passport due to some allegations that he is facing in court. Chairman Maniel said if the court finds him guilty, the commission will start the process of cancelling his passport and citizenship as a Ni-Vanuatu. Lalit, who is originally from India, bought his Ni-Vanuatu citizenship through citizenship programme of Vanuatu govt.”","Lalit Modi, an Indian national, is currently in Vanuatu fighting the case.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) It was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards.

CBSE Class 10 Mathematics Paper 2025: Exam Difficulty and Student Reactions

Final verdict

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted the Class 10 Mathematics exam today, March 10, 2025, for both the Basic and Standard levels. The three-hour-long exam, which commenced at 10:30 AM and concluded at 1:30 PM, followed the prescribed CBSE exam pattern, ensuring that students were tested across different levels of conceptual understanding and application.The question paper carried a total of 80 marks and was divided into five sections:consisted ofof one mark each,hadworth two marks each,includedcarrying three marks each,featured fourof five marks each, andcomprisedof four marks each. Internal choices were available in select questions in Sections B, C, D, and E, providing some flexibility to students.The algebra section contained a mix of direct and application-based questions. Questions on finding the zeroes of polynomials were straightforward, making this an accessible area for scoring. Quadratic equations had direct word problems, which students found easy to tackle. However, linear equations posed a bit of a challenge as they required more logical reasoning and careful interpretation. The section, overall, remained balanced, offering both simple and moderately difficult questions.Geometry tested students on various properties of triangles, including one question that involved the length of a median. Some of these problems were found to be tricky, requiring deeper conceptual clarity. Coordinate geometry, on the other hand, was relatively easier, with most questions being direct and formula-based. Students who had thoroughly practiced the NCERT examples were able to solve these questions without much difficulty.Trigonometric identity-based questions were directly lifted from NCERT, making them simple for well-prepared students. Some questions required application of trigonometric principles, but none were overly complex. Those who had practiced similar problems from sample papers found this section to be one of the most scoring areas.Basic probability questions were straightforward, testing students’ fundamental understanding of probability concepts. The statistics section included a direct question requiring students to find the median, which was sourced from NCERT. Since these types of problems are commonly covered in practice papers, students found them manageable.Most of the questions in this section were of moderate difficulty, except for one in circles, which some students found particularly challenging. The surface areas and volumes segment involved calculations that, while not conceptually difficult, were somewhat time-consuming. Students who managed their time well were able to complete this section without major issues.Experts, including Shweta Choudhary and Gautam Thakral from Shiv Nadar School, Faridabad, observed that the paper was well-structured with a balanced mix of moderate and slightly challenging questions. The Basic Math paper had three high-order thinking skills (HOTS) MCQs and a slightly difficult question from Circles. Standard Math students found a 5-mark question in Set 2 particularly tricky, while Set 1 included a question not found in the NCERT curriculum, causing some concern.Students’ reactions to the exam varied. Basic Math students, including Pratishtha Bansal, Vidhi Thakur, and others, were content with the paper, describing it as manageable. Standard Math students like Dhwani Ghoota and Aahwaan Khullar found the difficulty level similar to their Pre-Board exams. While some students were confident of securing full marks, others pointed out that certain sets had a slight disparity in difficulty level.Academic expert Mohd Sarif Salmani from Orchids The International School, Malad West, noted that the exam closely followed CBSE’s sample papers. While most MCQs were easy, some sets were slightly lengthy, demanding extra time for completion. Case-based questions required logical interpretation, adding an element of complexity to the exam.Overall, the CBSE Class 10 Mathematics paper was moderate in difficulty, with a few challenging elements. The exam was well-aligned with the syllabus and previous years' question papers, making it approachable for students who had prepared systematically. While some sets had variations in difficulty, the paper was largely fair, ensuring that well-prepared students could score well. With a mix of conceptual and application-based questions, the paper successfully tested students’ mathematical understanding in a comprehensive manner.","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted the Class 10 Mathematics exam today, March 10, 2025, for both the Basic and Standard levels.

MUMBAI: Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt. On Monday, it tabled its first Budget after its landslide win in the assembly polls. It reveals that the state faces the highest debt projection in its history at Rs 9.3 lakh crore and the steepest revenue deficit (gap between income and expenditure) at an estimated Rs 45,891 crores for 25-26.With little financial elbow room, the Budget does not offer new big-ticket schemes. Promises in Mahayuti poll manifesto, including a hike in stipend of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month and a farm loan waiver, have been kept aside for another day. Instead, the Budget has focused on keeping existing schemes going and in trying to keep its debt and fiscal deficit within prescribed limits.Indeed, the estimated outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme, whose beneficiaries are being scrutinised and trimmed, is Rs 10,000 crore lower than last year. The estimated allocation is Rs 36,000 crore for Rs 2025-26.With local body polls looming, the Budget has hiked the district annual plan by 11% from Rs 18,165 crore to an estimated Rs 20,165 crore. In a gesture towards social justice, it has hiked the proposed scheduled caste component of the annual plan by 42% and the tribal component by an estimated 40%. It proposes new taxes, mainly related to motor vehicles, which are expected to generate revenue of Rs 1,125 crore. It has also hiked stamp duty on certain transactions.The financial strain is apparent in the figures. The debt projection is Rs 2 lakh crore, higher than it was in 2024-25 when the figure was Rs 7.1 lakh crore. It is almost thrice as high as it was a decade ago. Its revenue deficit – the gap between the state’s income and expenditure — is more than twice the estimate last year, which was Rs 20,051 crore.However, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who controls the finance portfolio, emphasised that the debt and fiscal deficit were within fiscal limits.The state’s fiscal deficit is estimated at 2.76% of its GSDP. Also, the estimated debt is 18.7% of GSDP while the prescribed limit is 25%.The infrastructure projects are mainly ongoing projects for which no fresh outlay has been mentioned.","Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt.

Investigation ordered amid allegations of cover-up

Legal proceedings revived after initial dismissal

A Delhi court on Tuesday directed the police to file an FIR against former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others in a case of public property defacement . Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Neha Mittal passed the order based on a complaint by Shiv Kumar Saxena, who provided visual evidence of banners featuring Kejriwal and other AAP leaders placed illegally across the city.The court noted that the large-sized banners installed by Kejriwal, former MLA Gulab Singh, and former Dwarka Councillor Nitika Sharma not only defaced public property but also posed traffic hazards. ""Deaths caused by the collapse of illegal hoardings are not new in India,"" the court observed, emphasizing the seriousness of the offence.It ruled that ""hanging a banner board or affixing hoardings"" amounted to defacement under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007. The court instructed the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) to register an FIR immediately under this provision.The court criticized the police's previous handling of the complaint, noting that an action taken report (ATR) submitted by the SHO failed to confirm whether the hoardings existed on the alleged date. ""The ATR stating that no hoardings were found appears to be an attempt to hoodwink the court,"" the order said.The court directed the police to thoroughly investigate the origins of the banners, including details of their printing and installation. It dismissed arguments from the public prosecutor regarding the omission of certain names from the complaint, stating that the investigating agency has the authority to include individuals not originally named.Saxena had first filed his complaint in 2019, alleging that Kejriwal and his associates misused public funds to install large hoardings in Dwarka. A magisterial court initially dismissed the plea in 2022, but a sessions court later ordered a fresh review.""The matter is remanded back to the trial court to decide the application under Section 156(3) CrPC afresh,"" the sessions court had ruled in January.With the latest directive, the Delhi Police now faces a deadline to register the FIR and submit a compliance report, setting the stage for a renewed legal battle for Kejriwal and the AAP leadership.","A Delhi court has ordered the police to file an FIR against former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others in a case of public property defacement.

Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin.

I have already said that even if you give Rs 10,000 crore, we will not accept the destructive plan of Nagpur.

NEW DELHI: Sharing that an investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore will be coming to the NorthEast, home minister Amit Shah Tuesday said no youth from the region would have to migrate to another part of the country for work in next 10 years as they will find employment there itself.Recalling the slew of initiatives made in 10 years of Modi govt to restore peace, lay the foundation of development and increase connectivity in the NorthEast, Shah, in his address at NorthEast Students and Youth Parliament organised by Student Experience in Inter-State Living (SEIL), said budget for NorthEast had been raised by 153% in 2024-25 as compared to 2014-15.Shah elaborated Rs 90,000 crore was spent specifically on roads in the NorthEast, 64 new air routes started and Rs 18,000 crore allocated for railway connectivity in the region. “By 2027, the capitals of all states in the NorthEast will be connected by train, air, and road,” he added.While praising the NorthEast for having youth with highest IQ in India, along with diversity — 220 tribal groups, 160 tribes and rich culture and traditions — the home minister lamented how the region had fallen behind in development under past govts on account of sustained insurgency, violence and blockades. He said the NorthEast had to face a 40-year delay in development, with terrorism and separatism being the primary obstacles.Shah credited BJP govt for always prioritising the NorthEast through initiatives like creating a dedicated ministry for the region under Vajpayee govt, talking and working with insurgent groups to bring them into mainstream and end conflict, and pushing development initiatives in the region. Shah said violent incidents in the NorthEast had declined by 70% between 2014 and 2024 and civilian deaths by 89%. As many as 10,500 insurgents had surrendered with their weapons in the past decade, he added.",Home minister Amit Shah said no youth from the region would have to migrate to another part of the country for work in next 10 years.

India, US will negotiate ‘mutually beneficial’ trade agreement

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Manipur budget and the Centre’s supplementary demand for grants turned into an extension of the language controversy in Tamil Nadu with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday accusing DMK of hypocrisy.“I do not want to name him, but the moment I read the passages, anyone with a small, faint familiarity with Tamil will know who I'm speaking about. So, when this person speaks about Tamil, much horribly, there’s no objection. On the contrary, they would keep his photo. They will also say he is our Dravidian icon,” she said while quoting the “elderly person” from various Tamil magazines in what was seen as a reference to Periyar, the leader of the Dravidian movement.Coming to the defence of her colleague, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Sitharaman said he was made to withdraw his remarks just for saying that the protest by DMK members was uncivil. “But a man who repeatedly says Tamil is a barbaric language, they keep his photograph in every room, they garland him and worship him and say he is the icon of Dravidian movement. Look at their hypocrisy,” she said.She also listed out a series of projects where the Centre was assisting Tamil Nadu.Earlier, replying to the debate on Manipur budget, Sitharaman said all financial support would be provided to the state for economic development as she stressed the overall law and order situation had improved, except for some sporadic incidents.Lok Sabha passed supplementary demands for grants, which entails Rs 51,463 crore additional spending in the current fiscal and the Manipur budget for the 2025-26 fiscal. The lower House also passed, by voice vote, the Rs 1,291 crore demands for excess grants for 2021-22 fiscal and the Rs 1,861 crore supplementary demands for grants for Manipur in 2024-25.“With the collective effort of both the Centre and state govts, there has been an improvement in overall law and order situation in the state, to a large extent, except for some sporadic (incidents),” Sitharaman said.She also assured that all financial support will be provided to Manipur for faster economic development.The FM also took a swipe at TMC’s Kriti Azad, who had been critical of the Modi govt that it had lied in the past 11 years and didn’t fulfil promises it made while he accused the Centre of not releasing funds allocated to states including West Bengal.“I will appreciate Kriti Azad if he speaks about corruption in West Bengal one day. The CAG report has cited corruption of over Rs 2 lakh crore in West Bengal. Even the state CM had acknowledged corruption in the state as she had asked her party colleagues to return the ‘cut money’,” she said amid protests by the TMC MPs.While asserting that India’s tariffs were way below the commitment at WTO, govt on Tuesday told Parliament that New Delhi and Washington intend to negotiate a “mutually beneficial” trade agreement that will seek to lower import duty, address non-tariff barriers, and look at ways to enhance supply chain integration.Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal , who returned from the US, is due to meet exporters on Thursday as they seek clarity on where the negotiations are headed so that they can prepare to navigate through the latest turbulence in global trade amid repeated attacks by US President Donald Trump on India’s “high tariffs‘. On Tuesday, Goyal’s deputy Jitin Prasada also made it clear that currently, the US has not imposed any reciprocal tariff on India.“The US has issued a memorandum on reciprocal trade and tariffs on Feb 13, 2025, wherein the secretary of commerce and US trade representative are to take necessary actions to investigate harm to US and provide a report with detailed proposed remedies , based on which, US action against relevant trading partner could, thereafter be undertaken under any of the relevant US legislations,” he said.",The debate on the Manipur budget and the Centre’s supplementary demand for grants turned into an extension of the language controversy in Tamil Nadu.

NEW DELHI: A heated exchange erupted in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday over Congress president and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge ’s “aapko theek se thokenge” remark, with BJP strongly protesting against the “expression” and demanded its expungement as well as an apology from him.The confrontation was set off while the opposition was agitating for an apology from education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for his remark accusing DMK MPs of fudging facts over the language row and dubbing them “uncivilized” and “undemocratic”. Congress senior MP Digvijaya Singh was speaking when Kharge rose, leading deputy chairperson Harivansh to say that he had already been allowed to speak and that it was now his colleague’s turn.Kharge was not amused. “This is a dictatorship. I request you (deputy chairman) with folded hands to allow me (to speak). Hum poori tayyari se aaye hain aur aapko kya kya thokna hai thik se thokenge, sarkar ko bhi thokenge (the opposition is prepared to corner the govt),” he said while looking at Harivansh. While the deputy chairperson reminded that he was not party to the partisan squabble, Leader of House, health minister J P Nadda came down heavily on the LOP condemning the choice of his language which he termed as derogatory to the Chair.“The language used by the LOP, the aspersions on the chair, is condemnable. This is to be condemned by one and all. The words and language used for the chair is unpardonable, still he should apologise, and the word should be expunged,” he said.Deputy chairman Harivansh too disapproved of Kharge’s remarks, emphasising the need for respectful discourse in the House. In response, Kharge apologised, clarifying that his comments were aimed at govt policies, not the Chair. “I apologise, I never spoke against you. I criticised govt’s policy, and I say sorry if my words seemed harsh to you,” he said.","Congress president and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge ’s “aapko theek se thokenge’ remark.

Delimitation will punish states that controlled population: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delimitation-will-punish-states-that-controlled-population-congress/articleshow/118908686.cms,"Jaisram Ramesh

NEW DELHI: In first remarks on delimitation since a fresh row on the fraught issue broke out last month, Congress Tuesday said states which achieved early success in family planning will lose seats because of the redrawing of constituencies as per the population criteria. The party said delimitation will “penalise” the states that worked in line with the national objective, listing key northern states as major gainers and southern and eastern states as losers.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, “The distribution of seats across states in the Lok Sabha is presently based on the 1971 Census. Article 82 that was amended with effect from Feb 2002 provides for a fresh distribution based on the population data from the first Census after 2026.”He quoted a study done by Milan Vaishnav and Jamie Hintson in 2019, which distributed seats across the states based on the estimated population in 2026. As per its findings, Ramesh said, “The states that lose seats are Tamil Nadu (8), Kerala (8), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (8), Odisha (3), West Bengal (4), Karnataka (2), Himachal Pradesh (1), Punjab (1) and Uttarakhand (1).” He added that Assam, J&K and Maharashtra will not gain or lose any seats. “The states that gain are Uttar Pradesh (11), Bihar (10), Rajasthan (6), Madhya Pradesh (4), Jharkhand (1), Haryana (1), Gujarat (1), Delhi (1), and Chhattisgarh (1).”Ramesh said the states that controlled population “will be penalised for it”.While Congress has in the past said that delimitation should not hurt the states which performed well in population control , this is its first remark after a controversy broke out following the red flag raised by Tamil Nadu last month. There has been a view that as a national party, Congress may prefer to play safe as opposing delimitation on population criteria may result in a backlash in the heartland states whose share would go up in such an exercise.DMK head and TN chief minister MK Stalin Friday wrote to his counterparts of southern states and Odisha, West Bengal and Punjab to be part of a Joint Action Committee launched for an “uncompromising fight against this unfair exercise”. He has also invited CPI(M), CPI, Congress, AIMIM, JD(S), Akali Dal, YSRCP, TDP, BRS, Jana Sena, TMC, AAP and BJP units of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Odisha and West Bengal for a meeting on March 22.",Congress said states which achieved early success in family planning will lose seats.

Amid doubts raised by some opposition parties on voter lists and electors photo identity cards ( EPIC ), the Election Commission has invited suggestions from all national and state parties by April 30 on any unresolved issues at the level of electoral registration officer (ERO), district election officer (DEO) or chief electoral officer (CEO).The initiative to engage with political parties — including through a suggested interaction with their presidents and senior leaders at a mutually convenient time — to allay their concerns and strengthen electoral processes came even as the EC separately heard delegations of parties like BJP TMC and BJD on Tuesday on issues ranging from bogus voters, duplicate EPIC numbers to voter turnout data.The BJP delegation claimed that over 13 lakh duplicate voters were added to the electoral roll in West Bengal during TMC’s rule, with “systematic infiltration” of illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants into the rolls and 8,415 voters issued the same EPIC numbers. TMC raised concerns regarding duplicate EPIC numbers, and duplicate, shifted and dead voters.The BJD delegation requested the record of votes polled during simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls in the state last year, which, the EC said, was already shared with candidates’ polling agents in Form 17C.",The Election Commission has invited suggestions from all national and state parties by April 30 on any unresolved issues.

Later, a TMC delegation of 10 MPs marched to the Election Commission for a meeting with the poll panel. BJD also met the full bench of the EC to flag the issue.DMK MPs staged a protest in the Parliament complex against the three-language formula under the new National Education Policy and demanded that education minister Dharmendra Pradhan apologise for his remarks against the Tamil Nadu govt. Congress MPs from Tamil Nadu wore black in solidarity and joined the protest. DMK MPs raised slogans outside the House and carried posters saying ‘Tamil Nadu educates, BJP manipulates’. MDMK MP Vaiko alleged the three-language policy was aimed at destroying states.TMC leaders met the EC and alleged that Aadhaar cards were being cloned which could lead to the possibility of these being used for fake voter registrations. The party demanded that the EC issue a separate list of voter deletions, new additions and modifications with every new revised poll roll.Party MP Sagarika Ghose expressed scepticism over the poll panel’s recent statement assuring that the concerns would be addressed in three months. “This is an extremely serious issue. Ever since West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee flagged the issue, all parties have realised it's a serious issue that poses a threat to electoral democracy,” she said, adding, “The EC says it will resolve the issue in three months... We are asking if you don't even know the number, how are you giving the deadline?”On the delimitation issue, Rajya Sabha proceedings were disrupted for about 40 minutes as opposition MPs stormed the well, protesting the impact of constituency redrawing based solely on population, which they argued would disadvantage southern states.","Opposition parties kept up their protests inside and outside Parliament over issues such as duplicate EPIC numbers, the three-language formula and delimitation.

TMC slams Suvendu for ‘dangerous and provocative’ remarks



KOLKATA: Bengal’s leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari sparked outrage on Tuesday by declaring BJP would “physically throw Muslim MLAs out of the assembly” after the party “forms the next govt” in the Trinamool-governed state that goes to polls in 2026.CM Mamata Banerjee ’s party protested the remark, terming it “hate speech” and questioning Adhikari’s “mental stability” after the defection of BJP’s Haldia MLA Tapasi Mondal to its ranks the previous day.Adhikari, who was suspended from the assembly on Feb 17 till the end of the budget session, labelled the Mamata govt “a communal administration that is behaving like the second version of Muslim League”. “The people of Bengal will uproot them this time,” he told reporters outside the assembly.The state BJP brass declined comment on Suvendu Adhikari’s remarks.Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said it didn’t behove an elected representative to use such incendiary language against fellow legislators. “In Parliament or state assemblies, there can be debate and arguments. But to rake up religion and target MLAs belonging to a specific community is contrary to the principles of the Constitution. It’s dangerous, provocative and depraved. It’s also a criminal offence.”This isn’t the first instance of Adhikari’s statements causing unease even in his party. After BJP’s below-par performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in Bengal, Adhikari had called for an end to the party’s ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ slogan.“I will say ‘Jo hamare saath, hum unke saath’. We don’t need minority morcha,” he said, causing party colleagues to publicly disown the remark.","Bengal's leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari sparked outrage on Tuesday by declaring BJP would “physically throw Muslim MLAs out of the assembly” after the party “forms the next govt” in the Trinamool-governed state that goes to polls in 2026.

Don’t arrest Ranya’s husband, says HC

(Inputs from Rajiv Kalkod in Bengaluru)

BENGALURU: Karnataka’s Congress govt has ordered a probe into whether DGP (Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao had any role in the alleged gold-smuggling racket of his daughter and Kannada actress Ranya Rao. A one-man committee, led by additional chief secretary (ACS) Gaurav Gupta, will investigate the matter.Senior officers were reportedly unaware that a constable had escorted the actor -- with 14.2kg gold bars strapped to her body -- out of Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) when Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials intercepted her on March 3. She had arrived from Dubai and was arrested soon after.“Gupta’s inquiry will focus on the allegations against Rao, saying it was he who directed the constable to pick up Ranya. CID will probe alleged dereliction of duty by local police in the same episode,” a senior officer said. The move follows allegations by opposition BJP that the govt was shielding the big fish in the smuggling ring.Investigations revealed a violation of police protocol. Protocol staff told DRI officials that they had instructions to pick up Ranya. CBI has issued notices to four personnel from police protocol wing to explain why they were escorting Ranya out of the airport.Late Monday night, CBI sleuths raided Ranya’s Bengaluru flat and seized key documents. A special court for economic offences has adjourned hearing on Ranya’s bail petition to Wednesday. DRI sleuths had filed objections on Tuesday.Also under the scanner are Ranya’s brother K Rushab for possible links between the gold case and a multi-crore bitcoin scam being probed by a special investigating team (SIT) of the state police’s CID.“We need to know how payments were made for the purchase of 14.2kg gold carried by Ranya from Dubai. We are exploring all angles, including cryptocurrency,” a source said.Karnataka HC passed an interim order Tuesday barring DRI from arresting Jatin Vijayakumar Hukkeri, the husband of Ranya, without following the due process of law.

DALTONGANJ/RANCHI/HAZARIBAG: Three days after motorcycle-borne men gunned down a senior NTPC official in Hazaribag, a Jharkhand police anti-terrorist squad killed self-styled don Aman Sahu, whose gang was among those suspected to be behind the official’s murder.Witnesses and police said while Sahu, 30, was being brought to Ranchi from Chhattisgarh’s Raipur jail to appear in an ongoing NIA court case, a shootout ensued when his accomplices tried to free him by hurling bombs at the prison van transporting him.All MLAs, cutting across party lines, said Sahu deserved to die, while govt said in the assembly that the circumstances leading to the encounter would be investigated. “Police have the right to retaliate in self-defence. Tuesday’s encounter is also a message to other criminals that the state govt will not tolerate them,” state minister Sudivya Kumar said. Though leader of opposition Babulal Marandi backed the police and said it should not sit idle when shot at, former CM Champai Soren, however, criticised the police for failing to ensure Sahu’s security and demanded a CBI probe. “Sahu would have revealed the truth and that was why he was killed,” he claimed.Sahu’s family members, including his gangster brother Aakash who is currently in jail, countered police version through his counsel and claimed that encounter was stage-managed. The incident took place nearly 173 km from Ranchi.Palamu SP Reeshma Ramesan said the hurling of bombs at the van created an abrupt commotion and Sahu snatched a rifle from ATS havildar Rakesh Kumar and fired at him. “The cop was also injured in the grappling incident and was later admitted to Daltonganj medical college with an abrasion on his thigh. Sahu paid with his life in retaliatory action. The rear glass pane of the van ferrying Sahu was totally destroyed by the bombs,” Ramesan said.Said to be connected to gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, Sahu was also likely to be questioned about involvement in the killing of NTPC official Kumar Gaurav and shooting at a Ranchi-based coal trader last week for extortion. His operations, mainly murders, shooting warnings and extortion, stretched beyond Jharkhand to West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.Aman Sahu, who had 130 cases against him, was tied with ropes and handcuffed when his accomplices hurled two bombs at the police van at about 9.15 am at Anharee Dhounra, 16 km from Daltonganj town, Palamu district .“Aakash, who applied for bail soon after the encounter to attend his brother’s last rites, expressed fear that he, too, may be eliminated similarly. Appearing in his bail hearing online, Aakash also expressed concern for the safety of his family members,” Hemant Shikarwar, Akash’s counsel, said.Later, Ramesan said a magisterial inquiry would be conducted since Sahu was on judicial transit remand. “We will be sending a report about the encounter to the NHRCwithin two days,” the SP said.","Self-styled don Aman Sahu was among those suspected to be behind NTPC official's murder.

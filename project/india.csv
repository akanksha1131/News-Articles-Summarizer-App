NEW DELHI: CRPF ’s CoBRA battalion, which specialises in jungle warfare, has neutralised 20 hardcore Left-wing extremists in Jharkhand, including two central committee (CCM) members, along with the state police in the current year.The two eliminated CCM members are Vivek Chandri Yadav alias Prayag, who was killed in an operation in Bokaro in April, and Sahdev Soren, killed with two of his aides on Monday.Also neutralised over the past few months were two Bihar-Jharkhand special area committee members, four zonal committee members, two sub-zonal committee members, and three area committee members and several other notorious naxal cadres.The CoBRA commandos have also apprehended three Naxals — including one sub-zonal committee member, one area committee member and 1 cadre — striking fear among the remaining ranks of the Naxals, said a CRPF official.“The troops of 209 CoBRA have, in addition, recovered 32 sophisticated automatic weapons, 345 kgs of explosives, 88 detonators, 2,500 live ammunition, and large quantities of war-like stores,” the official added.As many as 18 Naxal hideouts and 39 bunkers were busted by CoBRA teams in Jharkhand, which has had a crippling effect on CPI(Maoist)’s operational and organisational capabilities, a CRPF officer told TOI.CRPF, in coordination with Jharkhand Police, has been instrumental in removing the last vestiges of Naxalism in Jharkhand; their joint operations had in 2022 eliminated Naxalites from Burhapahad area and Chakrabandha.","CRPF ’s CoBRA battalion, which specialises in jungle warfare, has neutralised 20 hardcore Left-wing extremists in Jharkhand.

Sahdev Soren encounter: ﻿Slain Jharkhand Maoist leader had escaped from jail van in 2012; killed Babulal Marandi’s son in 2007,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sahdev-soren-encounter-slain-jharkhand-maoist-leader-had-escaped-from-jail-van-in-2012-killed-babulal-marandis-son-in-2007/articleshow/123912553.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Nearly thirteen years after fellow Maoists helped him escape by ambushing his jail van on its way to a Giridih court, Sahdev Soren, a CPI(Maoist) central committee member (CCM) wanted for over 80 cases of Naxal violence, including the 2007 Chilkhari massacre that had killed former Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi’s son and 19 others, was neutralised in a joint operation by the CRPF’s CoBRA battalion and Jharkhand police.Also killed with Soren, who carried a total Rs 1.4 crore reward in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, were his two aides. They are Raghunath Hembram @ Chanchal, a Bihar-Jharkhand special area committee member carrying a bounty of Rs 25 lakh and Ramkhelawan Ganjhu @ Birsen, a zonal committee member with a Rs 10 lakh award in Jharkhand.Sahdev Soren was on Jharkhand’s ‘most wanted’ list for several years and mostly active in Bokaro, Giridih and Hazaribagh districts, or the north Chotanagpur region. It was known for almost five years that he had been unofficially taken into the central committee, though there exists no official CPI(Maoist) document to confirm this. After more than a dozen members of his unit were neutralised in sustained operations since January 2025, he had shifted base to the Hazaribagh-Giridih border along with two of his remaining aides — Raghunath Hembram and Ramkhelawan — to escape a similar fate.But that was not to be. On Monday, the counter-Naxal forces caught up with him and neutralised him along with Raghunath and Birsen, marking a total clean-up of Left-wing extremists from the Bokaro region.Announcing this on ‘X’, home minister Amit Shah posted: “Today a joint team of the CRPF CoBRA battalion and Jharkhand police have struck a major success in counter-Naxal efforts...the notorious Naxal commander and CCM Sahdev Soren @ Parvesh has been eliminated by the forces along with two others ‘reward-carrying’ Naxalites Raghunath Hembram and Birsen Ganjhu.“With this operation, north Jharkhand’s Bokaro area is totally free from Left-wing extremism (LWE). Very soon, LWE will be eliminated from across the country,” he declared.Soren is the seventh CCM to be neutralised so far this year.Soren had joined Left-wing extremism in the early Nineties. He started with arranging logistics and being an informer for Naxalites but was soon handed a rifle; it was politburo member Misir Besra who trained him how to use it. He was involved in several Naxal attacks between 1994 and 2000.Among the key ones, apart from Chilkhari massacre in which Babulal Marandi’s son was among 20 killed his brother fired at on a football field; are the murder of then Munger SP; the 2005 Bhelwaghati massacre that had left 18 villagers dead; and multiple incidents of looting of police weapons.","Sahdev Soren, a CPI(Maoist) central committee member (CCM) wanted for over 80 cases of Naxal violence, was neutralised in a joint operation by the CRPF’s CoBRA battalion and Jharkhand police.

Mike Hesson on India's handshake snub: 'We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that'

NEW DELHI: India’s commanding seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup on Sunday may have looked routine on the scoreboard, but the aftermath turned the Dubai International Stadium into the stage of a diplomatic drama. Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha refused to attend the post-match presentation ceremony in protest after Indian players declined to shake hands, an incident now at the centre of what many are calling “handshake-gate.”The flashpoint unfolded moments after India captain Suryakumar Yadav sealed the match with a towering six. Instead of waiting to exchange the customary handshakes with his opponents, Suryakumar shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube before leading his teammates straight into the dressing room. Within seconds, India’s support staff shut the door, leaving Pakistan’s players stranded in the middle of the ground.Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson expressed frustration at the snub. “We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they were already gone to the changing room, so that was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match,” he told reporters.The Pakistani players lingered on the field for a couple of minutes before retreating. Hesson, visibly agitated, rushed towards India’s dressing room, only to find the doors locked. He was later spotted in a tense conversation with match referee Andy Pycroft. In solidarity with his team, captain Salman Ali Agha chose not to appear at the post-match presentation, leaving broadcasters scrambling.Pakistan’s team management confirmed their protest in a statement. “The behaviour of Indian players was against the spirit of sportsmanship. That is why skipper (Salman) Agha was not sent to the post-match ceremony,” it read.India, however, stood firm. At his press conference, skipper Suryakumar Yadav said: “The team was aligned with the government and Board of Control for Cricket in India in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team. We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity. We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”The political overtones were impossible to ignore. The match was the first between the neighbours since a military conflict in May. That escalation followed an April terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which India accused Pakistan of supporting.While India’s spinners and Suryakumar’s unbeaten 47 scripted a dominant on-field win, the real talking point was India's refusal to shake hands after the match and Pakistan’s captain protesting in silence — by refusing to show up at the presentation, amplifying the rift that cricket could not bridge.",India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused to shake hands with Pakistan players.

HYDERABAD: A software professional recently approached Cyberabad's cyber crime police, claiming that he had lost Rs 1 crore to cyber fraudsters.Police said the fraudsters, under the pretext of stock market investments, convinced the victim that he had earned Rs 32 crore. However, when he attempted to withdraw the money, he was denied access and given various excuses, while the fraudsters tried to extort more money.Officials said that the victim initially invested Rs 50,000 and later increased his investment, believing he was purchasing legitimate stocks. He was also regularly sent updates about the investment status.The victim had first fallen into the trap after being added to an unsolicited WhatsApp group. Once he realised he had been conned, he approached the police.In executing the fraud, the victim was redirected to a website impersonating a page belonging to a well-known trading company.","The victim initially invested Rs 50,000 and later increased his investment, believing he was purchasing legitimate stocks.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: Has deadline for Income Tax Returns filing been extended beyond September 15?

The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15, clarifying that the due date remains unchanged.In a post on X, the department said: “A fake news is in circulation stating that the due of filing ITRs (originally due on 31.07.2025, and extended to 15.09.2025) has been further extended to 30.09.2025. The due date for filing ITRs remains 15.09.2025.”The clarification came amid a wave of unverified messages circulating online.The I-T department has urged taxpayers to rely only on updates from its verified handle @IncomeTaxIndia and avoid being misled by false claims. It further noted that its helpdesk is working “on a 24x7 basis” to support taxpayers with ITR filing, tax payment and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and X.Over six crore ITRs had already been filed for the Assessment Year 2025-26 as of Saturday.The department thanked taxpayers and professionals for their efforts, while reminding those yet to file to do so before the September 15 deadline to avoid last-minute delays, penalties and interest.The filing window had originally closed on July 31 but was extended to September 15 due to revisions introduced in ITR forms earlier this year.These “structural and content revisions” were rolled out in April–May, requiring changes to filing utilities and back-end systems, which prompted the extension.While this relaxation covered individuals, HUFs and non-audit entities, officials have underlined that a further extension is “unlikely.”Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, though this attracts late fees under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act — Rs 1,000 for income up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for income above that threshold.Delays also trigger interest liabilities under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C. Moreover, belated filers are shifted to the new tax regime by default and lose the ability to carry forward certain business or capital losses.ITR submissions have been steadily rising in recent years. For AY 2024-25, a record 7.28 crore returns were filed by July 31, 2024, up from 6.77 crore the previous year, marking a 7.5% annual increase.With Monday marking the final day, the department has reiterated its appeal: file early, comply on time, and avoid penalties.",The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15.

Suryakumar Yadav's Instagram post

Despite being a one-sided contest filled with standout individual performances, the India–Pakistan clash at the Dubai International Stadium may still go down as the tournament’s most talked-about game — but for reasons beyond cricket.By Monday morning, the ‘handshake-gate’ will dominate the popular narrative on social media feeds and airwaves, and be a hot topic of conversation at water coolers and coffee machines in schools and offices.The cast of characters — Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav , his counterpart Salman Ali Agha, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson, and match referee Andy Pycroft — were all involved in the drama.As is cricket’s longstanding tradition, the players usually “shake hands and make up” after the game. They do it for the sake of sportsmanship.However, the Indian cricket players were not in a mood to forgive and forget, and instead took a stand for all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav posted on Instagram: ""This win is dedicated to the armed forces of India and the victims of the Pahalgam attack. Jai Hind.""Surya's deputy Shubman Gill echoed his skipper's sentiments. He wrote on Instagram: ""Today’s win is dedicated to the victims of Pahalgam and to our brave armed forces who continue to safeguard us.The spirit of India lives on both on and off the field. Jai Hind.""Interestingly, at the start of the tournament, Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav, during the captains’ press conference, shook hands with Mohsin Naqvi, chief of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), president of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), and also Pakistan's Federal Interior Minister. But he refused to shake hands with his counterpart Salman Ali Agha — first at the toss and later at the end of the match.Suryakumar hit the winning six to finish the game, walked towards batting partner Shivam Dube, shook his hand, and then walked off, leaving the Pakistani players in the middle of the ground.The Pakistan team, led by Salman Ali Agha, stood in the middle for a couple of minutes before starting to walk back to their dressing room.Seeing his players head back, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson raced towards Team India’s dressing room, but by then the doors were shut.A visibly upset Hesson was seen having a long conversation with match referee Andy Pycroft. After standing there for four to five minutes, a frustrated Hesson walked back towards the pitch.In response, Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest against the behaviour of the Indian team, as the ceremony host was also an Indian — former India captain and coach Ravi Shastri.India captain Suryakumar Yadav defended the snub in his post-match press conference, saying that the team was ""aligned with the government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India"" in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team.""We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity,"" Suryakumar said. ""We want to dedicate today's win to the armed forces.""Pakistan's head coach Mike Hesson told reporters he was ""disappointed"" with the Indian team's decision.""We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game,"" the former Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) coach said.""We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that.

And Gauti’s (coach Gautam Gambhir ’s) message has just been very professional, about not worrying about things that are not in our control,” he had said.However, at the end of the game Team India players didn’t take their coach's advice of being ""professional"" to heart and instead did the opposite.And yes, India did win the match comprehensively by seven wickets and cemented their place in the Super Four, where they might again face Pakistan.",Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused to shake hands with Pakistan's Salman Ali Agha at the toss and at the end of the match.

NAVI MUMBAI: Rabale police have filed an FIR following a road rage incident in which the helper of a cement mixer was kidnapped by a person driving an SUV which brushed past the heavy vehicle on Mulund-Airoli road Saturday evening.DCP (zone 1) Pankaj Dahane said the SUV was in the name of Puja Automobiles, which is registered at the address of suspended IAS officer Puja Khedkar's Pune bungalow.The cleaner was rescued from Khedkar's bungalow on Sunday, Rabale senior inspector Balkrushna Sawant said.However, when police later went to the residence in connection with the probe, they found it locked, according to senior inspector Uttam Bhajnawale of Chatushrungi police. The driver of the SUV is on the run.“We have summoned the owner of the SUV,” Rabale SI Balkrushna Sawant said.

"SC refuses to stall waqf act, but stays some provisions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-stall-waqf-act-but-stays-some-provisions/articleshow/123908619.cms,"Abolishing waqf by user clause not arbitrary: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court, in an interim order Monday, refused to stay the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, prima facie finding none of its provisions illegal but suspended implementation of 'five-year practice of Islam' for dedicating a property to waqf till the Centre framed rules on it.The court also stayed a section of the amended law that provided for derecognition as soon as inquiry by an officer above the rank of collector begins into the status of a property as waqf, saying that it was prima facie arbitrary and not in line with separation of powers. It said that a determination by the official could not be treated as final, and as conceded by solicitor general Tushar Mehta during the hearings, could be challenged before the waqf tribunal and jurisdictional HCs.Even as Supreme Court on Monday stayed some provisions of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, it found no merit in the challenge to the provision for inquiry into govt land being declared waqf property by an officer above the rank of collector and said, ""The govt holds the property in trust for its citizens. Any person who has wrongful possession of such property cannot be permitted to claim the same as his own property.""The bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said that once the inquiry commences to determine whether a govt property has been wrongly identified or declared as waqf, the mutawalli of waqf board cannot create third-party interest in the property till the final adjudication by judiciary.SC rejected the arguments of challengers to the provision in the Waqf Act confining waqf only to Muslims and barring non-Muslims from dedicating their properties. SC said as the petitioners argued that waqf is specific to Islam, deletion of non-Muslims from the ambit of donation is not arbitrary. ""In any case, if such a person desires to donate his property, he can do so by giving or donating it to a trust or creating a trust for any of the purposes which were included in Section 104 of the Waqf Act, 1995,"" the bench said.To preserve religious character of Central Waqf Council and state waqf boards, the bench directed the Centre and states not to have more than four and three non-Muslims in the council and each board, respectively, recording the assurance by the SG during the hearing. SC also told the states to, as far as possible, avoid appointment of a non-Muslim chief executive officer, who is a serving joint secretary, of the waqf boards. The court refused to stay some provisions: challenge in court, in joint parliamentary committee, and Parliament, deletion of provision which barred non-Muslims from creating waqfs, application of Limitations Act to waqf properties, bar on tribal lands from being declared waqf, bar on declaring ASI properties to be waqf.On another intensely contested provision of abolishing 'waqf by user' provision, the bench said right from 1923 there had been a mandatory provision for registration of waqf property. ""We are, therefore, of the view that if mutawallis for a period of 102 years could not get waqf registered, as required under the earlier provisions, they cannot claim that they be allowed to continue with the waqf even if they are not registered,"" it said. ""If the legislature, on noticing misuse of the waqf properties, finds that after the enactment of the impugned Act all such applications should be accompanied by a copy of the waqf deed, the same cannot be said to be arbitrary,"" SC said.It also found no illegality in the prospective abolition of the 'waqf by user' clause. ""We are of the view that if the legislature, in 2025, finds that on account of the concept of 'waqf by user', huge govt properties have been encroached upon and to stop the menace, it takes steps for deletion of the said provision, the said amendment, prima facie, cannot be said to be arbitrary,"" bench said, and cited how in Andhra Pradesh the state waqf board notified thousands of acres of govt land as waqf and which was set aside by SC.","Supreme Court refused to stay the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. It suspended implementation of 'five-year practice of Islam' for dedicating a property to waqf.

Mystery of Agatha Christie's India story finally solved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-of-agatha-christies-india-story-finally-solved/articleshow/123877784.cms,"Agatha Christie autographs copies of her books

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

Mathew Prichard (also in photo right), who’s settled the India question once and for all, with his grandmother Agatha Christie

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Jan 11, 1960 |

Jan 20, 1960 |

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

Feb 16, 1960 |

Oct 30, 1961 |

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

Dar said the train’s capacity is limited to around 180 metric tonnes and is still in its infancy. “Our priority will be to keep the Srinagar-Jammu highway open for traffic,” he added.Chief minister Omar Abdullah Monday said, “If the Centre is unable to open and maintain it, they should hand it over to us.”Omar said he would speak to Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari to press for the immediate reopening of the road.Earlier, the LG said the 7-day-a-week parcel train will transport 23–24 tonnes of apples and other perishable goods every day.“This will provide a faster and more economical transportation mode, strengthen market linkages, and bring improvement in the lives and livelihoods of farmers,” Sinha said.Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers Union president Bashir Ahmad Basheer told TOI, “Early varieties like Gala are already perishing on the highway, as fruit-laden vehicles have not moved beyond Qazigund in the past eight days. This is a serious crisis.”Mandi representatives in Sopore, home to Kashmir’s oldest fruit market, demanded that if the administration cannot restore the Srinagar-Jammu highway, control should be handed over to the Army, “which can make it operational within a day.”Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone accused the Omar govt of wandering aimlessly on the issue. “Inclement weather is not the fault of the govt. But sitting like a mute spectator and doing nothing is criminal,” Lone said, urging the CM to “sit with your officers and stakeholders and work out a strategy.”Iltija Mufti, PDP representative, accused the govt of “not acting” on the crucial issue.",Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha flagged off the first dedicated parcel train from Budgam to New Delhi Monday.

D'Souza vs. Mohd. Ishfaq wherein, it was pointed out that no sensible professional would intentionally commit an act or omission which would result in harm or injury to a patient as the reputation of that professional would be at stake and a single failure may cost him or her dear in that lapse.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side.

Mumbai institute finds gene tied to rare male infertility disorder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-institute-finds-gene-tied-to-rare-male-infertility-disorder/articleshow/123911167.cms,"MUMBAI: For years, a rare form of male infertility, in which men are born without the tubes that carry sperm, was blamed on a single gene tied to cystic fibrosis. Now, researchers in Mumbai have identified a broader set of genes in Indian men, including one passed from mothers to sons, that help explain this condition, called congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD).Although the research gained momentum in 2019, its roots stretch back to 2011. The findings promise not only better understanding of the condition but also more informed treatment options and genetic counselling for couples. Fresh from Parel's ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRCH), a paper published earlier this week in Reproductive Sciences reported that so far, mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) explain congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in roughly 70% of Indian men with the condition. But until now, the remaining 30-40% had no clear genetic explanation. When only one tube is missing, the condition is called congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD). It sometimes occurs alongside kidney abnormalities but is rare, accounting for 0.04% of male infertility cases.When both tubes are missing, CBAVD accounts for 2-3% of Indian male infertility cases and up to 25% of men with obstructive azoospermia (no sperm in semen).For these couples, IVF is the only option. ""Stigma is associated with infertility. Women are often blamed even if the biological issue lies with the man,"" said Dr Prakash Pawar, a urologist at Sion Hospital. ""Male infertility is a growing global issue. High-burden tertiary care hospitals see a few cases of CBAVD annually. ""Of the 93 men in the study, 19 had tested negative for the known CFTR gene. Using whole-exome sequencing on these 19 samples, the researchers discovered a new X-linked gene called ADGRG2, which can be passed from mothers to sons and is linked to CBAVD. This gene was found in two of the 19 men studied. ""Research groups in Europe and other countries have also reported similar pathogenic variants in ADGRG2. What makes our study significant is that this is the first time ADGRG2 has been identified in Indian men with infertility,"" said Dr Rahul Gajbhiye, scientist at ICMR-NIRRCH and principal investigator of the study. He said that in light of the findings, whole-exome sequencing should be considered for genetic screening of CBAVD, covering CFTR, ADGRG2, and other candidate genes, before couples undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a procedure in which sperm is retrieved directly from the testicles and injected into the egg in the lab.","For years, a rare form of male infertility was blamed on a single gene tied to cystic fibrosis.

SC's endorsement of clauses in 2025 Act based on 100-yr mismanagement history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scs-endorsement-of-clauses-in-2025-act-based-on-100-yr-mismanagement-history/articleshow/123911026.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court's prima facie endorsement of non-arbitrariness of provisions of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, was principally based on a 100-year history of mismanagement and misappropriation of sprawling properties and valuable assets donated for charity by benevolent Muslims and the remedial regulations enacted since 1923.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih traced more than 100 years of documented history relating to regulation of waqfs starting from the Waqf Act of 1923, which noticed that the endowments made by pious and public-spirited Muslims were being wasted or systematically misappropriated by those managing them.Writing the 128-page judgment on the interim order, CJI Gavai said the enactment of the 1923 Act was necessitated as people increasingly found waqf endowment being used as a ""clever device"" to tie up property to defeat creditors and generally to evade the law under the cloak of a plausible dedication to the Almighty. ""A system of compulsory registration not merely about the fact of the waqf but also the nature, extent and other incidents of the waqf was found to be necessary even at that point of time,"" the CJI said, and drew similarity with similar clauses under the 2025 Act.SC said that the 1923 Act made it an obligation for each waqf to furnish its particulars and allowed verification of credentials, including accounts, by officials.""Not only that, but a penalty was also provided for a person who failed to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.""After referring to the Bengal Waqf Act of 1934, the bench took note of the provisions of the Waqf Act, 1954, under which a state govt was required to inquire into the existence of waqfs and the properties administered by them through an official. ""The provisions with regard to compulsory registration of every waqf also continued under the 1954 Act,"" it said.To find out the working of the 1954 Act, Centre had appointed an inquiry committee, which in 1975 recommended ""no Mutawalli who has failed to have waqfs registered as required under the 1954 Act should be provided with the facility of enforcing any right in a court of law unless he has duly registered his waqf as required under the Act.""Though the 1954 Act was amended in 1959, 1964 and 1969, the committee's recommendation was incorporated in the Waqf Amendment Act of 1984, which was opposed by Muslims leading to the law being placed in cold storage.In another parallel with the 2025 Act, SC said the 1995 Waqf Amendment Act provided a detailed procedure for registration of waqfs and bar on enforcement of rights on behalf of unregistered ones, which was in existence till 2013 and was removed hurriedly before the 2014 LS polls.",A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih traced more than 100 years of documented history relating to regulation of waqfs.

Only 45% of students feel ready for life beyond school: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-45-of-students-feel-ready-for-life-beyond-school-study/articleshow/123910895.cms,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Less than half of students, including those in India, felt well prepared for their next educational step, and only 45% felt ready for life beyond school, according to a global survey.Conducted by Cambridge University Press and Assessment, the survey - Preparing Learners to Thrive in a Changing World: The View from International Education - will be released on Tuesday and drew responses from 3,021 teachers and 3,840 students across 150 countries, including a weighted sample of South-Asian participants.Subject knowledge, once the undisputed passport to success, now looks more like a short-term currency. Though teachers and students still see it as vital for clearing exams, it was the least-selected priority for life after school, according to the report.Teachers are more optimistic: more than two-thirds say their students are ready for the next step and many stress leadership and self-management skills.Yet complacency looms; an Indian student observed: ""As AI grows... memorising subject knowledge matters less.""Students still prize subject knowledge for exams but ranked leadership, management and business skills highest for life beyond school. An Indian teacher noted that many pupils ""have made short-term plans for next one or two years"" yet are unsure about postgraduation choices.According to Rod Smith, Cambridge's head of international education, South Asian parents, who once focused on which university their child could enter, now ask whether schooling ""will prepare you with the kind of skills that are going to make you successful in a future world"". Self-management illustrates the gap: one in four teachers identified it as the hardest skill to teach, and about 19% of students found it hardest to learn. Technology amplifies the challenge - two-thirds of students worry about distraction from devices, and 88% of teachers say attention spans are shrinking.Interpersonal skills also suffer. Teachers cite fear of judgment and social anxiety as the biggest barriers to developing interpersonal skills, and 60% see decreased social skills as a major downside of technology, the survey found.A school leader from India warned that technology connects learners but ""has limited understanding in the way it offers solutions,"" narrowing world views. Another student said communication skills are vital because ""we need to exchange ideas... before it gets out of hand."" Experts in the report stress that subject knowledge is more important than ever; without a solid base, AI can mislead rather than empower. Smith echoed this, saying over-reliance on technology ""leads you down dead end. ""Cambridge plans to help schools balance rigorous subject knowledge with chances to practise self-management, leadership & communication.For India, where parents have invested heavily in education, the findings are a call to action. Students may undervalue their readiness, but teachers see potential. Giving young people discipline with technology, confidence to collaborate and curiosity to keep learning could turn promise into an advantage in the future.","Less than half of students, including those in India, felt well prepared for their next educational step.

PM puts thrust on

self-reliance in defence production

KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Monday directed the defence ministry to 'swiftly implement concrete steps' to achieve greater jointness, atmanirbharta and innovation to meet future challenges, amid the continuing differences among the Army, Navy and IAF over the creation of theatre commands for an integrated and cost-effective war-fighting machinery.Inaugurating the biennial three-day combined commanders conference (CCC) at Kolkata, the PM also reviewed the security situation and operational readiness of the armed forces in the context of the ""new normal"" created by Operation Sindoor, while being briefed on the future of warfare in the backdrop of emerging technology and tactics. tnnAs per the ""new normal"" laid down by PM Modi after the strikes against Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities, any act of cross-border terror will be treated as an act of war and be met with a decisive response. ""Moreover, the PM has made it clear that Pakistan's nuclear sabre-rattling will not prevent India from striking terror bases, with no distinction being made between terrorists and their sponsors,"" an official said.The PM complimented the armed forces for the success of Operation Sindoor as well as the integral role they play in nation-building, anti-piracy, safe return of Indian citizens from conflict zones and providing humanitarian assistance to friendly countries.The CCC at Easter Command headquarters in Vijay Durg, Kolkata, is being attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff Anil Chauhan, the three service chiefs and other top military officers and bureaucrats. Singh will address the commanders on Tuesday.Defence officials said that key topics under discussion include enhancing inter-service coordination, streamlining procurement processes, adopting advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and unmanned systems, and improving training frameworks for multi-domain operations. The conference emphasised the need to shift from traditional paradigms of warfare to agile, network-centric, and technology-driven military strategies.Reviewing the defence reforms implemented over the last two years, and the plan for the next two years, the PM's main thrust was on the urgent need for jointness among the armed forces, self-reliance in defence production and innovation to enhance operational readiness and ""prevail against any eventuality"" in the years ahead.The Modi govt has been pushing for the long-pending creation of the tri-Service integrated theatre commands (ITCs), in the most radical military reorganisation envisaged since Independence. The progress, however, has been slow. India currently has 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which do not have the requisite synergy in planning, logistics and operations.The plan is to have two ""adversary-specific"" ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur.","PM Narendra Modi has directed the defence ministry to'swiftly implement concrete steps' to achieve greater jointness, atmanirbharta and innovation to meet future challenges.

NEW DELHI: The sex ratio at birth recorded a decline for the fourth successive year in Delhi, with 920 females being born in 2024 per 1,000 males, compared with 922 in 2023 and 929 in 2022. Delhi govt officials said the fall was marginal, but health experts sounded an alarm, saying that the trend pointed to illegal prenatal sex determination tests taking place in Delhi-NCR.The data was released by Delhi's Directorate of Economics and Statistics and the office of Chief Registrar (births & deaths) in its annual report on births and deaths in 2024.""The trend is of concern as there is a continuous dip now (since 2020). This indicates prenatal sex determination happening in the city,"" said Arun Yadav, former director of hospital administration of MCD. ""We need a continuous crackdown on these illegal units rather than sporadic raids.""Delhi also saw a notable demographic shift in 2024, with a decline in the number of registered births and a simultaneous rise in deaths, as per data released this week.The sex ratio in the city had shown some improvement in 2020 when it jumped to 933 from 920 in the previous year.Since then, there has been a fall - 932 in 2021 and 929 in 2022. A senior Delhi govt health official said the fall reflects the low priority accorded to inspections by district authorities. He said that fewer inspections have led to fewer show-cause notices and suspensions of registrations, weakening the entire deterrent system.The official noted that there has been a rapid growth of illegal labs offering NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing) and karyotyping through home collection services, with reports being delivered directly to patients.Delhi recorded 3,06,459 births in 2024, a drop from 3,15,087 births in 2023. The average daily birth count decreased to 837 from 863 the previous year. Of the total births, 52.1per cent were males, 47.9per cent females, and 0.03per cent were categorised as others, which includes transgender, ambiguous or unstated cases.A majority of these births, 96.1per cent, took place in institutions, with govt hospitals accounting for 65.11per cent of all institutional deliveries. Domiciliary (home) births made up 3.9per cent, and among these, around 17per cent had assistance from trained medical personnel, while 61.4per cent relied on relatives or untrained help. Urban dominance in childbirth was significant, with 88.1per cent of the births attributed to mothers residing in urban areas, compared to 11.9per cent from rural parts of Delhi.In terms of birth order, 51.5per cent were first-time births, followed by 36.4per cent second-order, 10.2per cent third-order, and nearly 2per cent fourth or higher. An interesting pattern emerged when birth order was analysed against maternal education levels. Among mothers with fourth or higher-order births, 41.1per cent had education levels between matric and below graduate, while 16.7per cent were illiterate. Only 9.6per cent of such births were recorded among mothers with graduation or higher qualifications, highlighting a clear link between lower education and higher fertility rates.Another official said, ""Women with less education often have limited awareness of contraception and reproductive health. They are likely to marry early, leading to a longer reproductive period. Cultural norms in some communities encourage larger families, especially when there's a preference for sons."" He added, ""Also, lower education is often associated with reduced access to healthcare and fewer career opportunities, making motherhood a primary role. ""Educated women, on the other hand, are more empowered to make informed reproductive choices. Thus, education plays a crucial role in promoting smaller, planned families, he said. Age also played a role, with the majority of mothers, 37per cent, in the 25-29 years age bracket, followed by 27.1per cent in the 20-24 years group.Of the leading causes of infant death, 11.6per cent of institutional fatalities were due to septicemia, followed by 10.1per cent because of heart and pulmonary conditions, and 8per cent due to shock. Tuberculosis, hypertension, and liver diseases were also among the top causes. A senior official said, ""Septicemia is more of a problem in rural pockets when prenatal care is not taken well. Pulmonary circulation or other heart diseases can be picked up in the ultrasound and cured at the right time. ""Meanwhile, Delhi reported 1,39,480 deaths in 2024, up from 1,32,391 in 2023. This equates to an average of 381 deaths per day, compared to 363 in the previous year. Of the total deaths, 61.2per cent were males and 38.8per cent females, with 0.03per cent recorded under the ""others"" category.

""On the basis of the report of the SIT, the court is of the opinion that the receipt of animals by Vantara by rescuing them from various situations and housing them in the rescue centre for conservation, and breeding programmes have gone through a complex multi-layered/multijurisdictional statutory approvals, procedure and documentation. The imports of animals have been made only after issuance of valid permits.Once the import of animals is fully documented and supported by valid permits, it is not open for anyone to go beyond the said permits and to dispute the validity attached to such permits or official acts,"" it said.Incorporating the SIT report, which was filed in a sealed envelope, the court said the panel found that welfare standards followed for conservation and preservation of the animals at Vantara exceed prescribed benchmark and the mortality figures align with the global zoological averages.""Upon consideration of the entire record, we are more than satisfied that the facilities at Vantara in certain respects exceeds the prescribed standards of animal husbandry, veterinary care and welfare as well as the statutory benchmarks laid down by the Central Zoo Authority.

Under the new regime, monsoon onset over Kerala remains the same (June 1). There is also no change in the final withdrawal date over south India (Oct 15). The normal withdrawal date for Delhi is Sept 25.Announcing the beginning of the retreat of summer monsoon on Sunday, the IMD also predicted that the conditions are favourable for its withdrawal from some more parts of Rajasthan and some parts of Punjab and Gujarat during the next 2-3 days.Meanwhile, heavy to very heavy rainfall is predicted by the Met department over northeastern states and Maharashtra for the next three days.Normally, monsoon covers the entire India in 38 days (June 1-July 8). This year, it covered the entire country in 37 days after making an early onset on May 24 and covering the whole India by June 29.Though early onset/withdrawal or coverage has nothing to do with the overall status of the monsoon, it certainly guides farming activities, and water and hydro-power management during the rainy season.Early onset of monsoon helped farmers begin early sowing of kharif (summer sown) crops this year. The early withdrawal by just three days will, however, not impact the acreage as the sowing operation has already completed in most parts of the country. Even all key reservoirs have enough water to sustain the Rabi (winter sown) crops during Oct-March cycle.IMD has predicted an 'above normal' monsoon this year and it's already reflected in over 7% more than normal cumulative (June 1 - Sept 14) rainfall in the country so far with northwest India recording nearly 32% more than normal rainfall during the period, leading to multiple disasters including flooding and crop damage in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir.Except east & northeast India that faced a cumulative rainfall deficit of nearly 20%, the rest of the country received surplus rainfall with the central India getting 10.5% more than normal rainfall and south peninsular India getting 7.5% more than normal rainfall during the monsoon season.Good rainfall this year in most parts of the country helped increase the total acreage (1105 lakh hectares) which is more than last year (1078 lakh hectares) and also more than the normal acreage (1096 lakh hectares) for Kharif crops.","The southwest (summer) monsoon started withdrawing from some parts of west Rajasthan on Sunday against the normal date of Sept 17. It marked the beginning of this year’s monsoon retreat from the country. Normally, the withdrawal process ends on Oct 15 - a few days ahead of the onset of winter monsoon.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123889393,imgsize-1152764,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Sidney Crosby reportedly nearing a split with Penguins as hockey world braces for potential franchise-altering trade news,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/sidney-crosby-reportedly-nearing-a-split-with-penguins-as-hockey-world-braces-for-potential-franchise-altering-trade-news/articleshow/123905225.cms,"Sidney Crosby trade rumors spark questions about Penguins future (Getty Images)

Sidney Crosby and the trade whispers



What the future holds for Sidney Crosby



For nearly two decades, Sidney Crosby has been the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins, but reports suggest the bond may finally be fraying. The franchise’s timeline no longer matches the ambitions of its captain, raising speculation that the three-time Stanley Cup champion could consider life outside the Black and Yellow. While nothing appears imminent, insiders believe this is the closest Crosby has ever come to pondering a future away from Pittsburgh.The thought of Crosby leaving Pittsburgh once felt impossible. Yet cracks are beginning to show. “I never thought a Crosby trade was imaginable. Now, I’m not so sure,” wrote The Athletic’s Josh Yohe, pointing to growing frustration with the Penguins’ struggles.The Penguins, built on an aging core, no longer look like a contender. Meanwhile, the NHL is watching closely, knowing that if Crosby ever gives the green light, a bidding war would erupt. Among potential destinations, the Montreal Canadiens stand out. Elliotte Friedman revealed on his 32 Thoughts Podcast that Montreal’s front office may already be shaping decisions with Crosby in mind, saying, “[Canadiens’] Jeff Gorton and Kent Hughes are they sitting there and saying ‘we’re not doing anything with X player because we think it may prevent us from doing a Crosby deal‘.Montreal not only offers Crosby a shot at fulfilling his childhood dream but also the chance to mentor a young core hungry for playoff success. A move north would instantly inject leadership and championship pedigree into a team still learning to win.Despite the noise, a trade remains unlikely before the 2025-26 season. Crosby reportedly wants to finish this year alongside Evgeni Malkin, honoring their shared legacy in Pittsburgh. At the same time, distractions from a move to a market like Montreal could pull focus away from his primary goal: representing Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics.The decision, whenever it comes, will not be taken lightly. Crosby has built his career on loyalty and excellence, but time is not on his side. The choice may eventually come down to chasing a final Stanley Cup or staying with the team that defined his career. Either way, when Sidney Crosby makes his move, the NHL will never look the same.Also Read: Oilers GM addresses Connor McDavid contract uncertainty, urges fans to avoid panic while stressing team’s championship priorities",Sidney Crosby has been the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins for nearly two decades.

NEW DELHI: Flights between the West and India, mainly Delhi and Mumbai, will get even longer following the Iranian airspace closure on Friday after Israel attacked the country's nuclear sites. Sixteen Air India (AI) flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.AI had resumed overflying Iran shortly after Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24 to partially mitigate the longer route its flights had to take since then. While AI will have to take longer routes to and from the West, IndiGo between Delhi and Tbilisi and Delhi and Baku will become one-stop flights now. With both Pakistan and Iran no-go areas, Indian carriers will have to take really longer routes to reach Central Asia. ""We are studying the situation and some AI flights may become one-stop after closure of Iran airspace,"" said sources.Also, if and when Iran retaliates, the airspace of countries near Israel, like Jordan and Lebanon, also be impacted.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday that the Congress made a ""historic blunder"" by allowing Pakistan to become a nuclear power in the 1980s without taking action.He said Pakistan has since used ""nuclear blackmail"" to block international intervention.""At a time when nations today act decisively to neutralise nuclear threats, India’s tragic inaction during the 1980s remains a cautionary tale of what could have been—and what wasn't,"" the Assam CM said in a long post on X.Sarma said intelligence from R&AW had confirmed Pakistan’s uranium enrichment at Kahuta.In his post titled ""Congress's Historic Blunder: How India Let Pakistan Become a Nuclear State"", he claimed Israel offered help—from intel to joint strike planning. He said Jamnagar Air Base was shortlisted as a launch site and the Indian military supported a pre-emptive strike on Kahuta.""India had the capability and consensus to eliminate the threat before it became a reality. Yet at the last minute: Indira Gandhi hesitated, fearing international fallout,"" the chief minister alleged.He added that Rajiv Gandhi later ""shelved the plan, prioritising diplomacy over deterrence under foreign pressure"".According to Sarma, in 1988 Rajiv Gandhi signed a no-strike nuclear pact with Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto, pledging not to attack each other’s nuclear sites.He noted, ""A decade later, Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998. India was pulled into a costly nuclear arms race. Kargil, proxy terror wars, and cross-border strikes have since occurred under Pakistan’s nuclear shield.""""To this day, Pakistan uses nuclear blackmail to deter international action and legitimize its rogue behaviour,"" he said.Sarma also accused the CPI(M), an INDIA bloc ally, of promising in their 2024 manifesto to roll back India’s nuclear deterrent if elected.“Where strong leadership demands resolve and foresight, Congress offered caution and delay. A historic window to safeguard India’s long-term security was squandered—for short-term diplomatic comfort,” he said.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday that the Congress made a ""historic blunder"" by allowing Pakistan to become a nuclear power in the 1980s.

A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response and the safe evacuation of all 3,820 residents from 764 apartments. Authorities confirmed there were no injuries.The fire, which was extinguished after nearly six hours of effort, drew swift intervention from Dubai Civil Defence teams, who worked through the night to contain the blaze. In a series of updates on X, the Dubai Media Office (DMO) said: “Specialised teams successfully evacuated all residents… prioritising their health and safety throughout the operation.”Medical and psychological support teams were on-site to assist residents. “Ambulance teams and medical staff are on site to offer full medical and mental support to the safely evacuated residents,” DMO posted at 2:09 am.Authorities also assured that temporary housing arrangements were being made in coordination with the building’s developer to ensure the affected residents' well-being.As firefighting operations continued, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) suspended tram services between Dubai Marina Station (No.5) and Palm Jumeirah Station (No. 9) as a precautionary measure. A replacement shuttle bus service was activated, with the RTA stating, “The safety of our passengers and operations is our top priority.”Tram services will resume only after full safety inspections are conducted, the authority added.Eyewitnesses described the situation as tense, with one resident noting: “At around 1:30am, the fire started to slow down… plenty of debris has been falling.”Thanks to swift action, no surrounding buildings were affected. Authorities are now monitoring the structure and will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire, which remains undisclosed.This is not the first fire reported at Marina Pinnacle — also known as Tiger Tower. In May 2015, a kitchen fire on the 47th floor had spread to the floor above before being contained.Despite the building's fire history, Saturday’s operation stands out for its scale, coordination, and zero casualty outcome — underscoring Dubai’s emergency preparedness.","A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response.

Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, ending an intense two-day manhunt that left the state on edge.The suspect is also accused of wounding State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife Yvette in a separate attack at their Minneapolis suburban home. During both incidents, the assailant reportedly wore a rubber mask and posed as a law enforcement officer.Investigators discovered the suspect had compiled a notebook containing approximately 70 potential targets, including both lawmakers. Before fleeing one of the crime scenes, he allegedly opened fire on responding officers.The manhunt intensified Saturday night when SWAT teams converged on a residence in Plymouth, Minnesota, roughly 12 miles west of Minneapolis. The search expanded to Sibley County the following day, where authorities recovered the suspect's vehicle and hat, approximately an hour's drive from the attack sites.Prior to the shootings, Boelter exhibited suspicious behavior, including emptying his bank account and prepaying four months' rent – at $220 monthly – for a room he occasionally occupied in Minneapolis. The payment was made to David Carlson, who described himself as one of Boelter's closest friends since elementary school.","Vance Boelter, 57, has been identified as the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark.

Trump's post





US President Donald Trump has ordered federal immigration officials to prioritise deportations in Democratic-led cities following widespread protests in Los Angeles and other major urban centers against his administration's immigration policies.In a post on Truth Social, Trump urged ICE agents ""to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.""He emphasized that to accomplish this, officials ""must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.""This announcement follows weeks of intensified enforcement and remarks from Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of Trump’s immigration strategy, who stated that ICE officers would aim for at least 3,000 arrests per day—an increase from approximately 650 daily arrests during the first five months of Trump’s second term.Simultaneously, the administration has instructed immigration agents to pause arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels after Trump expressed concern about the negative effects of aggressive enforcement on these industries, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.In his post, Trump said: ""Our Nation’s ICE Officers have shown incredible strength, determination, and courage as they facilitate a very important mission, the largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History.Every day, the Brave Men and Women of ICE are subjected to violence, harassment, and even threats from Radical Democrat Politicians, but nothing will stop us from executing our mission, and fulfilling our Mandate to the American People. ICE Officers are herewith ordered, by notice of this TRUTH, to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.""""In order to achieve this, we must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens. These Radical Left Democrats are sick of mind, hate our Country, and actually want to destroy our Inner Cities — And they are doing a good job of it! There is something wrong with them. That is why they believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s Sports — And that is why I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role. You don’t hear about Sanctuary Cities in our Heartland!""""I want our Brave ICE Officers to know that REAL Americans are cheering you on every day. The American People want our Cities, Schools, and Communities to be SAFE and FREE from Illegal Alien Crime, Conflict, and Chaos. That’s why I have directed my entire Administration to put every resource possible behind this effort, and reverse the tide of Mass Destruction Migration that has turned once Idyllic Towns into scenes of Third World Dystopia. Our Federal Government will continue to be focused on the REMIGRATION of Aliens to the places from where they came, and preventing the admission of ANYONE who undermines the domestic tranquility of the United States.""""To ICE, FBI, DEA, ATF, the Patriots at Pentagon and the State Department, you have my unwavering support.

Who is Arturo Gamboa? Armed man at Kings Day protest fired at by peacekeeper; bystander killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-arturo-gamboa-armed-man-at-kings-day-protest-fired-at-by-peacekeeper-bystander-killed/articleshow/121870857.cms,"AP





A peacekeeper at a ""No Kings"" protest in Salt Lake City opened fire on a man who raised a rifle at the crowd, but accidentally shot and killed a bystander, police said on Sunday.The incident happened on Saturday evening during nationwide ""No Kings"" protests, where demonstrators rallied against what they called president Donald Trump’s authoritarian actions. While most protests remained peaceful, violence broke out in Salt Lake City when a man, identified as Arturo Gamboa, 24, pulled out a rifle near the protestors.According to Salt Lake City police chief Brian Redd, two men wearing neon green vests, believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, approached Gamboa with their handguns drawn. Witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle and moved towards the crowd. One of the peacekeepers then fired three shots, hitting Gamboa and a bystander, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39.Ah Loo was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries. Gamboa, who was treated for minor injuries, was arrested and charged with murder. Police accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death.The gunfire caused panic, forcing hundreds of protestors to flee, hide behind barriers and seek shelter in nearby buildings.Police recovered an AR-15 style rifle, a gas mask, and a backpack at the scene.Authorities are still investigating why Gamboa brought the rifle to the protest and how the peacekeepers were organised or trained for the event.In another incident in Riverside, California, a driver struck a woman participating in a separate ""No Kings"" demonstration and fled. The woman was hospitalised with serious injuries but is stable. Police are still searching for the driver.The Utah chapter of the 50501 Movement, one of the groups behind the protests, condemned Gamboa’s actions and thanked first responders and their safety team for acting quickly. They did not respond to questions about the peacekeeping team’s organisation or training.","A peacekeeper at a ""No Kings"" protest in Salt Lake City opened fire on a man who raised a rifle at the crowd, but accidentally shot and killed a bystander.

NAGPUR: A simple act of courtesy and kindness — letting a sick teenager and her grandmother board the helicopter first — spared the lives of a Maharashtra couple from the fatal helicopter crash near Kedarnath on Sunday. Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, her husband Rajkumar, and their toddler daughter Kashi, who were among the seven killed when the chopper went down minutes after take-off.On Sunday morning, the group was waiting at the Kedarnath helipad with the Jaiswals for the first sortie to Gaurikund when an elderly woman in the queue requested that she and her unwell granddaughter be allowed to go first. Pravin agreed, letting Vinod Devi, 66, and Trishti Singh, 19, take his family's place in the queue and opting to wait for the next helicopter. Talking to TOI, Mahajan said, ""The woman requested that her granddaughter had fever and she needed to reach the Gaurikund base soon. I agreed and allowed them to board,"" he said.Rajkumar Jaiswal, 41, who was a prominent coal-transport businessman from Wani, had set out on the Char Dham yatra with his family on Thursday, fulfilling a long-held personal vow.The group reached the Kedarnath shrine at 9:30am on Saturday and was scheduled to return by noon. But due to severe weather, sorties were cancelled for the rest of the day. Flights resumed at 5am on Sunday. Two other helicopters took off around the same time and landed safely.In addition to his coal business, Jaiswal ran a retail shop and was known in his community for his devout faith and involvement in local affairs. His wife Shraddha, 35, and their 23-month-old daughter Kashi died alongside him in the crash. Their six-year-old son, Vivaan, had stayed behind in Maharashtra with his grandfather. Their elder son, who lives in a hostel, had not joined the trip either.","Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, and their toddler daughter Kashi.

Patrick Mahomes’ heartfelt moment as a girl dad resurfaces and it’s melting fans all over again







Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, recently melted hearts on social media by revealing the face of their youngest child, Golden, for the first time. The post, shared jointly by the couple on Instagram, marks the first public glimpse of baby Golden’s face since her birth five months ago, on January 12, 2025.The post featured a tender family moment, highlighting all three of their children — Sterling (4), Bronze (2), and the newest member of the Mahomes clan, baby Golden. Patrick, holding Golden gently in his arms, beams with pride as she sucks on her tiny hand, dressed in a white onesie and sporting an oversized white bow that made her look even more adorable. Another frame captures Brittany and Golden, with the little one flashing a radiant smile in a cute denim romper — a moment that quickly stole fans' hearts.True to their tradition, Patrick and Brittany had earlier decided not to reveal their children’s faces immediately after birth. The couple has always placed high importance on privacy, especially when it comes to their kids. But when they finally shared this sweet family portrait, fans couldn’t stop gushing over how grown and happy the Mahomes family looked.While many are surprised at how young Patrick is to be a father of three, the 29-year-old quarterback has always embraced early parenthood. “No, it’s awesome. I always wanted to have kids young. I got to grow up in the locker room. I think I’ve talked about it before, and it made such an impact on my life,” he once said.Despite his high-pressure role leading the Chiefs, Mahomes never lets family take a backseat. As soon as he wraps up on the field, he’s quick to head home and soak up every moment with Brittany and their children. Fatherhood, as he describes, changed him for the better. Initially, he dreamed of having a son first, but everything shifted when he met his daughter Sterling.“Growing up I wanted to have a boy first, then I had a girl & it’s like God knew exactly what to do with me. He helped me mature as a man. It’s a different bond with a daughter because you’ve got to be that protector,” Mahomes shared during a candid conversation with Tom Brady on NFL on Fox.With every public glimpse of their family life, Patrick and Brittany continue to redefine what it means to balance fame, love, and parenthood — one sweet moment at a time.Also Read: “It affects everything”: Taylor Swift’s alleged falling out with Blake Lively gets deeper — and Travis Kelce may be caught in the crossfire","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, recently revealed the face of their youngest child, Golden, for the first time.

BATHINDA: Amritpal Singh Mehron, the alleged mastermind in the killing of social media influencer Kanchan Tiwari, known as Kamal Kaur 'Bhabhi', fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) just hours after the crime was committed, according to police on Sunday.A look-out circular (LOC) was issued against the resident of Mehron village in Moga district on Saturday, four days after Kamal Kaur was found dead in a car parked outside Adesh Medical University here on the night of June 11.Investigations revealed that she was murdered around 2 am on June 10. Mehron - who claims to head a radical outfit called 'Qaum De Rakhe' was present with his two accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Nimratjit Singh, when they strangulated Kamal Kaur, according to Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Amneet Kondal.Mehron allegedly took both her mobile phones and compelled her to disclose their passwords. He boarded a flight from Amritsar international airport at 9.15 am on the same day, having travelled from Bathinda to Amritsar, the SSP said.The SSP further said that information gleaned from the arrested people, Jaspreet and Nimratjit, confirmed Mehron's presence at the scene of crime.

Following contact with Mehron, he was instructed to retrieve the item, which he subsequently did.Investigations have also indicated that two more people were aware of the crime. Mehron fled in their vehicle, instructing Jaspreet and Nimratjit to remain with the deceased. Police have nominated one Ranjit Singh from Tarn Taran while the identity of the second person is not yet known.After Mehron's travel history confirmed he took a flight to the UAE on June 10, police said they will prepare a case for his extradition.

NEW DELHI: In a few weeks, you may not need to provide photocopies of Aadhaar and will instead be able to share electronic Aadhaar, either in full or the masked version, using a new app based on QR code.And, by November, other than submitting your biometric details, you will not be required to visit Aadhaar centres to update address and submit other details as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has lined up a new protocol that will draw from the birth certificate, matriculation certificate, driving licence, passport, PAN, PDS and MNREGA database to seek your address and other details to not just simplify life for citizens but also reduce the possibility of forged documents being used to get Aadhaar. Talks are underway to access the electricity bill database which will make it more convenient.UIDAI chief executive officer Bhuvnesh Kumar told TOI that a new app has been developed by the agency and around 2,000 of the one lakh machines have now moved to the new tool. ""You will soon be able to do everything sitting at home other than providing fingerprints and IRIS,"" he said. This will include updating addresses, phone numbers, name change and even rectification of a wrong date of birth.The move to allow QR code-based mobile-to-mobile or app-to-app transfer of Aadhaar is seen to be crucial to check against misuse and is proposed to be used for several purposes - from checking in at hotels to identity verification on a running train. ""It offers maximum user control over your own data and can be shared only with consent,"" Kumar said.This can also be used by sub-registrars and registrars at the time of property registration, where frauds often take place. Kumar said UIDAI is sensitising state governments to use Aadhaar to verify the credentials of those coming to register property, so that some of the frauds can be prevented.He said UIDAI has also initiated talks with CBSE and other exam boards to ensure biometric and other data updation of children, which is required to be done between five and seven years and again between 15 and 17 years. A special drive is planned so that the eight crore missing details for the first update (for kids between five and seven years) and 10 crore second update can be completed.Separately, UIDAI is also working with various players, such as security agencies, hotels, for covering entities that are not mandated to use Aadhaar.","By November, you will not be required to visit Aadhaar centres to update address and submit other details.

NEW DELHI: Temba Bavuma not only led South Africa to a historic ICC triumph after 27 years, but he also became the subject of countless memes as fans flooded social media with humorous and heartfelt tributes.The Proteas skipper guided his team to their maiden ICC World Test Championship (WTC) title, clinching a five-wicket win over Australia at Lord’s.Since the victory, memes celebrating South Africa’s long-awaited ICC triumph have taken over the internet. Here are some of the best.But beyond the jokes and memes celebrating Bavuma’s calm demeanour and emotional post-match interview, the moment marked a defining chapter in South African cricket.At the presentation, Bavuma was quick to credit his teammates for the landmark victory.He heaped praise on Kagiso Rabada , who claimed nine wickets in the match, including a crucial five-for in the first innings.Despite returning from a one-month ban for recreational drug use, Rabada delivered when it mattered most, surpassing Allan Donald to become South Africa’s fourth-highest Test wicket-taker.Bavuma also hailed Aiden Markram , whose majestic 136 anchored the Proteas’ record-breaking chase.“People have questioned Aiden’s place, but he showed character. KG will surely be in the Hall of Fame one day,” Bavuma said, reflecting the deep camaraderie in the side.Rabada, visibly emotional, described the victory as a culmination of years of frustration and near-misses for South African cricket. “We’ve seen the heartbreak over the years. This is for our past players and our people back home. Hopefully this is just the beginning,” he said.The match itself was a rollercoaster.After bowling out Australia for 212 on day one, the Proteas collapsed to 138, handing the Aussies a 74-run lead.But a fiery second-innings bowling effort and Markram’s sublime knock sealed the chase of 282.Kyle Verreynne’s winning shot sent the crowd into raptures, while Bavuma memes lit up the internet, turning the captain into both a hero and a viral sensation.","Temba Bavuma led South Africa to a historic ICC triumph after 27 years.

Kylie Kelce’s honest talk with her mom about sex before marriage will leave you stunned



Kylie on Bikini Runway Walks, Carnivore Diet & Father’s Day Gifts For Mom with Ilona Maher | Ep. 22





Kylie Kelce is no stranger to real, unfiltered conversations, especially when it comes to family. In the latest episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, aired June 12, the mom of four opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt — whom she lovingly refers to as “Lil’ Lis. ”Joining forces with Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher, the episode unfolded into an honest discussion about how their mothers influenced their understanding of sex and communication. For Kylie Kelce, this comfort was rooted in openness from an early age. Recounting a moment that clearly stuck with her, she said, ""I bombarded her, and came in and sat in a room while she was doing something, and just was like, 'OK, Mom, here. We're here now.'""At the time, Kelce had made up her mind to wait until marriage to have sex. But her mother’s response was anything but conventional. ""I think I'm gonna save myself for marriage,"" she told her mom. The reply? ""I think you're gonna change your mind."" And that wasn’t even the punchline.Kelce laughed as she remembered her mom’s brutally honest follow-up. ""Lil' Lisa doubled down... She was like, 'Hey, you gotta test drive a car before you buy it, right?'""While the original plan didn’t pan out, Kelce said the point wasn’t about the decision itself — it was the freedom she felt in making it.“It made it less scary. It made it less risky,” she said, adding that being able to speak openly with her mom gave her a safer, more informed perspective on sex and relationships.Now a mother to four daughters — Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), Bennett (2), and baby Finnley, born in March — Kylie hopes to build the same trusting dynamic with her own girls. She believes that kind of environment allows for real conversations about protection and safety. “With my mom, then I could talk about getting an IUD, I could talk about condoms and all that stuff with her,” she explained.Beyond the sex talk, Kelce also let fans into the chaos of raising four young kids. She joked, “If I had to describe the change going from three kids to four kids in two words or less: ‘Holy shit?’” Despite being a seasoned mom, she admitted she’s “still Googling things because that doesn’t stop, either.”For Kelce, authenticity and humor are part of the journey. Whether she’s parenting or podcasting, one thing is clear — the candid legacy of “Lil’ Lis” lives on.Also Read: Ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers reacts after he confirms secret marriage: ""It's really just harassment""","Kylie Kelce opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Tyrese Haliburton fires back at critics, Stephen A. Smith takes it personally in fiery rant



Hilarious fan reactions to ‘ Dumb and Dumber ’ trolling of Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4







Sometimes, the loudest message in a Finals game doesn’t come from a superstar or a coach—it comes from the stands. During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, while most fans rocked gold Pacers shirts, two individuals turned heads with bold fashion choices straight out of a comedy classic. Dressed in Dumb and Dumber-style tuxedos—one bright orange, one electric blue—they topped it off with oversized face cutouts of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. It was a hilarious, pointed response to recent media criticism of Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton—and fans online immediately took notice.The media heat on Tyrese Haliburton started after Game 2, when he was criticized for his passiveness in a 107–123 Pacers loss. On “First Take”, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back. “Win the damn chip, bro… That ain’t on me. That’s on you,” he said, implying Haliburton wasn’t delivering when it mattered. Smith continued, “Just in case he was talking about me—my brother, I'm not going away… this train don’t stop.”Then came Game 3. Haliburton bounced back with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds in a 116–107 Pacers win. After the game, he was asked about the media noise. He didn’t name names but made his feelings clear: “Most of the time, the talking heads on the major platforms, I couldn’t care less honestly. Like, what do they really know about basketball?” Kendrick Perkins , speaking on NBA Today, gave Haliburton credit for stepping up.“He finally arrived to the NBA Finals—to us box score watchers,” Perkins said. He even acknowledged, “He outplayed SGA.”And then came Game 4, when two fans used fashion to flip the script. Their orange and blue tuxes carried double meaning: orange symbolizing Smith’s New York Knicks loyalty, and blue a nod to the Oklahoma City Thunder—Perkins’ former team. It was comedy, commentary, and petty brilliance all rolled into one.Fans took to X with no shortage of reactions to the trolling masterclass.One fan said: “Absolutely incredible troll job by Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Dumb and Dumber tuxedos and all.”This tweet captured the moment perfectly and praised the fans for the elite-level trolling and creative execution.A second user chimed in with: “Two guys in the front row at the Pacers game dressed like Dumb and Dumber with Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins faces on their suits.”This user highlighted the boldness of the fans’ courtside position, emphasizing how visible and intentional the troll job was.Another user joked: “Are these two guys front row at the Pacers game calling Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins Dumb and Dumber?”This tweet added playful speculation, bluntly asking if the fans were deliberately labeling the ESPN duo as the classic comedy characters.One more said:“Best thing I’ve seen tonight…. Dumb and Dumber at the Pacer game tonight!”This comment called the bit the highlight of the evening—more memorable than even the on-court action for some viewers.And finally, another user said:“Pretty sure these fans are in Dumb and Dumber costumes…with face cutouts of Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins.”This tweet added to the confirmation and appreciation of the stunt, acknowledging the detail in the fans’ outfits and execution.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton shares heartwarming moment with Obi Toppin’s daughter before crucial Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 4 From Tyrese Haliburton shrugging off criticism to two fans turning sports talk into visual satire, Game 4 of the NBA Finals was about more than basketball. It became a statement on media narratives, on confidence, and on the creative passion of Indiana’s fan base. With subtle symbolism in every stitch of those tuxedos, the message was clear: Indiana hears the noise, and they know exactly how to laugh back. Whether the Pacers win the chip or not, their fans have already won the meme battle."," Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4 of the NBA Finals.

Dubey targets Priyanka, recalls Congress’s past on Israel, Palestine

Trump’s military spectacle draws crowds and criticism

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday demanded an apology from the Congress for falsely claiming that Pakistan’s army chief, General Asim Munir, was invited to a US military parade hosted by President Donald Trump. The White House had categorically denied the claim, calling it “false.”Speaking to ANI, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey accused the Congress of ""falling into Pakistan’s trap"" and spreading misinformation. ""For the last 2-3 days, the entire Congress party kept saying that Pakistan's Army Chief General Asim Munir is going to the US. This was a trap by Pakistan,"" he said. “Today, it is known that the White House or the US military never called Asim Munir.”A White House official confirmed this, stating, “This is false. No foreign military leaders were invited.”Dubey used the controversy to attack the Congress party's broader foreign policy history, particularly over its handling of Israel and Palestine.He criticised Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s remarks on India abstaining from a UN vote on Gaza, calling it “shameful,” and responded with a lengthy post on X. “This is what happens when you haven't studied history,” he said, pointing to India’s covert ties with Israel going back to Nehru’s era, even as it officially supported Palestine at the UN.“In 1948, Nehruji supported Palestine... but in 1950, Nehruji secretly opened his trade office Mission in Mumbai... In 1971, Indira Gandhi used Israeli weapons... In 1992, the first Israeli embassy was opened in Delhi,” he told ANI.He further alleged that after the 26/11 attacks, the Congress government under Manmohan Singh “supported terrorism and Pakistan under global pressure.” Praising Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policy, Dubey said India’s global standing has improved significantly, especially with Arab nations like Saudi Arabia.The row emerged as President Donald Trump hosted the largest US military parade in decades on Saturday to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army—coinciding with his 79th birthday.Thousands of troops marched past the White House, with tanks rolling down Constitution Avenue and fighter jets flying overhead. The White House claimed that over 250,000 people attended the event, though no evidence was provided.Trump, who once admired France’s Bastille Day parade, declared, “Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.”While Trump’s supporters celebrated, protests erupted in major cities under the banner “No Kings,” with critics accusing the former president of authoritarianism. Tear gas was fired in Los Angeles, and a shooting at a protest in Salt Lake City left one person critically injured.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey accuses Congress of ""falling into Pakistan’s trap"" Dubey uses controversy to attack Congress party's broader foreign policy history.

Jasson Dominguez’s error hurts Yankees in close game

Fans doubt Dominguez is ready for the majors

Young star faces high expectations





Jasson Dominguez, a young Yankees star made a huge error that angered fans during a game against the Boston Red Sox. He froze on the bases, costing his team a chance to score. ""I mean what the f**k are you DOING. Dominguez should be benched tomorrow for this alone I’m sorry. Completely inexcusable and unacceptable,"" one fan posted angrily on social media.During the seventh inning of the Yankees’ 4-3 loss to the Red Sox on June 14, 2025, Jasson Dominguez made a costly mistake. He was on second base when Trent Grisham swung at a pitch. Dominguez thought Grisham struck out and stopped running, but Grisham hadn’t.This confusion meant Dominguez didn’t advance, missing a chance to put runners on second and third with Aaron Judge up next. The inning ended without a score, frustrating fans. Dominguez said after the game, “I have nothing to say. No excuses. I made a mistake.” Fans were quick to react online, with one saying, “Send him back to the minors or trade him.”Another posted, “Jasson Dominguez may rank among the game’s all time overhyped prospects.” The mistake added to doubts about Dominguez’s focus, as the Yankees fight for a playoff spot.Dominguez’s error wasn’t the only thing upsetting fans during the Red Sox series.His defense has been shaky, and he’s struggled at the plate at times. One fan wrote, “Speaking of being asleep, how does Jasson get picked off second base. WTF.” Manager Aaron Boone defended other players, like Anthony Volpe, who also made a baserunning mistake, but fans weren’t happy. They even criticized Boone, with one saying, “Yesterday completely unnecessary and now this again. ”Even with Dominguez's very good minor-league resumé like .314 hitting and 11 home runs in 2024, he has been an inconsistent big-league player. The fans are divided: some want him sent to the minors for refinement while others see him still as a potential star.Also Read: Jasson Dominguez's net worth in 2025 - Exploring career earnings, salary details, and everything else His youth and inexperience-weighing in just at 22 major-league games-are said to be working against him in waning moments when he needs to grow more. But the spotlight is on Dominguez; pressure is mounting for him to prove his worth.Jasson Dominguez, called “The Martian” for his amazing talent signed with the Yankees for $5.1 million in 2019 when he was just 16. Fans expected him to be a superstar like Mike Trout after he hit a home run in his first MLB at-bat in 2023. But injuries like Tommy John surgery and an oblique strain have slowed him down.In 2025, he hit three home runs in one game against the Athletics showing his power but mistakes like the one against the Red Sox have hurt his reputation. Boone believes Dominguez will learn from these errors, but fans want results now.With the Yankees aiming for the playoffs every game matters and Dominguez’s performance is under close watch. Can he overcome these challenges and become the star fans hoped for? His next games will be key to answering that question.","Jasson Dominguez, a young Yankees star made a huge error that angered fans during a game against the Boston Red Sox.

Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia defends his 'insensitive' comments about Air India crash; says it's 'outpouring of fake emotions',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-businessman-sabeer-bhatia-defends-his-insensitive-comments-about-air-india-crash-says-its-outpouring-of-fake-emotions/articleshow/121834644.cms,"Sabeer Bhatia even held a poll on X asking people whether he should take an Air India flight.

Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia made comments on Air India crash that X users found insensitive.





Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia who recently mocked the Indian economy, mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"". In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, Bhatia asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive at the time of grieving.""Do you really think the 4th largest economy in the world should still be having plane crashes due to systemic failures? Time to question what truly makes a nation great,"" Bhatia posted.Social media users reminded him that there have been 55 deadly plane crashes in the US in 2025 alone to which Bhatia retorted that US has a greater number of flights as well.""Sabeer wants the attention he has lost. He wants to remind the world that he still exists,"" one wrote. ""Vulture spotted,"" another wrote. Interestingly, Bhatia engaged with all comments and even ran a poll on whether he should take an Air India flight or not.""Of course I’m deeply saddened and devastated by the loss of life. But that distracts from the real question: Why did it happen and what can we do as a society to prevent it from ever happening again?"" he wrote.""In all the angry replies I’m getting, people are responding as if their own families were on the plane. Telling me to put my phone down. So much hate, so much emotion. Where’s the logic? Do you really go through life like it’s a Bollywood movie?"" Bhatia wrote.""The right words aren’t “devastated” or “pained by the tragic loss” — those center the speaker. Say instead: “The families of the victims are in our thoughts and prayers.” It’s about them, not you,"" he added.""In the past few days of vitriolic backlash, I keep hearing the term “colonial mindset” — as if the West looks down on India. That’s simply untrue. What shocks people in the West isn’t India — it’s the poor decisions of its leaders. If anything, that is the real colonial hangover,"" he said.","Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"" In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, he asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121834649,imgsize-36708,width-400,resizemode-4/121834649.jpg"

There are many bonds in life that are worth celebrating for the emotions and value they hold for us. They make life a more memorable experience and give us moments that are cherished forever.

Farting is a natural byproduct of a healthy digestive system, but in some occasions it can be embarrassing. Dr Joseph Salhab, a gastroenterologist has recently shared some effective remedies to relieve farting. He was reacting to a woman's video on 'the most diabolical behaviour on the plane'. The woman complained about a fellow passenger 'farting' in the plane, and the passenger getting restless. “Try this remedy if you or someone around you has bad gas,” the doctor shared.Dr. Salhab’s top recommendation is simethicone. This is an over-the-counter medication to relieve gas. “It breaks up the gas bubbles in your gastrointestinal tract,” the gastroenterologist explained in his Instagram video. This medication works by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to combine and pass more easily. It can be used as a quick relief, especially in situations like air travel, where bloating and gas can worsen due to cabin pressure changes.One effective home remedy for gas is sipping peppermint tea. “It will help with abdominal pain and spasms,” the doctor said. Peppermint tea can help relieve bloating and gas. It contains menthol, which has antispasmodic properties that relax the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, it will reduce cramping and ease the passage of gas Peppermint tea also provides in calming effect on both the stomach and the discomfort associated with excessive flatulence.The third remedy on Dr. Salhab's list is Pepto Bismol. “You can take something like Pepto Bismol. It binds to the sulfur within your gastrointestinal tract, and makes it less smelly,” he said. The active ingredient, bismuth subsalicylate, reacts with sulfur compounds in the gut, and thereby decreases the foul smell of gas. This medication is available in liquid, tablet, or chewable forms.Farting is absolutely harmless. A healthy individual farts around 14 times a day. Though it may sound like a lot, most farts are odorless and relatively undetectable. What you eat also plays a crucial role in farting . Here are five tips to control excessive farting.If excessive farting persists, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions.","Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab suggests simethicone to break up gas bubbles and peppermint tea for abdominal relief.

Dementia Symptoms: 5 signs of dementia that show up in normal conversation: How casual chat can reveal the early symptoms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/5-signs-of-dementia-that-show-up-in-normal-conversation-how-casual-chat-can-reveal-the-early-symptoms/articleshow/121819137.cms,"Struggling to find the right word and repeating the same conversation



Losing track of the conversation and using lots of fillers



Getting names and titles wrong—repeatedly



Sudden silence or losing their train of thought



Withdrawing from conversations altogether



Why these subtle signs matter



What to do if you notice these signs



Most of us don’t expect dementia to creep into everyday chats. It’s something we associate with memory loss, getting lost in familiar places, or forgetting faces. But here’s the thing: some of the earliest signs of dementia quietly show up when someone’s just talking.A casual chat over coffee, a phone call with an old friend, or even a family dinner can reveal little clues that indicates something isn’t quite right.And no, it’s not always about forgetting words—it can be much subtler than that.So, if you’ve noticed that someone close to you—maybe a parent, grandparent, or even a younger relative—is acting a little off in conversations, it might be worth paying attention. Let’s walk through the early signs of dementia that often show up in the most ordinary exchanges—and are often brushed off as “just aging.”Everyone has that “tip-of-the-tongue” moment now and then. But when it happens a lot—and the person uses vague words like “thing,” “stuff,” or “that guy” too often—it might be a red flag.Example: Instead of saying “microwave,” they might say, “the hot box” or “that thing that heats food.” It’s not just forgetfulness—it’s difficulty accessing familiar vocabulary.This one’s easy to miss because it sounds harmless: someone tells a story, and five minutes later, they tell it again.You smile politely, maybe tease them a little, but inside, you're wondering.In dementia, short-term memory loss can make people forget they’ve just said something—even though they remember what happened in 1965 with crystal clarity.Imagine you’re talking about your weekend plans, and suddenly the person jumps to a totally unrelated topic, like “Did I ever tell you about my neighbor’s cat?”This disconnection isn't just quirky—it could be a sign that their brain is having trouble following the flow of dialogue.“Um… well… you know… like… uh…” We all use fillers sometimes, especially when tired or distracted. But if someone starts relying on them constantly or struggles to form full sentences, it may signal trouble with language processing. They might know what they want to say but can’t organize the words.Calling their son by their brother’s name or referring to the Prime Minister as “that TV anchor guy” might not just be a slip-up. Consistently mixing up names—especially those of close family or public figures they know well—is worth noticing.Ever seen someone freeze mid-sentence like they just lost their place? It's not always dramatic, but it’s noticeable. In early dementia, people often pause as if the thread of the conversation just disappeared. They may even laugh it off with a “Where was I?” but inside, they may be frustrated or even scared.Maybe they used to be the life of the party, but now they sit quietly, smiling, avoiding eye contact, or nodding without much to say. That withdrawal isn’t always shyness or fatigue—it might be because they’re struggling to keep up. It’s easier to stay silent than to risk embarrassment or confusion.The early stages of dementia aren’t always about obvious memory lapses. They’re about how the brain starts struggling with complex things—like conversation. Talking isn’t just chatting; it involves memory, vocabulary, emotional cues, sequencing, and processing speed. So when someone starts to fumble with everyday conversation, it can actually say a lot.Unfortunately, many of these signs are brushed off as “just aging” or “being tired.” But catching them early gives families more time to plan, get help, and make the person feel supported—not judged.Don’t panic. One or two moments doesn’t equal dementia. But if there’s a pattern, it’s worth noting.Start documenting. Keep track of what you’re noticing and how often it happens.Talk gently. If it’s someone close to you, try bringing it up in a loving way—“Hey, I’ve noticed a few things, and I just want to make sure you’re okay.”Encourage a doctor visit. A general check-up can help rule out other causes like stress, vitamin deficiencies, or medication side effects.Stay supportive. Above all, remember: people with early dementia often know something is wrong before anyone else does. What they need most is kindness, patience, and support—not fear or shame.Dementia doesn't always shout—it whispers. And often, the first place it speaks up is in conversation. So the next time you're chatting with an elderly parent, an older neighbor, or even a middle-aged friend—listen closely. You might catch something that seems small now but could make a big difference down the line.Because when it comes to dementia, the earlier we notice, the better we can help. Regular health checkups can help to detect illnesses early before its progression.","The early stages of dementia aren’t always about obvious memory lapses.

National Herald FIR is a BJP afterthought to rescue illegal case: Abhishek Singhvi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-herald-fir-is-a-bjp-afterthought-to-rescue-illegal-case-abhishek-singhvi/articleshow/125708774.cms,"NEW DELHI: Making light of the police complaint filed in the National Herald case, Congress said on Monday the BJP govt has filed the fresh FIR out of the fear that its chargesheet was legally untenable in the absence of a govt complaint in the matter -- calling it a desperate attempt to fill a major loophole in the proceedings driven by political vendetta against the opposition leadership.AICC spokesman and MP Abhishek Singhvi said the National Herald row is based on a private court complaint by Subramaniam Swamy, while the ED can only pursue a case that is filed by the govt or police or empowered officials.“I had argued in the court that this chargesheet is infructuous. The National Herald case has no police or ED complaint. And the judgement on the issue is pending. This is a major lacuna on which a big building was erected, and it could fall anytime. So, this fresh FIR is a desperate attempt to fill the gap of govt complaint in the case,” Singhvi argued, adding, “we can see what kind of foolishness can be committed when one works in haste out of vendetta. ”Addressing a press conference, Singhvi said National Herald, an idealistic organisation which was part of the freedom struggle and run by AJL, was given huge loans by Congress to sustain its operations, since its debt had ballooned to Rs 90 crore at one point in time.He said to make AJL debt free, a routine measure was adopted that is staple for every such company – turn debt into equity by creating a not-for-profit company, Young Indian. “There was no transfer of property, no movement of money, while YI became the controlling company of AJL,” he said.But, he said, the govt and ED have claimed that creation of YI led to money laundering through property transfer. ""This is a bizarre situation -- no crime, no cash, no trail to find, the BJP still conjures a case out of its own twisted mind,” he said.","AICC spokesman and MP Abhishek Singhvi said the National Herald row is based on a private court complaint by Subramaniam Swamy. “I had argued in the court that this chargesheet is infructuous.

"Now, you can report disease outbreaks from your phone: NCDC’s new community reporting system seeks citizen eyes on public health",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-you-can-report-disease-outbreaks-from-your-phone-ncdcs-new-community-reporting-system-seeks-citizen-eyes-on-public-health/articleshow/125708379.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: What if spotting a cluster of fevers or sudden diarrhoea cases in your neighbourhood could help stop an outbreak? A new nationwide system launched by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is now making that possible — by turning ordinary citizens into the country’s earliest disease sentinels.At the heart of the system is a simple QR code. Anyone can scan it from the Health Ministry or NCDC website, or from posters and materials being rolled out across states. Once scanned, the user enters basic details and selects what they’re reporting — a fever cluster, recurring diarrhoea, jaundice, dog bites, suspected food poisoning or any other unusual health event. Photos or short videos can also be uploaded. The moment a report is submitted, the alert lands simultaneously in district, state and national surveillance dashboards, where officers verify it and initiate investigations if required.Dr Ranjan Das, director NCDC said that the tool fills a critical gap in India’s surveillance network. Many outbreaks begin silently in homes, neighbourhoods or small gatherings well before patients reach hospitals. A citizen report — sometimes within hours — can help health authorities intervene early, contain spread and prevent large-scale outbreaks.Dr Himanshu Chauhan, additional director and HOD IDSP call this a “game changer,” especially during dengue, diarrhoea, influenza and waterborne disease seasons.But they caution that the system will work only if citizens use it responsibly — and consistently.To protect users, all submissions are routed through secure government servers, with personal data safeguarded under national cyber-security protocols. False or irrelevant reports are filtered through a combination of automated checks and manual verification by trained district teams.The Community Reporting System, introduced in January 2024 under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), was envisioned to give communities a direct role in early outbreak detection. Despite being launched in 2024, the tool remained largely unknown due to poor efforts to popularize it, resulting in only about 100 valid reports so far. The low utilisation highlights the gap between technology and public engagement, though officials say even this early trickle shows that once people know the platform exists, they are willing to report.The message from NCDC is clear: public health isn’t just a government job — it needs citizen vigilance too. Sometimes, a QR scan and 30 seconds may be all it takes to stop the next outbreak.","The Community Reporting System, introduced in January 2024 under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), was envisioned to give communities a direct role in early outbreak detection.

Breakfast meet 2.0: Karnataka power tussle still unsettled; Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah hold meet again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/breakfast-meet-2-0-karnataka-power-tussle-still-unsettled-dks-and-siddaramaiah-to-meet-again-today/articleshow/125708181.cms,"(Photo credit: ANI)

Duo held similar breakfast meeting



NEW DELHI: Just as the Congress government in Karnataka crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, chief minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar are making a renewed show of unity amid an escalating leadership tussle.Siddaramaiah on Tuesday visited Shivakumar's residence for breakfast 2.0, a gesture seen as an attempt to ease tensions just days after the two leaders held a similar meeting at the chief minister's home.Shivakumar on Monday extended an invitation to the CM to join him for breakfast, and posted on X saying, ""Me and the CM continue to work together as a team. I have invited the Hon'ble CM for breakfast tomorrow to discuss and strengthen our collective efforts to deliver on our promises to Karnataka.""His comments came after Siddaramaiah told reporters ""that day (Saturday) he (Shivakumar) asked me to come to his house for breakfast on Tuesday. I have not received any call till now. If invited, I will go. He may call. I think he will invite me.""The outreach is part of efforts to break the leadership deadlock between the two.Just two days earlier on Saturday, Shivakumar had visited the CM's Cauvery residence for a similar breakfast meeting, called by Siddaramaiah on the high command’s instructions to ease tensions and present a united front ahead of the Belagavi legislature session beginning December 8.At a closely watched joint press briefing, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar dismissed reports of a rift as ""manufactured confusion"" and agreed to remain united until the high command takes up the issue.Following the meet, Siddaramaiah said the talks had gone well. ""Breakfast was very good. All three of us ( CM, deputy CM and advisor) enjoyed it. We want to put an end to the confusion. Our mission is very clear — local elections are very important, and for the 2028 elections we are ensuring that Congress comes back to power. There is no difference between me and DKS, not now, not before,"" he said.""The media has created this confusion. From tomorrow, let there be no confusion."" He reiterated that both leaders would abide by the direction of the Congress high command, saying, ""What the high command says, we will listen to and abide by,"" he added. Siddaramaiah further said that the Assembly session would be conducted smoothly and that the party would ""fight BJP and JD(S) together.""Shivakumar, echoed the same stating that, ""People have shown great trust and given a massive mandate to us. It is our duty to deliver to the people of Karnataka… Both of us have full trust in our leadership. One word from the high command, if they tell me to wait, I will wait. Both of us will follow whatever the high command says.""He added, ""Whatever the CM says, I agree with him. We will not allow outsiders to interfere.""Home minister G Parameshwara who is another name in fray for the CM post in the state acknowledged the stir, saying ""all we want is a peaceful settlement.""""It's a good thing that our leaders are getting together again for breakfast. All we want is a peaceful settlement of whatever has happened over the month or so. As suggested by the high command, they are meeting for the second time. All the issues are settled. It is just reciprocal, nothing else,"" he said.""Everything is going smoothly. Different people have different aspirations. I don't think it is wrong. Naturally, they express their aspirations when the time comes,"" he added.The show of unity comes amid intense speculation over a possible leadership change when the government completed half of its term.Rumours were fueled by talk of a 2023 ""power-sharing"" understanding under which Siddaramaiah would serve 2.5 years and Shivakumar would lead the remaining tenure, a deal neither leader has openly acknowledged, and which the party has never confirmed.While Siddaramaiah maintains he will complete the full five-year term, Shivakumar's camp has pushed for the alleged rotational formula. The high command is now working to keep both leaders aligned to avoid instability in the state.","Chief minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar are making a renewed show of unity amid an escalating leadership tussle.

Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a critical condition; PM Modi offers assistance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/former-bdesh-pm-zia-reported-to-be-in-a-critical-condition-pm-modi-offers-assistance/articleshow/125707351.cms,"Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina Faces Fresh Conviction as Court Awards 21-Year Term

With former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a very critical condition, PM Narendra Modi expressed concerns about her failing health and offered all possible assistance to her. Modi’s gesture is significant as Zia has had a troubled past with India in contrast to her rival Sheikh Hasina’s warm and friendly ties with India. Zia’s party BNP accused the Indian govt of undermining democracy in Bangladesh by backing an “authoritarian” Hasina who was deposed last year and forced to flee to India.“Deeply concerned to learn about the health of Begum Khaleda Zia, who has contributed to Bangladesh’s public life for many years. Our sincere prayers and best wishes for her speedy recovery. India stands ready to extend all possible support, in whatever way we can,” said Modi in a post on X.Significantly, a team of Chinese doctors, apparently sent by Beijing, arrived in Dhaka on Monday to help in Zia’s treatment.This is not the first time Modi has reached out to Zia and her party. He had a meeting with her during his visit to Dhaka in 2015 that govt described as “full spectrum outreach” on Bangladesh.Modi’s message will also be seen as an acknowledgement of the new reality in Bangladesh - and re-evaluation of India’s position - which goes to polls early next year and the possible return to power of BNP, which is expected to gain majorly from Hasina’s ouster. According to a local survey last week, as reported by Prothom Alo, there’s a tight race currently between the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with the BNP holding a slight three-point lead. India has on several occasions said in the recent past it seeks fair and inclusive polls in Bangladesh.With his outreach, Modi is also doubling down on India’s position that it remains committed to the best interest of Bangladesh, including peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country and will continue to engage with all stakeholders. BNP too has said it wants “balanced and respectful” ties with India.",Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a very critical condition.

"India’s AIDS deaths down 81% since 2010, infections fall 49%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-aids-deaths-down-81-since-2010-infections-fall-49/articleshow/125707141.cms,"Nursing students and doctors hold placards while participating in an awareness walk on 'World AIDS Day'

NEW DELHI: India’s HIV epidemic continues to decline, with adult HIV prevalence steady at 0.2% and AIDS-related deaths dropping 81% since 2010 — one of the steepest reductions globally.New HIV infections have fallen by nearly 49%, placing India ahead of worldwide trends.But this national success hides a troubling shift. The latest HIV burden estimate shows sharp surges in the Northeast, with Mizoram and Nagaland now recording HIV prevalence of above 1% — more than five times the national average.Several other states — such as Meghalaya and Punjab — are also reporting spikes linked to drug use and changing sexual behaviour among young adults.The findings come from the India HIV Estimation 2025, released by Union health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda at the national World AIDS Day event at Vigyan Bhawan on Monday.Developed by NACO under the IESE framework, the report covers 34 States/UTs and 762 districts and was led by ICMR–NIRDHDS with support from nine national institutes and state AIDS control societies.Releasing the report, Nadda said India’s HIV programme continues to show strong gains, with testing rising from 4.1 crore to 6.6 crore, people on treatment increasing from 14.9 lakh to 18.6 lakh and viral load tests nearly doubling to 16 lakh.India has achieved a 35% drop in new HIV infections and a 69% decline in HIV-related deaths, outperforming global averages.He added that 85% of people with HIV know their status, 88% are on treatment and 97% have viral suppression — putting the country firmly on track to meet the 95-95-95 targets by 2030. Nadda, however, cautioned that HIV–TB co-infection and poor adherence to ART remain major hurdles that demand intensified counselling and community support.Nationally, India was estimated to have 25.6 lakh people living with HIV in 2024, including nearly 14 lakh men and 11 lakh women. HIV prevalence among youth (15–24 years) remains low at 0.06%.Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka continue to carry the largest burdens and, together with six other states, account for 74% of all PLHIV in the country. The Northeast, however, presents the sharpest warning signs. Mizoram’s new infection rate (0.9 per 1,000 uninfected population) is nearly 18 times the national average.","India has achieved a 35% drop in new HIV infections and a 69% decline in HIV- related deaths.

Why December still feels special for students

December has finally arrived, bringing with it the stretch students across the country look forward to all year, winter breaks, Christmas celebrations and the gentle slowing down that marks the end of the academic calendar. After a busy November filled with examinations in many states, schools are now shifting into a lighter schedule as temperatures begin to drop and year-end activities take over.Unlike summer holidays, December breaks don’t follow a uniform pattern across India. Each state, and often each school, sets its own calendar depending on the weather and institutional policies. But there is one common trend: the second half of December typically offers the longest cluster of holidays for schoolchildren before the new year begins.Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24, with most reopening only in the first week of January. This period usually covers Christmas, New Year’s Eve and the coldest days of the season.Even in states without long winter breaks, certain days will be observed as holidays across most schools:Some schools also club these festive holidays with year-end events, annual functions or cultural programmes, adding to the excitement of the month.December is more than just a month of holidays, it marks a much-needed pause in the school year. The weather encourages a slower pace, families plan outings and reunions, and students get a short but meaningful break before the academic race picks up again in January.Even for schools, this period is valuable: campuses use the downtime for repairs, planning sessions and preparations for final-term activities.","Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24.

Punjab cross the 300-run mark

NEW DELHI: After enduring a series of low scores on his comeback to the domestic T20 tournament - Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy - as Punjab ’s captain, young India opener Abhishek Sharma produced a breathtaking counterattack on Sunday morning, hammering a record-breaking century against a seasoned Bengal bowling attack at the Gymkhana Ground in Hyderabad.Came out to open the innings after Punjab opted to bat first, Abhishek found his rhythm immediately. He blasted his way to a half-century in just 12 deliveries, launching into his former Sunrisers Hyderabad teammate and senior India pacer Mohammed Shami for 23 runs in a single over.The scale of the assault by the Punjab batter was astonishing. By the time he reached his fifty, the left-handed sensation had scored 50 of his first 51 runs in boundaries only, smashing five sixes and five fours to leave Bengal stunned.Alongside him, Prabhsimran Singh also fired up early, helping Punjab surge past 120 inside eight overs. Abhishek continued to muscle sixes straight down the ground, repeatedly targeting the V region with brutal precision.The carnage didn’t stop. Abhishek stormed to a century in 32 balls, finishing with 11 sixes and seven fours before reaching triple figures. This knock marked his eighth T20 hundred in 157 innings, bringing him level with Rohit Sharma.Among Indian batters, only Virat Kohli (nine) has more T20 centuries.Just last season, Abhishek smashed a 28-ball hundred against Meghalaya, the joint-fastest by any Indian in T20 cricket. He also struck 87 sixes in T20s in 2024, the most by an Indian man in a single year.With 16 sixes in this innings alone, Abhishek went past his 2024 tally, becoming the first Indian to cross 90 T20 sixes in a calendar year.Abhishek eventually departed for a spectacular 148 off 52 balls, with 16 sixes and eight fours, but not before powering Punjab to a score beyond 300.

NEW DELHI: As the Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday, the government is set to push a heavy economic agenda, lining up nine key bills ranging from insurance reforms to new taxation frameworks for sin goods such as tobacco and pan masala. The session will run from December 1 to 19 and will also take up the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2025-26.A major item on the list is the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which aims to raise the foreign direct investment cap in insurance from 74 per cent to 100 per cent. The move, positioned as part of a wider effort to modernise financial-sector regulation, comes at a time when the industry has already drawn Rs 82,000 crore in FDI.On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will also introduce two significant tax-related proposals in the Lok Sabha — The Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and The Health Security se National Security Cess Bill, 2025. Together, the bills aim to reshape how tobacco and pan masala are taxed. The measures would replace the GST compensation cess with an excise duty on tobacco products, while the new Health Security cess would be levied on machines or processes used to manufacture specified goods, with proceeds earmarked for national security and public health expenditure.Currently, tobacco and pan masala attract 28 per cent GST plus varying compensation cess rates.Another major reform on the agenda is the Securities Markets Code Bill, 2025, which proposes consolidating three separate laws governing India’s capital markets into a single unified code to streamline compliance and improve ease of doing business.The session is also expected to see progress on the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025, now with a Select Committee, which aims to decriminalise a wide range of minor offences and reduce regulatory friction for companies.Other economic bills planned for consideration include amendments related to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , Manipur GST, National Highways administration, and corporate law updates — rounding out what is expected to be one of the more reform-heavy sessions in recent years.","The Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday.

IITs bar from placement drive 20+ companies that rescinded offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iits-bar-from-placement-drive-20-companies-that-rescinded-offers/articleshow/125706903.cms,"An IIT professor said the institutes have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by Centre under Viksit Bharat scheme

MUMBAI: Even as the placement season began across the premier IITs on Monday, more than 20 companies were banned from participating this year. These firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year, some even as late as June or July this year, at the time of joining. Since many IITs do not allow students with existing offers to sit for further interviews, such late withdrawals not only jeopardised career prospects but also affected students’ mental well-being, said officials. IITs, therefore, unanimously decided to ban these companies from the current placement cycle. IITs tried helping the concerned students despite the time lapse.The list of banned companies was finalised after these firms revoked offers at more than one IIT. Some of them are data analytics and software-based firms. They, however, are allowed to place students through off-campus process.An IIT professor involved in the placement process said the names of the companies were cross-verified by placement coordinators at 15 IITs recently. “We looked at their past records too. Some of these companies had a history of revoking offers and six to seven IITs had already banned them from participation.Offers have been revoked by some companies where some alumni are working. There were also a few companies that reduced salary packages offered in the letter. The placement cells are trying to speak to higher authorities in these companies,” said the professor.Speaking about such cancellations, a computer science graduate from IIT-Bombay’s batch of 2025, said he was hired by a trading platform last December and his joining date was June 1, 2025. “My offer was revoked on May 29. The company made me an offer of nearly Rs 30 lakh and I was more than happy to join. They revoked my offer just two days before I was supposed to join, but fortunately, I got a better offer through an alumnus in some time. Though IIT-Bombay extended help, I did not need it at that time,” said the graduate. He said some of his friends’ offers were revoked too, but a few of them landed other offers. “By June and July it becomes difficult for the institutes too to help with placements as phase-II of the process concludes by the end of the academic year,” he said.The professor added that the IITs this year have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by the Centre under the Viksit Bharat programme. “The job market is slow, but we are trying to reach out to many more companies and encourage start-ups incubated on prominent campuses to reach the best targets,” he said, adding that so far the placement season looks good.","Firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year.

The bottom line

Global arms revenues surged to an all-time high of $679 billion in 2024, up 5.9% in real terms, according to the latest SIPRI Top 100 ranking. While Europe and the US drove most of the increase, Asia and Oceania stood out as the only region to post a decline—largely due to a dramatic drop in Chinese arms company revenues, the SIPRI report said.India, though still far from being a global arms giant, posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies. In sharp contrast, Chinese arms revenues fell 10%, a setback tied to a wave of high-profile corruption scandals and major contract delays that rattled Beijing's defense establishment.India’s three Top 100 firms-Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders-together pulled in $7.5 billion in arms revenue in 2024, up from $6.9 billion in 2023.BEL led the growth with a 24% revenue jump, hitting $2.47 billion. The boost came from domestic orders, particularly in radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, both prioritized in India’s military modernization drive.HAL, India’s top-ranked defense firm at rank 44 globally, earned $3.81 billion, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the previous year. The company faced delivery lags, but remained a cornerstone supplier to the Indian Air Force and Navy.Mazagon Dock, focused on naval shipbuilding, recorded $1.23 billion in arms revenue, with a 9.8% year-on-year increase, thanks to continued submarine and destroyer production.India is pressing ahead with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) campaign in defense production. While not grabbing global headlines, its incremental gains highlight an emerging industrial base that could challenge traditional suppliers over time.“The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased by 8.2 per cent to $7.5 billion on the back of domestic orders,” the SIPRI report said.The picture in China couldn’t be more different. For the first time in years, China’s eight arms producers in the SIPRI Top 100-previously hailed as key enablers of President Xi Jinping’s military modernization push-lost major ground.The steepest fall came from NORINCO, China’s primary land systems manufacturer, which saw its revenue plunge 31% due to corruption scandals and leadership upheaval.CASC, China’s aerospace and missile systems leader, dropped 16% following delays in military satellite programs and the removal of its president amid graft allegations.Even AVIC, the country’s biggest defense company, slipped 1.3%, hampered by delays in aircraft deliveries.“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI military expenditure and arms production programme.China’s top-down, state-controlled defense sector may be big-but its opacity leaves it vulnerable to internal shocks. Political purges tied to Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign disrupted procurement and leadership pipelines across several top defense firms.Only two of China’s eight arms producers recorded revenue growth-CSSC, the shipbuilding powerhouse, was one, rising 8.7%, aligned with China’s naval buildup in the South China Sea.India’s slow, state-driven growth might lack flash, but it also avoids the internal disarray seen in Beijing. Its procurement is transparent, aligned to strategic plans, and largely free of major political scandal.China, meanwhile, is still far ahead in sheer scale but vulnerable to top-level instability.While China dragged down the region’s total, other Asian powers picked up slack:South Korean arms producers rose 31% to $14.1 billion, driven by booming exports.Japan posted the largest jump in Asia: a 40% increase in arms revenues across five firms, reaching $13.3 billion, reflecting Tokyo’s shift toward proactive defense spending amid regional tensions.US firms remain the backbone of the global arms industry. The 39 American companies in the Top 100 generated $334 billion in arms revenues in 2024, a 3.8 per cent increase that leaves them with just under half of global Top 100 sales. Lockheed Martin alone booked $64.7 billion, while RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each sat comfortably above $30 billion.Yet the American giant is struggling to turn money into timely capability. Programmes such as the F-35 fighter, the Columbia-class nuclear submarine and the Sentinel ICBM are all running late and over budget. Lockheed’s F-35 deliveries in 2024 were delayed by an average of 238 days per aircraft, and the programme’s projected sustainment costs have ballooned towards $1.6 trillion over its life. Northrop’s Sentinel programme has breached US cost-growth thresholds by around 80 per cent versus its original estimate.SIPRI’s Xiao Liang warns that “The delays and rising costs will inevitably impact US military planning and military spending… This could have knock-on effects on the US government’s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.” In plain terms, even as the US spends more, it risks getting less capability per dollar.European producers surged by 13%, reaching $151 billion, as countries rearm in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Russia’s corporate footprint in the SIPRI Top 100 remains surprisingly small—just two entities, Rostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation—but their combined arms revenues jumped 23 per cent in 2024 to an estimated $31.2 billion. Domestic demand linked to the Ukraine war more than offset shrinking exports. Russian plants have ramped up output of artillery shells, missiles and armoured vehicles; SIPRI cites reports of 1.3 million 152-mm shells produced in 2024, a more than fivefold increase over 2022.Where Russia is constrained, the Middle East is expanding. For the first time, nine companies from the region appear in the Top 100, with combined arms revenues of $31.0 billion, up 14 per cent where comparable data exist. Israeli firms alone generated $16.2 billion, a 16 per cent increase, fuelled both by the Gaza war and strong demand for uncrewed systems and missile defence worldwide.For India:Expect a continued push for domestic procurement and local manufacturing under the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP).India may look to expand exports, especially to Africa and Southeast Asia, but lacks the global competitiveness of Korean or Israeli systems.For China:Beijing still accounts for around 13 per cent of total Top 100 arms revenues, and its shipyards and missile producers have been central to the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and rocket forces over the past decade.But the 2024 rankings hint at a temporary pause or re-ordering in its modernisation drive just as tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea remain high.Recovery will depend on restoring procurement integrity, managing talent loss, and containing political fallout.For Asia:The regional arms race is far from over.The pivot from importing to building continues—but success will depend on supply chain resilience, governance, and geopolitical alignment.India is climbing slowly, but surely-fueled by trust in institutions, steady demand, and political will.China, long considered an unstoppable defense juggernaut, now faces turbulence not from outside threats, but from within.In the evolving landscape of Asian defense, discipline may matter more than dominance. And for now, India is playing the long game.","India posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies.

Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw launches AI-powered portal ‘Sanchar Saathi’ to find lost phones

Govt: Sanchar Saathi must be visible, fully functional on devices

NEW DELHI: In a move that is causing some concern to the industry and privacy advocates, govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices. Govt says this is being done to strengthen cyber security on the devices and prevent tampering and spoofing of the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.The order, originally issued on Nov 21, gives device makers - including Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and Chinese firms Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - 90 days to comply with the regulation or face penalties.Sanchar Saathi is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of DoT that promises to ""empower mobile subscribers and strengthen their security"" while increasing awareness about govt initiatives.An order recently issued by govt to handset manufacturers states, ""Central govt hereby directs every manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets that are intended for use in India to... ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile application, as specified by DoT, is pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India."" It also directs companies to ensure that the pre-installed app is ""readily visible and accessible to end users"" at the time of first use or device setup and that ""its functionalities are not disabled or restricted"".Nikhil Pahwa, founder of tech policy analysis company Medianama, said the order was ""bad news"" for mobile phone users and their privacy. ""Legally, one can argue that your mobile phone is your personal space, and this is an invasion of your personal space. It's where we have our most private conversations and exchange sensitive information with people we trust. How do we know this app isn't used to access files and messages on our device? Or a future update won't do that? This is clearly an invasion of our privacy. Remember how govt exempts itself from much of the Data Protection Law. This explains why,"" Pahwa said. The order is valid even for devices being imported into the country, or still in pre-sales transit.The direction has been given under Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments.","Govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices.

SRINAGAR: Around “120 terrorists” positioned on 69 launch pads across the LoC are under close watch and the next phase of Operation Sindoor will be activated without hesitation if Pakistan attempts any “misadventure”, BSF Kashmir frontier IG Ashok Yadav said Monday.Yadav said during the border force’s annual briefing that Pakistan shifted several launch pads deeper inside its territory after Indian air and artillery strikes between May 7 and May 10, when Op Sindoor hit terrorist sites in retaliation for the Pahalgam massacre that killed 26 civilians on April 22.“We caused heavy damage during Op Sindoor. Some launch pads were moved from forward areas so they remain out of firing range of Indian Army and BSF,” Yadav said, adding that despite relocation, these sites remain under surveillance. “Whenever there is any misadventure from Pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply.”During the May offensive, Yadav said BSF units and Army formations executed “heavy and accurate” fire assaults on Pakistani posts and launch pads. “Our units, including artillery regiments, inflicted huge casualties on Pakistani troops, damaged forward posts and destroyed several terrorist pads along the LoC.”Asked why the 69 pads were not struck earlier, he said terrain and distance limited firing solutions.“We had them under radar. Location and depth from the LoC matter. From some points it is difficult to target all launch pads,” he said.Yadav reported a sharp drop in infiltration attempts. Four attempts were recorded this year in the Kashmir frontier — two before and two after Op Sindoor — involving 13 infiltrators. “Eight were eliminated by the Army, five retreated,” he said. While the broader infiltration pattern remains unchanged, he acknowledged emergence of new tracks. “We receive inputs on new routes and cover them with the Army,” he said.Inside Kashmir valley, BSF has 13 companies working with the Army and police. Yadav flagged “silent recruitment” of terrorists and said the force is focusing on institutions functioning as “radicalisation centres”. Alerts are passed to agencies responsible for the hinterland, he said, adding that “complete synergy” exists among security forces.Following the Pahalgam attack, specialised BSF teams were deployed in the Gulmarg bowl to reinforce tourist security. “Our teams are operating professionally and effectively,” Yadav said.Despite harsh terrain, snowbound stretches, threats of sneaky strikes by Pakistani Border Action Team (BAT), sniping, ceasefire violations and fidayeen strikes, BSF personnel continue LoC duties with “full zeal and devotion”, he said.","Around “120 terrorists’ positioned on 69 launch pads across the LoC are under close watch. “Whenever there is any misadventure from Pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply,” says BSF Kashmir frontier IG Ashok Yadav.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125702047,imgsize-1169991,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

SRINAGAR: CBI announced on Monday the arrest of a suspect wanted for 35 years for his alleged role in the 1989 abduction of former home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's daughter Dr Rubaiya Sayeed by the banned JKLF, whose jailed chief Yasin Malik is standing trial in the case.The central agency, which took over the case in 1990, identified the arrested man as ""absconder"" Shafat Ahmed Shangloo. He had a Rs 10 lakh bounty on his head.""Shangloo conspired with Yasin Malik and others in committing the crime. He will be produced in the TADA court, Jammu, at the stipulated time per law,"" CBI said.Rubaiya, who was 23 at the time, identified Yasin as one of her captors during a court hearing on July 15, 2022. Another witness backed her testimony in Feb 2023 when Yasin appeared at that hearing through video-conferencing from Tihar Jail, where he is serving a life sentence in a terror funding case.Rubaiya, the third of Mufti Sayeed's daughters and sister of PDP president and ex-J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti, was a medical intern when JKLF terrorists abducted her on Dec 8, 1989, from near her home in J&K's Nowgam. She was returning by bus from Lal Ded Memorial Hospital.The terrorists demanded the release of five of their jailed associates in return for Rubaiya's release. After six days of negotiations, Union govt freed the terrorists despite then J&K CM Farooq Abdullah being opposed to it. Rubaiya, who now lives in Tamil Nadu, was freed hours later.Mufti Sayeed, India's first Muslim home minister, was part the VP Singh-led Janata Dal govt.""Even if they had taken my daughter hostage, I would not have released a single terrorist,"" Farooq publicly said in 2015.On Sept 19 this year, Mehbooba wrote to home minister Amit Shah, urging him to view separatist Yasin's case through a humanitarian lens. She said his decision to ""renounce violence and embrace political engagement and non-violent dissent"" required courage that should not be overlooked.""I write to you not merely as a witness but as someone who has lived through the turbulent times of J&K, bearing its grief, enduring its silences, and holding on to its fragile hopes,"" Mehbooba wrote.Just over a week ago, a second ""key eyewitness"" identified Yasin in a Jammu court as the ""main shooter"" in the 1990 terrorist attack in which four unarmed IAF personnel waiting for a staff bus in Srinagar were killed and 22 others wounded.The unnamed witness's testimony came 22 months after a retired IAF colleague of the victims first identified the JKLF chief as the main armed assailant.","Shafat Ahmed Shangloo had a Rs 10 lakh bounty on his head.

When a finance executive at a British engineering firm, Arup, joined a routine Skype meeting in Jan 2024, familiar faces filled the screen. The company leaders he had interacted with countless times spoke with authority, blinked naturally, and smiled reassuringly. Except the people on screen were not real, and the AI-crafted doubles duped the firm, which worked on the Statue of Unity and India’s rail projects, of nearly $25 million. The deepfakes were so flawless that 15 transfers from the Hong Kong office went through before anyone realised the con.Months later, a deepfake surfaced closer to home. At the India office of a global chipmaker, a man used artificial intelligence (AI) to impersonate a real job candidate in an online interview. “He synced facial movements and tone quite well but we detected the use of deepfake tech, and he was out,” says Naveen Sharma, co-founder of Kroop AI, which built Vizmantiz, a detection tool for synthetic videos and audio.India’s deepfake saga began in 2020, when deepfake videos of politician Manoj Tiwari “speaking fluent Haryanvi” to appeal to voters went viral ahead of Delhi assembly polls. By mid-2023, the menace had turned personal: in Kerala, a 73-year-old man lost Rs 40,000 following a WhatsApp deepfake call seemingly from his friend, pleading for urgent help from Dubai.India recorded a staggering 280% year-on-year increase in deepfake incidents in Q1 2024, particularly in the leadup to national elections, reported Sumsub, a global identity verification provider. A McAfee survey in Nov 2024 found 75% of Indians had seen deepfake content in the past year, and 45%reported that they knew someone who had been duped by a deepfake fraud.“The term ‘deepfake’ covers both synthetic content created from scratch and manipulated content that alters existing videos,” said Sharma. “Both forms distort truth: one invents it, the other rewrites it.”Forensic experts are now learning to read what AI cannot hide. “Deepfake audio is often too clean, lacking normal background noise,” says Dr Surbhi Mathur, head of Centre of Excellence in Multimedia Forensics at National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU). “AI faces also lack natural light variations and photo response non-uniformity (PRNU) — the ‘fingerprint’ left by camera sensors. The facial micro-expressions often lacks natural blinking patterns, or the way someone moves their face or their hands near the face. ”Sandeep Shukla, director of International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, says, “There are tools that claim over 90% accuracy in deepfake detection. However, as these rely on neural network-based deep learning tech, there’s no guarantee that every form of media manipulation will be detected.” Police and judges must be trained in detection and its limits, he urges. “And, when guilt is proven, the punishment must be high enough to act as a deterrent. ”The surge in deepfake content is driven by mass appeal, says Mathur. “Scammers exploit trusted faces for massive financial gain.” Since 2023, the deepfakes analysis unit (DAU), established under the Misinformation Combat Alliance with support from the corporate affairs and IT ministries, has tracked hundreds of AI-created scams. Fabricated “endorsements” for investment schemes and gaming apps have used the faces of Ratan Tata, N R Narayana Murthy, Rahul Gandhi, Nirmala Sitharaman, Virat Kohli, and even doctors Naresh Trehan and Devi Shetty for bogus health cures. A viral Ratan Tata “investment video” was found to be 83.8% AI-generated. Tata later publicly debunked it on Instagram.In Nov 2023, a deepfake of actor Rashmika Mandanna was created by morphing influencer Zara Patel’s face. Experts warn that ‘DeepNude’ or AI-generated explicit content created without consent pose grave risks to women’s privacy.With no dedicated deepfake law, several Bollywood actors are taking legal recourse. Delhi HC has issued ‘John Doe’ orders that allow legal action against anonymous offenders. It introduced ‘dynamic+ injunctions’, which compel platforms to remove the original deepfake as well as proactively monitor and take down re-uploads.Sharma identified the “most dangerous” use of deepfakes in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector. He says that during online know your customer (KYC) processes,“I can clone a voice or face, and the system may verify that person as genuine”.To tackle this, the “first mandate” of the upcoming deepfake policy will require “BFSI to use deepfake detectors for KYC and document verification,” Sharma reveals. Amendments to the IT Rules, 2021, will enforce content labelling over 10% of the screen or audio, and faster takedowns — within 36 hours, or three hours during elections. “A person circulating or a platform hosting deepfake content, even unknowingly, will face legal action,” he says.However, experts say India must move faster. “Technology changes every 15-20 days and scammers evolve just as quickly,” warns Sharma.“We need laws, detection, and awareness that move at the same speed.”uses a public-private model for deepfake detection and digital forensicstackles image-based abuse, deepfake threatsallows anonymous reporting of deepfake, cyber abuse incidents to aid state police forcesfocuses on real-time deepfake detection for images, video, audiodevelops Explainable AI (Xai) for deepfakes, signature forgeryspecifically targets AI-generated voice impersonation to prevent fraud Images : AI‘Too clean’ audio lacking normal background noise is a red flagSounding scripted, robotic, lacking human cadence or characteristic pausesSudden changes in pitch, tone following awkward cut or pauseDistinct noise like human breathing, heard during pausesLip synchronisation errors or the mouth moving during audio pausesDeepfakes often miss the natural shadow effects and light variationsObjects near the face (e.g., microphone, hands) merging unnaturally into the chin or jawlineTeeth appearing blurred, inconsistent, or lacking definition, are common flawsUnique artefacts carried by the application that created the imageUses blood flow analysis to detect deepfakes by checking facial colouration caused by heartbeatsUsed to check if an audio is AI-generatedThe open platform detects synthetic contentProprietary software for voice and audio authenticity checkDetects AI images, especially from models like DALL·E 3","India recorded a staggering 280% year-on-year increase in deepfake incidents in Q1 2024, particularly in the leadup to national elections.

"Show results of anti-pollution steps: SC to Centre, NCR govts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/show-results-of-anti-pollution-steps-sc-to-centre-ncr-govts/articleshow/125706824.cms,"'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

Measures must be implemented round the year, says apex court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday bristled at attempts to pin the blame for Delhi-NCR air pollution on farm fires and asked the Union and NCR govts to detail measures taken on other pollution sources — vehicles, industries, construction, dust — and the tangible results achieved through implementation of such steps.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said stubble burning incidents contribute to pollution in Delhi-NCR for just 15 days in winter months, but there are other major causes of pollution which need to be addressed round the year.In defence of farmers, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Let stubble burning not be made a political or ego issue. During Covid (lockdown), stubble burning was there. Yet, we could see stars in the night sky. You (govt) say measures have been taken. Still, we can’t see stars. What are the tangible results achieved through enforcement of graded action plan (Grap)? What actions have been taken against other sources of pollution?”What is being done about high-end gas guzzlers, the bench asked. “Strengthening quality public transport is key to reducing vehicular contribution towards air pollution. But that will take time and should be part of the long-term plan,” it said, adding that financial empowerment of people in India has led to a burgeoning number of cars in the capital city, which was not planned to accommodate so many people with individual vehicles.As Bhati informed the court that the number of incidents of stubble burning has gradually gone down in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the bench asked if there has been corresponding improvement in air quality in Delhi-NCR. “Normatively, you might have banned construction activities but is there sincere implementation on the ground?”Bhati admitted that Grap restrictions have not been scrupulously enforced.The bench said that both short-term and long-term measures require intensive implementation round the year and promised that matters relating to air pollution would be heard by SC at least twice a month round the year.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said all thermal power plants were required to implement sulphur dioxide emission control measures, primarily by installing the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system, by 2021.The deadline has been extended by the govt several times, and now the thermal power plants have been asked to implement the emission control measure by 2027-29, he said.When Bhati said that the govt has already filed both short-term and long-term plans to tackle the problem of air pollution, the bench asked why they are not been revisited if they have not been able to reduce pollution.On many occasions, the rural-urban bias of experts results in misdirection of efforts to curb pollution, it said, and suggested that experts aware of ground realities of India, not those who studied at Harvard or other foreign universities, prepare action plans.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Dec 10.","Supreme Court bristled at attempts to pin the blame for Delhi-NCR air pollution on farm fires.

Supreme Court Stays Key Provisions Of Waqf Amendment Act, Refuses To Suspend Other Proposals

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend time for the mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the UMEED portal and asked those who have not done so to approach the tribunal constituted under Waqf (Amendment) Act, which has the power to extend the period by six months.Running against time to comply with registration as the deadline is to expire on Dec 6, a batch of petitions were filed in the apex court, including by All India Muslim Personal Law Board, for extension of time on various grounds including because of technical glitches encountered in accessing the portal. But the Centre strongly opposed the plea saying the Act states the extension can be granted by the waqf tribunal and aggrieved persons should approach it.Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and M R Samshad said that so far, only around 1.6 lakh properties had been uploaded, and while the total number of such assets might be above 10 lakh, it would be difficult to upload details within the short span of time.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, however, said the court’s interference to extend the date would amount to amending the law itself which provided six months time.He also told SC the issue can be examined by the tribunal.Section 3B of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 says every waqf registered under this Act shall file the details of the waqf and the property dedicated to the waqf on the portal and database, within a period of six months from such commencement. It, however, provides that the tribunal may, on an application made to it by the mutawalli, extend such period of six months under this section for a further period not exceeding six months as it may consider appropriate, if he satisfies the tribunal that he had sufficient cause for not filing the details of the waqf on the portal within such period.Taking note that the issue could be examined by the tribunal, the bench refused to extend the time. SC said that facing technical problems in uploading details of the properties would be a valid ground to seek a further six months time from the tribunal. “Technical glitch is a very good reason to seek extension from tribunal,” the bench said.The court had in Sept declined to stay many of the provisions under challenge in a batch of petitions challenging the amendments, including the requirement for all waqfs to be registered under section 3B, considering such a registration requirement was there earlier as well.","Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend time for the mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the UMEED portal.

SIR debate demand wipes out Day 1 of winter session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sir-debate-demand-wipes-out-day-1-of-winter-session/articleshow/125706228.cms,"Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

You can’t dictate timeline for govt call on

SIR debate

, Rijiju tells oppn

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in Lok Sabha and walked out of Rajya Sabha on the first day of the winter session after govt refused to concede their demand to immediately allow a debate on the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission.They rejected the stand of parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju that the demand for debate over SIR was under consideration but govt could not be tied to a timeline.The forthcoming days are likely to see more disruptions as there is no indication that the govt might relent on its stand not to discuss the functioning of Election Commission, an independent body. The opposition is determined to force the issue and chose the path of confrontation despite misgivings among smaller INDIA bloc parties.There are signs suggesting that Trinamool is ploughing its own furrow in the matter (special intensive revision of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission) rather than following Congress. At a meeting of the grouping, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, is learnt to have repeated his “vote manipulation” charge — a clear sign that Congress would remain hewed to its stand opposing special intensive revision.There were repeated adjournments in the first half of the session as opposition shouted slogans disregarding Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s appeal not to do so. “You can raise slogans outside but not in the House,” he said. A bill introduced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to implement amendments to GST law in Manipur was passed in Lok Sabha amid the din.Sitharaman also introduced in Lok Sabha two new bills that seek to repurpose levies on ‘sin goods’ such as tobacco, pan masala and related products. However, with opposition persisting with its slogan shouting, the House had to be adjourned for the day in the second half.In Rajya Sabha, opposition MPs were on their feet to press their demand soon after the felicitation of chairman C P Radhakrishnan, who chaired the proceedings for the first time since his election as Vice President in Sept this year.TMC member Derek O’Brien said that parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju had promised them on Sunday to get back to them on their demand that SIR should be taken up under the broader agenda of “electoral reforms”. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, and CPM’s John Brittas joined in the demand.They cited suicides by booth-level officers (BLOs) due to alleged workload, with Kharge calling for taking up the debate on SIR first as they have been demanding it since last session.Rijiju reiterated that their demand is under govt’s consideration and that he would get back as soon as possible. “Nobody is undermining the matter taken up by opposition. It is under consideration of govt. But you cannot impose conditions like taking up the discussion today. There are opposition parties other than a dozen (demanding debate on SIR), who represent different states and want discussion on other issues,” he said. Opposition MPs told Rijiju that he had promised on Sunday to convey to them govt’s decision by 9pm the same day. Rijiju, however, said opposition cannot dictate a timeline.“Timeline is not the problem. But there is a trust deficit,” retorted Derek. Opposition members then staged a walkout in protest, following which the Chair took up special mentions and Zero Hour.Opposition functionaries said that they will continue to stick to their demand for SIR discussion on Tuesday and will take stock of the situation on Wednesday amid slender hope in its ranks that govt could agree.INDIA bloc will protest against the SIR at the Parliament entrance on Tuesday morning, in what will be reminiscent of the Monsoon session that was washed out over protests against ‘vote chori’.Many eyebrows were raised when Trinamool did not join the meeting of INDIA bloc held at Congress’s initiative. Also, smaller parties from Kerala like CPI, CPM, RSP and IUML felt that complete washout of proceedings should be avoided as there were important issues to be highlighted.Congress president Kharge sympathised with them, but said the issue of SIR is important and govt should accept the demand for discussion even if it is under some other subject like “electoral reforms”.But, sources said, a difference of views was the reason why opposition has decided to take a fresh look at the issue after two days.",Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in Lok Sabha and walked out of Rajya Sabha on the first day of the winter session.

Privacy alarm rings as govt directs smartphone makers to pre-load Sanchar Saathi app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/privacy-alarm-rings-as-govt-directs-smartphone-makers-to-pre-load-sanchar-saathi-app/articleshow/125699029.cms,"Sanchar Saathi mobile app

In what raises privacy concerns and fears around state surveillance, govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices, ostensibly to strengthen cyber security on the devices and prevent tampering and spoofing of IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.The order, originally issued on November 21, gives the device makers – ranging from Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and the Chinese lot of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo – 90 days to comply with the regulation or otherwise face penalties. The govt’s order is even valid for devices being imported to the country, or still in pre-sales transit.The direction -- that raised red flags within the industry as well as privacy advocates -- said, “Central govt hereby directs every manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets that are intended for use in India to… ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile application, as specified by Department of Telecom (DoT), is pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India.”And to ensure that the exercise does not end up as mere eyewash, the order also asks the companies to ensure that the pre-installed Sanchar Saathi app is “readily visible and accessible to the end users” at the time of first use or device setup and that “its functionalities are not disabled or restricted”.The order said that a provision to follow the instructions should also be made for devices which are in transit for sales.“For all such devices that have already been manufactured and are in sales channels in India, the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets shall make an endeavour to push the App through software updates.”Sanchar Saathi is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of DoT that promises to “empower mobile subscribers, strengthen their security” while increasing awareness about govt initiatives.The direction has been given under the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments. “Rule 5 of the Rules empowers the govt to establish digital or other mechanisms necessary to identify and report acts that may endanger telecom cyber security, and accordingly, the DoT has instituted the Sanchar Saathi App, that, inter-alia, enables stakeholders to report IMEI related suspicious misuse and also to verify authenticity of IMEIs used in mobile devices,” the order said.The order said that mobile handsets bearing duplicate or spoofed IMEI pose serious danger to telecom cyber security.Govt instructed the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets to submit compliance reports to the DoT within 120 days from issue of the directions. “Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws.”","The order, originally issued on November 21, gives the device makers – ranging from Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and the Chinese lot of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo – 90 days to comply with the regulation.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court order for pan-India CBI probe into 'digital arrest' cases, while signifying the threat from digital scamsters, is important also because the opposition-governed states had withdrawn ""general consent"" to CBI to probe crimes in their territories.Keeping two other forms of cyber-crime - investment scams and part-time job scams - on the back burner, the bench said CBI shall investigate digital arrest scam cases, and the court will consider whether the other two forms of cyber-crime require court supervision/monitoring. Suspecting assistance to scamsters by banking system insiders, the bench said, ""CBI shall have a free hand to investigate bankers under Prevention of Corruption Act when they are suspected to be involved in the opening of 'mule accounts' where the fraudsters park their extorted monies. ""CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi said that given the magnitude of the crimes and the fact that many of them were being committed from 'scam hubs' located in foreign countries, ""we direct the CBI to coordinate with Interpol to lay their hands on the cyber-crime havens operating from abroad"".The bench also issued notice to RBI and asked it to explain to the court why artificial intelligence tools or machine-learning technologies should not be employed to identify mule accounts in banks and freeze the deposits suspected to be proceeds of crime.The court also directed the IT intermediaries to preserve data relating to phones and equipment used by fraudsters, provide it to CBI and render full assistance to the central agency as and when sought in a particular case or in general.The bench further said that there is widespread breach of norms in issuance of SIM cards. ""Facts brought on record so far reveal an alarming negligent and irresponsible approach of telecom service providers while issuing multiple SIM cards in one name. We direct the DoT to submit a proposal for the consideration of SC, which may eventually be required to be implemented to prevent misuse of SIM cards,"" it said.SC directed all states and UTs to ensure establishment of regional/state Cyber-Crime Coordination Centres and operationalise them for better coordination with Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) of MHA so that effective steps could be taken against cyber-crimes, especially digital arrest scam cases.It asked MHA, ministry of finance, DoT, MeitY to submit a detailed plan of action for coordinated steps against digital arrest scam cases.The court adjourned hearing on the case by two weeks to enable CBI to choose experienced hands from state police forces as well as experts in information technology who can assist it in investigating digital arrest cases across India.","Supreme Court order for pan-India CBI probe into 'digital arrest' cases.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider the plea of an NGO seeking addition of names of persons belonging to persecuted minorities like Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains in neighbouring countries in the voter lists pending their application seeking Indian citizenship.After a brief submission by senior advocate Karuna Nundy for NGO 'Aatmadeep', a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi posted the matter for hearing on Dec 9 along with petitions which have challenged the special intensive revision of Bengal voter list.The petitioner said there are approximately 50,000 such applicants, who had entered India on or before Dec 31, 2014, and are entitled to get protection and citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019.Quoting Sec 6B of the CAA, the NGO said many of these persons have submitted applications for grant of certificate of registration but have not been given such certificates. ""Delay in issuance of citizenship certificates, coupled with the non-recognition of acknowledgment receipts during the ongoing SIR, has created a serious constitutional crisis. The affected persons, already recognised by Parliament as persecuted minorities of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who entered India deserving protection and integration, are now exposed to the risk of statelessness, social exclusion, and disenfranchisement,"" it said.""The acknowledgment receipt generated upon online submission serves as the primary and official proof of an application under the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024. In absence of final disposal within a fixed period, such receipts must be treated as valid provisional proof of pending citizenship determination, at least for limited civil purposes such as inclusion or retention in the electoral rolls during SIR,"" it said.",The Supreme Court agreed to consider the plea of an NGO seeking addition of names of persons belonging to persecuted minorities in the voter lists.

Modi: Some using Parl as extension of state politics

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Monday asked the opposition not to turn Parliament into a platform for venting its frustration over the crushing defeat in Bihar, emphasising that the legislature should be a place for delivery, not drama.“They (opposition) should consider that the country is not accepting the game they have been playing for the past 10 years. They should now change their strategy. I am willing to give them tips as to how they should perform,” he told the media at Parliament complex before the two Houses assembled for winter session.In a sharp takedown of opposition, which has conveyed its intention to disrupt parliamentary proceedings if govt does not agree to its demand for a discussion on SIR, PM Narendra Modi in his customary remarks before winter session began said some parties are using Parliament for “warming up” before polls and as an extension of their state politics.As opposition insists on a debate on SIR, Modi hit back saying he thought these parties would get their act together in the period since Bihar poll result but the defeat continues to trouble them. Similar protests from Congress, Left and regional parties had all but washed out the last session. “Parliament should be a forum for discussing policies and not raising slogans,” he said. These parties can raise slogans anywhere in the country as they did where they were defeated, and they can do where they are going to be defeated, he added.This winter session, he said in a message to the governing NDA members, should also not be a show of arrogance over the alliance’s victory. Modi’s jibe was as much aimed at Congress — whose member Rahul Gandhi led a yatra against SIR in Bihar before polls and framed his campaign around the charge of ‘vote chori’ — and regional parties like TMC, DMK and SP.While TMC-governed Bengal and DMK-governed TN are going to assembly polls in the first half of 2026, elections will be held in UP (where SP is principal challenger to BJP) early 2027. CPM-governed Kerala is also among poll-bound states. All these parties are united in demanding a discussion over the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in 12 states and UTs.Turning up the heat on rivals, Modi, said, “I have seen that there is so much anti-incumbency against the parties in office in some states that they are unable to face the masses there. They are venting their anger in Parliament.” “Negativity,” he emphasised, “may help to some extent in politics but opposition should also contribute positively to nation-building and raise strong issues.”Citing high voter turnout in Bihar polls coupled with the country’s robust economic growth, he said India has shown the world that democracy can deliver. Modi lamented that first-time MPs are especially sad that they are unable to raise their issues and show their performance due to repeated and long disruptions in Parliament. He expressed hope that this session will not be seen as merely a ritual but energise efforts toward progress.","PM Narendra Modi asks the opposition not to turn Parliament into a platform for venting its frustration over the crushing defeat in Bihar.

Can give life convict bail during pendency of appeal if he has a fair chance of acquittal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-give-life-convict-bail-during-pendency-of-appeal-if-he-has-a-fair-chance-of-acquittal-sc/articleshow/125706804.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking a liberal approach in granting relief to convicts, Supreme Court has held that even a life convict can be released on bail during pendency of his appeal if he has a fair chance of getting acquitted in a higher court.Applying this principle, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan suspended the sentence of life imprisonment of a Tamil Nadu police officer who was convicted and sentenced in a custodial death case which allegedly took place in 1999 in Thoothukudi police station. The court granted relief after senior advocate MukulRohatgi and lawyer Anand Verma pointed out the contradiction in oral evidence of prosecution witnesses (PW).""When the court is called upon to consider the plea for suspension of a substantive order of life imprisonment, the considerations are different. In cases of fixed sentence, the appellate court may consider the plea liberally unless there are exceptional circumstances to deny suspension. When it comes to life imprisonment, the appellate court should consider whether there is anything palpable or anything on the face of the record on the basis of which it could be said that the appellant has fair chances of succeeding in his appeal and getting acquitted,"" the bench said.The court said prima facie, it is of the view that the oral evidence of the PW 4 and the PW 5 respectively is in direct conflict on material aspects with the evidence of the PW 2.""The law is well settled. Conviction can be based on the evidence of a solitary eye-witness provided it is found to be wholly reliable. If it is found to be wholly unreliable, then there is no problem in discarding the entire evidence. There could be a third category wherein the court may find the evidence of a solitary eye-witness is neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable and in such a situation, the court must insist for corroboration in material particulars. We tried exactly to do the same thing by cursorily looking into the evidence of the PW 4 and PW 5 respectively. Prima facie, the oral evidence does not inspire confidence. In such circumstances referred to above, we are persuaded to accept the plea of the appellant for suspension of the substantive order of sentence pending the final disposal of his criminal appeal before high court,"" the bench said.",Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan suspended the sentence of a Tamil Nadu police officer.

NEW DELHI: Vice President C P Radhakrishnan’s first day as chairman of Rajya Sabha was marked by a warm welcome by treasury benches led by PM Narendra Modi and clashes between them and opposition as the latter raised the issue of ex-VP Jagdeep Dhankhar.PM praised Radhakrishnan’s contributions and said his rise from an ordinary background to the office of vice president reflects the true strength of democracy. The PM assured him that the Upper House will always uphold the dignity of the “esteemed institution and will remain ever mindful of maintaining your dignity as well”.Welcoming the new chairman, PM Modi recalled his past association with Radhakrishnan and said that he has always set himself apart by rising above the constraints of protocol. “In public life, there is a special strength in living beyond protocol, and we have always seen that strength in you.”But a clash between BJP and Congress members erupted as leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge recalled the sudden resignation of former VP Jagdeep Dhankhar. Kharge said any democracy in which opposition is not allowed to criticise freely govt policies will degenerate into tyranny.Kharge assured the chairman of Congress’ support, but urged him to treat opposition and treasury equally.“Fair and impartial conduct of proceedings, providing just opportunity to members of each party, is essential for credibility of this office,” he said.He referred to Dhankhar, who had resigned from the post of VP on July 21 over “health” issues. “I am constrained to refer to your predecessor’s completely unexpected and sudden exit from the office of the chairman, RS. The chairman, being custodian of the entire House, belongs as much to opposition as to govt. I was disheartened that the House did not get an opportunity to bid him a farewell. Regardless, wish him, on behalf of the entire opposition, a very healthy life,” he said.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju slammed Kharge: “I just want to remind the House that you have forgotten the language you used to insult him... The removal motion you served, a copy of which we still have...just think how much you have tarnished the dignity of the chair. My appeal is, please do not refer to anything which is not necessary on this solemn occasion.”Leader of the House in RS J P Nadda also criticised Kharge. Nadda said Radhakrishnan’s public life was unblemished. He ended his speech by quoting former President S Radhakrishnan: “We should behave like responsible members in Parliament and not as professional agitators.”Earlier, members appealed to the chairman to ensure that opposition gets a voice in Parliament. “This is the only forum where opposition can put its point across,” said Congress MP Rajiv Shukla.

NEW DELHI: Accusing PM Narendra Modi of “delivering dramabazi” on the first day of winter session of Parliament, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said BJP govt has shattered parliamentary conventions over the past 11 years by refusing to debate issues of public concern and by bulldozing bills detrimental to the common man, like the farm laws. Opposition will continue to demand a discussion on ‘vote chori’ in the wake of deaths of BLOs, he stressed.Kharge said govt passed 12 bills without discussion in less than 15 minutes during Monsoon session, while the PM had remained completely silent on the Manipur turmoil till opposition was forced to move a no-confidence motion on the issue.“BJP should now end this drama of distraction and engage in debate on real issues facing the people. The truth is that the common man is struggling with unemployment, inflation, economic inequality and looting of the country’s precious resources, while those in power are playing the game of dramabazi in arrogance of authority,” he said.Slamming Modi’s hurling of “drama” jibe at opposition, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav asked if the death of BLOs is a “drama” too and if police-BJP nexus in UP polls which saw “cops flashing revolvers” to stop voters from voting was also a “drama”.Akhilesh demanded that EC pay Rs 1 crore compensation to families of BLOs who have died because of the stressful SIR exercise.Demanding a discussion in Parliament on SIR, he said, “There is chaos. BLOs were not properly trained to enrol voters. It is EC’s job to enrol voters, but here political parties are running around to ensure that voting rights are safeguarded.”He alleged, “SIR is being done to help BJP win after they lost (LS) elections. Big IT companies are helping BJP weed out voters and identify who should be included. In UP and Bengal, we can clearly see that BJP wants to oust voters at the booths where opposition parties won in (LS) elections.”","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said BJP govt has shattered parliamentary conventions over the past 11 years.

PM Modi’s ‘Drama Nahi, Delivery’ Message Sets Fiery Tone As Winter Session Begins Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: Eight states and a Union territory have changed the name of their governor/lieutenant governor’s house from ‘Raj Bhavan/Raj Niwas’ to ‘Lok Bhavan/Lok Niwas’ following a directive from ministry of home affairs (MHA) to shed the earlier nomenclature associated with colonial era.In a letter to principal secretaries or secretaries to state governors and lieutenant governors of UTs, the home ministry cited the suggestion made at the conference of governors held last year “to rename ‘Raj Bhavans’ as ‘Lok Bhavans’ as the word ‘Raj Bhavan’ smacks of colonialism.”“Accordingly, it is requested that offices of governor and office of Lt governor may be named as ‘Lok Bhavan’ and ‘Lok Niwas’, respectively, for all official purposes,” said the MHA directive.Taking cue from the MHA letter, states/UTs have started shedding the word ‘Raj’ from the nomenclature of governor/lieutenant governor’s residence-cum-office.West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Gujarat and Tripura have effected the change and renamed ‘Raj Bhavan’ as ‘Lok Bhavan’. Ladakh’s Raj Niwas, the official residence and office of LG Kavinder Gupta, has been renamed as ‘Lok Niwas’.The Modi govt has been working on shedding the vestiges of India’s colonial past; it had earlier renamed Rajpath as Kartavya Path and has been using ‘Bharat’ instead of ‘India’ in many official communications. Govt websites now first show content in Hindi, though there is an option to view it in English. The band at the Beating Retreat ceremony now no longer plays English hymns like ‘Abide with me’.","West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Gujarat and Tripura have effected the change.

'Tarnished India’s reputation': BJP demands MEA to ban Mamata's future foreign visits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tarnished-indias-reputation-bjp-demands-mea-to-ban-mamatas-future-foreign-visits/articleshow/119685568.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday wrote a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar demanding a ban on Mamata Banerjee's travel to foreign countries in the capacity of West Bengal chief minister following ""anti-India pitch"" the TMC supremo made in UK.In a letter to Jaishankar, leader of opposition in the assembly Suvendu Adhikari accused Mamata of displaying devotion and admiration for the country’s colonial rulers.""West Bengal chief minister Smt. Mamata Banerjee, who went to the UK recently, with the permission and approval of the ministry of external affairs, has brought unimaginable shame to our country, especially to the People of West Bengal. We hang our heads in utter shame as because our ""so-called representative"" has deliberately and repeatedly undermined our country on the international stage,"" the letter read.""Firstly, while meeting the business community of the UK during a business event in London, she stirred a controversy by praising the 'British Heritage' of '190-year British rule over India and Bengal'. She fondly spoke about ""emotional relation with the UK and remembered the colonial times as a blissful passage of time,"" it added.Adhikari also accused Mamata of undermining India's achievements on foreign soil after she differed with the prediction that India would become the world's first economy by 2060.""This was just not it. She then did the unthinkable. Undermining India's achievements on foreign soil. During a Q&A session at the Kellogg College, Smt. Mamata Banerjee was asked about India's economic progress, leaving behind the UK as the fifth largest economy in the world. Her scepticism regarding India's economic progress is simply treasonous,"" Adhikari said.""It is not only my opinion but a collective demand that Smt. Mamata Banerjee should not travel in future, to any foreign country, in the capacity of the chief minister of West Bengal, aided and assisted by Indian embassies and missions located overseas,"" Adhikari said.""I hope you would consider my request and conduct a thorough probe to ascertain the anti India Pitch made by Smt. Mamata Banerjee in the UK and make sure that it is not repeated in the future,"" he added.Earlier on Thursday, huge uproar erupted in the packed auditorium of Kellogg College at Oxford University as Mamata delivered her maiden speech.During a conversation Mamata disagreed with a prediction that India would become the world's largest economy by 2060""I will differ from that. There are so many things about which I should not speak here... internal and external affairs matters... I cannot disclose. I have some other opinions,"" Mamata said.She went on to explain, ""Because every country is facing trouble after Covid-19, and with the turmoil going on in the world... if an economic war-like situation is underway in the world, how do we expect that we will gain? Let us hope for the gain, we can only hope. It is our dream to see my country our best. But it depends.""During the event, CM Mamata was also interrupted suddenly by a group of protesting students, who tried to disrupt her speech by raising the issue of post-poll violence and the RG Kar College rape-murder case.",BJP writes to external affairs minister S Jaishankar demanding a ban on Mamata Banerjee's travel to foreign countries in the capacity of West Bengal chief minister.

In such a case, registration of the FIR appears to be a very mechanical exercise and is a clear abuse of the process of law. In fact, registration of such FIR virtually borders on perversity,” Justice Abhay S Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench, said.“The poem’s words do not bring about or promote disharmony or feelings of hatred or ill-will. It only seeks to challenge the injustice made by the ruler. It is impossible to say that the words used by the appellant disturb or are likely to disturb public tranquillity. It is ridiculous to say that the act of the appellant is intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. The poem only tells the rulers what the reaction will be if the fight for rights is met with injustice,” the bench said.Setting standards for assessing the impact of spoken and written words, the bench said, “When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position.”It added, “On Jan 26, 2025, our Constitution became 75 years old. One of the important fundamental rights conferred on the citizens of India is under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It is the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression . This case shows that even after 75 years of the existence of our Constitution, the law enforcement machinery of state is either ignorant about this important fundamental right or does not care for this fundamental right.”","The poem posted online by Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi preached non-violence and love. “No prima facie case can be said to have been made out against the appellant qua the sections invoked.

Accurate circle rates key to good governance: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accurate-circle-rates-key-to-good-governance-sc/articleshow/119682581.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court has ruled that fixation of accurate circle rates , the minimum value of land and properties in a locality, is a prerequisite of good governance and will help enhance ease of living and doing business, but lamented that this important aspect has escaped “adequate attention” of govts.Circle rates notified by govts determine the stamp duty to be paid by purchasers of land and properties in a locality, and helps the land acquisition officer quantify the fair compensation to be paid to landowners.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar, while rejecting an appeal by Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation , said, “While serving the interests of honest taxpayers, accurate circle rates would simultaneously deter non-compliant taxpayers by preventing under-valuation.”In the judgment, the CJI stated, “Rational and fair circle rates are essential for good governance. Since the fixation of circle rates affects everyone financially, the data and methods used to determine them should be made public. Unfortunately, this important aspect has not received sufficient attention from authorities.”“An inflated rate results in an unfair financial burden on purchasers.

In Hinduism, the day of the New Moon, or Amavasya, is regarded as the most significant day. The sole purpose of this day is to honor the ancestors or forefathers. Every month, Amavasya falls, and this may be determined using Daily Hindu Panchang.Amavasya days are regarded as unlucky for carrying out any auspicious rituals, including Griha Pravesh, Mundan, Marriages, and Engagements. However, Amavasya days are seen as auspicious for carrying out religious rites including bathing in the holy Ganga, conducting hawan, feeding Brahmins, participating in charitable activities, and offer prayers to ancestors by performing Pitru Tarpan, Pitru Puja, and Pind Daan.Among the most well-known Amavasya celebrations in Hinduism are Mauni Amavasya, Somvati Amavasya, Shanichari Amavasya, Kartik Amavasya, Mahalaya Amavasya or Sarva Pitri Amavasya, Hariyali Amavasya, and Vat Amavasya.Since this day is dedicated to the Moon and the Moon is in its waning phase, which is unlucky for people with the Moon positioned poorly in their natal birth chart, astrology does not view it as a powerful day. Therefore, we are providing some remedies to help you eliminate the negative effects of the Moon.In addition to doing different religious activities, such as performing hawan dedicated to ancestors, one must perform remedies linked to Saturn on Amavasya day.Your mood, feelings, and emotions will be greatly impacted, and the impact will be significantly greater, if the Moon is in an unfavorable position in your natal birth chart. Since you won't feel well or have much energy on this particular day, you should offer water to the moon in the evening after sighting the Moon and worship Lord Shiva as well, since only Lord Shiva can protect you from the negative effects of Moon.","In Hinduism, the day of the New Moon, or Amavasya, is regarded as the most significant day.

The area has been cordoned off and reinforcements deployed.According to official sources, the slain policemen includes a head constable and two constables. The bodies were yet to be evacuated from the site as the operation continues.Grenades and rocket fire rocked the area with multiple explosions. “The gunfire continued throughout the day,” an official said late at night, adding that the wounded security personnel were taken to Kathua and Jammu hospitals, where they are reported to be in stable condition.The attackers are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.The security forces had closed in on the terrorists hiding in a remote, mountain hut — one of many built by nomadic herders who roam the area with their livestock. But they slipped away, triggering a manhunt across the region.The search entered its fourth day, with the Army, NSG, BSF, CRPF, and J&K police deploying advanced surveillance tools, bulletproof vehicles, UAVs, drones, and sniffer dogs.On Monday, search teams found four loaded magazines of an M4 carbine, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, and materials for making IEDs. A breakthrough came the next day when a woman in Dinga Amb village reported seeing two men in combat clothing asking for water. This prompted an expansion of the search.Also read: 'Separatism breathing its last': Amit Shah hails 'new Bharat' as two more Hurriyat affiliates quit Security has been tightened along Jammu-Pathankot national highway and link roads leading to border villages to plug potential escape routes for the terrorists.In Rajouri district, security forces found a terrorist hideout in Manyal Gali forests of Thanamandi, seizing live rounds, a grenade, a gas cylinder, a solar panel, and food supplies.Terrorist activities sparked protests in Jammu, where Dogra Front and Shiv Sena activists burned a Pakistani flag, denouncing cross-border terrorism.","Three J&K policemen and an equal number of suspected Pakistani terrorists killed in gunfight.

India cannot change fanatical and bigoted mindset of Pakistan: Jaishankar in Lok Sabha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-cannot-change-fanatical-and-bigoted-mindset-of-pakistan-jaishankar-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/119647618.cms,"S Jaishankar (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Friday that India is ""very closely"" tracking incidents of attacks on minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The minister said New Delhi is making its position ""well known"" but cannot change the ""fanatical and bigoted mindset"" of a neighbouring country.During the Question Hour, Jaishankar drew attention to 10 incidents of attacks on Hindus in Pakistan in February. Seven involved abduction and forced conversion, two were cases of abduction, and one incident saw ""police action"" against students celebrating Holi.""There were three incidents relating to the Sikh community in Pakistan. In one case, a Sikh family was attacked. In another case, a Sikh family was threatened because of the reopening of an old gurdwara. There was also an abduction and conversion issue with one girl from that community. There were two cases pertaining to the Ahmadiyya community. In one case, a mosque was sealed and in another case, 40 graves were desegregated and there was one case pertaining to the Christian community, where a Christian person who reportedly was mentally unstable was charged with blasphemy,"" Jaishankar informed the House.He added that India also monitors the welfare of minorities in Bangladesh. ""Like in Pakistan, we track the welfare and well-being of minorities in Bangladesh as well ... In 2024, we had 2,400 incidents relating to attacks on minorities and in 2025, 72 incidents ... I have taken it up with my counterpart there. The foreign secretary also took it up when he visited Bangladesh. This continues to be a matter of concern for our government,"" he said.Responding to a query on whether India plans to take ""tough action"" similar to Indira Gandhi’s stance against Pakistan, Jaishankar said, ""We as a government and a country cannot change the fanatical and bigoted mindset of a neighbour. Even Indira Gandhi could not do it.""On March 26, Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) released a report highlighting a sharp rise in attacks on religious minorities in the country during the first quarter of 2025. The report condemned the escalating abuses, stating that relief and justice remain elusive due to resource constraints and the influence of religious and political figures.HRFP President Naveed Walter said, ""Religious minorities in Pakistan are easier targets for attacks, murders, blasphemy charges, abductions, forced conversions, and forced marriages. The lack of attention to their suffering and neglect is even more painful.""The report cited several recent cases, including the false accusation of theft against Wasif Masih, a Christian youth from Chak Jhumra, Faisalabad, who was assaulted and publicly humiliated with black paint on his face.","S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Friday that India is ""very closely"" tracking incidents of attacks on minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Adhikari accused Banerjee of undermining India on the international stage and bringing shame to the country during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.In his letter, Adhikari claimed that Banerjee’s remarks in London displayed ""devotion and admiration for the colonial masters,"" which he described as ""unthinkable"" for a Bengali. He cited her speech at a business event in the UK, where she said, ""I love UK because we have an emotional relation, historical relation... From the heritage point of view, ours and from yours also. 190 years, you ruled in India. You ruled Bengal... So we forget that? Always India remembers you, and Bengal also remembers you.""Adhikari condemned her remarks, saying that Bengal had been at the forefront of the independence movement, resisting British rule. He said that praising the colonial past amounted to ""public renunciation of the sacrifices made by our freedom movement revolutionaries.""The letter also criticised Banerjee for her statements at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India’s economic growth. When a speaker highlighted that India had overtaken the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee disagreed, saying, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari called her response ""simply treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He alleged that Banerjee had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil"" and accused her of opposing the country's economic rise.The BJP leader further urged the external affairs ministry to conduct a ""thorough probe"" into her remarks and ensure she is not granted permission for official foreign visits in the future. He referenced existing guidelines that require the ministry of external affairs to approve such visits and suggested that her remarks should be considered grounds for disqualification.Banerjee's visit to the UK was marred by controversy, as she faced protests from a group of demonstrators at Kellogg College. Protesters held placards questioning her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video of the incident, criticising Banerjee for her comments on India's economic future. ""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.Union minister Giriraj Singh also slammed Banerjee, saying, ""Hiding the truth and insulting India, both are done by Mamata Banerjee. Today, the whole world is seeing and respecting our growing economy, but unfortunately, when Mamata Banerjee and the 'tukde-tukde gang' go abroad, they insult India. This is unfortunate.""Banerjee, however, responded to hecklers during her speech, saying, ""Please don’t do politics here on this stage. That you can do with me in my state, not here."" She also defended her government regarding the RG Kar College case, stating, ""The case is sub-judice, also, it is with the Central government, not with us.""",West Bengal leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar urging him to prevent future foreign visits by chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her official capacity.

NEW DELHI: Holding that right to freedom of speech and expression was an integral part of a healthy and civilised society, without which it was impossible to lead a dignified life, Supreme Court on Friday said the right of citizens to express themselves could not be trampled upon on “flimsy and fanciful grounds”. The court quashed criminal proceedings initiated by Gujarat Police against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi over his social media post with a poem, ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno’.Creating another layer of protection to prevent harassment by the government or police because of spoken or written words, or by signs or visible representations and also to ensure artistic freedom, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said FIR should not be lodged blindly in a mechanical way. A preliminary inquiry should be conducted by the police to ascertain whether a prima facie case was made out or not under various provisions of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including Sections 196 and 197(1).Setting standards for assessing the impact of spoken and written words, the bench said, “When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position.”New Delhi: Seventy-five years into our republic, we cannot be seen to be so shaky on our fundamentals that mere recital of a poem or, for that matter, any form of art or entertainment, such as stand-up comedy, can be alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities,” Supreme Court said on Friday while exhorting the judiciary to be at the forefront to “zealously protect” the fundamental rights of citizens, including the right to speak and express themselves which it said was not honoured by the police and the executive in many cases.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan frowned upon Gujarat high court for not quashing criminal proceedings against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi for his poem which the court said talked about “love, non-violence and fighting against injustice”. The bench rejected the HC’s justification that it did not interfere as the probe was at an initial stage.“Courts, particularly constitutional courts, must be at the forefront to zealously protect the fundamental rights of citizens. It is the bounden duty of courts to ensure that the Constitution and the ideals of the Constitution are not trampled upon. Endeavour of the courts should always be to protect and promote fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of speech and expression, which is one of the most cherished rights a citizen can have in a liberal constitutional democracy. Courts must not be seen to regulate or stifle freedom of speech and expression. As a matter of fact, courts must remain ever vigilant to thwart any attempt to undermine the Constitution and constitutional values, including freedom of speech and expression,” the bench said.“In a healthy democracy, the views, opinions or thoughts expressed by an individual or group of individuals must be countered by expressing another point of view. Even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected. Literature, including poetry, dramas, films, stage shows including stand-up comedy, satire and art, make the lives of human beings more meaningful. Courts are duty-bound to uphold and enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Sometimes, we, the judges, may not like spoken or written words. But still, it is our duty to uphold the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a). We judges are under an obligation to uphold the Constitution and respect its ideals. If the police or executive fail to honour and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, it is the duty of the courts to step in and protect the fundamental rights. There is no other institution which can uphold the fundamental rights of citizens,” the bench said.It said there was no rule that when the investigation was at a nascent stage, the HC could not exercise its jurisdiction to quash an offence. “When the high court, in the given case, finds that no offence was made out on the face of it, to prevent abuse of the process of law, it can always interfere even though the investigation is at the nascent stage. There is no such blanket rule putting an embargo on the powers of the high court to quash FIR only on the ground that the investigation was at a nascent stage,” it added.","The court quashed criminal proceedings initiated by Gujarat Police against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi over his social media post with a poem, ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno’ A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said FIR should not be lodged blindly in a mechanical way.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119676317,imgsize-29488,width-400,resizemode-4/119676317.jpg"
Iftar outreach vs Waqf politics: Who will gain in battleground Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-vs-mahagathbandhan-iftar-outreach-amid-waqf-politics-in-battleground-bihar/articleshow/119666167.cms,"“Aankh chheen kar chasma daine vale log, rakh lo apne pass yeh Saugat-e-Modi' kit”

NEW DELHI: Iftar diplomacy , an annual ritual in Bihar, has become an important platform for political outreach this year as the state gears up for assembly elections amid the row over Centre's proposed Waqf Amendment Bill . The politics over the Bill has already taken centrestage in the poll-bound state with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) launching its mega all-India protest earlier this week from Patna.Chief minister Nitish Kumar and Union minister Chirag Paswan, who are key allies of the BJP, face immense pressure from Muslim organisations to oppose the Bill. Their get-togethers this year were boycotted by some of these organisations as a mark of protest adding an interesting challenge to their iftar diplomacy.On the last Friday of Ramzan, a large number of Muslims in Patna wore black armbands during Jummah prayers to register their protest against the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, following an appeal by the AIMPLB.Nitish Kumar, who is yet to make a statement on the Bill, has been consistently attending iftar parties to showcase his commitment to the community. On Friday, he attended an iftar party organised at Haj Bhawan in Patna. Despite the enthusiasm at Haj Bhawan, where attendees raised slogans of ‘2025 again CM Nitish Kumar’, the chief minister refrained from interacting with the media and left the venue shortly after meeting the community leaders.Nitish, who faces a catch-22 situation over the issue, would hope that BJP's ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign, launched to reach out to the Muslims, counters some of this anger and creates a division within the community.The ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign, launched by the BJP Minority Morcha aims to distribute special kits to 32 lakh underprivileged Muslims across the country ahead of Eid so that they can celebrate the festival without any hardship.The kits distributed under the ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign will contain a variety of items. Along with food items, the kits will include clothes, vermicelli, dates, dry fruits, and sugar. Women's kits will contain fabric for suits, while men's kits will include kurta-pyjamas.On the other hand, Nitish Kumar's arch rival Lalu Prasad and other opposition parties in the state are going all out to make the most of this anger within the Muslims. An ailing Lalu joined the AIMPLB protest in Patna along with his son Tejashwi, who is leading the charge against the ruling NDA in Bihar. Addressing the protesters, Tejashwi assured them that his party and its leader, Lalu Yadav, firmly stand with them in their fight against the ""unconstitutional"" Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The RJD also took a dig at the BJP by putting up posters condemning the saffron party's ‘Saugat-e-Modi' kits to Muslims while trying to pass the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The posters criticised the BJP-led NDA government over the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and read:(Those who take away eyesight and offer glasses, keep this gift to yourselves).They featured a caricature of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with four hands, each holding labels such as Waqf Bill, NRC and Masjid, among other things.Images of other NDA leaders, including Union minister Chirag Paswan and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, with Waqf Board and NRC written on their hands, respectively, also found place in the posters.The text on the poster read, “Take back the Waqf (Amendment) Bill if you truly want to offer a gift of love. If you wish to distribute something on Eid, spread love—not division. But we know this isn't possible because your (NDA's) shop of hatred will shut down.”The RJD top brass has been actively participating and organising iftar parties to consolidate the party's support among the community in the election year. For now, while the NDA allies, have used the Iftar parties to send across a message of unity among the partners, the state Congress leadership added a twist to opposition tale by giving the RJD iftar party a miss.Elections in the state are still 6 to 7 months away and it will be interesting to see whose Eid outreach translates into votes.","The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) launched its mega all-India protest earlier this week from Patna.

His sharp political satire also touched on Maharashtra’s recent political upheaval, including rifts within the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Other figures he targeted included Prime Minister Narendra Modi and businessman Mukesh Ambani.Despite mounting backlash, Kamra refused to back down. ""I will not apologise,"" he posted on X, criticising both the ""mob and politicians"" angered by his jokes.Later that evening, an FIR was lodged against him over the video for remarks on Shinde.","Kunal Kamra granted interim anticipatory bail till April 7 by the Madras high court.

"No FIR without CJI’s nod, says Amit Shah on Justice Varma case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-fir-without-cjis-nod-says-amit-shah-on-justice-varma-case/articleshow/119676385.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the Centre’s first public response to the alleged recovery of cash from the official bungalow of Justice Yashwant Varma, home minister Amit Shah on Friday said no FIR could have been registered in the matter without a go-ahead from the Chief Justice of India (CJI).“When no FIR can be registered, how can a seizure be carried out. The FIR can only be registered with the CJI’s permission,” Shah said at the Times Now Summit 2025, co-presented by Dream Sports and powered by Pernod Ricard India. He also said a panel of judges was looking into the matter and one should wait for its report.The home minister touched upon several other issues including the Waqf Bill, declaring that govt would bring the bill before Parliament in the ongoing session, notwithstanding the protests by Muslim clerics, Islamic outfits and opposition parties. “(Then) Congress govt had passed the Waqf Bill in 2013 without any debate to appease a votebank. It is against the spirit of the Constitution. We are only trying to bring it in line with the Constitution,” Shah said.“The current law says Waqf Board decisions cannot be challenged in court. How can this be allowed? Even decisions of the govt are challenged in court,” he said while accusing opposition parties of misleading the Muslim community “simply to consolidate a votebank”.Earlier, while speaking on the alleged recovery of cash at Justice Varma’s residence, Shah said CJI Sanjiv Khanna had, in line with the procedure outlined in a Supreme Court verdict, taken note of the matter and set up a committee of judges to hold an inquiry. “Delhi Police and fire brigade are providing whatever documents are sought by the committee. They are cooperating with the inquiry,” he added. “The committee of judges will take a call in the matter and place its decision in the public domain. We should wait for the committee’s report,” the minister said.Shah declined comment on the transfer of Justice Varma, saying it was the domain of the SC collegium. Touching upon the demand for caste census, Shah recalled that the idea of a caste census was rejected by all Congress govts prior to 2011. “A socio-economic caste census was conducted in 2011 but they did nothing with it as it returned 48 lakh castes. Now, we are using technology to explore all possibilities and ways to correctly capture caste and sub-castes. As and when we take a decision on the census procedures, we will make it public,” he said.On delimitation, Shah reiterated the assurance that “no one will have to suffer even 0.001% injustice”. “This is the BJP govt’s policy,” he assured even as he questioned the timing of DMK and other parties raising the delimitation bogey when the govt had not announced any move to take up delimitation or notified its procedure. “DMK is trying to bring up issues like language and delimitation, anticipating defeat in the Tamil Nadu polls next year due to the corruption and chaos its govt has brought about in the state,” he said. On leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi’s grievance that he was not being allowed to speak in Parliament, Shah said he has ample opportunity to speak as Congress gets nearly 40% of the time allotted for all parliamentary debates. “He wants to speak during other members’ time. This may be OK in party office but not in Parliament that runs as per rules. As LoP, he should show respect for rules of Parliament and speak during his party’s time in debates,” he said.On Manipur, Shah said ethnic conflicts had been happening in the past too, sometimes lasting 3-4 years. “There is peace in Manipur for the past 7 months... Talks are being held with both communities. One round was held by MHA and another is expected soon,” he said.Ahead of PM Modi’s visit to RSS headquarters in Nagpur, Shah praised the organisation for training crore of Indians in taking decisions and working while keeping patriotism and nationalism paramount.","Home minister Amit Shah said no FIR could have been registered in the matter without a go-ahead from the Chief Justice of India (CJI) “When no FIR can be registered, how can a seizure be carried out?

"Mega Rs 62,700 crore deal for 'Prachand' attack choppers inked after CCS nod",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mega-rs-62700-crore-deal-for-prachand-attack-choppers-inked-after-ccs-nod/articleshow/119664746.cms,"Light combat helicopters

NEW DELHI: India on Friday inked the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract to acquire 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters (LCHs) for its armed forces from Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ), in the biggest-ever such deal that was signed soon after it got the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security.The CCS approved the procurement of 90 LCHs for the Army and 66 for IAF, which are armed with 20mm turret guns, 70mm rocket systems and air-to-air missiles for offensive operations and precision-strikes in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Siachen Glacier on the borders with China and Pakistan.The 156 LCHs, along with associated equipment and training for Rs 62,700 crore, excluding taxes, will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and 5 Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract in 2022. “Prachand is a powerful machine. This decision marks a major boost to India’s combat capabilities and self-reliance in defence ,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.The CCS, incidentally, also approved the new defence cooperation agreement with Sri Lanka, ahead of PM Modi’s visit to the island nation next week.TOI was the first to report that the deals for the 156 LCHs and 307 indigenous advanced towed artillery systems with gun-towing vehicles (Rs 6,900 crore) would be cleared by the CCS and inked before this fiscal ends on March 31.The deals for the direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters from France as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Docks, collectively worth almost Rs 1 lakh crore (Euro 10.6 billion), however, have been deferred to be the next fiscal now.As per the contracts inked in presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, the 156 LCHs will be built at HAL helicopter factories in Bengaluru and Tumkur in Karnataka. “The deliveries will begin in three years, with 30 LCHs to be manufactured per year,” an official told TOI.“LCH is India’s first indigenously designed and developed combat helicopter capable of operating at an altitude of over 5,000 meters (16,400-feet) with a considerable load of weapons and fuel,” he said.The highly-agile and manoeuvrable 5.8-tonne Prachand has 45% indigenous content by value at present. “The plan is to achieve an overall indigenous content of over 65% during the execution of this 156-LCH procurement,” he added.Separately, the MoD also signed a contract with US company Metrea Management for “wet leasing” of one KC-135 mid-air refuelling aircraft, which will come within six months, for providing training to IAF and Navy pilotsThe total number of contracts signed by the MoD during the 2024-25 fiscal has now reached 193, with the overall value crossing Rs 2 lakh crore. “This is the highest ever such figure, and nearly double the previous such number. Of them, the contracts to domestic industry are 177 (92%), with a value of almost Rs 1.7 lakh crore (81%),” another official said.Powered by two Shakti engines developed with the French Safran Group, the Prachand can take on enemy infantry troops, tanks, bunkers and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). The need for such helicopters for mountain warfare was first acutely felt during the 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan.The chopper also has “enhanced survivability” through light-weight armour panels against 7.62mm and 12.7mm rounds, self-sealing fuel tanks, damage-tolerant main rotor blades, bullet-proof windshields and a low frontal radar cross-section.","India on Friday inked the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract to acquire 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters (LCHs) for its armed forces from Hindustan Aeronautics.

His legal team had approached the apex court after the Gujarat high court had rejected his bail plea in August 2024, citing the seriousness of the crime.The SC, however, considered only the medical grounds, leading to his temporary release.Asaram was convicted in 2023 by a Gandhinagar court for raping a woman who lived at his ashram in Gujarat. He is also serving life imprisonment for sexually assaulting a minor in 2013 at his Jodhpur ashram.Following the Supreme Court’s initial bail order in January, security around the rape survivor’s family was significantly increased.Earlier, he was granted a seven-day parole in 2018, later extended by five days.He also received a 17-day parole in December 2024 before obtaining his interim bail in January 2025.Asaram was first arrested in 2013 after a minor girl from Shahjahanpur accused him of sexual assault at his Jodhpur ashram. Convicted in 2018, he was sentenced to life imprisonment under the POCSO Act.

SRINAGAR: As thousands of people took to the streets on Friday in different areas of Kashmir to observe Al-Quds Day in solidarity with Palestine, J&K police have registered an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the organisers at some places for raising pro-Hezbollah slogans and flags. Al-Quds is Arabic for Jerusalem.Kashmiri protesters carrying banners that read “Free Palestine” marched through the busy markets of Srinagar, Budgam, and other districts.

It is an annual pro-Palestinian event held on the last Friday of the Islamic month of Ramadan. Many speakers said that Kashmir stands in solidarity with the “oppressed people of Palestine”.A police statement said a case has been registered against the organisers and participants of a Youm-e-Quds procession in Beerwah, Budgam, “for creating a law and order situation by raising objectionable slogans”.“By sloganeering, organisers tried to create a law and order situation, thereby causing obstruction to smooth movement of the general public,” police said.

J&K police lodged an FIR at police station Pattan against a group of people seen carrying Hezbollah flags, placards, and banners featuring photographs of the Hezbollah commander.“The individuals were also heard raising slogans in support of Hezbollah with the intent to incite the general public and encourage elements associated with terrorist organisations to engage in subversive activities and to revive terrorist activities within the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” police said.“Police have initiated their investigation into the matter and swift action is assured against those found involved in activities that threaten peace and stability in the region,” police said.","Kashmiri protesters carrying banners that read ‘Free Palestine’ marched through the busy markets of Srinagar, Budgam, and other districts.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai on Friday said that the party's central leadership will take an ""appropriate call"" on the shape and form of alliances for the 2026 assembly elections, aiming to unseat MK Stalin's ruling DMK.His remarks come amid speculation about a possible revival of the BJP-AIADMK alliance after AIADMK general secretary and former Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami met Union home minister Amit Shah earlier this week.Asked about the AIADMK returning to the NDA, Annamalai said, ""I am not authorised to talk about alliance or the formation of alliance at this point of time.""""As the president of Tamil Nadu BJP, the role that is given to me is to strengthen the party in the state. That is what all of us are trying to do. The leaders are with me, the cadres are with me,"" he added.He said that ""with respect to the shape and form of the alliance in 2026 and the nature of the NDA, our leadership will take a call at an appropriate time and naturally the media will be briefed.""Speaking after a meeting with Union minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Annamalai described the 2026 elections as an opportunity to dethrone the DMK, citing corruption allegations and a ""deteriorating law and order situation"" in the state.""The DMK should be brought down from power and no vote should get wasted by the votes getting shifted between different parties. Tamil Nadu, as of now, has a five-cornered contest. Nowhere else in the Indian politics you see a five-cornered contest ,"" he said.He reiterated that alliance decisions rest with BJP's national leadership. ""With respect to the alliance, you have to understand that for a national party like the BJP, a disciplined party, it is our national leadership that will decide. So, we have committees, we have parliamentary boards which look into a lot of angles before they make the decision.""""We respect our national leadership and they will make sure and look into everything. They will decide how the further course will go,"" he added.On actor-turned-politician Vijay’s recent criticism of both the BJP and DMK, Annamalai dismissed it as ""politics of speaking"" rather than action.""Very sadly, Mr Vijay has decided to do politics of speaking: just take a mike, criticise the Central government and the state government, and get away with it,"" he said.""People are asking what is the productive solution you are going to bring. Are you solving the issues... Today he talked about the fishermen issue. We are solving the fishermen issue.

NEW DELHI: The bodies of three Jammu and Kashmir policemen killed in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were recovery on Friday, as the gunfight in Jammu's Kathua district stretched into its second day.The fourth policeman's body was located in the morning, but retrieval efforts were delayed as two terrorists continued firing from an elevated position.The encounter began on Thursday in Jakhole village, Ghati Juthana area, after security forces launched an operation against recently infiltrated terrorists from across the International Border. So far, four policemen and three terrorists have been killed, while seven security personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), have been injured.Heavy gunfire and explosions continued as police, the Army, and CRPF advanced through difficult terrain. It is unclear if these terrorists were part of a group that earlier escaped a security cordon in Hiranagar’s Sanyal forest or a separate infiltration.The bodies of the policemen—Balwinder Singh Chib, Jaswant Singh, and Tariq Ahmed—were recovered after a day of search efforts. Their service weapons were missing, but officials have not confirmed whether the terrorists took them.Director General of Police (DGP) Nalin Prabhat received the bodies at the medical college before a ceremonial tribute at district police lines in Kathua.The officers had been protecting the SDPO leading the search party when they were ambushed. The SDPO was later evacuated in an injured state. Three other policemen and two Army personnel are also hospitalised but stable.Earlier, a group of terrorists was spotted in Sanyal village near the International Border. Security forces launched a massive search operation using advanced surveillance tools, but the terrorists managed to escape and later resurfaced near Jakhole, about 30 km away. Search teams later found weapons, grenades, bulletproof vests, and bomb-making materials near the original encounter site.Reinforcements from the police, Army, and CRPF were sent to the area, while special forces were airdropped to hunt down the terrorists. Security officials believe the terrorists infiltrated last Saturday, possibly through a ravine or a newly built tunnel.The People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a front for Jaish-e-Mohammed, has claimed responsibility for the attack.Jammu police officials have been overseeing operations in Kathua for the past four days. The Army’s Rising Star Corps paid tribute to the fallen officers, saying on X: ""Rising Star Corps salutes the valour and indomitable spirit of the brave (J-K) Police personnel who made the supreme sacrifice fighting valiantly during the ongoing OP Safiyan in Kathua. Their courage and dedication will always be remembered.""","The bodies of three policemen killed in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were recovery on Friday.

I was sitting in the lobby of a hotel, waiting to attend a session, with an hour to spare. The hotel was abuzz with preparations for a reunion—a gathering of men in their fifties, likely former classmates. As the guests started to arrive, loud cheers and animated conversations filled the air; they seemed engulfed in waves of nostalgia.There is something both heartwarming and melancholic about reunions. Heartwarming because time had softened old rivalries, leaving only camaraderie. Melancholic because life had played its capricious hand—those once dismissed as failures now shone like stars, while the once-envied prodigies had faded into anonymity.When we were children, sitting side by side at wooden desks, the world felt fair and equal. Our uniforms were the same, we shared our lunches and endured punishments together. Laughter rolled freely, tears were wiped away. And we dreamed the same dreams.With the naïve confidence of youth, we believed that life would be just and effort always equalled success.But life is an unusual classroom. Unlike school , where lessons precede tests, life tests us first and teaches us later. It is a mischievous storyteller, delighting in unexpected plot twists.The girl who once thundered on debate stages now hesitates to voice her opinion at home. The quiet one, whom nobody noticed, is now a celebrated bureaucrat.And we ask ourselves:I was reminded of a verse by Na Muthukumar, one of modern Tamil literature’s finest poets, titled ‘Nobody told us that life does not follow the predictable equations of the classroom. That intelligence matters but timing matters more. That hard work is invaluable, but networking often determines success. Sometimes, we land on a square where a ladder lifts us higher; at other times, we find ourselves at the mouth of a snake that drags us down into unseen depths.Thiruvalluvar smiles at us from across centuries, reminding us that the world has its own intricate balance—one we may never fully grasp:Who are we, but mere travellers in this vast, unknowable design of creation?As I was summoned to my meeting, I took one last glance at the old friends in the lobby. Time had aged them, but their laughter remained untouched.The brief reunion returned them to the warm womb of the classroom—where there were no disparities, only shared dreams.“Thank God for small mercies,” I whispered to myself and walked away.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119667442,imgsize-102056,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/119667442.jpg"

Rana Sanga row in Parliament leads to BJP-opposition clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rana-sanga-row-in-parliament-leads-to-bjp-opposition-clash/articleshow/119679209.cms,"New Delhi: The ongoing row over Rajput ruler Rana Sanga spilled over into Parliament on Friday, with governing BJP condemning the remark of SP Rajya Sabha member Ramji Lal Suman that Sanga had invited Babur to India, and the Samajwadis and Congress alleging that Suman and other Dalit and tribal representatives were being targeted in UP at the instance of BJP. While Lok Sabha witnessed a minor skirmish over the issue, the clash was protracted in Rajya Sabha.During zero hour in LS, Jaipur rural MP Rao Rajendra Singh called Sanga a synonym of valour and sought to condemn Suman’s statement but SP members led by Dharmendra Yadav protested. BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said the nation would not tolerate insult to great warriors.Later, Dharmendra sought to raise an issue relating to a Muslim MP in the last LS but was refused permission.As soon as proceedings began in RS, slogan-shouting BJP members rose to their feet to demand an apology from Suman. Chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar called Rana Sanga “a symbol of chivalry and patriotism,” and criticised Suman’s remarks.“Our problem is that because of technology whatever we expunge is expunged only in our record. Social media gives traction to it,” he said. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju condemned Suman’s statement as an insult to the nation.Leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge said Congress respected all patriots but condemned attacks on Suman’s house, while warning that such “anti-Dalit actions will not be tolerated”. This provoked BJP members, who accused Kharge of “unnecessarily bringing the caste and Dalit card into play”. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal criticised Kharge for trying to “give a caste twist” to the issue. Suman got up to speak but BJP MPs started shouting slogans, which led the chair to adjourn the proceedings till noon.Dharmendra later told TOI that he wanted to highlight that SC/ST/OBC and Muslims representatives are under attack from BJP. He said Danish Ali was insulted in the House by a BJP member in the 17th LS, and now Suman’s house was attacked in Agra while the UP chief minister was in the city. He said days earlier, Robertsganj MP Chhotelal, a tribal, was attacked by BJP workers during an official meeting in Chandauli.",BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said the nation would not tolerate insult to great warriors. Samajwadis and Congress allege that Suman and other Dalit and tribal representatives were being targeted in UP at the instance of BJP.

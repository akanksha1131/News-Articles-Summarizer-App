‘Treated worse than animals’: 12 labourers from UP reportedly stranded in Kyrgyzstan; families allege fraud by local agents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/treated-worse-than-animals-12-labourers-from-up-reportedly-stranded-in-kyrgyzstan-families-allege-fraud-by-local-agents/articleshow/125799405.cms,"Representative AI image

Twelve labourers from Pilibhit, reportedly stranded and facing harassment in Kyrgyzstan, are at the centre of a detailed report submitted by the district administration to the Uttar Pradesh Home Department, officials said on Friday.District magistrate Gyanendra Singh stated that the report was prepared following a directive from the Home Department, which had asked for factual details and instructed the Superintendent of Police to conduct an inquiry.“Information about all 12 persons stranded in Kyrgyzstan has been compiled and sent to the government so that the due process can be initiated for their safe return,” Singh was quoted as saying by PTI.The families identified the workers as Ravi Kumar, Ajay, Chandrapal, Santram, Rohit, Ramesh, Harswaroop, Shyamcharan, Sanjeev, Prempal, Ramasare, and Harishankar, saying they were sent to Kyrgyzstan nearly three months ago by agents of a local recruitment agency. Each worker reportedly paid around Rs 2.5 lakh and was sent on a 59-day visa under “misleading contracts,” relatives claimed.The families alleged that the men are being forced to work in different cities, denied adequate food, and prevented from returning home.They further claimed the workers were being beaten and treated “worse than animals.”Families of the stranded labourers have alleged that the men are being tortured abroad, and that local agents are demanding up to Rs 2 lakh for their return. The workers have also been sending video messages to their families, pleading for rescue.Relatives have repeatedly approached police and administrative officials for assistance. Earlier this week, several family members met with Singh and superintendent of police Abhishek Yadav to recount the ordeal.Officials stated that all 12 workers want to return to India as soon as possible, and their video appeals have been included in the ongoing investigation. According to the district magistrate, the administration’s report will assist the state government in taking steps to facilitate their repatriation, PTI.SP Abhishek Yadav confirmed that the case has been assigned to CO City Deepak Chaturvedi for investigation. He said the families have submitted written complaints alleging that a local firm operating from a city colony, along with its representatives, played a role in sending the workers abroad on false promises.","Twelve labourers from Pilibhit are reportedly stranded and facing harassment in Kyrgyzstan.

NEW DELHI: The Red Fort complex in the heart of the capital will be the venue of the 20th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from Dec 8-13 with over 1,000 delegates from more than 185 countries expected to participate. The inauguration will be held on Sunday.Undeterred by the blast that occurred on Nov 10 near the historical monument, the govt is going all out to uphold the spirit of India and send out a strong message from the Red Fort complex, also a Unesco World Heritage Site.From varied galleries showcasing art, history and artefacts to states setting up stalls to present India’s diverse culture and stage performances — the Red Fort is all set to bring alive the India story over the next one week in one place. The culture ministry plans to keep the cultural components and the galleries open even after the meeting is over so that people can visit them over the next one month in the run-up to Republic Day on Jan 26.The meeting is not only a significant platform for cultural diplomacy and showcasing India’s soft power, but also important as it has formally proposed the festival of Diwali for inclusion in Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list.India’s nomination will be examined for inscription on the list at the session. This will mark a significant step to gain global recognition for this major festival, following previous Indian inclusions like Durga Puja in Kolkata, Kumbh Mela, Buddhist chanting of Ladakh, Yoga, Nawrouz and Garba of Gujarat.India currently has 15 elements inscribed on Unesco’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.On why Red Fort was chosen, culture minister Gajendra Shekhawat said one day when he came with officials to the site to review the state of maintenance and management of the monument, this thought came up that why not hold this global meet on intangible heritage in a Unesco World Heritage site. “It was challenging but everyone in the ministry worked hard as a team. They kept working despite the recent incident (the blast case near Red Fort) that you saw. Three new galleries have also been readied. We are now ready to welcome the dignitaries,” he added.The meeting will examine nominations submitted by state parties for inscription on the Unesco ICH list, review the status of existing elements and provide international assistance for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage.","The Red Fort complex in the heart of the capital will be the venue of the 20th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from Dec 8-13.

New Delhi: India and Russia on Friday vowed to scale up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030, with PM Narendra Modi saying the target could be ach-ieved ""well ahead of schedule"".""Considering the tremendous potential in our partnership, I am confident that we will achieve this target well ahead of schedule. We are making rapid progress towards this goal,"" Modi said, recalling the target of $100 billion that he and President Vladimir Putin had set last year. The two leaders were speaking at the India-Russia Business Forum.Modi said India and Russia could jointly drive growth in the Global South with India's leadership in affordable EVs, two-wheelers and CNG mobility and Russia's strength in advanced materials, and could collaborate in vaccine development, cancer therapy and automotive components.The PM said both countries were ""actively working"" towards the early conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union - comprising Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.Putin said Moscow wanted to deepen cooperation across security, economy, trade and culture. ""What we want is the development of our multi-faceted relations with India in various fields,"" he said. Russian companies, he added, were ready to ""increase manifold"" their purchases of Indian goods and services.He stressed that free trade would require resilient payment systems and insurance mechanisms, an issue that has complicated settlements since financial sanctions on Russia. Putin said Russia was looking to expand energy cooperation with India and ready to ensure uninterrupted fuel shipments. Moscow, he said, was open to joint work on small modular reactors and even floating nuclear power plants. He also wanted to enhance industrial cooperation with a focus on new technologies such as AI.The first round of talks on FTA between India and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union began last week. India wants to increase the composition of products in its trade basket with Russia as India exported goods worth $4.9 billion to Russia in 2024-25, while importing goods worth $63.8 billion, primarily crude oil and petroleum products, with a trade imbalance of $59 billion.","India and Russia vow to scale up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030.

Nations reaffirm anti-terror commitment

NEW DELHI: The long-standing extensive defence partnership between India and Russia will “reorient” itself from largely a buyer-seller relationship at present to joint R&D, co-development and co-production of advanced military technologies and systems.The joint statement issued after the Modi-Putin summit said this was in tune with India’s quest for self-reliance in defence production. Both sides agreed to encourage joint manufacturing in India of spare parts, components and other products for maintenance of Russian-origin arms as well as defence equipment under the Make in India programme through transfer of technology, it said.The two countries will also work to set up joint ventures to meet the needs of the Indian armed forces as well as “subsequently export to mutually friendly third countries”, it added.While no fresh defence deal was inked during the summit, as was expected, the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov on Thursday discussed India’s plan to procure another five squadrons of the S-400 ‘Triumf’ air defence systems and Rs 10,000 crore worth of their surface-to-air missiles for existing units, which performed extremely well during Operation Sindoor, as was earlier reported by TOI.In the air defence arena, India is also looking to acquire short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba surface-to-air missile systems. Another procurement on the anvil is R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters in IAF’s combat fleet.Joint production of advanced and lightweight variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles also figured in the talks. These BrahMos-NG missiles, for instance, will be able to arm even lightweight fighters instead of the present ones that only heavyweight Sukhoi-30MKI jets can carry.PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin expressed satisfaction with the regular military contacts between the two countries, while appreciating the ‘Indra’ joint military exercises between their armed forces. They reaffirmed their commitment to maintain the momentum of joint military cooperation activities and expand military delegation exchanges, the statement said.PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed their strong commitment to preventing and countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border movement of terrorists and terrorist financing networks and safe havens.“India and Russia have long stood shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism. Whether it is the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, or the cowardly attack at Crocus City Hall, the root of all such incidents is the same. India firmly believes that terrorism is a direct assault on the values of humanity, and that global unity against it is our greatest strength,” said Modi in his media statement. According to the joint statement, the leaders unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation by any “religious or ideological pretexts, whenever, wherever, and by whomsoever they may be committed”.They also called for actions against all UN-listed terrorist groups and entities, including al-Qaida, ISIS/Daesh and their affiliates, aimed at rooting out terrorists’ safe havens.","The long-standing extensive defence partnership between India and Russia will ‘reorient itself from largely a buyer-seller relationship at present to joint R&D, co-development and co-production of advanced military technologies and systems’ Both sides agreed to encourage joint manufacturing in India of spare parts, components and other products for maintenance of Russian-origin arms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125798463,imgsize-198992,width-400,resizemode-4/india-russia-defence-ministers-meeting.jpg"

Putin, Modi Supercharge India’s Atomic Future With Big Reactor Push And Next-Gen Mini Reactors

NEW DELHI: As the world watched the India-Russia summit intently, hoping PM Narendra Modi would nudge President Vladimir Putin towards an early end to the Ukraine war, Modi’s message to the president going into the bilateral meeting was that the welfare of the world lay in the path to peace that the international community must work together to find. Modi reiterated that India was not neutral but on the side of peace, while backing all recent efforts to bring the war to an end.Putin thanked Modi for his efforts to seek a solution and briefed him on ongoing efforts, including with the US, to resolve the crisis peacefully. Both leaders were very upfront about sharing their perspectives as they brought the issue up in their televised opening remarks, with Modi attributing their continued exchanges on Ukraine to the trust they share in their relationship.“We support every effort for peace and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every effort for peace. The entire world has passed through many crises, from Covid until now. We hope that very soon the world will get relief from these worries and on the path of progress in the right direction, a new hope will emerge for the global community,” said Modi, expressing confidence that ongoing efforts would soon see the world headed towards peace.He also said India had always been ready to contribute to such efforts and would remain so.India will hope that Modi’s message, along with the fact that there was no big-ticket announcement in sensitive areas like defence, will help soothe frayed nerves in the West, which has been visibly riled by India’s hosting of Putin, even if under the 25-year-old annual summit mechanism. India is in the advanced stages of a free trade agreement with both the US, which has slapped a 25% tariff on India for its oil trade with Russia, and EU.With EU at least, India is hoping to conclude negotiations in the next few weeks as it would clear the ground for a successful India-EU summit on Jan 27. Brussels has closely followed Putin’s visit, concerned that it could throw a spanner in its efforts to upgrade the relationship with India through the FTA, for which both sides are still required to address contentious issues like EU’s carbon tax and its insistence on a commitment to the Paris Agreement in the bilateral trade agreement. However, except for the optics of the summit, it’s unlikely that EU would tie itself up in knots over the outcomes that focused mostly on areas like economic cooperation, healthcare, migration and media.India’s fresh call for peace followed its decision earlier this week to abstain from voting on a UNGA resolution demanding an end to Russia’s forced relocation of Ukrainian children.“We have had continuous discussions on Ukraine. You have also, from time to time, as a true friend, kept us informed of all matters. I believe that this trust is a great strength. I have discussed this subject many times with you and have also placed it before the world: the welfare of the world lies in the path of peace. We must all search for the path to peace together,” said Modi in his opening remarks.In his opening remarks, Putin said he discussed at length the Ukraine issue with Modi at the private dinner the PM hosted for him on Thursday. “I could share a great deal of details about the events taking place in Ukraine and what is being undertaken by us jointly with some other partners, including the US, on the question of a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis. And the actions we are taking together with some partners including the US on a possible peaceful settlement,” said Putin, adding that the relationship with India was characterised by substance.","India will hope that Modi’s message, along with the fact that there was no big- ticket announcement in sensitive areas like defence, will help soothe frayed nerves in the West. Putin thanked Modi for his efforts to seek a solution and briefed him on ongoing efforts, including with the US.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125798449,imgsize-41860,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi.jpg"

Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week.

NAGPUR: Quoting a Supreme Court ruling, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has said the use of loudspeakers is not essential to practising a religion, and that amplified sound cannot infringe on the rights of unwilling listeners. Dismissing a plea by Masjid Gousiya in Maharashtra’s Gondia district, seeking a directive to restore use of loudspeakers at the mosque, the bench on Monday said the petitioner failed to produce any legal or religious document establishing a right to use loudspeakers for offering prayers.A division bench said: “The top court had observed that no religion prescribes prayers be performed by disturbing the peace of others through voice amplifiers or drum beating.” At a hearing on Oct 16, HC asked the petitioner to demonstrate whether installing loudspeakers was mandatory in religious practice.The petitioner could not produce supporting material and was “not entitled to seek relief”, it said. “The SC had also noted that while there is a right to speech, there exists a right to listen or decline to listen. Nobody can be compelled to listen, and nobody can claim he has a right to make his voice trespass the minds of others,” the bench observed.

Do we need a law that deals with marital rape? Watch what Delhi, Mumbai residents have to say

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Friday introduced a private member’s bill in the Lok Sabha to criminalise marital rape, calling it an urgent need to uphold women’s rights, emphasising India’s constitutional values.Speaking during the introduction of the bill, the veteran Congress leader told the parliament that the country must move from “No means no” to “Only yes means yes"".In his social media posts later, Tharoor said the marital rape bill seeks to amend the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and remove the current exception that allows non-consensual sex within marriage.“Every woman deserves bodily autonomy and dignity within marriage. Marital rape is about violence, not marriage. The moment for action has arrived,” he said.The bill notes that Section 63 of the law currently excludes marital rape as a punishable offence, leaving married women without legal protection and perpetuating outdated patriarchal notions.""This failure to criminalise marital rape has left married women legally defenceless, distinguishing them from unmarried women and perpetuating the misconception that marriage voids the necessity of consent.This undermines women's fundamental rights to dignity, safety and bodily autonomy,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the bill said.""Allowing a husband to force sex upon his wife disregards her autonomy and perpetuates a culture of control and gender-based violence. Similarly, factors unrelated to a woman's autonomy, such as her caste, profession, clothing choices, personal beliefs or past sexual conduct, should never be used to presume her consent. Such assumptions not only perpetuate gender-based inequality but also violate her fundamental rights and dignity. They must be unequivocally rejected,"" the statement further said.Tharoor also introduced two other private members’ bills — one to amend the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, and another to set up a permanent States and Union Territories Reorganisation Commission to guide future reorganisation of states and Union territories.A private member bills allow MPs from opposition parties to propose laws, though most are withdrawn after government review.",The bill seeks to amend the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and remove the current exception that allows non-consensual sex within marriage.

'Israel-India Defense Ties Are Long-Standing And Strategic': Expert Danny Citrinowicz

NEW DELHI: Israel has urged India to formally designate Hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations, saying that New Delhi’s position carries significant weight across South Asia.Senior officials from Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs, speaking in Jerusalem, said they believe India understands the “networks and linkages” behind these organisations. They stressed that Israel had already proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and now expects “reciprocation” from India.“Our request from India is to work hard to sanction and designate these organisations as terrorist groups. Israel designated Lashkar-e-Taiba a couple of years ago, and we would like to see this reciprocated,” one official said, as quoted by ANI.Israel also underlined what it described as strong ties between Hamas and LeT, and warned that Iran’s IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah have increasingly been relying on transnational criminal groups to conduct attacks.“You're not going to see an Iranian operative act directly in Europe. What you will see is a criminal group -- a drug lord, a human trafficker or another network -- connected to an Iranian handler who then carries out an attack, as we've seen in Scandinavia or in London,” the official said.The remarks came just days after a similar appeal from the Israeli Defence Forces. “It will be a good thing if India did. India and Israel have a common enemy. It will be good to have a clear statement on who we face,” Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, International Spokesperson for the IDF, said in Tel Aviv on December 1.Another official emphasised that even a declaratory move from India would have a “strong global impact”, given the influence India holds in the region. “Neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives ‘look up to India’, and New Delhi’s stance shapes regional responses,” the official said.“It's not only about freezing assets or banning operatives from entering India. It signals that India has clearly seen what Hamas is doing, and no operative should step on Indian soil,” he added.“We are putting pressure on India to designate Hamas... After having designated Lashkar-e-Taiba, we would like to see the same,” the official said, noting “clear attempts” by Hamas to rebuild its structures and stressing that dismantling them remains central to the next phase of the US-proposed ceasefire.Hamas, founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is designated a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Canada and several other countries.

Here are Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top quotes from the joint press conference

My friend President Putin, delegates from both countries - I am happy to welcome President Putin for the 23rd India–Russia Bilateral Summit. Twenty-five years ago, President Putin laid the foundation of our strategic partnership.

The world has witnessed many ups and downs in the last eight decades. However, the friendship between India and Russia has remained like a pole star. This relationship is built on mutual respect and trust... Today, we have held discussions on all factors that will help strengthen this relationship.

Energy security has been a strong pillar of our partnership, and we will continue this win-win cooperation. Our collaboration in civil nuclear energy has spanned decades and contributed to clean energy. Our cooperation in critical minerals is essential for maintaining a diverse and reliable global supply chain.

This year in October, millions of devotees received the blessings of Lord Buddha's sacred relics at the International Buddhist Forum in Kalmykia. I'm pleased that we will soon be launching a free 30-day e-tourist visa and a 30-day Group Tourist Visa for Russian citizen.

Top quotes from Putin's address

We are ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the growing Indian economy.

I thank President of India, Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister of India and all our Indian colleagues for the warm and hospitable welcome accorded to the Russian delegation...I thank PM Modi for the dinner at his residence yesterday.

Last year, our bilateral trade turnover grew by 12 per cent, setting a new record. We are currently forecasting that this year’s trade agreement will remain at the same impressive level.

The Prime Minister gave us a list of challenges that deserve the attention of both governments, and we will act on them. The creation of a Free Trade Agreement between India and the Eurasian Economic Union will help. Our countries are gradually moving to mutual settlements in national currencies, which already account for 96% of commercial transactions. We are also witnessing successful partnerships in energy - stable supplies of oil, gas, coal, and everything required for India’s energy needs.

India and Russia have long been standing shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism. Whether it is the terrorist attack in Pahalgam or the cowardly attack on the Crocus City Hall, the root of all these incidents is the same. India's unwavering belief is that terrorism is a direct assault on the values of humanity and that global unity against it is our greatest strength. India and Russia have close cooperation in the UN, G20, BRICS, SCO, and other forums. We will continue our dialogue and cooperation in all these forums.

Our country, for the last half a century, has been helping to arm and modernise the Indian Army, including the Air Defence Forces, aviation, and the Navy. In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiation we just had...I can express my confidence that the current visit and the agreements reached will help further deepen the Russian-Indian strategic partnership for the benefit of our countries and the people, the peoples of India and Russia.

TN defies HC for 2nd time in 2 days on hilltop lamp ritual,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tn-defies-hc-for-2nd-time-in-2-days-on-hilltop-lamp-ritual/articleshow/125775300.cms,"BJP state chief Nainar Nagenthran (right), party veteran H Raja (centre) and other partymen being arrested in Thiruparankundram on Thursday

MADURAI: The Karthigai Deepam issue has snowballed into a major controversy in Tamil Nadu, with the state govt Thursday defying for the second time a Madras HC order allowing lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon (a stone lamp pillar) atop Thiruparankundram hills, even as a division bench of the HC rejected its appeal against a contempt order. Meanwhile, BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and dozens of others were detained by police during protests.State govt filed an SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.Earlier in the day, the bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state’s appeal, saying it was meant to preempt contempt action. The bench upheld Justice G R Swaminathan’s orders permitting lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon with CISF protection. The single bench had also initiated contempt proceedings Wednesday after the Deepam was lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple, not at Deepathoon atop the hill, as directed by it on Dec 1.Despite the single-bench order on Wednesday, police had prevented the petitioner and 10 others, who had been allowed to light the lamp at Deepathoon, from proceeding to the hills citing prohibitory orders.Following the rejection of the state’s appeal Thursday, Justice Swaminathan resumed the contempt proceedings, quashed the prohibitory orders imposed by Madurai district administration, and once again permitted lighting of the lamp atop the hill, this time under protection of Madurai city police. If officials defied the order, “harsh consequences will ensue”, the judge said.However, police once again stopped the individuals from proceeding, saying it would be detrimental to public order. It was a re-enactment of the scene from Wednesday at the Thiruparankundram foothills, with hundreds of BJP workers and Hindu group activists protesting against state govt, and over 1,000 police personnel deployed. BJP’s Nagendran had an argument with police before he was detained along with several others, including H Raja and Amarprasad Reddy, and about 50 cadres to prevent them from proceeding to the hills.Meanwhile, the HC division bench will on Dec 5 take up the appeals filed by Madurai district collector and executive officer of the Subramaniya Swamy temple authorities, challenging the order passed by the single bench allowing the lamp to be lit at Deepathoon.Justice Swaminathan had Monday allowed Rama Ravikumar and other petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon, brushing aside objections on proximity of the site to a dargah and the fact that the lamp has been lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple for decades.","State govt files an SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo's operational crisis entered its fourth straight day on Friday, triggering widespread chaos at airports across the country, leaving thousands of passengers stranded with no food, no water, vacant counters and lost luggages.IndiGo has suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight on Friday, intensifying the ongoing travel chaos. This comes a day after the airline cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights, far exceeding its usual daily disruptions. The worst-hit routes were those connecting Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa, triggering delays and congestion across major airports nationwide.According to PTI, airport-wise cancellations included 118 in Mumbai, 100 in Bengaluru, 75 in Hyderabad, 35 in Kolkata, 26 in Chennai and 11 in Goa, with several other airports reporting disruptions as well.Across airports, frustrated passengers complained about long queues, no staff support, uncertainty over alternative flights and hours-long waits at baggage belts.Many shared photos on X showing crowds sleeping on luggage, overflowing check-in areas and piles of unattended bags — unsure whether to go home or hope for a last-minute update.Sharing a post on X, one user wrote, ""Spent the last 4h at Bangalore airport. Some people have been here for more than 13 hours. Every single Indigo flight has been delayed significantly and then cancelled. I still find privilege in having the opportunity to try and get on any flight so I can get to my meetings, yet, no flights available until 24h from now. This is not progress. Thousands stranded.""Inside the terminal, long queues snaked across check-in counters and security lines, with seating areas completely full. A passenger travelling to Bengaluru told TOI that, ""My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.15 pm on Thursday. I rushed to see if I could get a ticket on another airline. But a ticket to Bengaluru had become pricier than a seat at a Taylor Swift concert. Clearly, other carriers were indulging in 'surge pricing. '""Later, when the passengers asked an IndiGo staffer about their delayed flight, he reportedly said: ""The plane is ready, but we don’t have a pilot to fly it,"" offering no clear answers on the delay or cancellation.At several airports, frustration boiled over — angry flyers protested at gates, and the chaos even disrupted boarding for other airlines.Airlines reportedly increased fares amid the crunch. A Delhi–Bengaluru ticket for Friday/Saturday ranged between Rs 11,000 and Rs 43,145, while Mumbai–Kolkata fares touched Rs 19,000.With IndiGo operating 65% of India’s domestic market, disruptions have hit other carriers too. Aircraft stuck at airports like Pune delayed the movement of other airlines.The DGCA held multiple emergency meetings and directed IndiGo to stabilise operations immediately and ensure fares do not rise due to reduced capacity.""To reduce passenger inconvenience while maintaining safety margins, IndiGo has requested operational variations/exemptions from specific FDTL provisions for A320 operations up to 10th February 2026. IndiGo has assured DGCA that corrective actions are underway and that normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026,"" the DGCA said after meeting the airline management.IndiGo assured the regulator that ""normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026."" The DGCA has asked IndiGo to submit a detailed roadmap on pilot hiring, training schedules, roster restructuring and safety assessments. A 15-day progress report is now mandatory.A DGCA inspection at Delhi’s Terminal 1 found passenger-handling manpower ""inadequate,"" and the airline has been told to urgently increase staff across affected terminals.Pilot associations have criticised IndiGo for poor planning. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) alleged that despite getting a two-year preparatory window before the full implementation of new flight duty and rest period norms for cockpit crew, ""inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze"".In a statement on X, IndiGo said, ""The last two days have seen widespread disruption across IndiGo’s network and operations. We extend a heartfelt apology to all our customers and industry stakeholders who have been impacted by these events. IndiGo teams are working diligently and making all efforts with the support of MOCA, DGCA, BCAS, AAI and airport operators to reduce the cascading impact of these delays and restore normalcy. ""The airline urged passengers to check flight status before travelling.IndiGo has informed the regulator that more cancellations are likely in the coming days. Flight operations will be trimmed from December 8 to reduce disruptions.IndiGo operates more than 400 aircraft, runs over 2,300 flights daily, connects 90+ domestic and 45+ international destinations, and flew 118 million passengers in FY25. It was recently named ""Best Airline in India and South Asia"" at the 2025 Skytrax Awards.The government on Friday placed the new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules in abeyance with immediate effect, saying the step was taken “solely in the interest of passengers” without compromising safety.Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said the pause aims to stabilise IndiGo’s operations, which saw over 1000 cancellations today, with airports like Delhi witnessing no IndiGo departures.The ministry has ordered a high-level inquiry to fix accountability and prevent future disruptions.Airlines must now issue automatic refunds, provide hotel stays for stranded passengers, and prioritise seniors and persons with disabilities. Full normalisation is expected by Monday.The government has ordered an independent probe after preliminary findings pointed to gaps in IndiGo’s internal oversight, operational preparedness, and compliance planning.A four-member committee—comprising Joint DG Sanjay K. Bramhane, Deputy DG Amit Gupta, SFOI Capt. Kapil Manglik and FOI Capt. Lokesh Rampal—has been tasked with a comprehensive review of how the crisis escalated.The panel will examine causes of the disruption, manpower and rostering adequacy, compliance with revised FDTL norms, accountability for planning failures, and the airline’s mitigation efforts. It will submit its findings within 15 days for necessary regulatory action.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Friday said the airline expects fewer than 1,000 cancellations on Saturday, adding that operations should stabilise between December 10 and 15.Apologising to passengers, he said earlier corrective steps were insufficient, prompting a full system “reboot” that led to over 1,000 cancellations today, the highest so far.Elbers said DGCA’s relief in the implementation of FDTL norms was “of great help”.IndiGo, which usually operates 2,300 flights daily, has sharply reduced services as planning gaps triggered massive disruption nationwide.The government expects schedules to progressively improve over the weekend.Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu has held IndiGo’s “mismanagement” of crew planning under the new FDTL rules responsible for the massive disruptions.He was quoted by ANI as saying that other airlines had adapted to the revised flying-time norms, but IndiGo failed despite months of engagement by the ministry.The government has granted the airline temporary abeyance from FDTL norms and formed a committee to identify accountability.Naidu said the immediate priority is restoring normalcy, clearing airport backlogs, and ensuring support for affected passengers.He added that congestion should ease from tomorrow, with airports expected to return to regular flow.Indian Railways has stepped in to absorb the massive travel demand created by the IndiGo crisis, deploying 116 extra coaches on 37 trains across 114 augmented trips.These additions can carry up to 4,000 passengers per trip, accommodating 4,89,288 travellers overall. The Railways is also rolling out 30 new special trains with 18 coaches each, capable of transporting 30,780 passengers per trip, covering 21,16,800 passengers across 57 trips.With Northern Railways planning more specials, the overall arrangements are designed to handle 35,000 passengers per day, ensuring connectivity for nearly 26 lakh travellers during this period.IndiGo attributed the disruption to ""unforeseen operational challenges"" including technical issues, weather interruptions and the rollout of revised crew duty rules (FDTL norms).The DGCA, however, said the disruptions stemmed from misjudging manpower needs under the new rules that limit pilot duty hours and night landings. After reviewing data, the regulator said the airline’s crew requirements ""exceeded their anticipation"".IndiGo told the regulator that it currently has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers available for December. But the airline’s crew requirement has sharply risen since the second phase of the FDTL rules kicked in. In November, IndiGo needed 2,422 captains and 2,153 first officers, higher than October’s requirement of 2,186 captains and 1,948 first officers.The data shows a clear crew shortage, which is a major reason behind the ongoing flight disruptions. With the new FDTL norms also limiting the number of night landings per pilot, night operations have been hit the hardest. The airline admitted that crew requirements were higher than expected and shared its updated projections with the regulator.IndiGo underestimated how many crew members it would need after the second phase of FDTL rules kicked in on November 1. Despite this, the airline increased its domestic flights by 6% — from 14,158 in the summer schedule to 15,014 in the winter schedule starting October 26.This mismatch between flights and available pilots and crew has created a major crunch, turning into a double blow for passengers: cancelled flights and skyrocketing fares.""These disruptions have arisen primarily from misjudgement and planning gaps in implementing phase 2 of the flight duty time limitation, with the airline accepting the actual crew requirement for new (rules) exceeded their anticipation,"" the DGCA added.","IndiGo has suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight on Friday. This comes a day after the airline cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights, far exceeding its usual daily disruptions. The worst-hit routes were those connecting Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125780312,imgsize-106896,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The Battle Pakistan Lost To India Days Before 1971 War | I Witness

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war, underscoring how air power proved decisive in shaping the conflict’s outcome and paving the way for India’s victory and the creation of Bangladesh.In a post on X, the IAF recalled its strike on the Sakesar radar station, which crippled Pakistan’s key western air defences for two days.“On the third day of the 1971 war, the IAF was everywhere the enemy looked — and many places where they didn’t expect. Hunters tore through Drigh Road and Karachi, smashing storage hangars. Canberras kept up relentless pressure, delivering 1,44,000 lbs of ordnance across four major airfields,” the post said.The IAF added that 132 missions were flown on the western front, with An-12s and Canberras “raining devastation on enemy concentrations.” On the eastern front, with the Pakistan Air Force effectively grounded, 104 offensive sorties by the IAF cleared the way for the Indian Army’s rapid march into East Pakistan, ultimately leading to the birth of Bangladesh.It also recalled the legendary Battle of Longewala, fought from December 4 to 7, 1971, in Rajasthan’s Longewala sector, where heavily outnumbered Indian troops held their ground against a major Pakistani assault — a defence in which the IAF also played a crucial role.“Four Hunters rewrote history — shattering an enemy armoured thrust and leaving 27 tanks destroyed and 10 more damaged. Jaisalmer stood safe because air power arrived when it mattered,” the post highlighted.The 1971 India–Pakistan war began on December 3 with Pakistan launching pre-emptive strikes on Indian air bases amid the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan. The conflict ended on December 16 with Pakistan’s defeat, the surrender of 93,000 troops — the largest military capitulation since World War II — and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war.

NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise after IndiGo reported widespread operational disruptions and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across its network since late November 2025.Civil Aviation Minister reviewed the situation with senior MoCA officials and IndiGo’s top management, directing the airline and all relevant aviation bodies to take urgent steps to assist passengers and stabilise operations. The Ministry said it is keeping a “close watch” on the situation, according to DGCA's statement cited by ANI.""In addition, the Civil Aviation Minister has also held a meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India and instructed AAI to inform all airport directors that they should constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. He also directed DGCA to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,"" according to the released statement.Apart from the ministry, DGCA, in a detailed review meeting chaired by the Director General (Civil Aviation), flagged concerns over IndiGo cancelling 170–200 flights per day, a level significantly higher than normal for the country’s largest airline.IndiGo attributed the disruptions to transitional challenges from the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) Civil Aviation Requirements, which came into effect in two phases — 01 July 2025 and 01 November 2025 — following court directions.The airline said the new fatigue-management rules, crew-planning issues, and winter operational constraints have sharply impacted scheduling stability.DGCA has directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest and ensure that the current situation does not lead to fare increases.IndiGo has been instructed to submit:As DGCA released its statement assuring firm corrective action and close monitoring, IndiGo, however, informed the regulator that stabilising its network will require a short transition period. The airline told DGCA that additional cancellations will continue over the next two to three days as part of its schedule-reset effort aimed at restoring roster balance and preventing further last-minute disruptions, as reported by PTI.IndiGo has also conveyed that it will proactively scale down flight operations starting December 8 to minimise passenger inconvenience and allow crew-planning teams to rebuild buffers eroded over recent weeks. According to the airline, this controlled reduction in operations is essential to streamline rosters, align crew availability with revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms and ensure that fatigue-management standards are fully complied with.The carrier has assured DGCA that corrective measures are already underway and that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026.

‘Excessive conditions’ in public dealings must be set aside as illegal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/excessive-conditions-in-public-dealings-must-be-set-aside-as-illegal-sc/articleshow/125798396.cms,"Simplicity in transactions good governance, says SC

Insistence on unnecessary documentation and circuitous procedures in govt offices remain a harrowing experience for citizens of the country. But in an important decision to simplify administrative procedures and infuse reform, Supreme Court on Friday ruled that govt’s insistence on unnecessary, excessive requirements in public dealings must be set aside as illegal.Terming simplified processes as a hallmark of good governance, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar said the authorities must resist imposing superfluous and redundant requirements as they make any procedure complicated, causing loss of time and, also, peace of mind.The bench declared a memo issued in 2009 by Jharkhand govt illegal on the basis that it was not needed. The memo mandated an additional recommendation of assistant registrar as a pre-condition for registration of a document under Section 9A of Indian Stamp Act. The court said that when a cooperative society is registered, the certificate of registration signed and sealed by the registrar shall be conclusive evidence.The additional requirement imposed by govt, SC noted, is “disruptive to ease of transaction, without any value addition to the integrity of the transaction”.“Simplicity in public transactions is good governance. Constitutional courts uphold this virtue to strengthen the rule of law and ensure access to justice.In administrative law, simplicity means laws, regulations and procedures should be clear, straightforward and easy to understand, allowing for effortless compliance. Administrative procedures should avoid complexity, redundant requirements and unnecessary burdens, which waste time, expense, and disturb peace of mind,” Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.“While higher courts set aside executive decisions on the grounds of illegality if they are not founded on relevant considerations, or even when the decisions are based on irrelevant considerations, it is important to recognise the principle that executive actions that mandate certain unnecessary, excessive requirements must equally be set aside as illegal,” he said.The court further elaborated that “irrelevant consideration includes insistence or performance of acts or submission of documents, which neither have relevance nor are value additions to the purpose or object of law or policy in place. Instead, they are demonstrably superfluous and unnecessary, consuming limited time and human resources. This also has a direct bearing on efficiency and good governance...”The bench said administrative law has well recognised the principle of an administrative decision becoming unlawful if the decision fails to take into account relevant considerations, or even when it takes into account irrelevant considerations.","Supreme Court rules that govt’s insistence on unnecessary, excessive requirements in public dealings must be set aside as illegal.

was unwell & crying... I’m worried, says her mother

KOLKATA: Birbhum resident Sunali Khatun, nine months and 12 days pregnant, returned to India along with her son, Shabir, 8, on Friday evening, six months after the family’s ordeal began with Delhi Police detaining them as “illegal immigrants”, BSF pushing them into Bangladesh, and authorities there jailing them for illegal entry.Mother and son entered Bengal through the Mahadipur border checkpoint in Malda around 7pm and were received by zilla parishad sabhadhipati Lipika Ghosh and other Trinamool functionaries. Officials took them to Malda Medical College and Hospital, where doctors ran tests to decide when she can travel four-and-a-half hours by road to reach her home in Birbhum.Bangladeshi couple Farooq and Mumtaj Hossain, who hosted Sunali Khatun and her family after they received bail a few days ago, said doctors in Chapai Nawabganj had planned to induce labour. They abandoned the plan when Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) said she needed to be handed over to BSF immediately. Sunali’s husband Danish Sk remains in Bangladesh, awaiting completion of repatriation formalities along with fellow Birbhum resident Sweety Biwi & her two sons.All six were deported on June 26 despite having Aadhaar and other identity documents, their lawyers said. Sunali, Danish and Sweety had been earning a living as ragpickers in Delhi when they were rounded up on June 17 on suspicion of being Bangladeshis living illegally in India.With 26-year-old Sunali’s repatriation getting delayed despite Supreme Court’s Dec 3 directive to govt to ensure her return “during the course of the day”, her counsel had mailed the court’s registry early Friday for an urgent hearing by the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi.Things began to move around 3.30pm after a BGB team and Indian embassy officials reached Chapai Nawabganj to escort Sunali and her child from the house where they were being kept, till the international border. Rampurhat chief medical officer Sovan De said all possible medical arrangements were made for Sunali’s arrival in Birbhum. Social worker Mofijul Sk, who was in Bangladesh to facilitate her return, said an ambulance would take her from Malda to her home once doctors certified her fit to travel.Sunali’s mother Jyotsna and her daughter Anisha returned to their Birbhum home from Delhi on Friday. Both had travelled to the national capital for the SC hearing on Dec 3. “We boarded a train from Delhi as soon as we were told Sunali was coming back. I am worried about her health. She was feeling unwell and crying when I spoke to her at noon,” Jyotsna said. West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board chairperson Samirul Islam, who led the legal battle for Sunali’s repatriation, wrote on X that her return would be remembered as “a historic moment that exposes the torture and atrocities inflicted on poor Bengalis”.(With inputs from Subhro Maitra in Malda and S Boral in Suri)","Sunali Khatun, nine months and 12 days pregnant, returned to India along with her son, Shabir, 8, on Friday evening.

Massive Outrage Over IndiGo Chaos, Over 600 Flights Cancelled In India's Biggest Aviation Crisis

New Delhi: Mass flight cancellations by IndiGo have sent fares on competing airlines soaring as passengers scramble for alternatives on routes dominated by India's largest carrier.One-way economy tickets for Sunday on Delhi-Mumbai sector range from Rs 21,577 to Rs 39,000 across airlines other than IndiGo. Bengaluru-Kolkata tickets cost between Rs 20,000 and Rs 23,000 each while Chennai-Delhi seats are priced around Rs 21,000.IndiGo, which holds 64% of India's domestic market share, has told passengers it expects to resume normal operations between Dec 10 and 15. Seats on available IndiGo flights scheduled for the next several days cost roughly half the price of competitors due to the uncertainty caused by operational disruptions.The remaining airlines - Air India, Air India Express, SpiceJet and Akasa Air - collectively control 36% of domestic capacity. When passengers avoid IndiGo and concentrate demand on this smaller pool of seats, fares invariably increase based on supply constraints. Regional routes show even sharper increases. Udaipur-Delhi one-way economy tickets for Sunday cost between Rs 15,367 and Rs 26,406 on non-IndiGo carriers.Udaipur-Mumbai fares range from Rs 24,000 to Rs 35,000.Mahima Shukla, a Delhi-based CA, flew to Udaipur Friday by Air India Express and was to return Sunday on an IndiGo flight.

Exemptions will put safety at risk, says pilots’ body

NEW DELHI: Govt has put on hold the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms for pilots with “immediate effect for now” and expects normalcy in IndiGo operations to be restored by Dec 15.The aviation ministry’s decision came Friday when over 1,000 IndiGo flights — more than half its schedule — were cancelled, with none operating from Delhi, wreaking havoc on plans of lakhs of fliers. IndiGo is offering full waiver on cancellation /reschedule requests on travel from Dec 5 to 15. On Saturday, less than 1,000 flights are likely to be cancelled. The number will gradually fall.On Thursday — when its on-time performance touched its nadir at 8.5% — IndiGo had sought exemption from certain norms, such as the cap on number of night landings a pilot can make between midnight and 6am, to restore normalcy in Airbus A320 operations by Feb 10, 2026. Since that was a long way off, govt put Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s FDTL orders in abeyance.The week-long flight operation disruptions in IndiGo has wiped out nearly Rs 20,000 crore worth of market value for Interglobe Aviations, the company that runs the airline. In past one week, the stock has fallen nearly 9% to Rs 5,371 on BSE at Friday’s close with the airlines major’s current market cap at nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore now.From its Nov 28 close at Rs 5,904 on BSE, the stock had fallen to an intra-day low of Rs 5,266 during Friday’s session. However, after DGCA allowed the airlines some temporary leeway with crew management rules, the stock recovered some ground to close at Rs 5,371, market players said.While IndiGo’s stock suffered due to the ongoing crisis, the stock price of SpiceJet, one of its smaller competitors, gained. Friday SpiceJet stock price rallied 2.5% on BSE to close at Rs 31.Putting on hold Friday its orders meant to ensure that pilots are not fatigued, thereby boosting flight safety, govt said the move will not compromise on safety of passengers. “This decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs... taken urgent measures to address the ongoing disruption in flight schedules, particularly those of IndiGo,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said.DGCA has constituted a four-member committee headed by a joint DG for a “comprehensive review and assessment of circumstances leading to operational disruption of IndiGo. Committee will identify accountabilities for failure and adequacy of subsequent mitigation measures being taken by IndiGo,” a govt statement said.Aviation authorities say all possible steps are being taken to stabilise IndiGo operations at the earliest. DGCA has offered its Airbus A320-type-rated flight operations inspectors (FOIs) to operate flights for IndiGo in an attempt to help the airline recover from its lowest operational point in over 19 years of existence. “FOIs operate a flight every month (to keep their licences valid). We have made this offer to IndiGo, they did not ask for it, to help it get back on its feet as quickly as possible,” said sources.A significant number of pilots for IndiGo and for some other Indian carriers are upset at losing their hard-earned right to a more humane roster. “Airlines treat us as mere cost-cutting items in their income and expenditure statements during their good days. When it fell on bad days last month, we helped as much as working at 120%. But that could not have gone on indefinitely as we remember how they treat us,” said many senior pilots.Sensing the simmering discontent, Naidu held meetings over video links with some pilot bodies and assured them that the exemption from the new FDTL was temporary. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai issued an appeal to pilots’ associations as the aviation sector is under “significant stress”.“As we now approach fog season, peak holiday period, and marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges. Passenger volumes are expected to rise sharply, and weather-related impacts may further complicate scheduling and flight safety. Given this situation, we earnestly request full cooperation of all pilot bodies, associations, and pilots across India,” Ahmed’s letter says.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers issued a video statement saying normalcy could return between Dec 10 and 15, while admitting the crisis had “shaken customers’ belief in IndiGo’s reliability, built over the last 19 years”.Hours after govt relaxed key provisions of the new duty-and-rest norms to help IndiGo stabilise its pilot roster and flight operations, the Indian pilot community criticised the civil aviation regulator, demanding that the said dispensations be withdrawn immediately.The relaxations now allow IndiGo to roster its pilots for longer duty hours than permitted under Phase II of revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, which came into effect on Nov 1 after a preparatory period of about two years. FDTL norms are mandatory regulatory limits that define the maximum duty hours and minimum rest periods that should be factored in when rostering pilots for duty so as to keep crew fatigue under check and maintain operational safety. Each country formulates its own FDTL based on specific operational realities and scientific studies.In a strongly worded letter to DGCA, Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said selective exemptions compromise safety and undermine the intent of the rules. The union also sought a probe into what it termed an “artificial pilot-shortage narrative” created by IndiGo, punitive action against the airline’s accountable management, and full enforcement of Phase II of the FDTL without exemptions. Airlines in India adopted Phase II of FDTL on Nov 1.The dispensations have destroyed regulatory parity, undermined public trust in DGCA’s neutrality, compromised scientifically established fatigue protections, and placed millions of passengers at heightened risk, said ALPA. Aviation safety expert Capt Amit Singh said the changes bypass the established procedure for exemptions. “These are ad hoc changes. There was no pilot representation before these changes were made,” he said, adding that exemptions must follow safety risk assessments in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation norms.Meanwhile, ALPA’s strongest objection pertained to changes in night operations; relaxation of the definition of night (midnight to 5am was extended in the new FDTL to midnight to 6am) and doubling of permitted landings “encroaching night” — the return to the 5am definition means that a pilot rostered for, say, 5.30am, will not be considered as flying night operations — from two to four, contradicting the revised FDTL and “fundamentally diluting” fatigue protections.DGCA has effectively acknowledged that IndiGo pilots will now fly with reduced rest and increased fatigue, placing passengers at higher risk, it said. It referred to a Nov 24 meeting ALPA had with DGCA in which it was “unequivocally agreed” that no dispensation, exemption or variation, especially for commercial reasons, would be granted to any operator. “FDTL norms exist solely to safeguard human life, and any dilution would expose pilots, passengers, and aircraft to unacceptable risks,” it said.The association questioned why widespread disruptions surfaced 35 days after Phase II came into force: IndiGo had nearly two years to prepare for the Nov 1 implementation of Phase II of revised duty and rest rules for pilot rostering. “These events raise serious concerns that an artificial crisis was engineered to exert pressure on govt for commercial gain under the pretext of public inconvenience.”ALPA warned that if the dispensations are not revoked, DGCA, and not pilots, must bear responsibility for any fatigue-related incident arising from the relaxations.","The week-long flight operation disruptions in IndiGo has wiped out nearly Rs 20,000 crore worth of market value for Interglobe Aviations, the company that runs the airline.

Rajnath Singh Claims Nehru Wanted Babri Built With Public Funds But Sardar Patel Blocked His Plan

KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: Calcutta HC directed the Bengal govt Friday to do whatever it takes to pre-empt communal disturbance in Murshidabad’s Beldanga ahead of suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir ’s planned foundation-laying ceremony for a “Babri Masjid”, coinciding with the Dec 6 anniversary of the Ayodhya structure’s 1992 demolition.“The state must act per its stand... The law-and-order situation in Murshidabad shall be strictly maintained, and the lives and properties of citizens will be protected,” the division bench of acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul and Justice Partha Sarathi Sen said while disposing of a PIL against the scheduled event.Kabir’s mosque plan comes barely eight months after communal violence in Murshidabad, triggered by protests against the Wakf (Amendment) Act, 2025.Advocate-general Kishore Datta told the bench the state had already deployed adequate forces to thwart any plan to disturb peace. Deputy solicitor-general Rajdeep Majumdar said 19 companies of CISF were stationed in the area. A 3,500-strong security contingent, including RAF units, fanned out into Rejinagar and its surrounding areas on the eve of the event. Two BSF companies are on standby to secure NH-12.MLA Kabir, suspended by TMC a day ago, was summoned to Rejinagar police station Friday evening and questioned for several hours, sources said.Earlier in the day, a defiant Kabir supervised arrangements for Saturday’s event and asked his team to arrange 30,000 packets of biryani for his guests. He met splinter groups of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind and All Bengal Imam Muezzin Association.“The main programme will start at noon. The Quran will be read for two hours.

Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

NEW DELHI: Govt does not wish for India to ever face UPA-era shortages of weapons, ammunition and equipment again, and wants a steady flow of revenue to keep its defence capabilities ready to meet the needs of modern warfare, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Friday as Lok Sabha passed a bill to levy a cess on pan masala manufacturing units to augment national security and public health.In her reply to the debate on the ‘Health Security se National Security Cess Bill’, Sitharaman spoke at length on the govt’s defence priorities and touched on Operation Sindoor to emphasise that modern conflicts are becoming capital-intensive due to the domination of precision weapons, autonomous system, space assets and cyber operations, making it imperative to constantly update technology.She said, “We need resources and we need to understand that it does not come cheap. Therefore, more resources towards the specific objective of strengthening defence will have to be made.”Highlighting PM Modi’s Independence Day announcement of Mission Sudarshan Chakra to protect infrastructure and key installations, she said, “Enemy should not be given a chance to penetrate. If an enemy dares, our ‘sudarshan chakra’ will destroy them. That is the capability we want to bring in.” The new cess on pan masala was needed as the effective tax incidence on it will fall from 88% to 40%, the maximum GST slab for demerit goods, once GST compensation cess ends, making it cheaper.It will be detrimental for public health, she told the House.Opposition members offered a variety of criticisms of the bill, including a swipe on whether pan masala consumers are going to finance national defence, and if govt has become so desperate it is raising revenue through such a cess.Addressing the criticism, she said it is her duty as finance minister to raise revenue to meet various demands. No govt, since 1947, has given so much relief in direct and indirect taxation within a year, she said in reference to the big relief in income tax and GST rationalisation that made everyday items cheaper.The purpose of the bill is to create a “dedicated and predictable resource stream” for two domains of national importance — health and national security, she said, terming the pan masala industry as highly evasion prone. Turning to CAG reports and statements of govt functionaries from the UPA era, she said soldiers were left in the Himalayan cold without boots, woollens and, at times, food for want for resources. Artillery guns were not procured for decades after the Bofors episode and a then minister said the country does not have enough money for procurement, she added.As health is a state subject, the govt will be sharing a part of the cess with states, she said. Centre has provided more than what it collected from the cess between 2014-15 to 2025-26.Reeling out data of transfer of funds to states, she said Rs 6.4 lakh crore in cess was transferred, while the govt collected Rs 6 lakh crore from health and education from 2014–15 to 2025–26.",Lok Sabha passes bill to levy a cess on pan masala manufacturing units to augment national security and public health.

NEW DELHI: India remains the centre of malaria transmission in the WHO South-East Asia Region, accounting for 73.3% of all estimated cases and nearly 89% of malaria deaths in 2024, even as the region records one of the world’s steepest declines in malaria, World Malaria Report 2025 showed.The region logged 4.79 lakh cases in 2024 — a 65.7% fall since 2015 — and just 99 reported deaths, but WHO estimates indicated a far larger burden of 2.7 million cases and 3,900 deaths, with India driving most infections and fatalities.Despite this dominance, India remains on track to meet the 2025 Global Technical Strategy goal of a 75% drop in incidence, having crossed a 70% reduction by 2024. Most districts continue to report sustained declines, tho-ugh localised outbreaks in forest belts and cross-border spillover from Nepal persist as major challenges.Children under 5 accounted for 8.7% of cases and 18% of deaths, while P.vivax, notoriously difficult to eliminate, caused nearly two-thirds of infections. The report credits the gains to aggressive interventions — large insecticide-treated net drives in India, Myanmar and Nepal; 143% growth in rapid testing since 2015; and 100% treatment coverage. Low-level pfhrp2/3 gene deletions were detected in India, but treatment failure for key ACTs remained below 5%, indicating continued drug efficacy.A key milestone highlighted was India’s exit from High Burden to High Impact group in 2024, marking its shift from a global high-burden nation to one nearing elimination in several states — a transformation few countries have achieved at this scale. Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste are malaria-free. WHO warns drug resistance, climate-related outbreaks and declining international funding threaten global progress.Dr Sunil Rana of Asian Hospital said malaria persists in India because timely healthcare fails to reach tribal and forest communities. “Longer mosquito-breeding seasons, delayed care-seeking, weak surveillance and unchecked migration through border zones keep outbreaks alive,” he said.","India accounts for 73.3% of all estimated cases and nearly 89% of malaria deaths in 2024.

BHUBANESWAR: Central Bureau Of Investigation Friday arrested Biranchi Kumar Nayak (43), the alleged key middleman in the Odisha sub-inspector recruitment scam.

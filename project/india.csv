"Pilot study finds over half of truck drivers surveyed have poor vision, 57% elevated BP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pilot-study-finds-over-half-of-truck-drivers-surveyed-have-poor-vision-57-elevated-bp/articleshow/117666375.cms,"NEW DELHI: A pilot project to identify the problems faced by truck drivers and to take corrective steps across six states — Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu — found that over half of them suffered from compromised vision; over 44% had borderline or above Body Mass Index (BMI) and around 57% had elevated blood pressure levels.A total of 50,713 truck drivers were screened under “Project Abhay” in the past one year, which was designed and developed by Centre for Rural Development & Technology (CRDT) of IIT-Delhi in collaboration with Foresight Foundation and was supported by the road transport ministry. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari released the report on the findings and steps taken to address the issue faced by drivers on Tuesday.As per the report, during screening, about 55.1% of truck drivers were found to have compromised vision, with 53.3% requiring distance vision correction and 46.7% needing near-vision correction. Under the project, drivers were given the spectacles at the site, which ensured 93.7% of them with refractive errors received immediate corrections. “Improved vision among drivers directly reduced the likelihood of road accidents, contributing to safer highways and more efficient logistics operations,” it said.During health screening, it was found that 44.3% of drivers had borderline or above BMI, 57.4% had elevated blood pressure levels, and 18.4% showed borderline or high blood sugar levels. “Drivers were provided with counseling on lifestyle changes, including dietary changes and stress management, with urgent cases referred to for further medical investigation,” the report mentioned.About 33.9% of drivers reported moderate stress, while 2.9% were found to have high stress levels. Under the project, dedicated mental health counseling desks provided guidance and introduced drivers to resources like Tele-MANAS, which provides access to mental health care through a 24x7 tele-mental health service.Speaking at the release of the report, Gadkari said the govt is committed to transforming India’s logistics sector, by enhancing truck drivers’ welfare, promoting sustainable fuels, and integrating advanced safety technologies. He said that govt plans to shift 80% of India’s truck fleet to CNG or LNG to cut logistics costs and reduce environmental impact as well. The minister also said India has only 75 drivers for every 100 trucks, leading to a shortage of 22 lakh drivers. “This lack of manpower contributes to accidents, as India does not have driver shifts like Europe.” He said, around 10,000 deaths are caused by trucks, he said.","A total of 50,713 truck drivers were screened under ‘Project Abhay’ in the past one year.

He fell down..,"" she told IANS.One eyewitness recounted how the emergence response at the world's largest religious gathering in Prayagraj was delayed despite multiple calls for help.

'Gaping holes': SC frees death row convict in Mumbai rape-murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gaping-holes-sc-frees-death-row-convict-in-mumbai-rape-murder/articleshow/117664389.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the Jan 2014 Mumbai rape-murder of an IT professional that created as much sensation as the 2012 Nirbhaya case , Supreme Court Tuesday acquitted Chandrabhan Sudam Sanap by setting aside concurrent decisions of a trial court and Bombay HC that had convicted him and awarded death penalty. ""He shall be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case,"" SC said.Authoring the 113-page judgment that results in a heinous crime going unpunished, Justice KV Viswanathan, part of a bench comprising Justices B R Gavai and Prashant K Mishra, said, ""Prosecution has not established its case beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, we are constrained to come to the sole irresistible conclusion that the appellant is not guilty of the offences for which he has been charged.""The 23-year-old woman, referred to as 'EA' in the SC judgment, was working in Mumbai and staying at the YWCA Hostel for women in Andheri. She had visited her parents in Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh in Dec and was seen off at the Vijayawada railway station by her father on Jan 4, 2014.As she could not be contacted over phone subsequently, the father lodged a missing person complaint and went to Mumbai in search of his daughter. EA's body, half-burnt and decomposed, was discovered on Jan 16, 2014, in some bushes near the Eastern Express Highway.SC analysed and re-appreciated the entire evidence produced by police before the trial court and said, ""We allow the appeal (of Sanap) and set aside the judgment of the HC and acquit the appellant with regard to the offences for which he was charged in this case.""Doubting the veracity of Sanap's purported extra-judicial confession about committing the crime after picking the woman from the railway station in Mumbai on the promise to drop her to Andheri, the apex court bench said, ""There is no corroboration in material particulars and hence we are inclined to reject the extra-judicial confession.""The SC discarded the evidence linking the bike allegedly used in the commission of the crime to the accused. The court also discarded the evidence emerging from the test identification parade during which the accused was identified by witnesses on the ground that the photo of the accused was splashed all over the media by the time the TIP took place.The court also discarded the alleged recovery of the deceased woman's suitcase from the accused's sister and said, ""Merely based on the recovery, no conviction for the offence charged could be sustained against the appellant in this case. As to why the college identity card of the deceased EA would be preserved by the accused and kept in custody of the sister nearly two months after the incident is something we find very intriguing.""The SC added, ""All these facts cumulatively constrain us to conclude that there are gaping holes in the prosecution story leading to the irresistible conclusion that there is something more than what meets the eye in this case. While the adage - witness may lie but not the circumstances - may be correct, however, the circumstances adduced, as held by this court, should be fully established. ""There is a legal distinction between 'may be proved' and 'must be or should be proved' as held by this court. The circumstances relied upon when stitched together do not lead to the sole hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and we do not find that the chain is so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused.""","The 23-year-old woman, referred to as 'EA' in the SC judgment, was working in Mumbai and staying at the YWCA Hostel for women in Andheri.

The decision is seen as a landmark judgment, setting a precedent for protecting home-buyers' interests against banking institutions' recovery proceedings in real estate projects, reports Subhro Niyogi.The apartments are in a New Alipore project, with each worth Rs 1.95 crore to Rs 3.14 crore. They were already in the buyers' possession when the bank threatened to take possession.The tribunal upheld a ruling by West Bengal Real Estate Regulatory Authority (WBRERA), which had ruled in favour of home-buyers. This ruling was challenged by Yes Bank. The tribunal's decision prevents the bank from taking possession of or auctioning the flats to recover loans.The case involved nine complainants, who purchased flats in Ideal Exotica project in New Alipore from Ideal Real Estates between 2021 and 2023. The controversy arose when Yes Bank, which had extended a loan of Rs 320 crore to the developer, tried to take possession of these flats through Debts Recovery Tribunal under SARFAESI Act, which allows banks and financial institutions to recover loans by auctioning borrowers' assets. The flat owners, who had already completed mutations under Kolkata MC norms, had approached WBRERA seeking protection of their rights when Yes Bank obtained an order from Debts Recovery Tribunal, Kolkata. The bank published a notice of taking possession of the nine flats by appointing a receiver so that it could sell them by auction to recover the loan advanced to the promoter.The tribunal cited provisions of RERA, Transfer of Property Act, and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, to rule that RERA provisions override SARFAESI Act.","West Bengal Real Estate Appellate Tribunal has stopped a bank from taking over apartments from nine customers over a loan default by the developer.

Poll Should the Uniform Civil Code Be Implemented All Over India? No, It Overlooks Cultural and Religious Diversity Yes, It Promotes Equality for All

What is UCC and what is its significance??

UCC criticism

What is the implementation process?

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand is set to make history on Monday by becoming the first state in post-independence India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami will officially launch the UCC portal and issue a notification marking the adoption of the civil code, following the completion of government employee training, mock drills, and dry-run sessions.""The UCC's implementation represents a significant milestone, making the Himalayan state the first in the country to adopt this progressive legislation since independence,"" Dhami said.CM Dhami said that the UCC was drafted after extensive consultations with experts, locals, and representatives from various communities, with the goal of bringing uniformity in society and empowering women.The UCC addresses various societal issues, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. Key aspects of the law include the registration of marriages, divorces, and live-in relationships to ensure equal property rights and protect children's rights, with penalties for non-compliance.UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions. The move has sparked both support and criticism, with proponents arguing for equality and opponents warning of potential societal divisions.The UCC clarifies legal requirements for marriage, stating that only mentally capable individuals aged 21 (for men) or 18 (for women) who are not already married may enter into a union. Marriages can be performed according to religious customs, but registration will be mandatory to ensure legal recognition.The law also addresses issues related to the creation and cancellation of wills and codicils under testamentary succession. Marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or those outside the state will be eligible for registration if legal requirements are met.Opposition leaders have criticized the UCC, arguing that it may lead to societal division along religious lines and might be impractical and overly ambitious.The debate surrounding the UCC extends beyond Uttarakhand, as Article 44 of the Indian Constitution advocates for a uniform civil code across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referenced the Supreme Court's direction on the need for a common code, stressing that fulfilling the vision of the Constitution's framers remains a national goal.Uttarakhand's implementation of the UCC is likely to set a precedent, with other states potentially following suit. The success of the law's implementation will depend on its ability to balance individual rights and social harmony.As Uttarakhand stands at the forefront of this legal revolution, the coming weeks will offer a clearer picture of how the UCC will be received, both in the state and across India. The state's experience with the UCC will undoubtedly shape the future of personal law reform in the country.Shailesh Bagauli, secretary (home), stated that the government will issue two notifications: one for the implementation of the UCC and another for the rules and regulations, officially launching the UCC in the state.Dhami had promised to implement the UCC if re-elected during the 2022 state polls. After becoming CM, he appointed a five-member committee led by Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai to draft the code, which received feedback from over 2.3 lakh people, representing nearly 10% of Uttarakhand's families.The 740-page draft was presented to the chief minister on February 2, 2024, approved by the cabinet on February 4, tabled in the assembly on February 6, and passed the following day. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) approved the bill on February 28 and President Droupadi Murmu subsequently signed it on March 11.","UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions.

"China still boosting infrastructure, defence positions along LAC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-still-boosting-infrastructure-defence-positions-along-lac/articleshow/117656092.cms,"'Any Chinese deviations being raised at appropriate levels'



NEW DELHI: Despite troop disengagement in Depsang and Demchok last Oct and a flurry of top-level diplomatic meetings, there has been no let-up in China’s strengthening of its military positions and infrastructure all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.“The infrastructure development activities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are continuing at multiple locations along the LAC. In the east, for instance, it is happening in Rongto Chu and other valleys,” a defence source told TOI.The strategically-located Yangtse in the crucial Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh is also witnessing China work assiduously to offset the tactical advantage India has in the area by controlling the high ground or ridgeline in the plateau for where it can see PLA positions.Apart from new military camps and the concrete road constructed from its Tangwu dual-use Xiaokang border village towards the LAC in the area, the PLA has also upgraded a couple of dirt tracks there to ensure it can “surge” troops in larger numbers if required, the source said.Asked specifically by TOI about China’s continuing infrastructure build-up across Yangtse, an official Army source on Tuesday said both China and India are undertaking infrastructure development “all along the northern borders as per the guidelines enunciated in various agreements and protocols between the two countries”.“Any deviation from the agreements and protocols by the Chinese side, once observed, are being raised at appropriate levels during engagements through various existing mechanisms,” he added.As per satellite imagery analyst @NatureDesai on X, China has been constructing two new roads, including one from Lampug towards Tangwu, during the ongoing winter months across Yangtse to provide alternate connectivity and higher ground to its troops. It will provide the PLA an “unobstructed view of Indian ground lines of communication” in the area, he said.Defence sources, in turn, said the PLA has been focusing on establishing last-mile connectivity across Tawang, Naku La in north Sikkim and a few other areas in the eastern sector.Areas like Yangtse, where the rival troops had clashed in Dec 2022, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh, which have been under Indian control for decades, remain major flashpoints between the rival armies.The story of new Chinese roads, bridges, helipads, gun positions and the like coming up is similar in all the three sectors of the 3,488-km LAC, western (Ladakh), central (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal), with PLA troops continuing to be forward deployed with heavy weapon systems in large numbers.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, asked earlier this month whether India had agreed to give patrolling rights to the PLA in sensitive areas like Yangtse, had said that all corps commanders have been delegated powers to resolve “minor frictions” related to patrolling and grazing issues so that they do not become “big issues” later, as was then reported by TOI.China is yet to agree to de-escalation and then de-induction of its troops along the LAC after last Oct’s disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh, which has led to restoration of patrolling by the rival soldiers and grazing by herders as well as reduced the risk of any inadvertent escalation.","Despite troop disengagement in Depsang and Demchok last Oct, there has been no let-up in China’s strengthening of its military positions and infrastructure. The strategically-located Yangtse in the crucial Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh is also witnessing China work assiduously.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117656171,imgsize-42418,width-400,resizemode-4/117656171.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry is considering to bring a new rule to make it mandatory for vehicle owners and driving licence (DL) holders to update their address (Aadhaar), mobile phone number and other details, a move aimed at reining in violators going scot-free and evading penalty.Sources said the ministry is considering making it a part of the proposed amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act. “There is a need to have some mechanism to track people who are violating rules, particularly frequent offenders, posing risk to other road users. Changing mobile number and applying for a new DL is the easiest way to evade paying penalty and face action,” an official said.Recently, union road transport secretary V Umashankar gave a hint of the proposed move while speaking at a conference on road safety. He said, “More than Rs 12,000 crore worth of e-challans issued remain unpaid, essentially because the database through which we are enforcing the e-challan system is not good. So, we need to clean up the database and make it more perfect.”Citing that some DLs and vehicle registration certificates (RCs) on Sarathi and Vahan databases may date back to the 1960s and 70s, and the 1980s and 90s respectively. The old databases has no mobile and Aadhaar numbers. “May be the address is not the same, which means we need to think of certain touch points at which it becomes mandatory for vehicle owners or licence holders to update their details,” Umashanakar said.He said this will help agencies to know whom to reach and where to reach, and if an e-challan penalty remains unpaid after a certain time, then RC or DL holder becomes cut off from other service requirements. “May be his insurance goes up, registration gets invalidated, cancelled or suspended,” the secretary said.","The road transport ministry is considering to bring a new rule to make it mandatory for vehicle owners and driving licence (DL) holders to update their details.

Poll Is Rahul Gandhi's Comment on Kejriwal's Wealth Justified? No, It's Unnecessary Personal Attack Yes, It's a Valid Critique

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Raul Gandhi held a rally in Delhi on Tuesday, where he took multiple jabs at AAP Supremo Arvind Kejriwal , ahead of the Delhi elections to be held on February 5.Addressing the gathering at Patparganj, Rahul accused Kejriwal of not helping the poor and vanishing in times of need of the people. ""Kejriwal says anything that comes to his mind, when he came, he had a small car and had said that he will do a new kind of politics. He had said he will change Delhi but when poor people were in need, he wasn't there, when riots happened he wasn't there,"" said the Congress leader. In a further attack on the ex-Delhi CM, Rahul added, ""He said he will do clean politics, but in Delhi, the biggest scam of liquor happened and you must have seen the photo of his house...Kejriwal stays in a palace, 'Sheesh Mahal'. So this is the truth.""Then, calling for support to Congress' Patparganj candidate and calling out Manish Sisodia for his ""involvement"" in the liquor scam, Rahul said, ""Before, Manish Sisodia ji was the candidate here, who was the architect of the liquor scam. He ran away from Patparganj in fear, it is a good thing.

We don't want an India of hatred, fear and violence. We want a shop of love,"" he said.He also addressed the Constitution and BR Ambedkar row in his speech attacking the BJP. Today the fight is to protect Baba Saheb Ambedkar's Constitution, because BJP had said that if the number crosses 400 then they will change the Constitution. Then Mohan Bhagwat said that we did not get independence on 15 August 1947. His statement is an insult to our Constitution,"" he said. ""The country's billionaires like Ambani and Adani were seen at the Ram Mandir ceremony, but our tribal President was not allowed to attend the Ram Mandir ceremony. The President was also not allowed to attend the inauguration of the new Parliament. Narendra Modi wants a India of billionaires, while the Constitution says that every citizen is equal. It is nowhere written in the Constitution that a single billionaire should have all the wealth of the country. Their aim is only to spread fear,"" he further said. Rahul Gandhi also emphasised the minimal involvement of Dalits, backward communities and tribal groups in budget fund allocation decisions, attributing this to their limited representation in crucial sectors.Gandhi called attention to PM Modi's non-response regarding the Congress' caste census demand and affirmed that wherever Congress forms the government, they would implement a nationwide caste census. Gandhi reaffirmed that the Congress would eliminate the 50 per cent ceiling on reservation.","Congress MP Raul Gandhi held a rally in Delhi on Tuesday, where he took multiple jabs at AAP Supremo Arvind Kejriwal.

WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has said that PM Narendra Modi will do ""what is right"" on illegal immigrants, underlining that discussions are going on with India.Making these remarks on Monday while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way back to Joint Base Andrews from Florida, Trump also mentioned that Modi is likely to visit the White House in Feb. Trump told House Republicans at a Florida retreat on Monday that the US would impose tariffs on countries that ""harm"" America, naming China, India and Brazil as high-tariff countries. ""We are going to put tariffs on outside countries and outside people that really mean harm to us. Look at what others do.

So, we're not going to let that happen any longer because we're going to put America first,"" he said.The remarks followed his phone conversation with Modi in which, as the White House said in a statement, Trump called upon India to increase its procurement of American-made security equipment and move towards a ""fair bilateral trading relationship"". The leaders discussed plans for PM Modi to visit the White House, underscoring the strength of friendship & strategic ties between our nations, said the White House.While talking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked if Modi has agreed to take illegal immigrants.

This geological churning is happening beneath California's Sierra Nevada mountains . The phenomenon has been happening for millions of years and could shed a new light on how the continents are formed.Geologists used nearly four decades of seismic data from stations encompassing the northern, central and southern Sierra Nevada along California's eastern border to uncover signs of a critical separation between the cool continental crust and mantle below.The findings – made by researchers Vera Schulte-Pelkum from the University of Colorado Boulder and Deborah Kilb from the University of California San Diego – help resolve a mystery on how our planet generates lighter portions of its crust from the dense mix of minerals churning beneath.In a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers stated that this process, called differentiation, happens when the dense layers of the Earth’s crust sink and get absorbed into the mantle, leaving the lighter layers behind.“Our observations provide progressive snapshots of a lithospheric foundering process spanning several million years and hundreds of kilometres, illuminating a fundamental differentiation process by which continents are built,"" the researchers noted in the paper.Scientists have traced this peeling process beneath the Sierra Nevada using advanced imaging techniques. The southern section of the mountain range shows evidence of dense material that sank into the mantle millions of years ago. In the central region, the process is still ongoing, as indicated by small, deep earthquakes occurring beneath the surface.The northern part of Sierra Nevada still retains its dense layer, making it a snapshot of an earlier stage in this geological cycle. This discovery provides a rare glimpse into the mechanisms behind continental evolution.","Scientists have traced this peeling process beneath the Sierra Nevada using advanced imaging techniques.

What is an Atomic Clock?

What are the benefits of the project?

How will the transition happen?

NEW DELHI: The country may be on Indian Standard Time (IST), but the exact time is determined by GPS satellites , down to the millisecond, and is linked to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).In the next few months this is set to change with Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) being the link to National Physical Laboratory to provide the reference time. A lab in Faridabad will receive the time from NavIC which will be shared through an optic fibre link with four other centres - Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati - with each having an atomic clock .The deployment of atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks instead of service providers accessing data from multiple sources linked to GPS. Soon, the regional centres will disseminate the time to all end users - resulting in ""one nation, one time"".The satellite system was conceived soon after the Kargil war, when India could not get the exact location of targets from foreign satellites. Govt realised that strategic importance and finally got moving on the project around seven years ago.Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said most of the work for the Times Dissemination Project has been completed with atomic clocks installed in Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Bhubaneswar. A few months ago, the NavIC link with NPL Faridabad was tested. The department, which is working with NPL and Isro to disseminate IST with millisecond to microsecond accuracy, will have to align the clocks in four centres with Faridabad to adjust for the time taken for sharing the data through the optic fibre cable.An atomic clock is a clock known for its exceptional accuracy, and functions by utilising specific resonance frequencies of atoms. The extreme precision levels of the atomic clocks can be interpreted by the fact that they will lose one second every 100 million years or so.Former consumer affairs secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said it will establish India's own precise and reliable time distribution network, reducing dependence on foreign systems and enhancing national security. ""It will benefit critical sectors like power grids, telecommunications, banking, defence, and transportation by ensuring synchronised operations, efficiency, and resilience against cyber threats,"" he said.While technical work is underway, the consumer affairs department has notified the draft rules, mandating the use of IST as the sole time reference for legal, administrative, commercial, and official documents across the country.Exceptions will be allowed for specialised fields such as astronomy, navigation, and scientific research, subject to prior govt approval with violations attracting penalty.","Atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday issued a notice to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking facts and evidence to substantiate his allegation that Haryana had poisoned Yamuna waters released to Delhi, which he claimed could have caused “genocide” had the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) engineers not stopped the waters at Delhi border.Importantly, the poll panel reminded him of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) provisions against statements that cause enmity between groups, are prejudicial to national integration and create public mischief, all of which attract a maximum jail term of three years.This could mean that EC, in the event of lack of sufficient evidence backing Kejriwal’s allegations, may consider ordering a criminal case/FIR to be registered against him, invoking the aforesaid provisions of BNS as well as Section 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act (false statement being a corrupt practice). This would be in addition to likely action for violation of the model code of conduct.Stating that the allegations of an elected govt poisoning the Yamuna waters with an intention to kill the residents of Delhi and equating this with nuclear or biological war, coming from a leader of Kejriwal’s stature, are “extremely serious in nature and unprecedented”, the Election Commission asked the AAP national convener to reply to its notice by 8 pm on Wednesday, citing the “factual foundation” of his allegations, “especially when the veracity...is contested”. The notice cites the clarification of Delhi Jal Board, posted on X on Monday, denying Kejriwal’s poisoning claims as “false, misleading and factually incorrect”.“Being a very senior leader with vast administrative experience, you must definite have the evidence to substantiate such serious allegations....It is presumed that the Govt of NCT of Delhi must have officially taken up such a serious and grave issue of public health with the state govt of Haryana,” EC stated in its notice that followed separate complaints by the BJP and Congress.Stating that Kerjiwal’s allegations, if true, run the risk of “creating enmity between the regional groups, residents of neighbouring states, and threat of law and order situation due to actual or perceived shortage of non-availability of water during this time of the year”, EC drew his attention to BNS provisions including Section 196 (statements that promote enmity between groups), Section 197 (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and Section 353 (public mischief), all of which carry a maximum three-year jail term, fine or both.The EC also cited Section 123 (4) of the R P Act as well as model code provisions that restrain candidates and parties from activities that create hatred and tension between groups, as also from criticism of other parties based on unverified allegations or distortion.As regards the other complaint received from chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab about sharp increase in ammonia levels in Yamuna waters released by Haryana, which the former claimed had made it untreatable, leading to a water shortage and public health crisis, EC said it had already called for a report from Haryana govt and was dealing with the complaint separately after considering the inputs from Haryana govt.","The Election Commission has issued a notice to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

In 1973, an SC bench in Kesavananda Bharti judgment had by a narrow margin devised the 'basic structure theory' to demarcate the unamendable part of the Constitution, a ruling that went against the intents of Indira Gandhi and in which Justice H R Khanna had tilted the balance for the majority view.It was followed by the ADM Jabalpur case ruling, in which Justice Khanna Sr had penned the lone dissent to rule Emergency powers could not extinguish the right to life, which he said was inherent to a nation's existence. The CJI said, ""In the initial years, SC had interpreted all fundamental rights as rights working in exclusive silos. This judicial attitude, however, underwent a significant change after the Emergency was imposed in 1975."" He said the court in 1978 in the Maneka Gandhi case had ruled Articles 14, 19 and 21 were not mutually exclusive and had to be read together.He said Constitution created a strong centre but advocated a balanced federal structure, a characteristic of governance which a nine-judge bench in S R Bommai case had termed as a basic feature of the Constitution. ""Bommai (judgment) also has implications for the secular fabric of India. SC had also ruled that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution.""Supreme Court Bar Association president Kapil Sibal said SC must champion the Constitution, especially when confronted with challenges to constitutional values that are creating serious problems. The CJI said the 1990s in the SC marked an era of consolidation and expansion of fundamental rights. ""The last two decades of the 21st century stand as a testament to the SC's evolving role in our constitutional framework."" On the challenges ahead, the CJI said, "" First, the weight of arrears which continues to delay justice. Second, mounting costs of litigation threatens true accessibility.

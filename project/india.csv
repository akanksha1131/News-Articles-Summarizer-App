SC reserves order on Saranda Sanctuary area; Jharkhand for non-inclusion of tribal habitation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reserves-order-on-saranda-sanctuary-area-jharkhand-for-non-inclusion-of-tribal-habitation/articleshow/124863046.cms,"SC reserves it order (agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its verdict on the Jharkhand government’s plea to reduce the expanse of to be notified Saranda sanctuary from its earlier 310 sq km to 250 sq km to exclude 60 sq km of forest inhabited by tribals to protect their forest rights as well as schools and educational institutions there.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran that the tribal rights are always protected in a sanctuary and the real reason for Jharkhand govt in seeking exclusion of 60 sq km was to cater to lobbies interested in mining in the area. He said that the mines already in operation by steel authority of India (SAIL) are already exempt by the SC.Parameshwar said that the earlier affidavit of the state placed an unequivocal stand that all the 126 blocks of Saranda forest, earlier a game reserve comprising pristine Sal tree forest with wildlife, was free from tribal habitation. Notifying a forest as sanctuary does not erase the forest rights of tribals, he said citing the statutes.Appearing for Jharkhand, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said that the state has to handle a restive situation arising from its proposal to notify Saranda forest as a sanctuary, which contrary to amicus curiae’s claim has no wildlife. The forest rights of the tribals require protection as much as the schools where the tribal children study, he said.The bench said the state had been taking contradictory stand before the court on the expanse of the Saranda Sanctuary but clarified that it would protect the forest rights of the tribals. Appearing for tribal population, senior advocate Gaurav Sharma told the court that the forest dwellers want to harvest seasonal produce like resins, mahua flowers and other forest products to sustain themselves.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for SAIL, said the court would also protect the mining interests of the public sector company and allow ancillary activities linked to mining. The bench reserved verdict and asked the parties to submit written notes by Friday.",The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its verdict on the Jharkhand government’s plea to reduce the expanse of to be notified Saranda sanctuary from its earlier 310 sq km to 250 sq km.

Evidence against man, who spent 12 yrs in jail, fabricated by police: SC

NEW DELHI: Time and again cases surface where the accused are made ""scapegoats"" by the system and false evidence planted against them. These victims end up rotting in jail for years even if they eventually get acquitted. Now, Supreme Court has decided to examine the complex matter of compensating a person for wrongful arrest, prosecution and conviction.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta Monday sought assistance from the attorney general and solicitor general to adjudicate the issue which will have major implications, given that conviction rate in the country is just around 54%.Appearing for one such accused, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium said people who have to spend years in jail over false charges must be compensated after being acquitted, as the incarceration amounts to violation of fundamental rights. He pleaded with the court to frame guidelines on the issue. Law Commission too had recommended a statutory framework for the purpose, he said.The court was hearing the plea of a poor person who had to spend 12 years in jail, out of which six were under the shadow of death after he was awarded capital punishment for the rape and murder of a minor. The man was acquitted by SC, which held that the evidence against him was fabricated by police.Assisted by Square Circle Clinic of NALSAR, Hyderabad, he moved SC through advocates Mihir Samson and Yash S Vijay for compensation in lieu of what he had endured. He was arrested in 2013 and sentenced to death in 2019 by a trial court in Thane. His acquittal by SC came in 2025.""The petitioner has suffered a grave and severe violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, on account of being falsely accused of heinous offences, illegally arrested, being made the subject of an illegal and tainted investigation, unfair prosecution, and suffering 12 years of wrongful incarceration, for which he ought to be appropriately compensated by the state as it has completely destroyed his life, his reputation and his family, with the latter reduced to abject penury. ..,"" the petition said.Functionaries of the state were responsible for his arrest, prosecution and conviction. It is well settled that the state must be responsible for the wrongdoing of its servants in the harm caused to the fundamental rights of citizens, by way of appropriate compensation. This responsibility is on the basis of strict liability. The mere release of the individual from incarceration is not sufficient to correct the wrongs faced by him, and the state ought to be directed to pay appropriate compensation to him for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage he suffered for 12 years and continues to suffer,"" the petition stated. As two other petitions have also been filed by aggrieved persons, the court clubbed all three cases together. In 2018, the Law Commission had recommended enacting a specific legal provision for redress in cases of miscarriage of justice.","Supreme Court to examine the complex matter of compensating a person for wrongful arrest, prosecution and conviction.

MP BJP expels functionary after farmer's murder in Guna

BHOPAL: A land dispute turned murderous in a village in MP's Guna district Sunday when a BJP functionary allegedly led a mob that bludgeoned a 50-year-old with iron rods, broke his limbs, crushed him under an MUV, and molested his daughter who tried to shield him from the attackers.Police said around 15 armed men attacked the farmer and his wife while they were on their way to their field in Ganeshpura village. When his two daughters rushed to help, the accused, identified as BJP's local booth committee chief Mahendra Nagar, allegedly pinned one of them to the ground, sat on her chest, and tore her clothes.The mob allegedly fired guns and threatened villagers to prevent anyone from taking the victim to the hospital.Within an hour, the wounded farmer died.""There were multiple fractures on the farmer's body. His daughters were also attacked,"" SDOP Bamori Vivek Asthana said Monday. ""An FIR has been registered against 14 people.""Those named include BJP's local booth committee chief Mahendra Nagar, his brother Hukum Singh Nagar, wife Kamlesh Bai, and sons Nitesh and Devendra Nagar. Hukum Singh has been arrested. Others are on the run.Police said the assault stemmed from a long-standing land dispute between the farmer and Nagar's relative Kanhaiya Nagar over a plot in Rajasthan's Baran district.One of the victim's daughters said: ""I tried to save my father. But they pushed me to the ground. Mahendra Nagar sat on me and tore my clothes. They fired their guns and pulled me by the hair. My father was going to the field when all these people - Mahendra, Naveen, Harish, Gautam, Devendra - came out and attacked him.""The killing ignited political outrage and calls for the expulsion of Nagar - a former Congress worker who joined BJP in 2020 after Jyotiraditya Scindia's defection. He has been charged with murder, molestation, and criminal conspiracy under BNS. State BJP president Hemant Khandelwal expelled Nagar from the party Monday evening. Guna BJP president Dharmendra Sikarwar said earlier in the day that a letter has been sent to party seniors seeking his immediate removal. ""We have asked for his expulsion from the post and from primary membership,"" he said.","MP BJP expels functionary after farmer's murder in Guna district. 15 armed men attacked the farmer and his wife while they were on their way to their field.

Second meeting between EAM, Rubio in 2 months

NEW DELHI: EAM S Jaishankar met his US counterpart Marco Rubio in Malaysia amid efforts to repair the India-US relationship, keeping high-level engagement between the two countries going despite differences over bilateral matters and geopolitical issues that have bogged down ties.There was no readout by either side of the meeting till late in the evening and Jaishankar only said in a post on X that he appreciated the discussion on bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues. Later, while delivering India's national statement at the East Asia summit, Jaishankar took a dig at the US and European countries as he said principles of energy trade were being applied selectively.It is understood that Jaishankar and Rubio touched upon ongoing efforts to finalise a bilateral trade agreement and also the issue of energy trade. The Donald Trump administration has slapped India with an additional 25% tariff for its oil procurement from Russia, accusing India of bankrolling Russia's war on Ukraine.This was the second meeting between Jaishankar and Rubio in the past two months. They had also met on the margins of the UNGA last month where they discussed cooperation in a number of areas. They had also agreed to continue working together to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region, including through Quad.There was no confirmation about whether there was any discussion in the meeting on Monday on the Quad summit that India has to host in the near future.Later in the day, Jaishankar also met his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi and discussed cooperation among Quad countries. According to a Japanese readout, Motegi emphasised that Japan and India play a significant role in realising peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and expressed his desire to fulfill this role together with other Quad States. ""Agreed to work closely to implement the joint vision for the next decade of our cooperation. Also exchanged perspectives on the global situation and our Indo Pacific cooperation.

'What Is Preached Not Necessarily Practiced’: Jaishankar Takes Veiled Swipe At West Over Trade

Jaishankar welcomes Gaza peace plan, seeks early end to Ukraine-Russia conflict

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar flagged what the Indian govt sees as US and Europe's double standards in pressuring India to stop buying Russian oil, as he addressed the East Asia Summit in Malaysia, filling in for PM Modi. He said energy trade is increasingly constricted, with resulting market distortions, and ""principles are applied selectively and what is preached is not necessarily practised"".Jaishankar, who delivered India's statement at the summit after meeting his US counterpart Marco Rubio, sought an early end to conflicts as he stressed how in current circumstances energy flows and food security were being undermined.

There is no room for ambivalence, he said.The minister made the point about energy trade while talking about growing concerns over reliability of supply chains and access to markets in complicated times. Jaishankar said technology advancement had become very competitive and the quest for natural resources even more so.Jaishankar emphasised that change has a life of its own and the world will inevitably respond to new circumstances. ""Adjustments will be made, calculations will come into play, fresh understandings will be forged, new opportunities will emerge and resilient solutions will be devised.

He called for serious global conversations to address these issues.EAS is an annual Asean-led forum that includes the bloc's dialogue partners like India, China and the US.The minister also said both sides shared concerns about cyber scam centres in the region, which has also entrapped Indian nationals.Jaishankar welcomed the Gaza peace plan and sought an early end to the conflict in Ukraine.""We are also witnessing conflicts that have significant repercussions, near and far. Deep human suffering apart, they undermine food security, they threaten energy flows and they disrupt trade,"" said the minister.Jaishankar underscored India's commitment to furthering maritime cooperation, in line with the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and the shared commitment to the 1982 UNCLOS.""We wish to propose an EAS Maritime Heritage Festival to be held in the ancient port of Lothal in Gujarat.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha brewing over the Bay of Bengal is set to make landfall between Machilipatnam and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh on October 28 evening, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The storm is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm, bringing wind speeds up to 110 kmph and heavy rainfall across Andhra and south Odisha.Also read: Cyclone Montha live updates: Odisha, Andhra Pradesh on high alert; 8 districts mapped as ‘red zones’ in Odisha As of early Monday, Montha lay centred about 680 km south-southeast of Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh) and 850 km south of Gopalpur (Odisha).According to IMD’s latest bulletin, the storm is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm within the next 12 hours before crossing the Andhra coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam. Maximum sustained winds are expected to reach 90–100 kmph, gusting to 110 kmph, with a storm surge of up to one metre above astronomical tides in low-lying coastal areas.“People in coastal Andhra and south Odisha are advised to stay indoors once the cyclone nears landfall. We expect heavy to very heavy rainfall on October 28 and 29,” said S Jagannath Kumar, IMD scientist, Amaravati.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has placed the entire state administration on high alert, directing district collectors and SPs to ensure zero loss of life.Following a review meeting on Sunday, Naidu identified the Machilipatnam–Kakinada stretch as the most vulnerable zone and instructed departments to ensure seamless coordination in evacuation, relief, and restoration efforts.At least five districts — Kakinada, East Godavari, Konaseema, Eluru, and West Godavari — have swung into action, enforcing school closures, pre-positioning relief materials, and preparing cyclone shelters.In Kakinada, officials began moving residents from Hope Island to safer areas. All schools will remain closed from October 27 to 31 in anticipation of heavy rain and flooding.In Konaseema, collector R Mahesh Kumar ordered the closure of schools and said shelters had been arranged for over 6,000 residents in 34 coastal villages. Authorities have also shifted 428 pregnant women, who were due in the next 15 days, to health centres.NDRF teams and heavy earthmovers have been kept on standby for rescue operations.West Godavari authorities declared holidays for schools and colleges on October 27 and 28, and suspended all beach and resort activities. Officials have started relocating people from dilapidated buildings and low-lying areas to temporary relief camps.Neighbouring Odisha, though not directly in the path of landfall, is expected to face severe peripheral impact from Montha’s heavy rainfall bands.The state government has mapped eight southern districts—Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Gajapati, Ganjam, Kandhamal and Kalahandi—as red zones likely to face extremely heavy rainfall and strong winds.Revenue and disaster management minister Suresh Pujari said the state had begun evacuating vulnerable populations from hilly and landslide-prone areas.“Our goal is zero casualty. We have already deployed 128 response teams, including ODRAF, NDRF, and 99 Fire Service units, across eight districts. Evacuations from risk zones will be completed by Monday evening,” he said.Odisha has also cancelled all government employee leaves, activated round-the-clock control rooms, and directed hospitals to ensure uninterrupted power supply.Along the Odisha and Andhra coasts, fishing activity has come to a complete halt.Over 21,000 vessels, including 2,000 trawlers, have been anchored at fishing harbours and jetties in Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Paradip, and Kharinashi, following repeated warnings from the fisheries department.“Many boats returned to harbour on Sunday after we used loudspeakers to alert fishermen. Anyone venturing out will face strict action,” said Rabi Narayan Patnaik, joint director (marine), fisheries department.For the fishing communities, the cyclone adds to existing distress. “Continuous low pressure systems this season have already hit our earnings. Now Montha will keep us ashore again,” said Narayan Haldar, president, Odisha Matsyajibi Forum.The Andhra civil supplies department has drawn up a comprehensive action plan to ensure uninterrupted food, fuel, and essential supply chains during and after the cyclone.Minister N Manohar said Public Distribution System (PDS) commodities have been fully stocked at mandal-level points, while fuel stations in coastal districts have been directed to maintain 100% stock of petrol, diesel, and LPG.Telecom companies have been asked to set up generators to ensure mobile network continuity. Authorities have also granted GPS exemptions for emergency second-stage food grain movement across affected districts.In Gajapati, the district administration has ordered the closure of all major tourist spots and waterfalls, including Mahendragiri and Jirang monastery, to prevent accidents.Collector Madhumita said the district’s eight waterfalls and three tourist sites would remain closed until further notice.Government employees’ leaves have been cancelled, and officers have been appointed as nodal coordinators in each vulnerable block. “All cyclone shelters are functional, and control rooms are operating at panchayat level,” the collector said.In Visakhapatnam, the approach of Cyclone Montha has revived memories of the 2014 Cyclone Hudhud, which devastated the city with losses estimated at Rs 21,000 crore.Residents, recalling the week-long power and communication blackout, are stocking food, fuel, and medicines.“We don’t want another Hudhud situation. Our apartment association has arranged diesel for generators and stored drinking water bottles,” said Krishna, a resident of MVP Colony.The IMD has warned of widespread rain across Andhra Pradesh and southern Odisha from October 27 to 29, with wind speeds of 45–65 kmph even before the system makes landfall.","Cyclone Montha brewing over the Bay of Bengal is set to make landfall between Machilipatnam and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh on October 28 evening.

NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old woman, her ex-boyfriend and his friend have been arrested for allegedly killing her live-in partner, a UPSC aspirant, in north Delhi's Timarpur earlier this month and staging it as a fire incident.According to police, she planned the murder as she suspected he possessed a hard disk containing ""objectionable"" videos and photographs of her.The accused - Amrita Chauhan, her ex-boyfriend Sumit Kashyap (27) and his friend Sandeep Kumar (29) - hail from UP's Moradabad, where they were nabbed.On Oct 6, police were alerted to a fire on a fourth-floor flat in Gandhi Vihar. Firefighters found a charred body inside, later identified as 32-year-old Ramkesh Meena. A case under sections related to causing death by negligence was registered at the time.CCTV footage showed two masked persons entering the building on the day of the incident. After 39 minutes, one person could be seen exiting, and at 2.57am, a woman with another individual left the premises. The fire broke out shortly afterward, raising suspicion.According to sources, the woman's identity was established and her phone's location found near the site of the incident. When police tried to contact her, it was switched off. Several raids in Moradabad led to her arrest on Oct 18. Cops said she confessed to the crime and revealed the involvement of Kashyap and Kumar as well as the motive. Police recovered the hard disk, a trolley bag and the victim's shirt.Kashyap and Kumar were subsequently arrested on Oct 22 and 23, respectively. Police later invoked BNS sections related to murder, common intention, and mischief by injury, inundation, fire or explosive substance against the trio.Police said an inquiry revealed Chauhan and Meena, who met in May this year, had a live-in relationship. ""She claimed he secretly recorded obscene videos and refused to delete them,"" an officer said.When she shared her grievance with Kashyap, he allegedly roped in his friend to retrieve the hard disk. Chauhan, a BSc Forensic Science student and an avid watcher of crime series, hatched the plan to murder Meena and make it seem as though he died in a fire, police said.The trio allegedly thrashed and strangled Meena, before pouring oil, ghee and wine over his body. Kashyap placed a gas cylinder near the victim's head, opened the regulator and ignited it with a lighter while Chauhan secured the flat's iron gate from the inside, said police. They allegedly stole the hard disk, two laptops and other items belonging to Meena. About an hour later, the cylinder exploded, completely burning the victim.Confirming the arrests, DCP (North) Raja Banthia said Kashyap worked as an LPG distributor while Kumar was a graduate preparing for SSC CGL exams.","A 21-year-old woman, her ex-boyfriend and his friend have been arrested for allegedly killing her live-in partner, a UPSC aspirant, in north Delhi.

Delhi prepares for grand Chhath celebration





(With PTI inputs)

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Friday announced that October 27 (Monday) will be a government holiday to mark Chhath Puja . The decision coincides with the festival’s third day, considered the most sacred, when devotees gather along riversides and ponds to offer prayers to the setting sun.The holiday also recognises the festival’s cultural and spiritual importance, reflecting its emphasis on faith, devotion, and the harmony between humans and nature. Chhath Puja is observed through rituals that celebrate purity, gratitude towards nature, and environmental awareness, making it one of the most significant festivals in Delhi’s social calendar. Chhath Puja School Holidays will be observed in all Delhi schools, as per the official government announcement.The Delhi government has mobilised preparations at over 1,300 Chhath ghats across the city. Seventeen model ghats along the Yamuna are being upgraded with improved facilities, including tents, lighting, toilets, drinking water, and enhanced security, to ensure devotees can perform rituals comfortably and safely.During an inspection at Pochanpur Chhath Ghat in Dwarka Sector 23B, CM Rekha Gupta, accompanied by MLA Sandeep Sahrawat and members of the Chhath Puja Committee, oversaw decoration and maintenance activities, according to media reports.The initiative emphasised citizen participation alongside government efforts to turn the festival into a city-wide celebration of cultural unity.The government’s ongoing Yamuna cleaning work has been progressing over the past eight months, showing visible improvements in water quality. Coordination with neighbouring states Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has been central to the initiative, with the city administration aiming to combine environmental responsibility with festival arrangements.Earlier on Friday, the CM inaugurated a newly constructed Chhath ghat and other development projects worth ₹30 crore in Laxmi Nagar. The initiative also recognised the contributions of the Purvanchal community to Delhi’s socio-economic growth.For Chhath Puja 2025, there is no official confirmation of a public holiday in other parts of NCR including Noida or Gurugram. However, schools in both cities are likely to remain closed, following the common practice of observing regional festivals. Residents and parents are advised to check with individual schools for final closure details.With the government holiday and upgraded facilities across the Capital, Delhi is set for a large-scale Chhath celebration, blending devotion, civic planning, and environmental consciousness.","The Delhi government has mobilised preparations at over 1,300 Chhath ghats across the city.

Cyclone Montha: Army, NDRF On Alert As Twin Cyclonic Systems Build Up In Arabian Sea & Bay Of Bengal

Odisha on alert, says Revenue and Disaster Management Minister

Andhra Pradesh districts take up large-scale contingency measures

Heavy rainfall and flooding risks

As Cyclone Montha intensifies over the Bay of Bengal, both Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have gone on high alert, ordering school closures and precautionary evacuations in several coastal districts. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of extremely heavy rainfall and gale-force winds up to 110 kmph, with the storm expected to make landfall on October 28 between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam.In Odisha, the Ganjam district administration has already shut schools and colleges until October 28, reports Kalinga TV. Meanwhile, while other southern districts including Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Gajapati, Kandhamal and Kalahandi have been marked as “red zones”, where similar closures are likely if conditions worsen. In Andhra Pradesh, Konaseema, Kakinada, East and West Godavari, and Eluru districts have implemented contingency measures, including school holidays, evacuations, and bans on fishing.According to an ANI report, Odisha Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Suresh Pujari said the state is “fully prepared” with extensive safety measures and coordination plans across departments. “The Odisha government has prepared extensively for the impending cyclone, which is currently 930 kilometres away from the Odisha coast and moving towards the west and northwest,” he said.He added that eight districts have been identified as highly vulnerable, and all departments — including energy, health, public relations, rural development, and agriculture — have been instructed to stay alert.“Cyclone centres, relief centres, and plot centres are ready... The water resources department has started releasing water from reservoirs,” Pujari said.As reported by Times News Network (TNN), Andhra Pradesh has also begun extensive preparations in at least five coastal districts including Kakinada, East Godavari, Konaseema, Eluru, and West Godavari. Local authorities have issued fishing bans, school closures, and evacuation advisories in vulnerable areas.In Kakinada, officials started moving people from Hope Island to safer zones, while in Konaseema, Collector R Mahesh Kumar ordered the closure of schools and prepared shelters for over 6,000 residents from 34 coastal villages. He added that 428 pregnant women expected to deliver within the next 15 days have been shifted to nearby health centres.In West Godavari and Eluru, schools and colleges will remain closed on October 27 and 28, and recreational activities at beaches and resorts have been suspended. Telecom operators have been instructed to deploy generators to ensure uninterrupted mobile connectivity during the cyclone.As per IMD projections, 20–30 cm of rain is likely across several coastal and southern districts of both states between October 28 and 30, accompanied by flooding, power disruptions, and possible storm surges.A Kalinga TV report highlighted intensified coastal preparedness, with visuals showing IMD forecasts and district-level mapping of rainfall risks. The channel reported that fishing has been banned, and relief and rescue teams have been positioned across Odisha’s southern coastline.Authorities in both states said coordinated efforts between disaster management, police, and energy departments are ongoing to minimise damage, with 24x7 control rooms and emergency medical teams on standby.","Cyclone Montha is expected to make landfall on October 28 between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam.

NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma struck an unbeaten century, Virat Kohli made a fighting half-century, and pacer Harshit Rana grabbed four wickets as India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday, though they lost the series 1-2.Rana’s brilliant spell of 4/39 helped bowl Australia out for 236 in 46.4 overs, setting the stage for a dominant Indian chase. Rohit then led the way with an unbeaten 121 off 125 balls. He first shared a crucial 69-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (24) before joining forces with Kohli (74* off 81 balls) for an unbroken 168-run stand, guiding India to the target in 38.3 overs.After reaching his half-century, Kohli initially forgot to acknowledge the crowd or celebrate, until Rohit signaled him to mark the milestone.Watch the video here During the innings, Kohli also broke another record, becoming the second-highest run-getter in ODI cricket. The No.3 batter, famously known as the 'Chase Master,' overcame subdued form in the first two ODIs to register his 75th ODI fifty and surpass 2,500 runs against Australia in the format.Kohli also surpassed Sri Lankan great Kumar Sangakkara’s tally of 14,234 runs (in 404 ODIs) in his 293rd ODI innings. The former India captain now sits just behind legendary Sachin Tendulkar , who leads with 18,426 runs. Impressively, Kohli maintains a superior average of 57.69 across 305 ODIs, compared to Tendulkar’s 44.83 in 463 matches.With his career nearing its end in ODIs, Kohli is set to finish as the second-highest run-getter behind his idol, Tendulkar.In the match, Kohli’s unbeaten 74, including seven fours, and Rohit’s 33rd ODI ton — which was also his 50th international century — powered India to a nine-wicket victory at the Sydney Cricket Ground, even as Australia secured the series 2-1. Rohit was named both Player of the Match and Player of the Series for scoring 202 runs across three games.The two sides will now clash in a five-match T20I series, beginning October 29.","India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court brushed aside on Monday pleas for making public names of candidates shortlisted by the selection panel for the posts of chief information commissioner and information commissioners after the Centre said the process would be completed in three weeks. ""The selection panel comprising the PM, leader of the opposition and a Union Cabinet minister nominated by the PM would finalise the names in 2-3 weeks,"" additional solicitor general K M Nataraj told SC.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing on behalf of social activist Anjali Bhardwaj, said the Centre is brazenly violating the SC order for making public names of all who had applied, those shortlisted, and the procedure adopted.Govt has also said ""they would appoint people who had not even applied for the posts"", Bhushan claimed.Nataraj told the bench that there are many eligible and suitable candidates who do not want their names to be publicised ""fearing backlash by a section of society who find fault with everything done by govt"".Bhushan said the Centre and states are killing information commissions by keeping their sanctioned strength low and yet keeping posts vacant to frustrate RTI applicants.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi assured Bhushan it would scrutinise the selections to ensure that those appointed meet the eligibility criteria. But Bhushan said that citizens have the right to know who has been shortlisted. The bench said, ""Publishing the names of those shortlisted would entitle those not in the panel to move the courts against the appointment process which would then never get completed. "" SC posted the matter for further hearing after three weeks.After Bhushan pointed out that Jharkhand has not appointed anyone to the state information commission rendering it dysfunctional, the bench was assured by the state that the appointment process has already been notified and would be completed in 45 days. Supreme Court said if the process was not completed within the timeframe, then the chief secretary would be liable for appropriate orders.The court also noticed vacancies in the SICs in Maharashtra, Karnataka and MP and asked them to initiate the selection process within three weeks. It said in Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Odisha, Karnataka and Maharashtra thousands of RTI applications are pending adjudication by the SICs because of their inadequate strength. It asked these states to consider increasing the strength of SICs and apprise the court.","Supreme Court brushed aside pleas for making public names of candidates shortlisted by the selection panel for posts of chief information commissioner and information commissioners.

Takeaway

NEW DELHI: A Dubai-based Indian traveller has won a legal battle at the Delhi High Court after Customs seized his luxury Rolex watch at the Indira Gandhi International Airport , wrongly classifying it as a “commercial quantity.” The passenger had challenged the Customs order, and the Court ruled that a single high-value watch cannot automatically be treated as goods meant for trade, allowing him to redeem it upon payment of the prescribed fine.The case centres around incident from March 2024, when Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, arrived at Delhi Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around Rs 12.7 lakh. Believing he had no dutiable goods, he passed through the Green Channel- reserved for passengers without items requiring declaration. Customs officers intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt, claiming non-declaration and categorising the watch as a “commercial quantity.”A division bench of Justices Pratibha M Singh and Sahil Jain delivered the verdict, noting that while the Customs Department acted correctly in detaining the item for non-declaration, it erred in categorising one luxury watch as goods meant for trade.The case involved Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, who was intercepted by Customs officers at Delhi Airport in March 2024 after walking through the Green Channel.His Rolex watch was seized for alleged non-declaration. An Order-in-Original passed earlier this year allowed redemption of the watch after payment of a fine, but labelled it a “commercial quantity”- prompting Mahesh to challenge the decision before the High Court.The bench observed that although the Customs Commissioner correctly permitted redemption, the classification of a single Rolex as a commercial import was “unsustainable.”“Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use,” the judges said.However, the Court maintained that the declaration requirement and duty liability for high-value personal articles remain valid under law. The bench allowed redemption on payment of the existing fine by October 31, reiterating that travellers must exercise diligence when carrying luxury or high-value items through Indian airports.The ruling serves as an important clarification for both travellers and enforcement authorities — that while non-declaration attracts penalties, mere possession of an expensive personal item does not imply commercial intent.Under India’s customs baggage rules, every arriving passenger must declare dutiable, restricted, or high-value items, regardless of whether they are for personal use.A declaration is mandatory if a traveller carries:Travellers falling under these categories must use the Red Channel and fill out a Customs Declaration Form upon arrival, as opposed to the Green Channel which is for anyone not carrying any items that require declaration/customs duty.Children below ten years are entitled to half the adult limit, and pooling allowances within a family is not permitted.Luxury goods such as watches, designer accessories, and high-end electronics are not considered personal effects under Customs law. Even when used or worn, these must be declared if they exceed Rs 50,000 in value.For jewellery, men returning after a year abroad can bring up to Rs 10,000 duty-free, while women can bring jewellery worth Rs 20,000. Any excess is assessed for duty at arrival.Failure to declare dutiable or restricted goods can lead to:In Mahesh’s case, the court upheld that Customs acted within its powers in detaining the watch but clarified that the seizure should not have treated the item as a trade import.The High Court’s ruling provides relief in one individual case but carries a broader message for international travellers — high-value personal items like luxury watches must still be declared at Customs counters subject to conditions. Wearing such goods does not exempt them from declaration.In simple terms, declaration ensures lawful clearance and avoids the risk of confiscation, penalties, or prolonged litigation — as illustrated by the Rolex case itself.","The case involved Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, who was intercepted by Customs officers at Delhi Airport in March 2024 after walking through the Green Channel.

NEW DELHI: What began as an alleged acid attack near Delhi University’s Laxmi Bai College has turned into a case of deceit and revenge. The Delhi Police on Monday arrested Akil Khan, the father of the 20-year-old student who had claimed to be the victim of the acid attack, after uncovering that Khan had allegedly raped the wife of the main accused in the supposed acid attack. However, Khan has now admitted that the acid attack was fabricated using nothing more than toilet cleaner.During interrogation, Akil Khan admitted to fabricating the acid attack claim, saying that the liquid used was ordinary toilet cleaner, news agency PTI reported.According to police, the student, a second-year BCom candidate enrolled in DU’s Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board, had claimed that she was attacked with acid by Jitender and his associates, Ishan and Arman, on Sunday morning while on her way to attend an extra class.Soon after, counterclaims surfaced, including an accusation of rape against the student’s father. The wife of the main accused, Jitender Singh, told police that she had earlier filed a complaint against the student’s father, Akil Khan, alleging that Akil had raped her while she was employed at his socks manufacturing unit between 2021 and 2024. She said Khan had blackmailed her using her private photos and videos.Following her statement, police questioned Khan when he admitted to fabricating the acid attack claim.Investigators had already found inconsistencies in the student’s account and confirmed that Jitender was not present at the alleged crime scene at the time of the incident. Call detail records and CCTV footage revealed that he and his wife were in Karol Bagh, far from the area of the incident.","Akil Khan, the father of the 20-year-old student who had claimed to be the victim of the acid attack, was arrested on Monday.

The Chhath countdown



NEW DELHI: When Rahul Gandhi set out under Bihar 's unforgiving August sun for his 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', it was a test of whether he could still find takers in a land where the Congress survives mostly as a fading afterimage. For 16 days, his campaign carved a noisy trail through dusty highways and crowded colonies.Today, however, as Bihar's election heat rises and the state readies for a two-phase assembly poll, the buzz is dominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fiery speeches, Amit Shah's rallies, Tejashwi Yadav's roadshows and Prashant Kishor's groundwork. Amid all this, one voice remains missing - Rahul Gandhi.The Congress leaders's last appearance in Bihar was nearly two months ago, when he wrapped up his yatra at Patna's Gandhi Maidan on September 1. The campaign was pitched as a moral crusade to ""protect the vote"" - an attempt to awaken Bihar's electorate against what he called 'vote chori' (theft of votes) by the ruling NDA.Over sixteen days, he covered 1,300 km across 25 districts and 110 assembly constituencies - riding motorbikes, donning 'gamcha' for local appeal, visiting makhana farmers - often joined by allies like Tejashwi Yadav, Hemant Soren and others.But two months later, the narrative has shifted. Rahul, who had briefly stirred Congress's dormant base through his yatra, seems to have lost the momentum. And instead of leading the charge from the front, its leader is missing in action.When the Mahagathbandhan announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate on October 23, the press conference banner carried only one face - Tejashwi's. Rahul was missing, both on stage and in spirit. Within the alliance, the unspoken verdict seemed clear: he may be the face of opposition on the national level, but he was no longer its in-charge in Bihar.Though there has been no official seat-sharing arrangement, RJD is contesting 143 of the 243 seats of Bihar and Congress is contesting 61 seats.In the 2020 assembly elections, Congress had the worst strike rate in the opposition camp despite Tejashwi's electrifying campaign that led RJD to emerge as the largest single party. Congress had contested 70 seats, the most in the opposition alliance after the RJD (144), and could win only 19.Since his Patna rally, Rahul Gandhi has appeared in public only five times - none of them in Bihar. In late September, he was spotted at a pizza outlet in Gurugram.In early October, he travelled to Colombia, where he declared that ""India’s democratic system is under attack from all sides."" During a talk at the University of Chile, he lamented that ""free and scientific thinking"" was under ""tremendous attack"" in India.On October 17, he visited singer Zubeen Garg’s village in Assam to pay tributes. Three days later, he was seen at a sweet shop in Old Delhi, rolling laddoos for the cameras.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal, however, maintained that the party's ""full-throttle campaign"" will begin only after the Chhath festival. Rahul Gandhi, he said, will tour Bihar on October 29 and 30, followed by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and party president Mallikarjun Kharge. A joint rally with Tejashwi is planned in Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.But will this late entry work? For the past month, while PM Modi, Amit Shah and JP Nadda have flooded Bihar with rallies and Tejashwi has built emotional momentum across districts, Congress has remained in political limbo.Rahul's absence has left party candidates and workers scrambling for visibility and credibility on the ground. His re-entry, barely a week before Phase 1 polling on November 6, feels less like a strategy and more like irrelevance.For now, Congress is trying to make up for his absence by circulating old clips from the yatra, calling Rahul Gandhi the 'Jan Nayak' — the ""hero of the people.""Adding to the drift is Congress's own internal turmoil in Bihar.Ticket distribution had triggered open rebellion, with state leaders accusing AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru of corruption and favouritism. Disgruntled members were seen protesting at the party headquarters. Their slogan, ""Ticket chor, gaddi chhodd,"" was an ironic echo of Rahul's own ""Vote chor, gaddi chhodd"" taunt at the NDA government.The dissent underscores the deep disconnect between the central leadership and the local cadre, even at the last leg of the election campaign. In recent days, senior leaders like Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Baghel were parachuted in to manage the fallout, both within the party and with allies like RJD. Hemant Soren, who walked with Rahul in Bihar in a show of strength, eventually walked out and decided not to contest elections.But through it all, Rahul has remained absent.Meanwhile, BJP has turned Bihar into a campaign battlefield.Prime Minister Modi has led from the front with rallies in Samastipur and Begusarai, urging voters to deliver a ""record-breaking victory."" Home minister Amit Shah has addressed meetings in Siwan and Buxar, while BJP president JP Nadda has courted intellectuals in Vaishali. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been roped in to hold over 20 rallies.The optics are unmistakable, a full-spectrum show of power and coordination.Rahul's partner, Tejashwi Yadav, has also been a relentless presence on the ground, addressing multiple rallies a day. When asked about Rahul’s absence, he sidesteps diplomatically, but the contract remains too stark to miss.Even after literally no presence till now, Congress insists that its campaign will finally shift gears after Chhath Puja (October 27). The party’s manifesto, focusing on social justice and women's welfare, is scheduled for release on October 28.He is scheduled to address his first political rally along with Tejashwi Yadav on October 29. The duo will hold a joint rally in Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.His late entry may well be planned. But ask any political pundit and they will tell you that in any election, presence on the ground matters the most, and right now, that is nowhere to be seen.So, just 10 days before Bihar goes to the first phase of polling, the question is simple: Why so late, Rahul?","Rahul Gandhi's last appearance in Bihar was nearly two months ago, when he wrapped up his yatra at Patna's Gandhi Maidan.

BIG UNSC Takedown on Kashmir: India Rebukes Pakistan Over Illegal Occupation and Rights Crackdown

SRINAGAR: For the first time since assuming office in Oct 2024, J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday admitted his optimism regarding the restoration of statehood was fading.“I was hopeful from day one about the restoration of statehood,” he said. “Now, the hope has diminished. The longer you keep us waiting and delay statehood, the less hopeful we’ll be,” Omar said while interacting with reporters in his office at J&K Assembly, which is in session currently.Asked about reports claiming he would step down as CM if J&K’s statehood was not restored within a fixed period, Omar refused to comment. On Sunday, he had said in an interview that he had set for himself a finite time frame wherein, if statehood was not restored, he would resign. Omar skirted the topic on Monday.He, however, insisted that lack of statehood was becoming a hurdle for the elected govt to function. “Am I mad to ask for statehood if there are no hurdles in executing our work? If it were easy to work in a Union Territory, then all states of the country would have asked for becoming UT and we wouldn’t even be talking about statehood,” he said.Mentioning some of the hurdles, the CM said officers were not posted according to the govt’s choice, and several departments that should have been under the control of the elected govt are not were not with it.Omar also took on the assembly speaker, Abdul Rahim Rather, who refused discussion on the arrest of AAP MLA Mehraj Malik after BJP members insisted that the case sub was judice.Dismissing allegations of a “secret understanding” with BJP, he said maintaining cordial ties with the Centre was essential “so that the work of governance continues smoothly”, but asserted that “NC has no ties with BJP, and it never will have”.He further said NC was the only party that was taking on BJP in J&K. “We were the only ones who challenged them in the Rajya Sabha election... In the Nagrota bypoll, both Congress and PDP decided not to contest. The only party standing up to the BJP there is the NC,” he said.As two of his party MPs, Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi and Mian Altaf Ahmed, criticised his governance style on Sunday, the CM said he respected Mian Altaf as a senior colleague and valued his advice immensely. Omar, however, said he did not want to talk about Mehdi, and that there was no comparison between the two MPs.Mehdi has been extremely critical of Omar and has accused him of abandoning advocacy for Article 370 and betraying people on many promises. The Srinagar MP hit back at the CM saying: “There are thousands of people languishing in jails and he (Omar) doesn’t know anything about it. The fight for Article 370 is a fight for our existence. We must be informed of what happened in that fight,” the MP Srinagar said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday admitted his optimism regarding the restoration of statehood was fading. “The longer you keep us waiting and delay statehood, the less hopeful we’ll be,” Omar said while interacting with reporters in his office at J&K Assembly, which is in session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124857352,imgsize-58090,width-400,resizemode-4/hope-for-statehood-of-jampk-diminishing-omar-abdullah.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Opposition on Monday launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission of India (ECI) after it announced Phase 2 of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls across 12 states and Union Territories, calling it a ""vote theft"" exercise designed to benefit the ruling BJP Several leaders accused the poll body of acting under government pressure, claiming that ""in today's India, it's the government that chooses voters.""Earlier, Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar announced that the second phase of SIR will cover 51 crore voters and be held between November and February. ""The second phase will be conducted in 12 states and Union Territories. SIR will ensure no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible elector is included in poll rolls,"" Kumar said.He added that the enumeration process will begin on November 4, draft rolls will be published on December 9, and final rolls will be out by February 7, 2026.The 12 states and UTs covered under Phase 2 include Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.Kumar also clarified that Assam, which goes to polls in 2026, will have a separate SIR exercise due to distinct citizenship provisions.Reacting sharply, the Congress alleged that the ECI was working in collusion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to manipulate voter rolls.In a post on X, the party said, ""The Election Commission is now set to play the game of 'vote theft' in 12 states. In the name of SIR, 6.9 million votes were slashed in Bihar. Now, crores of votes will be slashed across 12 states.”Calling the move a ""conspiracy against democracy,"" Congress alleged, ""This is blatant 'vote theft,' which Narendra Modi and the Election Commission are carrying out together.""""The Election Commission should have been held accountable for these cases. Instead, it has become part of the game of 'vote theft',"" it added.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray went a step further, demanding legal action against the poll body.""A case should be registered against the Election Commissioner for the corrupt practice of bogus voters,"" Thackeray said. ""Voters elect government in a democracy, but today the government chooses voters,"" he added.Congress leader Pawan Khera echoed similar criticism, questioning the transparency of the SIR process. ""We still haven't received answers to questions related to the SIR conducted in Bihar so far. The situation was such that the Supreme Court had to step in to rectify the SIR process,"" Khera said on X.He alleged that the EC and the BJP were ""working hand in hand."" ""The intentions of the Election Commission and the BJP have been exposed to the entire country through the SIR in Bihar,"" he said.""Whenever SIR takes place, Election Commission officials visit every household, adding new voters and removing those who need to be deleted from the list. Following the revelation of 'vote theft' linked to Rahul Gandhi ji’s Aland Assembly, the SIT has reported that a centralised operation was being carried out to remove names from the voter list.""""Amid all these issues, the Election Commission’s conduct of SIR is under suspicion, and its intentions do not seem genuine. Neither the opposition nor the voters are satisfied,"" he added.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK President M.K. Stalin also hit out at the ECI for scheduling the SIR during the monsoon season. ""To carry out Special Intensive Revision just months before the election, and especially during the monsoon months of November and December, brings serious practical difficulties,"" he said.""To conduct SIR in a hasty and opaque manner is nothing but a conspiracy by the ECI to rob citizens of their rights and help the BJP. In Bihar, large numbers of women, minorities and people from SC and ST communities were removed from the electoral rolls, and the absence of transparency has fuelled serious suspicion in the public mind,"" he stated.Stalin announced that an all-party meeting will be held on November 2 in Chennai to discuss the issue and decide on the next course of action.""Following the announcement, we held discussions with our alliance partners, and on that basis an all party meeting will be convened on 2 November to decide the next course of action. The right to vote is the foundation of democracy. Tamil Nadu will fight against any attempt to murder it, and Tamil Nadu will win,"" he said.AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh told PTI that the Chief Election Commissioner was ""acting as an agent of BJP and PM Modi.""""EC Chief Gyanesh Kumar is a liar, just like Narendra Modi. He is an agent of the BJP. It’s unfortunate for the country that such a person is the Chief Election Commissioner,"" he added.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor dismissed the move as politically motivated stating that, ""SIR was done in Bihar. What difference did it make? Was anyone's name struck off? A few people did face difficulties.""""BJP can try all it wants, they might want to delete someone's name, scare someone else and bother someone. But if people turn against you, do any SIR or FIR, there will be nobody to save you,"" he added.The EC earlier completed Phase 1 of the SIR in Bihar, where the final list of 7.42 crore electors was published on September 30.

NEW DELHI: A day after a 20-year-old Delhi University student was allegedly attacked with acid near Laxmi Bai College in Delhi, the case has taken a confusing turn with conflicting evidence, past complaints and a possible revenge angle now under probe.Police sources told news agency PTI that the prime suspect, Jitender, was miles away from the crime scene when the alleged attack took place. Call detail records and CCTV footage have placed him and his wife in Karol Bagh, far from the area of the incident.""No CCTV footage has so far shown three men on a motorcycle near the spot as initially claimed. The motorcycle believed to be used in the crime was also seen in Karol Bagh,"" an officer involved in the investigation told PTI.Meanwhile, forensic teams have found no traces of acid or discarded bottles at the site. Investigators are also questioning why the victim got off her e-rickshaw about 300 metres short of her college gate, after travelling part of the way on a scooter with her brother.In a separate development, Jitender's wife has accused the victim's father of rape, filing a complaint at the Bhalswa Dairy Police Station.She alleged that while working at a socks factory owned by the man since 2021, he took private photographs of her, sexually assaulted her, and later circulated the images to her husband.Police confirmed she had made prior PCR calls on October 24 and 25, but a written complaint was only filed now.Investigators have also learned that two other men named in the current case, Ishan and Arman, are distant relatives of the victim. Their families have reportedly been locked in a long-standing property dispute.In 2018, their mother had accused the victim's father of throwing acid at her, and a case was registered at Mangolpuri Police Station.Police are now examining multiple possible motives, including revenge, family enmity and attempted framing, as the investigation continues.","A 20-year-old Delhi University student was allegedly attacked with acid near Laxmi Bai College in Delhi.

Cyclone Montha: Army, NDRF On Alert As Twin Cyclonic Systems Build Up In Arabian Sea & Bay Of Bengal

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army has been placed on high alert as two developing cyclonic systems over the East Central Arabian Sea and the South East Bay of Bengal are expected to intensify into cyclone “Montha” within the next 48 hours.According to a statement cited by ANI, the Army said the situation is being closely monitored in coordination with the national disaster management authority (NDMA) and respective state governments.“The Indian Army has been placed on high alert in view of the developing cyclonic systems over both the East Central Arabian Sea and the South East Bay of Bengal, which are expected to intensify over the next 48 hours into Cyclone ‘Montha’. The situation is being closely monitored in coordination with the national disaster management authority (NDMA) and respective state governments,” the Army said.Both systems are currently under observation by meteorological agencies, which have issued an Orange alert for the Northern coast of Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas, as they develop into a potential severe weather event that could impact coastal regions.Defence and disaster management authorities are said to be coordinating to ensure readiness for possible relief and rescue operations.Authorities across coastal states remain on standby as part of early preparedness measures.In response to the deep depression intensifying into cyclone 'Montha' in the Bay of Bengal, the Odisha government on Monday began evacuating people from vulnerable areas in eight southern districts and deployed 128 disaster response teams.

'CM Mamata sensing trouble': BJP; TMC hits back



Key transfers



NEW DELHI: After the EC announced a pan-India SIR, including West Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government went for one of the biggest one-day shake-up transferring over 500 bureaucrats. Though dated October 24, the transfer orders were uploaded in phases on the department’s website both before and after the Election Commission announced the SIR.Transfer orders for 61 IAS and 145 WBCS (Executive) officers were uploaded in the first half of the day, followed by postings of six IAS and 315 WBCS officers appearing online soon after the EC’s briefing.The officers will serve as key functionaries in the SIR exercise, and once the schedule is notified, any further transfers by the state would require EC approval, PTI reported citing an official.The SIR will run from November 4 to December 4, with draft electoral rolls slated for release on December 9 and the final list set to be published on February 7.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioned the timing of the transfers calling the ""last-minute bulk transfers"" an effort to ""disturb the process (SIR)"".""CM Mamata Banerjee is sensing trouble for her party once this exercise is successfully completed and a large number of fake voters are deleted from the electoral rolls.She is, hence, trying everything in her hand to disturb the process by making such last-minute bulk transfers,"" BJP leader Sajal Ghosh alleged.TMC rubbished the allegations saying it was a ""routine measure"". ""Such transfers take place in the government as a routine measure across the year. There's no reason why one should draw a connection between this and the SIR announcement. This is opposition for opposition's sake,"" TMC IT cell head Debangshu Bhattacharya said.Among those shifted were 14 district magistrates, several special secretaries, OSDs, and a large number of ADMs and SDOs across both IAS and WBCS cadres. HIDCO MD Shashank Sethi has taken charge as DM of North 24 Parganas, with Murshidabad DM Rajarshi Mitra moving to his position. KMC commissioner Dhaval Jain has been posted as DM of Birbhum, while Sumit Gupta from South 24 Parganas replaces him. Haldia Development Authority CEO Kontam Sudhir has been appointed DM of Purulia.Science and technology department secretary Godala Kiran Kumar will now serve as divisional commissioner of Medinipur, and Panchayat & rural development special secretary Kuhuk Bhushan has been named DM of Kalimpong.

She spoke Hindi with a Bengali accent and remembered almost nothing. For years, no one knew who she was or where she came from.The breakthrough came after 13 months of counselling by social service superintendent Kunda Katekhaye-Bidkar, in coordination with medical superintendent Dr Satish Humne and psychiatrist Dr Pankaj Bagde. Gradually, the woman mentioned a place called ""Bandri,"" her husband and sons' names, and a relative's description.These fragments led the team to Bandri in MP's Sagar district.Acting on the hospital's request, SHO's team traced her family after weeks of checking records.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: SC Monday said hurling a shoe at an SC judge in courtroom is criminal contempt in the face of the court but expressed reluctance to initiate contempt proceedings against advocate Rakesh Kishore, who engaged in the act against CJI BR Gavai, saying the judge who faced the attempted assault alone could punish the contemnor.SC Bar Association chief and senior advocate Vikas Singh repeatedly requested a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi to entertain association's plea seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore.""His subsequent conduct is even more contemptuous as, instead of being remorseful, he boasted he would do it again and that it was a command from God. This is an insult to God as no God would give such a command,"" Singh said.Justices Kant and Bagchi said that under Contempt of Court Act, 1971, only the judge before whom anyone attempts or commits contempt in the face of the court has jurisdiction to initiate contempt proceedings in matter.""The act of the advocate is a serious and grave criminal contempt of court. His subsequent conduct aggravates his crime. But once the CJI has magnanimously pardoned him, there is little we can do. We also do not think the attorney general can give consent for initiation of contempt proceedings in a case involving criminal contempt in the face of the court,"" the bench said.Justice Kant pointed out that initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore would only serve his design of getting cheap publicity on social media. ""He should be treated with the contempt he deserves for the abominable action,"" the bench said, though adding that it was ready to consider the larger issue at hand - the issuance of a John Doe order restraining social media from glorifying such incidents.

NEW DELHI: India needs to be ""ready for a war-like situation"", with military preparedness being based on indigenous foundations, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Monday, asking the industry to further accelerate self-reliance in defence production.India gave ""a firm response with a firm resolve"" to Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10 and the armed forces are fully prepared to defend the country's borders, Singh said.""(But) we must continue to introspect.

KOLKATA: Bengal govt has transferred 67 IAS and 460 state civil services officers in one of its largest single-day administrative reshuffles yet, moving 14 district magistrates, besides key civic and infrastructure officials.The sweeping changes come months before EC's special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, which begins this week in Delhi and will start soon in Bengal. Under Article 324(1) of the Constitution, the SIR process vests EC with powers of ""superintendence, direction and control"" similar to those it exercises during elections. Administrative officers such as DMs and block development officers serve as electoral registration officers during this phase.Many of the transferred officers had been in their posts between two-and-a-half and four years and were close to breaching EC's rule barring officials from holding the same post for more than three years when elections are announced. Bengal's assembly polls are expected by March 2026, and EC's schedule for electoral roll verification is seen as a precursor to the election calendar.""The transfers were routine,"" a senior state officer said, but officials acknowledged that carrying out such a reshuffle after EC's process began would have been ""much more complicated and difficult"".Legal experts said once SIR starts, EC's direct oversight limits the state's power to reassign key officers.The reshuffle order, signed Friday, comes amid what insiders described as ""feelers"" from EC over the ""slow pace"" of SIR preparations in some districts. ""DMs also become district electoral registration officers once the SIR process starts and come under EC's direct purview. EC could have asked for transfer of those DMs with whose work it was not satisfied,"" a retired bureaucrat said.Officials said similar transfers in police administration could follow to comply with EC's three-year rule, though those can wait until before formal poll announcement, as police personnel do not come under EC control during the SIR phase.","Bengal govt has transferred 67 IAS and 460 state civil services officers in one of its largest single-day administrative reshuffles yet.

NRC case pending in SC, Assam may sees summary rolls revision

NEW DELHI: : Election Commission on Monday ordered the next leg of the special intensive revision of electoral rolls — apan-India exercise covering a dozen states and Union territories, and 51 crore electors in all. Enumeration for this phase shall start on Nov 4 and the final electoral roll, with Jan 1, 2026 as the qualifying date, be published on Feb 7, 2026.Four of the five states/UT where assembly polls are due in April-May next year — West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry — are among the 12 that will witness SIR over the next three months. Assam, though also poll-bound, is not on that list.Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said Assam cannot be covered by the same SIR norms applicable to other states/UTs as the Citizenship Act has an exclusive provision for Assam — Section 6A — with differential criteria for determining citizenship.Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said Supreme Court is monitoring the matter relating to ‘citizenship verification programme’ — an apparent reference to National Register for Citizens exercise completed in Assam in 2019 — and it may reach finality soon. “A separate order shall be issued for Assam,” said Kumar.Sources said that since there has to be mandatory pre-poll roll updation in Assam, EC could, in the absence of a final SC order on NRC, go for a summary revision.“This will avoid complications arising out of conflict between electoral roll and NRC,” said an official.Other states/UTs covered in this phase of SIR announced on Monday are Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep. They have been chosen for having mapped a very high percentage of their electors as of Oct 27, with the last SIR roll and adequately prepping their machinery with posting/training of BLOs and training of district magistrates and EROs. The last two on the list are UTs without a legislature. Maharashtra, where SC has ordered conduct of local polls by Jan 31, 2026, is not on the latest SIR list, even as Kerala, where local polls are being discussed but are not notified yet, is.Kumar emphasised that EC would deliver an error-free roll in the 12 states/UTs. “SIR will ensure no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible elector is included,” he said. Citing the receipt of ‘zero appeals’ after publication of final roll in Bihar, he said it stands testimony to perfection with which SIR was carried out and cooperation extended by nearly 7.4 crore electors.Unlike Bihar, the pan-India SIR will not require residents to submit any documents during enumeration phase. Also, a separate box has been added to enrolment forms to record one’s own or parents’/relatives’ details from the last SIR in 2002/2003/ 2004. “Ones not linked to the last SIR roll will be issued a notice to prove their eligibility with one of the ‘indicative’ documents,” said Kumar.On pressure that BLOs may face in states opposing SIR, EC said it is confident that all states/UTs will discharge their constitutional duty under Article 326 by placing their personnel at its disposal for SIR, and maintaining law and order. On transfers of officers in states like West Bengal after announcement of SIR, a senior EC functionary said it signals that these states are ready for the exercise despite threatening to not allow it.Sources said nearly 70- 80% voters in the 12 states/ UTs may find a link to the last SIR roll as thanks to digitisation, an elector in one state/ UT can locate their parents’ name in any other state/UT roll from the last SIR. The CEC said an elector is required by law to sign and submit only one enumeration form.The ‘indicative’ list of documents accepted as proof remains the same as in Bihar. Aadhaar will be accepted only as proof of identity. “If during the hearing, a person offers an alternative document, it will be considered by the ERO,” the CEC said.","NRC case pending in SC, Assam may sees summary rolls revision. West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are among the 12 that will witness SIR.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over stray dog bite incidents continuing despite its directions, Supreme Court on Monday summoned chief secretaries of all states and UTs - except Bengal and Telangana - for failing to inform it about steps taken to implement the Animal Birth Control rules.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria took strong exception to states not responding to its notice or filing compliance affidavits in the two months since its Aug 22 order. ""Continuous incidents are happening and the country's image is going down in the eyes of foreign nations. We also read news reports,"" the bench said. The apex court directed the chief secretaries to appear before it on Nov 3 and explain the non-compliance.Noting that the rules are uniform nationwide and the menace of dog bites exists in every state, SC had earlier expanded the scope of the case beyond Delhi-NCR and issued notices to all states and UTs. It had sought details from animal husbandry and local body departments on the compliance measures.At Monday's hearing, SC was informed that only Bengal, Telangana and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had filed responses.

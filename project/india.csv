Judge removal involves several steps. Here’s how it proceeds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-removal-involves-several-steps-heres-how-it-proceeds/articleshow/121477504.cms,"Judge removal involves several steps. Here’s how it proceeds

Once a judicial inquiry committee concludes in its report about wrongdoing by a constitutional court judge, the CJI, on being satisfied with the committee’s finding, offers an opportunity to the judge concerned to resign.If the judge refuses, then the CJI forwards the inquiry report to the President, who is the appointing authority, and the PM. The PM and the Union Cabinet, after discussing the report, may ask the law ministry/parliamentary affairs ministry to initiate a motion for removal.A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion, and in Lok Sabha if 100 or more MPs agree to put their signatures to it.Once the motion is placed before the LS Speaker or RS chairman, in either case, he carries out a preliminary review of the report as well as the accompanying motion and has the power to ‘admit or refuse to admit’ the notice of motion for removal (Section 3 of Judges Inquiry Act, 1968).In the event of admitting the notice of motion for removal, the head of the House concerned will keep the motion pending and constitute a three-member committee for “the purpose of making an investigation into the grounds on which the removal of a judge is prayed for”.The committee will comprise either the CJI or a judge of the SC, an HC chief justice and a distinguished jurist. The committee will then frame charges against the judge concerned. “Such charges, together with a statement of the grounds on which each such charge is based, shall be communicated to the judge and he shall be given a reasonable opportunity of presenting a written statement of defence within such time as may be specified in this behalf by the committee,” the Act provides.Section 4 of the Act provides, “The committee shall have power to regulate its own procedure in making the investigation and shall give a reasonable opportunity to the judge of cross-examining witnesses, adducing evidence and of being heard in his defence.” The committee, after conclusion of the investigation, will present a report to the head of the House concerned where the motion for removal is pending.If the report finds the judge ‘not guilty’, then no further steps will be taken, and the motion will be treated as infructuous. If the report finds the judge guilty, then the head of the House will lay the report before the House as soon as possible and the House will take up the motion for removal for debate.The motion will then have to be passed by each House, supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than twothirds of the members of the House present and voting.It will then be presented to the President for removal of the judge. A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion, and in Lok Sabha if 100 or more MPs agree to put their signatures to it","A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion.

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Wednesday approved extension of a national highway project in Andhra Pradesh and two multi-tracking of railway corridors in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, entailing a total investment of more than Rs 7,000 crore to push infrastructure development in the country.While the new four-lane 108-km Badvel-Nellore highway project will improve connectivity to Krishnapatnam port in Andhra, the multi-tracking of railway lines - Ratlam-Nagda and Wardha-Balharshah - will decongest East-West and North-South rail corridors, particularly for trains heading towards Mumbai.Announcing the decisions, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the four-lane Badvel-Nellore corridor on NH-67 would be taken up on public private partnership mode. This will provide connectivity to crucial nodes in the three industrial corridors of Andhra Pradesh - Kopparthy node on the Vishakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor, Orvakal node on Hyderabad-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor and Krishnapatnam node on Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. The corridor will reduce the distance to Krishanpatnam port by around 40 km compared to the existing Badvel-Nellore road and cut travel time by an hour.On the railway expansion projects, Vaishnaw said the 3rd and 4th line on the Ratlam-Nagda route and 4th line on the Wardha-Balharshah route, covering four districts in MP and Maharashtra would increase the existing network of Indian Railways. ""Bottlenecks on the Ratlam-Nagda and Wardha-Balharshah routes will be eased, resulting in movement of more passenger trains as the track availability will increase,"" he said.Vaishnaw said projects worth more than Rs 4.5 lakh crore had been approved in the transport and infrastructure sector during the third term of Modi government.","Cabinet approves extension of a national highway project in Andhra Pradesh.

'Limit to political desperation': BJP wades into Congress crossfire as Udit Raj targets Shashi Tharoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/limit-to-political-desperation-bjp-wades-into-congress-crossfire-as-udit-raj-targets-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/121477025.cms,"Udit Raj (L), Shashi Tharoor (C) and Kiren Rijiju (R)

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions within the Congress party, the BJP has rallied around opposition MP Shashi Tharoor, who is facing criticism from his own colleagues over remarks made during an international delegation visit.Tharoor’s statements lauding India’s recent counterterror strikes have sparked sharp reactions from fellow Congress leader Udit Raj, prompting BJP leaders to question the Congress’s stance on national interest.Union minister Kiren Rijiju took to X on Wednesday to condemn the grand old party, responding to Udit Raj’s criticism of Tharoor. Sharing a video, Rijiju questioned the party's priorities: “Congress ka haath kiske sath? Kya Congress party mein desh ke liye bolna mana hai?” he posted in Hindi.“We Indians must speak in one voice in crucial time at least,” he added.In another post, Rijiju intensified his criticism, “What does the Congress party want & how much they really care for the country? Should the Indian MPs go to foreign nation and speak against India and its Prime Minister? There’s limit to political desperation!”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla echoed Rijiju’s sentiments, alleging that Congress leader Udit Raj was targeting Tharoor under the influence of Rahul Gandhi.He framed the row as a case of internal sabotage. “Shashi Tharoor is being attacked at the behest of Rahul Gandhi because Shashi Tharoor kept India first not (Gandhi) family. He talked about national interest, not his party’s interest. He is being attacked because he kept national policy above the vote bank (politics),” Poonawalla told PTI.He accused the Congress of hypocrisy: asserting support for the armed forces in an all-party meeting, while launching “missiles at its own leader” abroad.“The Congress, which is launching missiles at its own leader, won’t say a word against Pakistan,” he said.The row stems from Tharoor’s recent remarks during an official address in Panama, where he was representing India as part of a multi-party delegation. Tharoor spoke about India’s evolving counter-terrorism posture, referencing key military operations.“What has changed in recent years is that the terrorists have also realised they will have a price to pay; on that, let there be no doubt. When, for the first time, India breached the Line of Control between India and Pakistan to conduct a surgical strike on a terror base, a launch pad – the Uri strike in September 2015. That was already something we had not done before. Even during the Kargil War, we had not crossed the Line of Control; in Uri, we did, and then came the attack in Pulwama in January 2019. This time, we crossed not only the Line of Control but also the international border, and we struck the terrorist headquarters in Balakot. This time, we have gone beyond both of those. We have not only gone beyond the Line of Control and the international border. We have struck at the Punjabi heartland of Pakistan by hitting terror bases, training centres, and terror headquarters in nine places,” Tharoor said.Udit Raj, however, took serious objection, accusing Tharoor of undermining the Congress’s legacy. “How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LOC and the international border?” Raj posted on X.He pointed to India’s military actions during the 1965 and 1971 wars, as well as strikes under the UPA, to challenge Tharoor’s narrative. “Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has become the super spokesperson of the BJP, speaking in favour of PM Modi and his government,” Raj told ANI.As the rift widens, Tharoor finds himself caught between praise from political opponents and rebuke from within his own party.Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor, is currently leading an all-party delegation to countries in Americas for Centre's resolve of global outreach of India's recent counterterror Operation Sindoor.",Opposition MP Shashi Tharoor is facing criticism from his own colleagues.

44 MLAs ready to form Manipur government: NDA group to governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/44-mlas-ready-to-form-manipur-government-nda-group-to-governor/articleshow/121475600.cms,"Photo/Agencies

BJP brass will decide on govt formation: Manipur MLA

IMPHAL: A group of 10 MLAs led by BJP's Thokchom Radheshyam met Manipur governor Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday to convey their readiness to form a govt in the state which has been under President's Rule since Feb.The group claimed support of 44 NDA legislators. Independent MLA Sapam Nishikant Singh spoke in the same vein.The 44 MLAs mentioned by Radheyshyam include 30 of 37 BJP legislators, including former CM N Biren Singh; six NPP MLAs; all five NPF MLAs; the lone JD(U) MLA; and two of three Independents. The seven remaining BJP legislators, two Kuki People's Alliance members and one Independent, all belonging to the Kuki-Zo community, are not part of this group.The 60-member Manipur assembly currently has 59 MLAs, with one seat vacant due to the death N Kayisii, who represented Tadubi constituency. Opposition Congress has five members.While BJP refrained from commenting on the development, there were indications that the group of 10 could not have acted unilaterally.Manipur has been under President's Rule since Feb after Biren Singh resigned as CM amid criticism about his govt's handling of the ethnic clashes between Meiteis and Kuki-Zos.The assembly, which has been under suspended animation, can be revived any time before the current spell of President's Rule expires on Aug 13, should BJP decide to form another govt.Radheshyam was vague on whether the initiative for the meeting with the governor had been sanctioned by the BJP brass. ""The central leadership of BJP will take the decision,"" he quipped.Significantly, he revealed that Speaker Thokchom Satyabrata Singh has ""individually and jointly"" sounded the 44 MLAs and that there is no one who opposes the formation of a new govt. ""We are ready to stake a claim to form a govt,"" he added.""People have faced so my hardships. In the previous term, two years were lost due to Covid, and in this term, another two years have been lost due to the conflict,"" said Radheshyam, emphasising the need for the return of a political dispensation in Imphal.The development comes amid intense protests in the Imphal Valley over an order by security forces to conceal the state's name - Manipur - on the windshield of a govt bus.Meitei groups demanded an official apology from the governor over the incident that happened in Gwaltabi on May 20, and the resignation of the chief secretary, the DGP and the security adviser.More than 250 people have died since the ethnic strife broke out on May 3, 2023, in the state. Meitei groups maintain that the territorial integrity of the state is non-negotiable in any peace process, while the Kuki-Zos assert that the only solution to resolve the crisis is creating a separate administration for the hill districts where they live.","A group of 10 MLAs led by BJP's Thokchom Radheshyam met Manipur governor Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26.

Lessons beyond the classroom

Advice that breaks the mold



Eyes on the stars, feet on the ground

The academic world constantly flaunts “quantity” and the number of hours studied ostentatiously. But here’s a topper who stole the spotlight not only for his exceptional performance in the CBSE Class 10 board exams, but also for his not-so-followed study strategy. Meet Rudra Pratap Singh , a student of Stone Ridge International School, Rudrapur, who secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams. His secret to success? Consistency and smart work. Shattering all the age-old adages that equate long hours with high scores, Rudra said: “I studied for just two hours a day.”At first glance, Rudra’s story seems like one of prodigious intellect. But a deeper conversation reveals something more universal and profoundly human—a story of clarity, self-discipline, and purpose-driven learning, all while shouldering responsibilities that transcend far beyond textbooks.From training with NASA and ISRO under their Young Scientist and Citizen Science programmes to interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during government-led youth initiatives, Rudra’s resume reads like a page out of an adult professional’s LinkedIn profile.“I’ve worked with the Ministry of Youth Affairs for programmes like Viksit Bharat and Leaders Dialogue,” he said. He also holds certifications in astrophysics from IIT Kanpur and IIT Bhubaneswar, and serves as a Brand Ambassador for KIIT University, Russia.At such a young age, Singh has earmarked his name as the world record-holding author, certified by the World Record Committee (USA) as the youngest writer of juvenile fiction. He perceives this as part of a larger mission. “I’m advocating for youth welfare, teen upliftment, and mental health activism,” he says with the composure of someone twice his age.So what is the secret behind a teenager with international commitments and so many other feathers in his cap finding time to top the board exams?It isn’t something very typical, nor something entirely different, Rudra says—“just prioritisation and consistency.”He didn't believe in marathon study sessions. “Quality over quantity—I never went beyond two hours a day. But I made sure those two hours were fully focused. I broke large tasks into smaller ones and checked them off daily.”Rudra admits to feeling demotivated several times during the journey. “Sometimes I wondered if two hours were enough,” he said. “But then my inner voice reminded me—you’ve made a promise to yourself and to the people who believe in you. That belief became my fuel.”Rudra’s love for learning isn’t confined to math or science. “I’ve always loved social sciences,” he said. His interests in geopolitics and climate science saw him working with Oxford Academy and participating in the UN Climate Science Olympiad. He’s also been a member of the United Nations World Parliament.He allocated separate time for each subject. “I gave 45 minutes each to English, Hindi, and Social Science, and a bit more to Mathematics because solving problems requires practice,” Rudra says. He made sure he was gaining conceptual clarity in every subject.Like every success story, Rudra’s too has its cornerstone. “My family, my teachers, and the environment around me,” he says without a pause. “There were times when my parents believed in me more than I believed in myself.”He credits his online mentors at PhysicsWallah for helping him build strong conceptual clarity and appreciates the flexibility that digital learning offers. “When we study online, we must show our face to the teacher—not just out of respect, but to stay accountable to ourselves.”For someone his age, Rudra is remarkably self-aware. “Motivation is temporary, but when discipline becomes your motivation, it stays.”Rudra’s message to juniors is both enriching and grounded in experience. “People told me, ‘To top CBSE, you have to study more.’ I wanted to prove them wrong—that even with just two hours of focused study a day, it’s possible. And I did.”But here’s the catch: “It only works if you’re consistent, humble, and willing to learn from others. Don’t be overconfident. Learn from your mistakes—and better still, from others’.”He also doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the pressure that comes with expectations. “In some internal exams, I missed two or three questions. It shook me. But I adapted—reduced my time on social media, focused on weak spots, and reminded myself why I began.”Currently in Class 11, Rudra is focused on the PCM stream, but his ambitions are far broader than just cracking an entrance exam. Whether it’s working with ISRO again, continuing his writing, or influencing youth policies, Rudra sees learning as a lifelong journey, not a series of marksheets.And as he moves forward, the lesson he leaves behind is a compelling one—you don’t need long hours, you need deep intent.In an age where academic excellence is too often equated with burnout, Thakur Rudra Pratap Singh stands as proof that with purpose, even two hours a day is enough to chase the stars—and catch them.",Rudra Pratap Singh secured 499 out of 500 marks in the CBSE Class 10 exams.

The operation was a response to the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians.India's counter-attack prompted Pakistan to launch its strikes on Indian military sites and urban areas. In response, India hit at least nine Pakistani air bases, including radar and air defence units.

Vajpayee Called Indira Durga: Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Slams Rahul Gandhi's Remarks on Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress on Wednesday indulged in a political slugfest after one Sena (UBT) leader vowed to blacken Rahul Gandhi 's face for his 'derogatory' comments about freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.Nashik city unit chief of Sena (UBT), Bala Darade, slammed Rahul for calling Savarkar 'mafi-veer' and said that he will pelt stones at Congress leaders' convoy if he ever visits Nashik.""We are proud that we live in the birthplace of Swatantrya-veer Savarkar. Rahul Gandhi's statement about Savarkar, calling him 'Mafi-veer', was insulting,"" Darade told a Marathi news channel on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the Hindutva ideologue.""We condemn it strongly. We will blacken Rahul Gandhi's face if he comes to Nashik. If we cannot do that, we will pelt stones at his convoy,"" he added.Nashik-resident Devendra Bhutada has filed a defamation case against Gandhi, claiming that some remarks made by the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha against Savarkar hurt his feelings.Darade further said he did not care about the consequences of his threat for the MVA.Meanwhile, Sena (UBT) spokesperson Sushma Andhare claimed that Darade's views were his own and not the official stand of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party.Congress, however, strongly objected to Darade's remarks and said that Congress workers are capable enough of tackling such threats.""Rahul Gandhi's father, late Rajiv Gandhi, and grandmother, late Indira Gandhi, sacrificed their lives for India's unity. Congress and its leadership are not afraid of such threats,"" he told reporters. ""Rahul Gandhi did not make derogatory remarks against Savarkar,"" Congress Maharashtra unit chief Harshwardhan Sapkal said.""His comments contain historical references. Even (journalist and writer) Arun Shourie, a minister in the Vajpayee government, has written a book on Savarkar, and most references in that book are what Rahul Gandhi has said.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday refuted Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma 's allegations regarding his British wife Elizabeth Colburn's alleged connection with Pakistan’s ISI, calling it the “plot of a C-grade Bollywood movie.”In his first public statement on the matter, Gogoi clarified that his wife spent only one year in Pakistan in 2013 while working on an international project focused on climate change in South Asia.“About 14–15 years ago, my wife — a well-known expert in public policy — was involved in an international initiative addressing climate change in South Asia. As part of that work, she spent a year in Pakistan and then came to India in 2012–13, where she has been working ever since. In 2015, she took up a new job,” the Congress leader said.“I accompanied her in 2013, about 12 years ago. The chief minister is trying to turn this into a C-grade Bollywood movie with a so-called release date of September 10. This story is bound to be a complete flop. The people of Assam are already aware of the truth,” he added.Gogoi also raised questions about the timing and intent behind the allegations.“Our counter-question is this: if, according to these accusations, my wife or I committed any wrongdoing or illegal act, then who has been in power for the last 11–12 years? What have the central agencies been doing all this time? Everyone knows the level of scrutiny involved when someone crosses a national border — whether entering or exiting,” Gogoi said.“As a leader of the opposition who speaks boldly and openly in Parliament, my biodata is known to everyone,” he added.Reacting to Gogoi’s remarks, chief minister Sarma welcomed the Congress MP’s “admission” and claimed that credible evidence supports allegations of Gogoi's ties with the Pakistani establishment.“Finally, Congress MP Shri Gaurav Gogoi has admitted that he visited Pakistan. But let us be very clear — this is just the beginning, not the end,” Sarma wrote on X.“What lies ahead is far more serious. There exists every reasonable ground, supported by credible inputs and documented information, to suggest that Shri Gogoi has maintained proximity with the Pakistani establishment. The Government of Assam, committed to transparency and accountability, will make everything public on September 10, once the Special Investigation Team (SIT) concludes its comprehensive inquiry. The people of Assam and the nation deserve the truth — and they shall have it in full,” he added.“But the people will also not forget — nor forgive — the Congress party and Shri Rahul Gandhi for deliberately promoting such a dangerous and compromised individual into the public life of our country,"" Sarma added.During a press conference, later in the day, Sarma claimed that Gogoi is a ""Pakistani agent"" and his wife maintain close ties with its establishment.""Whatever he (Gaurav Gogoi) has revealed is only 10 per cent. He and his wife are deeply involved in anti-India activities. His son was born in India and later got British citizenship. He surrendered his son's Indian passport there are very serious allegations. I have documents to prove his wife's involvement in collecting Indian Intelligence input. I will reveal details on September 10,"" Sarma said.""The entire point was to dethrone Bhupen Borah. He (Gogoi) could have admitted that before his appointment. He is very smart. He knows that he has to admit. So, he admitted after taking the appointment letter as a Congress president. But today also he made a very wrong statement. His Pakistan visit had nothing to do with his wife. That was an independent visit with the approval of Interior Department of Pakistan. This is about national security, about Bharat. This has nothing to do with elections. His wife was snooping on our IB. I have documents to prove that. It was all because of taking advantage of Tarun Gogoi's position. They crafted their role within Indian establishment. It was snooping on behalf of a particular climate activist group,"" he added.This come days after Sarma alleged that Gogoi visited Pakistan on the “ISI’s invitation” and worked closely with the establishment.Sarma had claimed, “Gaurav Gogoi visited Pakistan on an invitation from the ISI. This is the first time I’m publicly stating this. We have documents to support it. He did not go there for tourism. He went there to receive training.”He added that Gogoi, who is the deputy leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, traveled on a direct invitation from the Pakistani government, calling the visit “dangerous.”“He was working closely with the Pakistan establishment. When does a Home Department issue an invitation? Only to impart training,” Sarma asserted. “An invitation from the foreign affairs department or a university is an entirely different matter. This was not from the foreign ministry or cultural department. He went on a direct invitation from Pakistan’s Home Department,” he claimed.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claims Gaurav Gogoi is a ""Pakistani agent"" and his wife maintain close ties with its establishment.

NEW DELHI: In the biggest-ever exercise relating to appointments and transfers in constitutional courts, the 5-judge Supreme Court collegium led by CJI B R Gavai on Monday presented a long list of recommendations to the Union govt - to appoint three new SC judges and five new HC chief justices, and to transfer four CJs and 22 HC judges.The collegium, also comprising Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, J K Maheshwari and B V Nagarathna, completed the big exercise in a five-hour meeting Monday afternoon. Karnataka HC CJ N V Anjaria (parent HC Gujarat), Gauhati HC Chief Justice Vijay Bishnoi (parent HC Rajasthan) and Bombay HC's Justice Atul S Chandurkar have been recommended for appointment as SC judges.The collegium examined the seniority, merit and suitability of nearly 30 shortlisted HC judges and found these three judges meritorious, suitable as well as senior enough to be appointed as judges of the SC, which has 30 judges, including the CJI, against a sanctioned strength of 33.The collegium recommended the appointment of Delhi HC's Justice Vibhu Bhakru as chief justice of Karnataka, a post which will fall vacant on appointment of Justice Anjaria as SC judge. It decided to appoint Justice Vipul Pancholi (parent HC Gujarat) as CJ of Patna HC which he joined in 2023 upon transfer.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, who was transferred from Delhi high court to Madhya Pradesh high court in May 2024, has been recommended to be appointed as CJ of that high court.Chief Justice Suresh K Kait (parent HC Delhi) recently retired from the post.Justice Ashutosh Kumar of Patna high court was recommended for appointment as CJ of Gauhati HC, a post which will fall vacant on Justice Bishnoi's appointment as an SC judge.

Justice Anjaria was appointed as a judge of Gujarat HC on Nov 21, 2011, and took oath as CJ of Karnataka HC on February 25, 2024.Justice Bishnoi was appointed as judge of Rajasthan HC on Jan 8, 2013, and became CJ of Gauhati HC on Feb 5, 2024.

Congress ups the ante



How government has responded



NEW DELHI: ""If terrorism is a rabid dog, Pakistan is its vile handler. We must first unite the world to tackle this wild handler—else it will continue to breed more rabid dogs,"" boomed TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee ’s emotional voice to thunderous applause from the Indian diaspora in Tokyo.The rest of Abhishek's speech was in sync with what the government has repeatedly reiterated. He said Pakistan was given ample time to clean its house, and when it refused to act, India — “honourable in action” — decimated nine terror establishments across the border without harming civilian infrastructure.Abhishek's succinct portrayal of India’s modus operandi to the global community has been eclipsed only by Shashi Tharoor in the opposition ranks, who not only took Pakistan to the cleaners but, in his suave manner, blasted Donald Trump’s repeated hyphenation of India-Pakistan and his boastful claim of using trade as leverage to broker peace.Tharoor's jab at “gentleman” Trump may have earned him further plaudits among a growing mass of admirers, but Congress is unlikely to gain political brownie points from it. Its barely hidden contempt for Tharoor’s freewheeling, independent stance, evident in not nominating him for the all-party meet is another example of an organisation that has failed to read the room and has shown strategic tone-deafness. Congress, despite its diplomatic pedigree, missed an opportunity to leverage its best communicator on foreign soil.As a former Under-Secretary-General of the UN and MoS MEA, Tharoor holds elite credentials to lucidly elucidate India’s stance on terror, and not nominating the four-time MP is certainly not a fair assessment of his skillset.Incidentally, the government had sought to overrule both Congress and TMC in nominating leaders of its choice. In TMC's case, in the absence of the ailing Sudip Banerjee, it nominated Yusuf Pathan , while Tharoor was incidentally named as head of the group visiting the US and four other countries. While TMC put its foot down and insisted on selecting its own representative, eventually ensuring that Abhishek Banerjee flew to Tokyo, Congress neither managed to persuade the ruling dispensation nor dissuade Tharoor from leading the delegation.Even in domestic optics, Congress appears to be trailing. Regarding the visit to Poonch, Congress seems to have taken a leaf out of TMC’s book. According to J&K CM Omar Abdullah, it was the TMC that initiated the process of visiting Poonch, which bore the brunt of Pakistan’s barbarism during Operation Sindoor , leading to the deaths of innocent civilians.Abhishek Banerjee visiting Rash Behari Bose's grave in Tokyo, a key aide of Netaji, has resonated with Bengali nationalists. Taking cue from Abhishek, the rest of the delegation, along with the Indian ambassador, went to pay their respects, which TMC touted as “Bengal showing the way.”Netaji's grandnephew Chandra Bose, too, praised Abhishek Banerjee for visiting the historic site. When contacted by the Times of India, former BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose was emphatic that this is the time for national unity and that TMC is doing what any responsible party should do. He hoped that Congress too would mellow its belligerence and keep all the probing questions for a later day, probably once Parliament is in session. His impassioned plea to all political parties is to maintain communal harmony and not be swayed by the evil designs of the Pahalgam terrorists.Professor Sibaji Pratim Basu believes there is more than meets the eye in TMC's extremely well-calibrated stance post-Operation Sindoor. He argues that with assembly elections due in Bengal in a year, the party is in no mood to put a foot wrong. However, once the election draws closer, TMC may well tighten the screws on the BJP, questioning why the government didn’t go for the jugular and attempt to take PoK. The likes of Madhya Pradesh BJP minister Vijay Shah passing disparaging comments against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi will also be raised before the appropriate electorate, Basu believes.As for Congress, he contends that the party is willing to play hardball because this year is relatively election-free until the end — and in any case, it isn’t a major player in Bihar. According to him, the lack of effective messaging remains the biggest flaw in Rahul Gandhi ’s political playbook. The fact that Shashi Tharoor has provided a ringing endorsement of India’s policy regarding Operation Sindoor, Basu predicts, will be used by the BJP to blunt the pointed queries of the grand old party in Parliament.Political analyst Professor Subhamoy Maitra looks at TMC's strategy through a critical lens. He believes TMC is a party that isn’t ideologically driven. It operates through meticulous political planning in an opportunistic fashion. Maitra minces no words and calls TMC a “political chameleon” — hawkish on foreign policy one day, repositioning itself as a peacenik the next, if the situation demands. According to the veteran analyst, TMC, assured of a lion’s share of the minority vote, is now also trying to make the right noises for the majority community ahead of the assembly election next year.Maitra believes Abhishek Banerjee's visit hits the mark politically, but can’t help wondering if the entire episode — from Yusuf Pathan’s withdrawal to the TMC general secretary stepping in — was a well-coordinated political stunt. As for Congress, Professor Maitra believes the grand old party is staying true to its centrist roots and is therefore shying away from completely mirroring the BJP on a national security issue. He infers that the party is merely leveraging the lack of transparency in the India–US equation.Professor Basu and many others believe TMC has learnt from past missteps. After the Pulwama attack, Mamata Banerjee had taken a controversial stance by asking for proof of India’s assault on Balakot. It didn’t play out well with the masses, and the BJP had a field day branding her anti-national. At a 2019 election rally in Kolkata, PM Modi said, “Kolkata’s Didi was more pained than people in Islamabad and Rawalpindi…Leaders of the mahagathbandhan...shouted so much that they became heroes in Pakistan.”Politics is often driven by narrative — and that’s where TMC had failed to read the tea leaves post-Balakot. Other opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, who campaigned hard on alleged corruption in the Rafale deal, were humbled in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The BJP, surprisingly, delivered its best-ever performance in Bengal, winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats.From the clarion call to annex PoK to Abhishek’s pointed “rabid dog” analogy, TMC is eager to match the BJP’s fervent nationalistic pitch. Congress, on the other hand, after a muted response during Operation Sindoor, has upped the political ante. Its sharp attack on S Jaishankar for what felt like a clearly out-of-context comment has baffled many. Congress leader Pawan Khera has already referred to Jaishankar as Jaichand, the medieval ruler who helped “outsider” Muhammad Ghori defeat Prithviraj Chauhan.Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi has posted on X calling the External Affairs Minister “JJ,” posing three questions and claiming “India’s foreign policy has collapsed.” While what “JJ” means is open to interpretation, the phrasing of the questions virtually endorses Trump’s assertions about brokering peace.Sure, the government should clarify Trump’s claims, and when asked on foreign soil, Jaishankar cheekily said, “The US was in the United States” during Operation Sindoor. Tharoor again rightly dissected Trump’s logic, exposing its transactional underbelly and performative bravado. But the rest of Congress seems more interested in scoring quick hits than crafting a coherent foreign policy stance.As for the accusation that Jaishankar informed Pakistan in advance, even P Chidambaram has responded in guarded fashion. He told Indian Express that Rahul Gandhi rightly asked, and the MEA has clarified, hence, “I have no further comment.” Where Congress could have genuinely grilled the government was on why the Pahalgam attackers haven’t been caught even after a month, or how the attack was allowed to happen in the first place. Instead, it went off-script, launching personal tirades — a risky strategy at a time when the nation appears united behind Operation Sindoor.Jaishankar, on his part, has clarified in the Consultative Committee of Parliament that Pakistan was only informed after India had hit the terror targets. According to sources, he also cleared the air on Trump’s mediation claims, stating emphatically that the ceasefire was initiated solely through bilateral discussion after Pakistan reached out. Congress sources, however, maintain that they are not fully satisfied with the explanation provided.PM Modi, too, speaking from his home state, indirectly addressed Trump’s claim, stating that it was Pakistan that couldn’t bear India’s military onslaught and waved the white flag. Appealing to the good sense of Pakistani citizens, he urged them to remove their country from the clutches of terrorism. If the red lines are crossed,""the bullets are ready,” came the dire warning.It remains to be seen how Congress responds to this emphatic assertion from PM Modi about how events unfolded during Operation Sindoor. So far, Congress’s messaging has appeared muddled and misdirected, a sharp contrast to its INDIA ally, TMC. The likes of Alka Lamba’s gaffe, calling Operation Sindoor “Operation Blue Star,” have certainly not helped its cause. There may still be time to course-correct, but for now, TMC has emerged as the craftier and more calibrated opposition.In a year where perception may outweigh ideology, the real contest may be between message discipline and narrative drift.","Congress missed an opportunity to leverage its best communicator on foreign soil, writes Sibaji Pratim Basu. Basu: TMC may well tighten the screws on the government once the election draws closer. The likes of Madhya Pradesh BJP minister Vijay Shah are questioning why the government didn’t go for the jugular.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121462096,imgsize-1160317,width-400,resizemode-4/121462096.jpg"

Poll Should India collaborate with international partners for the AMCA project? Yes, it can enhance technology sharing No, we should develop independently

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday green-lighted the 'Made in India' fighter jet programme to produce a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities to bolster its air power.The AMCA, along with the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), is expected to form the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the coming decades.""In a significant push towards enhancing India's indigenous defence capabilities and fostering a robust domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) Programme Execution Model,"" the ministry of defence said.The ministry added that private sector companies are invited to participate in the project.""They can bid either independently or as a joint venture or as consortia. The entity/bidder should be an Indian company compliant with the laws and regulations of the country,"" the ministry said in a statement.The development also comes amid heightened tensions with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor which claimed over 100 terrorists.The government has focused on enhancing India’s air power, especially in light of China's rapid advancements in the domain.Meanwhile, China now accounts for over 80% of Pakistan's arms imports.A recent US intelligence report claimed that Pakistan is the ""primary recipient"" of China’s economic and military generosity and foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's armed forces are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China.""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. However, terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects has emerged as a point of friction between the countries; seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024,"" it added.Also read: Why India is fighting a Pakistan armed by China ""Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China’s economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China’s PLA, including a new air exercise completed in November 2024,"" the report said.Last year, the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, granted in-principle approval to the AMCA programme. The indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet project is expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening the IAF’s combat capabilities.The estimated development cost of the AMCA project stands at approximately Rs 15,000 crore.The IAF has long advocated for the AMCA programme, given its long-term strategic requirements and the absence of a fifth-generation fighter jet in its current fleet. In contrast, China has already inducted its Chengdu J-20 jets, which it claims to be fifth-generation air superiority fighters with precision strike capabilities.India’s confidence in the AMCA initiative received a major boost following the successful development of the LCA Tejas.Developed by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Tejas has proven to be a capable platform for air combat and offensive missions, with secondary roles in reconnaissance and anti-ship operations.Meanwhile, the IAF is also in the process of acquiring 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) to enhance its operational readiness. In April 2019, the IAF issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement, estimated at around USD 18 billion. The MRFA deal is considered one of the largest military procurement programmes globally in recent years.","India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities.

NAINITAL: To address Nainital's parking crisis, MHA Wednesday issued formal directives allocating the premises of the Metropole Hotel to the Uttarakhand government for temporary use as a parking facility.Built in 1880, the hotel once belonged to the Raja of Mehmoodabad, who migrated to Pakistan. A luxury destination in its prime, it famously hosted figures such as Pakistan's founding father, Mohd Ali Jinnah, who spent his honeymoon there. It was designated 'enemy property' in the early 1960s.MHA's decision follows a request by CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, who cited the town's acute parking shortage and proposed using the hotel's expansive grounds, capable of accommodating over 1,000 vehicles, for public parking. According to a state govt communique, home minister Amit Shah responded positively, confirming MHA's approval in an official letter to the CM. Thanking Shah, Dhami said the move would ""significantly ease traffic congestion and improve logistical convenience in the region. ""Spread over 10 acres, the once-celebrated property had fallen into disrepair after being declared enemy property, with encroachers gradually occupying its open land. In 2023, around 134 families were evicted following Supreme Court orders.In Oct last year, the custodian office of enemy properties under MHA had issued a temporary No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the Nainital district magistrate, allowing surface parking on an ad-hoc basis.","The Metropole Hotel was designated 'enemy property' in the early 1960s.

A voyage of grit: From riding bikes to becoming circumnavigators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-voyage-of-grit-from-riding-bikes-to-becoming-circumnavigators/articleshow/121474746.cms,"Lt Commanders Roopa (left) and Dilna will sail into Goa’s Mormugao Port on Thursday evening, marking the end of a historic, eight-month-long voyage

Panaji: As a child, Dilna K was afraid of heights. Today, she climbs the INSV Tarini's 25-metre-high mast in the middle of the ocean. In Puducherry, another family watches with similar awe as Roopa Alagirisamy, once a girl with dreams of space, returns after conquering the world's oceans. The two naval officers - Lt Commanders Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy - will sail into Mormugao Port on Thursday evening, marking the end of a historic, eight-month-long voyage. Their journey covered 25,400 nautical miles, crossing four oceans and rounding the three Great Capes - a feat attempted by few, and achieved by fewer. Though they grew up on opposite sides of the Anaimalai Hills, what binds them is a relentless grit - a refusal to accept ceilings, whether on land or at sea.From the age of 10, Dilna was never one to be found indoors. While other children studied for tests, she was outdoors - wielding a cricket bat with the boys from her colony or chasing football down dusty lanes. ""She found her passion for rifle shooting in NCC and became a national shooter. Shooting is expensive, she always had to compromise on training and good equipment. I remember her travelling from Kozhikode to Idukki almost every two weeks to practice at a good range,"" Dilna's sister Deepthi said.Before her father, an Army man, passed away in 2015, Dilna made a promise that she would represent India at the international level. On Thursday, as Tarini sails into Mormugao Port, she brings that promise home. Dilna had always been a daddy's girl and still rides her father's Royal Enfield as an ode to him.""She used to pull out 100 buckets of water per day from our well as a young girl to build up her muscles and we used to make fun of her. She would climb coconut trees to develop agility, even though she was scared of heights,"" said Deepthi.Like Dilna, Roopa's journey was shaped by setbacks, and a stubborn refusal to give up. Roopa grew up dreaming of space. With a BE in aeronautical engineering, she even worked a stint with the National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru. But her true launchpad came from the Navy. ""Roopa faced so many SSB interviews. It felt like she was going in circles,"" said her younger sister Durga Monica. ""She decided to make one final attempt. And cleared it.""After being commissioned in June 2017, Roopa's job at the Naval Armament Inspection division in Mumbai required her to inspect weapons, guns, rocket launchers and torpedoes that went into warships and submarines. It is here that she picked up sailing, first as a dinghy sailor and then in competitive sailing. ""She never wanted an ordinary life, with a 9-5 job. She wanted something that others would not do,"" said Monica. ""If you give Roopa an opportunity, she will grab it and there is nothing that will stop her.""Whether it was bungee jumping or her decision to take up surfing, the Alagirisamys had no inkling of Roopa's adventurous streak. ""Nobody knows truth about when she volunteered for sailing in the circumnavigation. She never told any of this to us,"" said Monica, laughing.Behind the Tarini's voyage are two stories of persistence, parallel, yet bound by the same wind.Roopa and Dilna's journey echoes the trail first charted by INSV Tarini's all-women crew in 2018. In 2024, Roopa and Dilna made it their own.","Lt Commanders Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy will sail into Goa’s Mormugao Port on Thursday evening.

JAISALMER: A state government employee was detained on Wednesday in Rajasthan on suspicion of spying for Pakistan's spy agency ISI amid a widening crackdown on espionage networks across the country after Operation Sindoor.Sakur Khan Mangaliyar, employed with the state's employment department, was picked up by a joint team of CID and intelligence agencies from his office in Jaisalmer. Mangaliyar is expected to be transferred to Jaipur for further questioning.Authorities are also probing a suspected connection between Mangaliyar and a senior Congress politician from the border region. Security agencies have withheld comment on political links. Sources said Mangaliyar served as a personal assistant to a Congress functionary during the previous Congress-led state govt.Mangaliyar, a resident of Mangaliya's Dhani in Baroda village near the Pakistan border, had been under surveillance for several weeks. Investigators found multiple Pakistani phone numbers in his mobile device and reported that he could not provide credible explanations. He also admitted to traveling to Pakistan at least seven times in recent years, raising further concerns.SP Sudhir Chaudhary said the inquiry began following alerts from ""higher headquarters"" over suspicious activities. ""We are verifying all facts and conducting an inquiry,"" he added.Though no military-related photos or videos were found on his phone, officials said several files had been deleted. Two bank accounts under his name are currently under scrutiny. Intelligence sources revealed possible links between Mangaliyar and an official in Pakistan's embassy, suggesting coordination with ISI handlers.His detention follows a string of arrests across Punjab and Haryana connected to spying for Pakistan. Since May 7, when India launched Operation Sindoor in response to the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, at least seven suspects have been arrested in espionage-related cases in the two states.Among them is Hisar-based travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra, accused of passing sensitive data to Pakistani handlers. On May 11, Punjab police arrested two people in Malerkotla. Haryana police detained two on May 13 and May 15. Two people working inside Bathinda military station were held on May 7 and May 14 on similar charges.","Sakur Khan Mangaliyar, employed with the state's employment department, was picked up by a joint team of CID and intelligence agencies.

Rahiman died on the spot, while Shafi is in ICU.The FIR names 15 people, two of whom were identified as Deepak and Sumith. Shafi told police the assailants were known to him and Rahiman. Mohammad Nisar, a fellow driver who filed the police complaint, said: ""While we were unloading sand ... about 15 people carrying swords, machetes and rods attacked Rahiman, who was in the driver's seat. When Shafi intervened, he too was assaulted.""The victim was laid to rest Wednesday amid tight security.His funeral procession drew a massive crowd, bringing traffic to a standstill.

NEW DELHI: The S-400 system and the jointly-manufactured BrahMos missiles were used by India in the conflict with Pakistan and their performance was exemplary, said Russian ambassador Denis Alipov. The ambassador also said that discussions between India and Russia on the procurement of more S-400 air defence system units are ""ongoing"" as both countries continue to solidify the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership.""From what we know, India has clearly stated the goals and undertook actions after having identified the targets and the terrorists it promised to do.

While India maintained that it had only hit terrorist camps and its actions on May 7 were non-escalatory, Pakistan chose to launch a military operation against India three days later that was rebuffed by Indian armed forces.India has longstanding and wide-ranging cooperation with Russia in the field of defence.

We are very satisfied with the results of this collaboration. It has very promising prospects.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave interim bail to a 23-year-old accused of raping a 40-year-old, noting that charges had not been framed even though he had been in jail for nine months. In scathing comments, a bench comprising Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma also asked how Delhi Police could file a rape case against the man, a social media influencer, when the woman had gone voluntarily with him.""A single hand can't clap. On what basis have you filed case under Section 376 of IPC. She is not a baby. The woman is 40 years old. They have gone together to Jammu. Why have you invoked 376. This lady goes to Jammu seven times and the husband is not bothered,"" the bench observed. It directed that the accused be produced before the trial court and granted interim bail subject to terms and conditions.According to the police complaint, the woman first came into contact with him in 2021 through social media while seeking a social media influencer to promote her clothing brand. During initial interactions, the accused allegedly requested an iPhone to enhance content creation, which she arranged through an authorised Apple Store in Jammu.However, their professional relationship soured after the accused attempted to resell the device.In December 2021, the man visited the woman at her house in Noida to return the Rs 20,000. He subsequently persuaded her to travel for a brand shoot in Connaught Place. During the journey, the accused allegedly gave her sweets laced with intoxicants and she lost consciousness. Contrary to assurances that she would be taken to Hindu Rao Hospital, the man allegedly took her to a secluded area, sexually assaulted her, stole money from her purse, and captured her nude photographs. Thereafter, the woman was allegedly coerced into travelling to Jammu where she was subjected to continued sexual abuse, extortion, and threats over a two-and-a-half-year period, according to the complaint.","The Supreme Court gave interim bail to a 23-year-old accused of rape.

NEW DELHI: The SC on Wednesday asked the Assam Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to inquire into 171 alleged incidents of fake encounters carried out by state police in 2021 but said barring a few incidents the PIL petitioner's claim about fake encounters appeared to be speculative.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh disposed of a petition by an advocate Arif M Y Jwadder and said, ""We direct the AHRC to issue a public notice inviting all individuals who claim to be aggrieved (victims and their family members) by the alleged police encounters to come forward and furnish relevant evidence.""Allowing AHRC to select team of police officials unconnected to the encounters for further inquiry into some cases if the need be, the bench said ""fair and impartial inquiry"" is a right of citizens aggrieved by police action and expected AHRC to adopt robust measures akin to witness protection protocols to safeguard the privacy, safety and security of those participating in the inquiry process.The state, in its counter-affidavit had said that out of a total of 171 cases, chargesheets have been filed in 125 cases, forwarding reports submitted in 23 cases, and remaining 23 cases are under investigation. Writing the judgment and examining the allegations of the petitioner, Justice Kant said that he has failed to independently place on record any cogent or verifiable material to substantiate the allegations.Justice Kant said, ""After minutely scanning such data, prima facie it seems that barring a few cases, it is difficult to infer that there has been a procedural breakdown, or the guidelines (relating to encounter inquiry) were flagrantly violated.

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment after his pet husky bit his neighbour inside an apartment lift. The man, Rishab Patel, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.Judicial magistrate Suhas Bhosale, while delivering the verdict, said he would not show Patel ""too much leniency"". Referring to CCTV footage, the judge noted, ""The way in which the accused dragged his pet inside lift shows he is not compassionate towards his own pet. He did not care about the informant, his son and dragged his own pet inside the lift... the act... resulted in injury.""The victim, Ramik Shah, a resident of Alfa Apartment in Worli, was heading down from the fourth floor with his one-and-a-half-year-old son and domestic help. When the lift stopped at the third floor, Patel was standing with his dog. Shah said he requested Patel to wait, explaining that his son was cynophobic (afraid of dogs). However, Patel allegedly ignored the request and did not even allow them to exit. Instead, he dragged his dog into the lift, which bit Shah on his left forearm. After the incident, Shah, his son, and the help exited the lift, but Patel allegedly followed them and challenged Shah to ""do whatever he wanted.""Shah later sought medical treatment and filed a police complaint.During the trial, the prosecution presented oral evidence from the victim, Ramik Shah, and his domestic help, Anuj Singh, who confirmed Patel had forcibly entered the lift with the dog despite repeated requests.The defence pointed to inconsistencies, including a delay in medical treatment and the initial absence of administration of anti-rabies vaccine for the victim. However, the magistrate found the testimonies of both Shah and Singh consistent and credible. ""Only because the witness is servant of the first informant we cannot brush aside his evidence if it is otherwise trustworthy,"" he ruled. Holding Patel's actions as ""voluntary,"" the court fined him Rs 4,000 in addition to sentencing him to jail.","Rishab Patel, 40, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.

NEW DELHI/GUWAHATI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and newly appointed Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi continued to skirmish on Wednesday over the former's charge that his opponent had quietly visited Pakistan.While Gogoi said the CM's ""ludicrous and ridiculous"" allegations were part of an unsuccessful political plot to sow seeds of doubt in the mind of Congress brass and discourage them from appointing him the state unit chief, Sarma claimed his charge had been validated with the Congress neta finally ""admitting"" that he had visited Pakistan. CM also said Gogoi had been economical with facts and police would soon bring out the full truth.Addressing a press conference, Gogoi said his wife, ""a well-known expert in public policy"", worked on an international project in south Asia on climate change, and spent a year in Pakistan before returning to India around 2012-13. She later took up a new job in 2015 and he too went to Pakistan once in 2013. He said the people of Assam had known these facts during the 11-year term of BJP-led Centre, which conducts background checks on opposition members, especially those like him who speak freely in Parliament.Sarma took to X to say Gogoi's ""admission"" that he did travel to Pakistan was just the tip of the iceberg of his links with the enemy country and his govt would reveal the full story through its investigative report on Sept 10. ""Today he admitted (going to Pakistan) because he knows Sept 10 is approaching. But he has made a very false statement (that he went to visit his wife). It was an independent visit, approved by the Interior Department of Pakistan,"" he said. ""What I will reveal on Sept 10 will make Rahul Gandhi regret appointing such a person to a leadership role,"" Sarma said, adding, ""There are serious national security concerns at stake...""Gogoi said, ""The CM has said he will make revelations on Sept 10. Is this a movie? This is a sensitive issue and he should reveal now what he has. BJP 's job is defamation and they are creating this whole thing like a C-grade Bollywood movie which will flop miserably.""Sarma had written, ""This is just the beginning, not the end. What lies ahead is far more serious. There exists every reasonable ground, supported by credible inputs and documented information, to suggest that Shri Gogoi has maintained proximity with the Pakistani establishment."" He also alleged Gogoi's British wife was ""snooping on our IB"" on behalf of a climate activist group ""and I have documents to prove that"".Gogoi alleged the CM's ""smear campaign"" is a tactic to cover up the activities of his own family, adding he has amassed huge wealth and property through his family, which heads 17 companies and gets benefits of govt contracts. He further said illegal coal and drugs had emerged as the ""biggest diseases"" of northeast under BJP's patronage, and the reality of the region was far from the claims made during the ""rising North East summit"", which was addressed by PM Narendra Modi.","Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and newly appointed Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi continued to skirmish on Wednesday.

RAIPUR: Once synonymous with the rise of Maoist insurgency, Bastar, along with Kondagaon, have been removed from the list of Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected districts by Union home ministry, marking a turning point in Chhattisgarh's mission against Naxalism.This comes a week after Maoist general secretary Basavaraju was gunned down, along with 27 other Maoists, in neighbouring Narayanpur district. Bastar had been on the LWE-affected districts' list for at least 25 years.Bastar and Kondagaon have now been sub-categorised as 'districts of legacy and thrust', which means Maoist activities have come down to a great extent. Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI, ""Kondagaon and Bastar are among 30 districts across the country now brought under 'districts of legacy and thrust' category. This removes them from the category of LWE-affected regions but they need development and vigilance on the operational front.

Categorisation of Kondagaon and Bastar as 'districts of legacy' is a significant step closer to being 'Maoist-free'. All our efforts would now be focused on ensuring that Naxal menace is totally eliminated in Bastar Range,"" Sundarraj said.","Bastar and Kondagaon have now been sub-categorised as 'districts of legacy and thrust' This comes a week after Maoist general secretary Basavaraju was gunned down, along with 27 other Maoists, in neighbouring Narayanpur district.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121474027,imgsize-711834,width-400,resizemode-4/121474027.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan remains tight-lipped on a wave of drone attacks in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, with a suspected quadcopter strike injuring 22 civilians, including seven minors, during a volleyball match in Azam Warsak, South Waziristan, on Tuesday night.The attack, echoing a deadly May 19 strike in North Waziristan that killed four children, has sparked fury over the govt’s silence and lack of accountability in the volatile tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.The latest assault, security locals said, occurred around 8 pm local time, targeting civilians aged 13 to 60. A 13-year-old boy and an adult male were critically injured and transferred to tertiary care, with seven others severely wounded. “We were playing volleyball when the explosion hit, followed by gunfire. It was pure panic,” said a resident, requesting anonymity.The North Waziristan attack in Hurmuz village on May 19 had led to an eight-day sit-in at Mir Ali town. Locals accused authorities of targeting civilians under counter-terrorism pretexts. The military’s media affairs wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), denied involvement, blaming the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but offered no clarity.Tuesday’s strike follows a pattern of unclaimed attacks. In March 2025, 11 civilians, including women and children, died in Mardan in an attack that locals said was delivered by drones, though authorities claimed it targeted militants.In Sept 2024, a drone strike in Upper South Waziristan killed one and injured three, with no official response. Historically, US drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal areas, peaking between 2004 and 2018, drew fierce condemnation for civilian casualties. Pakistan’s protests against US operations, including diplomatic complaints to the UN, contrasted with its own use of armed quadcopters against alleged TTP militants in tribal districts and other parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2020, often without acknowledging civilian tolls.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has demanded independent probes, citing violations of due process in both foreign and domestic strikes.Islamabad’s silence on the latest attack fuels distrust. Pakistan attributes tribal violence to groups like TTP, as in the ISPR’s North Waziristan response, but its failure to address quadcopter incidents — whether by state forces or militants — deepens local resentment. “If drones keep targeting Waziristan, how do we answer our people,” an elder asked during the Mir Ali protests, a sentiment amplified after Tuesday’s attack. Civilians, particularly children, bear the brunt of conflict in a region scarred by militancy and military operations.","Pakistan remains tight-lipped on a wave of drone attacks in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand has seen significant development strides over the past three years under chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami , with strong support from the central government—often described as the ""double engine"" model. During Dhami's tenure, the central government has approved new projects and accelerated previously stalled ones, furthering the state's development agenda.While AIIMS Rishikesh is fully operational, the central government has now approved a satellite AIIMS centre in Kichha, Udham Singh Nagar, which is anticipated to begin operations next year. This facility aims to improve healthcare accessibility for Kumaon and Terai residents. Additionally, the central government has allocated 100 MBBS seats for a new medical college in Haridwar and sanctioned another 100 seats for Almora Medical College, adding 200 medical seats in the past two years.With central support, the Delhi-Dehradun Expressway is making swift progress. A notable feature is the elevated road section through Rajaji National Park, nearing completion. This expressway will reduce Delhi-Dehradun travel time to about two and a half hours from the current five to six hours. The central government has also approved the Najibabad-Afzalgarh bypass to shorten distances between Garhwal and Kumaon. In the past three years, rural road construction in Uttarakhand has surged, with the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana adding 519 new roads spanning 1,481 km and connecting 35 villages previously without road access.The central government is pushing to complete the strategic Rishikesh-Karnaprayag rail line by 2026, with track installation set to begin soon. Efforts are also underway to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) for other rail routes, including Bageshwar-Tanakpur and Rishikesh-Uttarkashi. Eleven railway stations across Uttarakhand—including Dehradun, Haridwar, and Kathgodam—are set for transformation into Amrit stations under the new fiscal budget, which allocates Rs 5,131 crore for rail projects in the state.Following Uttarakhand’s success in hosting four G20 meetings, which showcased its culture, cuisine, and spiritual heritage, the central government has chosen the state to host the National Games in January-February next year. The event is expected to boost sports infrastructure and highlight Uttarakhand on a national level.The central government has included 51 Uttarakhand villages along the Nepal and China borders in its Vibrant Village Programme. These villages, situated in five development blocks across three border districts, will see 510 development projects with an investment of Rs 758 crore. The state has also received approval for over 18,000 additional housing units under the PM Awas Yojana (Gramin).The central cabinet has greenlit the Lakhwar multipurpose project, which will provide irrigation for around 34,000 hectares, produce 300 MW of hydropower, and supply drinking water to six states, including Uttarakhand and Delhi. The much-anticipated Jamrani dam project in Kumaon has also received approval, signalling progress in water resource management.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi once declared that the coming decade will belong to Uttarakhand. Following this vision, the central government is providing full support for the state’s development. With significant central backing, Uttarakhand is building a robust infrastructure network. For this, the people of Uttarakhand express their gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.","Uttarakhand has seen significant development strides over the past three years under chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.

"Women’s empowerment in Uttarakhand: Policies, progress, and future goals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/womens-empowerment-in-uttarakhand-policies-progress-and-future-goals/articleshow/115068606.cms,"DEHRADUN: Women have been central to the success of Uttarakhand since its formation, with many playing a crucial role in the state's development. In several hill districts, women outnumber men due to migration, making them the backbone of local life. Over the past 24 years, women in Uttarakhand have increasingly risen to prominent positions in various sectors, a trend that reflects their growing leadership in the state.Following the formation of Uttarakhand, the state government has taken significant steps to empower women, yielding positive results. A landmark reform was the introduction of reservation for women in urban local bodies and the three-tier Panchayat system, which has paved the way for the emergence of women leaders at various levels. In a further push for gender equality, the current government under chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has decided to implement 33% reservation for women in cooperative societies. Additionally, the government has reinstated 30% horizontal reservation for women in government jobs. Notably, the state’s chief secretary is a woman, and women are now holding key positions, such as District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police, in several districts.The government is also focusing on education and financial support for women, with a special emphasis on girls' education. To incentivize female education, the state has launched several schemes under the Nanda Gaurav Yojana, which provides Rs 12,000 at the birth of a girl and Rs 51,000 after she completes Class 12. Additionally, the chief minister’s Mahalakshmi Kit is provided to every family at the time of a girl’s birth, helping support the early years of a girl child.To honor the contributions of women, the Uttarakhand government presents the State Stree Shakti Tilu Rauteli Award every year on the birth anniversary of the legendary warrior Tilu Rauteli. The award, which includes Rs51,000 in cash, a memento, and a certificate, recognizes women who have excelled in various fields. In another move to support working women, the government has started establishing working women’s hostels in districts such as Dehradun and Haridwar, offering affordable and secure housing for women living away from home.The state government is taking concrete steps to economically empower women. In an effort to encourage property ownership among women, it is offering exemptions on stamp duty for properties purchased in women’s names. Additionally, the government’s Lakhpati Didis scheme, launched in 2022, has already seen over 100,000 women becoming lakhpatis. The scheme aims to boost the annual income of women in self-help groups to over Rs1 lakh, providing them with opportunities in agriculture, dairy, tailoring, catering, and more.The government is also offering interest-free loans of up to Rs 5 lakh to self-help groups to help women start their own businesses. Furthermore, the Mukhyamantri Sashakt Bahna Utsav Yojana aims to increase the income of women’s groups across the state.CM Dhami emphasized the government's commitment to empowering women, stating, ""The state government is dedicated to maternal power. Our government's effort is to strengthen the economic position of women. To achieve this, we are running several schemes through women’s groups. Additionally, women are being provided loans for self-employment. This is why we have implemented reservation for women in government jobs.""He further added that the upcoming Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will play a significant role in further empowering women economically and socially, making them more secure in both their personal and professional lives.The Uttarakhand government’s continued focus on women’s empowerment is evident through these initiatives, which aim to create a more inclusive and equitable society for women in the state.","Women have been central to the success of Uttarakhand since its formation, with many playing a crucial role in the state's development.

In the appeal filed on Wednesday, Rajasthan government sought an extension of time for nearly 23,000 mining leases to comply with environmental regulations.The extension would allow time for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s (MoEF) State Level Authority, SEIAA, to process the required appraisals and reappraisals as mandated by the NGT order.

The order came a day after the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP govt, altering its stance, requested to set aside the previous high court judgement in this case.Additional advocate general (AAG) Shiv Mangal Shar-ma, who represented the state govt, told TOI, “Former JDA officials granted approval for a land lease to one M/s Ganpati Constructions, which was earlier rejected by the UDH department. It was alleged that the rules were overlooked and the land deed was issued and rejected a few times.”During the hearing, the apex court examined whether the Rajasthan high court’s quashing of the proceedings and its permission to withdraw prosecution were justified. Sharma, during the proceedings, argued that the high court’s orders should not be sustained and that the case required adjudication based on merit as significant facts and allegations remained unresolved.“We requested the Supreme Court to get a comprehen-sive review of the case done as the Rajasthan high court, while granting relief to Dhariwal and others, including the then UDH principal secretary GS Sandhu, lacked a comprehensive review of the facts,” Sharma added.After hearing the arguments, the Supreme Court, setting aside the previous two orders of the high court, directed it to conduct a fresh, unbiased review of the entire case, including all evidence and procedural details. The apex court has also requested the chief justice of the Rajasthan high court to ensure meticulous handling of the re-evaluation, reinforcing the judicial stance on transparency and accountability . “The high court has been directed to complete its re-examination in six months,” Sharma said.","The bench, comprising Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujwal Bhuyan, has ordered the high court to re-evaluate the case from all angles.

Breaking the cycle of suffering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/breaking-the-cycle-of-suffering/articleshow/115067365.cms,"‘Inadequate awareness’

Prenatal tests important

For almost a decade-and-a-half, Kishore Meshram has been undertaking a gruelling 85km journey from his village in Narkhed taluk to Nagpur every month, accompanying his son Mayuresh — now 14, a thalassaemia patient — for blood transfusions.Meshram and Mayuresh aren’t alone. Across Central India, several others need to travel long distances to reach the Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Centre (TSCC) at Jaripatka in Nagpur, Maharashtra, with the medical facility serving as a lifeline for impoverished tribals in a 500km radius.Without consistent transfusions, these patients have to endure excruciating agony or even face death.Patients also need clinical intervention during vaso-occlusive crisis (when microcirculation is obstructed by sickled RBCs). As countless patients suffer in silence, the number of those afflicted with these genetic disorders continues to mount. Currently, there are more than 1.5 lakh thalassaemia and 14 lakh sickle cell anaemia patients nationwide.“Inadequate awareness about inherited blood disorders is the sole reason why the burden of thalassaemia major and sickle cell anaemia continues to surge despite being entirely preventable,” said Dr Vinky Rughwani, di rector, TSCC, which provides transfusions — otherwise unaffordable for the hundreds who come from faraway hamlets of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh — for free.Established in 2004, TSCC has conducted more than 66,600 complimentary transfusions for 1,500 registered patients and provided free consultation to 45,000 individuals. It also offers free periodic assessments for cardiac, renal, hepatic, and other ailments to monitor treatment side-effects.TSCC has collaborated with Bengalurubased Sankalp India Foundation to screen expecting mothers for haemoglobinopathies. In the past year, TSCC screened approximately 21,000 pregnant women, identifying more than 1,800 carriers who required testing of their spouses. Ultimately, 286 couples were found to be at heightened risk of giving birth to a child with thalassaemia major or SS-pattern.Advocating mandatory premarital screening for thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, Rughwani asserts that every individual must undergo testing before marriage. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or a prenatal test is playing a key role as a prevention tool. Of a sample size of 21,000 pregnant women, “at least 9% were found to have traces of sickle cell or thalassaemia, while 15% of 1,800 couples were at risk”, he said. Daga Hospital, Govt Medical College and Hospital, and Indira Gandhi Govt Medical College and Hospital also provide medications, transfusions, and diagnostics to patients, though they lack a dedicated facility for the treatment of these conditions.Paediatrician Dr Sanjay Deshmukh said Nagpur requires a govt-dedicated sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for transfusion, diagnostic, and advanced treatments, such as bone marrow transplant (BMT), as patients from across Central India seek treatment there.Prompt treatment, fewer formalities, and a spectrum of allied complimentary services are some of the benefits that draw patients from Vidarbha and other parts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh.Meshram said before being referred to TSCC, was strained both financially and mentally. He now goes about in his village, urging marriageable youths to take the test before selecting their life partner or planning a child.Nevertheless, much remains to be done for these patients, feels Rughwani.A significant breakthrough came with Coal India’s announcement of a Rs10 lakh sponsorship for thalassaemia patients under 12 years of age to undergo BMT.Since then, 50 patients from TSCC have benefited. “The CM and PM’s relief funds, Coal India Ltd, and other organisations have enabled us to provide Rs 15 lakh for BMT, alleviating the financial burden on families,” said Rughwani. Looking ahead, he’s resolute in securing job reservations for patients and govt funding for BMT for sickle cell patients, marking the next milestone in his mission to secure the lives of those affected.(Know about any such inspiring story?

School Holiday November 24th: Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's Martyrdom Day

November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations. After the lively Diwali celebrations on October 31, students get to enjoy several important religious holidays in the beginning of November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also indicate the end of the academic season. The pre-exam period for students begins in November, with the announcement of upcoming term-end tests and the first batch of dates for key entrance exams such as the JEE.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Here's a closer look at the school holidays in November Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","November 2024 marks the peak of India’s festive season, with schools and colleges nationwide continuing their celebrations.

The presser witnessed the foreign minister reiterating India's stance on Canada of ""making allegations without any specific evidence.""Calling it a ""hypocrisy of Canada towards freedom of speech,"" the MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that Jaishankar also raised the issue of ""political space"" being given to ""anti-India elements"" in Canada.

BJP MLAs marshalled out in J&K assembly bedlam over Article 370,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mlas-marshalled-out-in-jk-assembly-bedlam-over-article-370/articleshow/115062107.cms,"This is a representational image

SRINAGAR: The J&K assembly resembled a fight club Thursday as BJP MLAs clashed with marshals after speaker Abdul Rahim Rather ordered the eviction of opposition members who were protesting the passage of a resolution on restoring the former state’s special status — revoked in 2019 with the abrogation of Article 370 The commotion began when independent MLA Sheikh Khursheed of jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid’s Awami Ittehad Party displayed a banner advocating for Article 370 and 35A. BJP lawmakers stormed the well and tore the banner. The speaker briefly adjourned the House, but the BJP members continued their protest, refusing to heed calls for order.Upon resuming, leader of opposition Sunil Sharma of BJP opposed the assembly passing Wednesday the resolution — calling it a “drama”. This fuelled dissent among members in the treasury bench.Slogans filled the House as BJP MLAs chanted in support of Kashmir's integration with India: “Balidaan huway jahan Mukerjee woh Kashmir hamara hai.” National Conference (NC) members retorted by emphasising their allegiance to J&K: “Jis Kashmir ko khoon say seencha, woh Kashmir hamara hai.” CM Omar Abdullah looked grim and watched the yelling match silently.As tempers flared, speaker Rather directed marshals to remove BJP members, resulting in physical altercations. BJP MLA Shagun Parihar’s protest by standing on a table led woman marshals to intervene, intensifying the ruckus. Eventually, the speaker adjourned the proceedings for the day.The disruption stemmed from the resolution that urged the Union govt for a dialogue to restore the special status and constitutional protections afforded to J&K by Article 370.Later, J&K BJP president Sat Sharma said: “NC has brought the resolution. NC knows all too well that even if it is brought 100 times, they won’t succeed as long as PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah are at the Centre. They are doing this to distract people, disturb peace.”His predecessor Ravinder Raina said BJP will not allow Article 370 to be restored. “Article 370 has become history and it can never return,” he asserted.While deputy CM Surinder Choudhary and food minister Satish Sharma accused BJP of “driving a wedge between Kashmir and Jammu”, Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone alleged that NC is playing a “fixed match” with BJP by passing a watered down resolution.“We demand the immediate rollback of Article 370, the restoration of statehood, and the complete nullification of the reorganisation act,” Lone said.Cabinet minister Sakina Itoo responded, saying Lone was a minister in the previous PDP-BJP govt through the “Nagpur quota”. “PM Modi used to be his elder brother,” said Itoo, referring to Lone’s earlier alliance with BJP.",J&K assembly resembled a fight club Thursday as BJP MLAs clashed with marshals.

"In Trump moment, a Democrat win lights up an NCR house",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-trump-moment-a-democrat-win-lights-up-an-ncr-house/articleshow/115061466.cms,"GHAZIABAD: Over the past couple of weeks, candidates of several political parties have passed by Haider house in Sanjay Nagar, canvassing for votes for the Ghaziabad assembly bypoll on November 20. But its residents, Ali and Chandni Haider, have been glued to their phones and TV, taking in every update from the US — their interest not in the Trump-Harris duel for the White House, but a small country election in the state of Illinois.There, around the same time Republicans led by Trump began scenting a decisive victory, an Indian-American Democrat pulled off an impressive win in DuPage County. The victor happened to be Saba Haider (40), Ali and Chandni’s daughter.Saba won a seat in the DuPage County Board, defeating her Republican rival and incumbent Patty Gustin by 8,521 votes.The DuPage board comprises elected representatives from six districts. The tenure is decided on the basis of a draw — and Saba will be on the seat for two years.At her house in Chitragupta Vihar , her parents couldn’t be prouder.“She has always been this talented. Saba has a friend circle of politically active people who motivated her to run for the county polls. If she wants to go ahead in politics, we are always there for her,” says Ali, who retired as an engineer in UP Jal Nigam.Ali and Chandni now manage a school for the underprivileged in Ghaziabad. They live in the Sanjay Nagar house with Saba’s elder brother Avas and his family. They have a younger son, Zeeshan, who runs a business in Dubai.“When Saba was born, we lived in Sector 19 of Noida. We moved to Ghaziabad only in 1993,” Chandni tells TOI.Saba went to Holy Child School in Ghaziabad. She pursued BSc from Ram Chameli Chadha Vishvas Girls’ College in the city and bagged a gold medal in wildlife sciences from Aligarh Muslim University.“She would always take part in debates and oratory. I think her strong academic background created the foundation for her passion in politics and public service,” Chandni says.In 2006, Saba married Ali Kazmi , a computer science engineer from Bulandshahr, and relocated to the US with him. Settled in Chicago, the couple have two children — Azim (14) and Aizah (10).In the US, Saba became a certified yoga teacher — training a diverse range of clients from college students to corporate officers. That’s what made her popular among the locals, her mother insists.“Yoga is very popular in the US as well. Saba has hosted several events to promote wellness,” she says. “Her husband is also involved in social welfare and health services and supports my daughter’s political ambitions.”For Saba, her mother is her biggest inspiration. Announcing her win in the polls on Wednesday, Saba wrote on Facebook, “This win is dedicated to my mother, who is eternally optimistic and forever giving and kind. As a kid, whenever I told her that I wanted to achieve something that seemed outside the norm, she encouraged me and always said, ‘Absolutely, if you work hard enough!’ Mummy, thank you for encouraging me to believe in myself…”It wasn’t, however, a cakewalk for Saba. Her feet were numb from all the walking she had to do for canvassing.“Saba told me, ‘Mumma, I can’t even feel my feet’. I told her to get a foot massage, but she said she did not have time for it. On Monday, when the votes were cast, Saba said her toenails were broken and she was bleeding from them. It hurt to see my daughter in pain. But today, I am very proud of her,” says Chandni.The last time Saba came home was in June 2022, when Zeeshan got married.“She came to India after years. We had such an enjoyable time amid all the wedding celebrations. But we keep going to the US off and on,” she adds.This, however, was not Saba’s first time in the election fray. In November 2022, she lost the county polls by around 1,000 votes. “She was determined to contest again. And we were there to support her,” her mother says.Saba has left no stone unturned since the loss. “I have gone to so many doorsteps, spoken to people and canvassed for votes,” she told TOI on Thursday from Chicago.For Saba, raising two children and gaining a foothold in politics simultaneously was easier said than done. “Being from Ghaziabad, I had never seen snow in my life. Here, we get 2ft of snow. Battling extreme weather conditions, shopping from only one ‘desi’ grocery store and raising children was quite difficult for me and my husband. But, we gradually settled in,” she says.Does she see a stable career in politics? “I haven’t yet thought about it. I am just working for the community and will see where it takes me. This win means a lot to me as my opponent had been a candidate for the past 20 years.”On Trump’s win, she says, “I had hoped the Democrats would win. However, accepting the results in this democracy, I hope the next leadership focuses on growth, development and inclusivity. There is a lot of confusion and fear among the people of this country that needs to be addressed.”","Saba Haider won a seat in the DuPage County Board, defeating her Republican rival and incumbent Patty Gustin by 8,521 votes.

""All central agencies will support the states in every way, from gathering intelligence to taking action. But until one group is created with a 'zero-tolerance to terror' mood, the national counter-terror policy and strategy cannot succeed,"" he underlined, while batting for a 'whole-of-govt' approach.The home minister sought to impress on the need for states to work in close coordination both among themselves and with the central agencies, saying that while states may have geographical and constitutional limitations, terror operations transcend inter-state and global boundaries. He asked thanas to be anti-terror ready by training their officers in use of artificial intelligence to analyse various police/criminal databases, including those maintained by NIA. The NIA must move from ""a need to know"" approach to a 'need to share' and eventually a ""duty to share"" approach.""To deal with new challenges like terror financing and crypto , a coordinated approach must be adopted from police stations up to the DGP office,"" said Shah.He said the govt has come up with a model anti-terrorism squad (ATS), model special task force (STF) and model police training manual for the states and Union Territories, which, if adopted, will work as a common structure and platform to deal with the menace of terrorism.""The SOPs can be tweaked by the states as per their requirements. Coordination through ATS and STF does not undermine the federal rights of states,"" assured Shah.Reminding the police officers of PM Modi's goal to make India a developed power by 2047, the home minister said there would be security challenges along the way, and insisted on taking on the terror ecosystem with a unified, anti-terror ecosystem.Stating that the Modi govt, in its last 10 years in power, had adopted a zero-tolerance approach and cracked down on both terror and terror financing, Shah said the improved security situation was evident from terror incidents having declined by 70% as compared to the preceding 10 years.Shah asked DGP-rank officers present at the conference, to invoke the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) to deal with terror. He shared that NIA has filed a chargesheet in 498 of the 632 cases registered by it, with its conviction rate being almost 95%.","The home ministry is working on a national counter-terror policy and strategy.

Have to assume no ban order exists, and hence, can’t examine its validity, says HC

NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court ended proceedings on a plea challenging the ban on the import of Salman Rushdie 's controversial novel, The Satanic Verses , after noting that the authorities had failed to produce the 1988 notification on the ban and it must be ""presumed that it does not exist"".In an order passed on Nov 5, a bench of Justices Rekha Palli and Saurabh Banerjee said that the petition, filed in 2019, was therefore infructuous, and the petitioner would be entitled to take all actions in respect of the book as available in law.The Rajiv Gandhi govt had banned the import of the Booker Prize-winning author's book citing law-and-order reasons in 1988.Petitioner Sandipan Khan had moved court arguing that he was unable to import the book because of a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on October 5, 1988, banning its import into the country in accordance with the Customs Act.He, however, contended that the notification is neither available on any official website nor with any of the authorities concerned. During the course of the court proceedings, the authorities maintained that the notification was untraceable.The bench observed: ""What emerges is that none of the respondents could produce the said notification dated Oct 5, 1988, with which the petitioner is purportedly aggrieved and, in fact, the purported author of the said notification has also shown his helplessness in producing a copy of the notification during the pendency of the writ petition since its filing way back in 2019.""""In light of the aforesaid circumstances, we have no other option except to presume that no such notification exists, and therefore, we cannot examine its validity and dispose of the writ petition as infructuous,"" it concluded.The petitioner sought to set aside other related directions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1988.","Have to assume no ban order exists, and hence, can’t examine its validity, says HC.

And their effort to divide India will not succeed,” she added.Slamming the National Conference-led coalition govt for the resolution, Irani said, “The govt, elected through the democratic framework, is giving evidence of breaking India instead of working on development issues and uniting India.” After abrogation of Article 370, J&K witnessed a decline in terror incidents by 70& and deaths in such incidents came down by 80%, the former Union minister said.Irani also took on Congress over the resolution and asked the party leadership if it stood for terrorism.She also asked if the Congress-led “INDI alliance” stood against the “economic and constitutional interests” of J&K as well as the rights that the tribal population, Dalits, OBCs, women and children have got with the revocation of Article 370.“What they seek is special status for themselves, not the people of J&K,” she said.","BJP leader Smriti Irani said the resolution was akin to “waging a war against the Indian constitution, Supreme Court and Parliament’ Irani also took on Congress over the resolution and asked the party leadership if it stood for terrorism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115062638,imgsize-929081,width-400,resizemode-4/115062638.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Members of country's erstwhile royal families have expressed strong opposition to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's recent comments in an editorial, accusing him of misrepresenting the contributions and legacy of India’s princely states.Rahul Gandhi in his opinion piece for the Indian Express, scrutinized India’s colonial history, with specific references to how the East India Company allegedly manipulated Indian royalty for its gain.""India was silenced by the East India Company. It was silenced not by its business prowess, but by its chokehold. The Company choked India by partnering with, bribing, and threatening our more pliant maharajas and nawabs. It controlled our banking, bureaucratic, and information networks. We didn't lose our freedom to another nation; we lost it to a monopolistic corporation that ran a coercive apparatus,"" Rahul wrote in his article.Representatives of royal families argued that these comments by Rahul were not only a distortion of historical facts but also a disservice to those who fought and sacrificed for India’s independence.Rajasthan's deputy chief minister Diya Kumari, whose grandfather was Jaipur's final ruling Maharaja Man Singh II, rejected Rahul's claims and dismissed his assertions as a gross misrepresentation.""I strongly condemn Rahul Gandhi's attempt to malign the erstwhile royal families of India. The dream of an integrated India was only possible because of the utmost sacrifice of these families. Baseless allegations, founded on half-baked historical interpretations, are completely unacceptable,"" Kumari said.BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia from Gwalior's dynasty opposed the Congress leader's statements. ""Those who sell hatred have no right to lecture on Indian pride and history,"" he said.Accusing Rahul of a “colonial mindset,” Scindia countered Gandhi’s interpretation by citing figures such as Mahadji Scindia, Kittur Chennamma, and Rani Velu Nachiyar—figures he argued were true patriots in India’s freedom struggle.""Your selective amnesia about your own privilege is a disservice to those truly striving against adversity,"" he noted.BJP MP from Mysore Yaduveer Wadiyar, and Wadiyar dynasty descendant, stated, ""Rahul Gandhi's lack of knowledge of true history is on constant display. His latest statement, via an article this morning, reflects his ignorance of the contributions made by the erstwhile princely states towards today's Bharat, the patronisation of Bharatiya Heritage, without which, we might have lost many of the traditions we hold dear today, and most importantly, the sacrifices they made made towards the formation of a unified India.""BJP MLA from Dewas and royal family member Gayatri Raje Puar criticised Rahul's statements as disregarding the royals' role in preserving ""Sanatan Sanskriti."" She emphasised their contribution to protecting heritage, sovereignty, and culture, resulting in ""Akhand Bharat.""BJP leader and Nathdwara MLA Vishvaraj Singh Mewar said that Rahul's comments demonstrated either ""ignorance or intentional misrepresentation.""BJP leader Smriti Irani also criticised Rahul Gandhi's article, stating, ""Those who have relegated the Congress party to a 'private limited company' are talking about East India Company.

However, he didn't do anything.""""Had he done anything, he would have been able to speak Odia properly.

Therefore, they were forced to eat mango kernel gruel. Two people have died and others are undergoing treatment. This is very sad,"" Patnaik stated whilst addressing party student wing members at the BJD headquarters.He voiced his concerns about the current government's decisions, stating they had undermined the BJD administration's previous work in ensuring sufficient grain distribution. Patnaik, who served as Odisha's chief minister from 2000 to 2024, highlighted that his government had implemented a state food security scheme for those not covered under the NFSA.""Now, the current government has ruined all those efforts and, as a result, people are forced to eat mango kernel gruel because they're not getting rice,"" Patnaik stated.Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare minister KC Patra dismissed these claims, countering, ""As many as 16 people had died by eating mango kernel in Tikiri and Kashipur blocks of Rayagada district during the BJD government . Will Patnaik admit that these people died for not getting rice to eat?""The minister confirmed that medical reports indicated food poisoning as the cause of death, not rice scarcity.

Activists claim UGC cell sitting on ragging plaints,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/activists-claim-ugc-cell-sitting-on-ragging-plaints/articleshow/115064438.cms,"Medical colleges figure disproportionately in the list of complaints to UGC's anti-ragging cell, but anti-ragging activists complain that the complaints don't always lead to action. They cite the complaint filed by first year students of JLN Medical College in Raipur about being forced to tonsure their heads and being slapped and physically harassed in the hostel as an example. No action has been taken on the complaint so far.Within weeks of 2024 academic year starting on Oct 14, the anti-ragging cell has received over 55 complaints from medical colleges across India, which is almost 42% of total complaints received from all colleges. In 2024, of the 800 complaints received by the cell so far, 222 were from medical colleges and 230 from engineering and polytechnic colleges. This is despite the fact that there are just over 700 medical colleges compared to over 8,000 engineering and technology colleges.In four cases from medical colleges, the victims took their own lives. Anti-ragging activists say UGC data doesn't even capture all incidents because you cannot register an anonymous complaint. ""The reported case of severe ragging in RVRS Medical College in Bhilwara, Rajasthan, does not feature in UGC list of complaints though the students tried to complain. They insisted on the student identity being revealed and since the student was not willing to do so, the complaint does not figure in the list,"" explained Gaurav Singhal of Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE), a non-profit that works on preventing ragging.""In case of JLN Medical College, Raipur, though the complaint was registered, no action was taken by UGC or college authorities. This college is notorious for ragging and equally infamous for an administration that refuses to act. The authorities summoned the entire first year batch and asked if anything was wrong,"" said Rupesh Kumar Jha, of SAVE.Jha said that most complaints were made anonymously because if any student's identity was disclosed, seniors could mark him or her for even more severe ragging and abuse.""This is a common problem. So, victims are scared. If you are serious about tackling ragging, anonymous complaints must be given importance. It is for the UGC or college authorities to investigate and verify the truth in such complaints. In JLN Medical college, the boys were forced to shave their heads. If students are going around in uniform with shaved heads or if all freshers have a peculiar hairstyle, it is evidence that ragging is going on. How can the college authority deny it?"" asked Jha. ""College authorities take it as a personal attack on them and almost never act on their own. Instead of being thankful that students are informing them that all is not well in the college, they victimize the complainant. This is why students cannot be expected to seek help from within the college. We must prevent ragging by implementing the detailed action plan mandated by the Supreme Court order in 2009,"" said Prof Rajendra Kachroo, the father of Aman Kachroo who died from violent ragging in 2009.Neither the college authorities, nor National Medical Commission (NMC), UGC or health ministry responded to queries from TOI regarding inaction on complaints of ragging from the college.","Of 800 complaints received by the cell so far, 222 were from medical colleges.

RAIPUR: A train chugged off where it wasn't supposed to, railways suffered a Rs 3-crore loss, a station master was suspended, and a divorce battle dragged on for 12 years from Visakhapatnam to Supreme Court and Chhattisgarh's Durg - because of a cursory 'OK'.The station master had ended an angry phone call with his wife with the word, but it was mistaken for a go-ahead to send a train into Maoist territory, triggering this stranger-than-fiction chain of events.The station master hails from Visakhapatnam and his now divorced wife is from Durg. Court evidence shows they married on Oct 12, 2011, but the bride was unhappy due to her past relationship with another man, and her confession that she wasn't over it. This led to friction at home.The stationmaster appealed to her parents, who gave assurances, but the woman never stopped communicating with her lover. She would call him even with her husband sleeping right next to her.The marriage was already hanging by a thread when, one night, she called the stationmaster when he was on duty and they again quarrelled. Since he was at work, he ended the call by saying, ""We'll talk at home, OK?""He didn't realise that his work microphone was on. His colleague on the other end only heard the 'OK' and mistook it as the green signal to dispatch a freight train down a restricted route in a Maoist-affected area. Thankfully, there was no accident, yet it was a violation of night-time restrictions, and caused railways a loss of Rs 3 crore.The stationmaster was suspended. The punishment worsened his marital woes and the officer, now at the end of his tether, filed for divorce in a Visakhapatnam family court. His wife filed a complaint under IPC section 498A (cruelty and harassment) against him, his 70-year-old father, his elder brother, who is a govt employee, sister-in-law and maternal cousins.Saying she feared for her life, the woman moved Supreme Court and managed to get the case transferred to Durg. When the Durg family court rejected his divorce petition, the railwayman appealed to Chhattisgarh high court, his counsel Vipin Kumar Tiwari said.In a recent judgment, a division bench of Justices Rajani Dubey and Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal deemed the wife's actions ""cruelty"", reversed the family court judgment and granted the man divorce.HC found that the wife had falsely accused her husband of having an affair with his sister-in-law. The dowry and cruelty complaint also turned out to be false. The wife failed to give specific details of the dowry. Also, the cruelty charge against the in-laws could not be proved as they did not live with the couple.The division bench granted the husband divorce while noting that the wife's arguing with him on the phone, which led to the 'OK' incident, the filing of false reports, and making baseless accusations constituted mental cruelty towards him.","The station master had ended an angry phone call with his wife with the word, but it was mistaken for a go-ahead to send a train into Maoist territory.

NEW DELHI: Hopes of Jet Airways getting fresh wings crashed on Thursday as the Supreme Court ordered its liquidation, with the successful bidder - Jalan Kalrock Consortium - failing to deposit even the first tranche of Rs 350 crore of the Rs 4,783 crore resolution plan for years, thereby burdening SBI-led lenders with huge financial liabilities.Noting the gross violations of the plan by JKC, comprising UAE-based NRI Murari Lal Jalan and Florian Fritsch, who holds shares in Jet Airways through his Cayman Islands-based investment holding company Kalrock Capital Partners, the SC exercised its rarely-exercised omnibus powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to order liquidation of the unviable airline.In a 169-page judgment which provided guidelines for future Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings and streamlining the processes before company law tribunals NCLT and NCLAT, the bench accepted arguments of additional solicitor general N Venkataraman and SBI counsel Sanjay Kapur to allow SBI-led lenders' consortium to forfeit the Rs 250 crore deposited by JKC as well as its Rs 150-crore performance bank guarantee.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Pardiwala said, ""The amount of Rs 200 crore already infused by SRA (successful resolution applicant in JKC) stands forfeited. Lenders/creditors are further permitted to encash the performance bank guarantee of Rs 150 crore furnished by SRA. We order accordingly.""The bench said, ""In the peculiar and alarming circumstances as discussed in this judgment and keeping in mind the fact that almost five years have elapsed since Resolution Plan was duly approved by NCLAT and there being no progress worth the name, we are left with no other option but to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution and direct that Jet Airways be taken in liquidation. The NCLT, Mumbai, shall now take appropriate steps for appointment of liquidator and all other necessary formalities for commencement of liquidation of Jet Airways.""Faulting NCLAT for allowing JKC to adjust performance bank guarantee of Rs 150 crore to meet the shortfall in deposit of first tranche of Rs 350 crore which was to be made good by May 22, 2022, the bench said for five years, the resolution plan remained in limbo during which period several dues, including airport dues, to be paid by Jet Airways have increased due to the fault of JKC. ""The court must ensure that such debts stop running at some point of time,"" it said.The bench said although IBC was enacted to ensure survival of bankrupt entities, the same must not come at the cost of efficiency. ""In scenarios such as the present, 'timely liquidation' is indeed preferred over an 'endless resolution process',"" it said.

Stubble burning cases cross 4 lakh in 6 states in 6th year, 74% in Punjab

NEW DELHI: With stubble burning likely to peak in the next few days, the environment ministry has doubled the penalty for burning paddy crop residue by farmers. The revised fines range from Rs 5,000 to Rs 30,000 per incidence, depending on the size of the offender's farm.The revised penalty will be imposed on violators with immediate effect in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and NCR areas of UP and Rajasthan.Notified on Wednesday, the rules specify that farmers with less than two-acre farm land will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5,000 per incidence, if they are found burning stubble.Those having two acres or more but less than five acres will have to pay Rs 10,000 per incidence; and those having more than five acres of land will have to pay Rs 30,000 per incidence.The notification replaced the Imposition, collection and utilisation of environmental compensation for stubble burning rules, 2023, which had provisions of penalties of Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 per incidence, depending on the three land size categories.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas has been given the power under the rules to impose penalty (environmental compensation) on erring farmers.The commission accordingly on Thursday authorised all nodal/supervisory officers, appointed by the govts of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, to impose and collect environmental compensation, as per the revised rates. The violators will have to deposit the penalty either in cash or demand draft or through electronic modes into the account of respective state pollution control boards or pollution control committees ""within 30 days from the date of challan"".Crop residue burning has decreased in the ongoing paddy harvesting season, but it has still reached close to four lakh cases recorded in six study states in the sixth year. Punjab remains the worst affected, accounting for over 74% of the cases. Out of the 400,461 cases recorded in six states, Punjab recorded 296,670 cases, followed by 50,242 cases in Madhya Pradesh.Before the start of the ongoing season, Punjab, as per the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modeling from Space (CREAMS), had recorded over 75% of burning cases, with the state reporting 291,629 cases out of a total of 387,946. With fewer burning cases in the ongoing season, Punjab has decreased its share by 1%. Crop residue burning is recorded by CREAMS using satellite data from September 15 to November 30.Though Punjab and Haryana have faced criticism from various agencies for worsening air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR), Haryana has recorded even fewer stubble burning cases than Madhya Pradesh, at 24,361.","Stubble burning cases cross 4 lakh in 6 states in 6th year, 74% in Punjab.

However, the Forest Survey of India had informed the court that as many as 1,670 trees were cut during Feb 16-26 for widening of road for proper access to vital installations like a super specialty hospital to treat wounded paramilitary personnel and the Saarc University.Carbon stock loss due to felling of trees in 2.32 ha area is estimated at 130.36 tonne in all the five pools, which is equivalent to 477.99 tonne of CO2, the FSI had said. The forest department of Delhi had contested the FSI's claim. FSI has strongly objected to the under-reporting of the trees still standing in the project area. While the forest department said the total number of trees standing are 106 in RFA and 200 outside RFA (total 306), the FSI put their numbers at 166 inside RFA and 1,488 outside RFA (total 1,654).","The bench asked senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan to suggest a mechanism to be put in place to prevent such illegal felling of trees by any authority in the ridge areas.

3 fingers, 'station', auto: How cops saw through 'blind case'

NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough, Delhi Police has arrested three men in connection with the brutal gangrape of a 34-year-old woman researcher from Odisha reported on Oct 11. Their probe has revealed that the incident happened near ITO and the woman, who suffers from a mental health condition, was dumped in southeast Delhi's Sarai Kale Khan in an auto. The survivor is still under treatment at a central government hospital, police said.According to police, two of the accused, one intoxicated, had conspired to rape the woman when they found her alone. They allegedly took her to an isolated area by force and assaulted her. An autorickshaw driver, who witnessed the act, allegedly raped the woman in his vehicle before dropping her at Sarai Kale Khan, where she was found. TOI had reported the incident on Oct 12.Among the arrested men is the auto driver, Prabhu Mahto (28); a scrap dealer, Pramod Babu (32); and a beggar, Mohammed Shamshul (29). They were tracked down using CCTV analysis, technical surveillance and human information networks. The investigators have recovered crucial evidence linked to the crime. The autorickshaw has also been seized.Crucial physical evidence, including the blood-stained clothes of the survivor, comprising a pant and salwar, besides the clothes the accused were wearing at the time of the crime have also been seized. These include clothes of Mahto, Pramod and Shamsul and the latter's cap, belt and shoes.The survivor of the horrific gangrape lay silently in a bed at the AIIMS Trauma Centre, lost in thought. Outside, there waited a posse of cops hoping she would say something that would help them catch her assailants. It was a blind case. Forget the identity or number of assaulters, even the time and place of the crime wasn't known.The woman had been discovered at Sarai Kale Khan in a battered state, in pain and unable, or unwilling, to speak. Constable Sangeeta went to the ward in the guise of a social worker. After consulting the AIIMS Trauma Centre management, the cops also got an Odia translator to go in as a nurse. The two were assigned to take care of the survivor while building trust and gathering information.The survivor took some time to open up. She showed three fingers when asked how many men had assaulted her. ""One of them was handicapped and they had an auto,"" she told the undercover duo. She also uttered the word 'station'. She was unable to reveal other details, like the time and place of the rape due to her preexisting mental health challenges and the trauma of her horrific experience.Joint commissioner of police Sanjay Jain formed a special team led by DCP Ravi Kumar Singh and ACP Aishwarya Singh and 10 sub-teams to pursue the case. Sub-inspector Shubham Chaudhary prepared a site plan, identifying more than 700 government and private CCTV cameras installed on the major and minor roads starting at the point where the woman was discovered on Oct 11. The investigators got their first lead when they found CCTV footage showing the victim exiting the Old Delhi Railway Station waiting hall at 10.14am on Oct 10.The team then analysed footage from cameras at Kashmiri Gate, Red fort, Daryaganj, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Rajghat-Shantivan, Rajghat Depot Bypass, ITO, Mathura Road, PWD headquarters, DTC headquarters, Indraprastha depot and the petrol and CNG pumps between ITO and Sarai Kale Khan. This helped prepare an electronic map of the route possibly taken by the survivor.After minutely studying the possible route taken by the woman, more than 150 autorickshaws identified by both visible and non-visible licence plate digits were verified. The breakthrough came with the spotting of an autorickshaw parked near the scene of crime. The same auto was then seen moving and stopping at another location.""Here, the driver exited the vehicle and crossed the road,"" DCP Singh said. ""This spot was where we obtained a partial number plate. After sustained efforts, the autorickshaw was correctly identified as bearing the number DL1RAA 9327 and its driver on the night of Oct 10-11 was determined to be Prabhu Mahto."" The registration details were used to track down the driver. An officer explained that Mahto's mobile location was tracked and matched the spot in the CCTV footage.Sustained efforts were made to locate the accused and Mahto was arrested on Oct 30. He was interrogated at length and he helped the cops identify and nab the second accused, Pramod alias Babu, on Nov 2. The third man alleged to be involved in the crime, Mohmmad Shamshul, was arrested on Nov 4. The successful manhunt had taken 21 days.""We will ensure the accused get the harshest punishment under the law,"" said a senior officer. Under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, anyone accused of involvement in gangrape can be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term that is not less than 20 years and which may extend to life, which will mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. A fine may also be charged additionally.","Delhi Police has arrested three men in connection with the brutal gangrape of a 34-year-old woman researcher from Odisha.

Ottawa events binned over security issues

NEW DELHI: India called out Canada for what it described as Ottawa's ""hypocrisy"" on freedom of speech in blocking a publication based in Australia - Australia Today - that highlighted foreign minister S Jaishankar's remarks against Canada this week in Canberra. The govt also said Canada had not provided security for the consular camps that Indian missions have been hosting in the country, despite increasing threat to Indian officials, leading to cancellation of some of the camps.On its X account, Australia Today says it carries news and opinions from Australia focused on multicultural communities and the Indian subcontinent. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a media briefing on Thursday that social media handles and pages of this particular publication, which he described as an important diaspora outlet, had been blocked and were no longer available for viewers in Canada.""This happened just a few hours after this outlet carried a press conference of the external affairs minister along with his counterpart Penny Wong. The outlet also published several articles on the visit of the external affairs minister, as well as an interview with him. So, we were surprised. It seems strange to us,"" he said.""I will say these are actions that highlight yet again Canada's hypocrisy on freedom of speech,"" the official added.In a joint press conference with Wong, Jaishankar had accused Canada of developing a pattern of making allegations without backing those with any evidence. He had also said surveillance of Indian diplomats was unacceptable, while reiterating India's position that Canada provides political space to extremists.""So, you can draw your own conclusion about why Australia Today was blocked,"" Jaiswal said. The official also said threats to Indian diplomats in Canada had increased and Ottawa had not provided security for Indian consular camps.""Over the last year or even more, the kind of things that we have seen... attacking Indian diplomats, threatening, intimidating, harassing Indian diplomats,"" he said. ""Threats to Indian diplomats in Canada have increased. They have been put under surveillance, which is unacceptable. We had also taken up the matter very strongly with the Canadian side,"" he said in response to media queries.","India calls out Canada for what it described as Ottawa's ""hypocrisy"" on freedom of speech.

Compromise between accused & survivor no ground to quash child sexual assault case: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/compromise-between-accused-survivor-no-ground-to-quash-child-sexual-assault-case-sc/articleshow/115063777.cms,"NEW DELHI: Holding that sexual assault of a child is too serious a crime to be allowed to be quashed without trial on the basis of compromise between the accused and survivor's family, Supreme Court on Thursday said that such offences are not private in nature but against the whole society.A bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Kumar set aside an order of Rajasthan high court which had quashed criminal proceedings against a teacher in sexual assault case of class XI student. The HC let the accused off on the ground that the student's family compromised with the teacher just a week after the case was lodged. Though the father of the survivor supported the accused in SC also, the court did not accept his plea and paved the way for trial against him on a petition filed by neighbours of the victim student.""In view of the nature of the offences alleged against the third respondent (the accused), one can only say that if they are proved they could be treated only as offences against the society and at any rate, it cannot be said that prosecuting an offender against whom such allegations are made is not in the interest of the society. In fact, it would only be in the interest of society. In that view of the matter, when by quashing the FIR by invoking the power under Section 482, Cr. P.C., the accused was relieved of the liability to face the trial...,"" the bench said.The apex court said that the HC must have given due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. It said before passing order the Court has to apply its mind to (i) whether the crime is one against the society or against an individual alone (ii) seriousness and how the crime was committed (iii) whether offence(s) is one under a special statute (iv) stage of proceedings and how the accused managed to compromise with the complainant.""The power under Section 482 of CrPC could not be used to quash proceedings based on compromise if it is in respect of heinous offence which are not private in nature and have a serious impact on the society. When an incident of the aforesaid nature and gravity allegedly occurred in a higher secondary school, that too from a teacher, it cannot be simply described as an offence which is purely private in nature and has no serious impact on the society,"" the court said. ""We have no hesitation to hold that in cases of this nature, the fact that in view of compromise entered into between the parties, the chance of a conviction is remote and bleak also cannot be a ground to abruptly terminate the investigation, by quashing FIR and all further proceedings pursuant thereto, by invoking the power under Section 482, CrPC,"" it said. Quoting renowned American poet H W Longfellow, the court said a torn jacket might soon be mended, but a bruised heart of a child would be beyond reviviscence. It said that even a third party not directly affected by the crime can invoke the jurisdiction of Supreme Court to seek justice and punish the culprit.""According to us, such right to a third party to prefer a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution is certainly to be recognised and respected in a case where seemingly miscarriage of justice had occurred and still, neither State nor the victim or any relative falling under the term 'victim' approached this Court,"" it said.",Rajasthan high court had quashed criminal proceedings against a teacher in sexual assault case of class XI student.

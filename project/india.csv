"Arvind Kejriwal's reply flags ammonia, EC to insist on proof of 'poisoning'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwals-reply-flagsammonia-ec-to-insiston-proof-of-poisoning/articleshow/117713268.cms,"Such toxic water poses grave health hazards: Ex-CM

NEW DELHI: Responding to the Election Commission’s notice seeking “evidence” to support his allegation that the BJP govt in Haryana was “poisoning” Delhi’s water supply in the run-up to the Feb 5 polls, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has said that the raw water received from the upper riparian state had been “highly contaminated and (is) extremely poisonous” for human health.This, he said, was also proved by a letter written by the DJB CEO to the chief secretary of the capital in which she had admitted that the level of ammonia in the Yamuna water was 6.5ppm while DJB water treatment plants were designed to treat up to 1pm.Late Wednesday night, EC sources said they were examining the reply but pointed out that it seems to have glossed over the central issue of substantiating the charge of “poisoning” of the water.Late Wednesday night, EC source said Kejriwal had fallen back on the complaint of increased ammonia levels which has already been raised by the Delhi and Punjab chief ministers and which EC is considering separately. The poll body has already asked Haryana govt for a report on the matter.An EC official said Kejriwal’s response did not contain any proof of “poisoning” of the river water by an elected state govt with the intention to kill the residents of Delhi, details of the poisoning agent, or how, when and which engineers at DJB had detected the poison and stopped the “poisoned” waters on the Delhi border. DJB had issued a denial of these claims, call them “false, misleading and factually incorrect”.EC’s letter asking Kejriwal to explain his “serious and unprecedented” charge against an elected govt had said, “…as regards the allegations of poisoning, it is expected that there must be a factual foundation to the allegations. Especially when the veracity of the statements made by you is contested, then you must be able to back your statements on a factual basis.” The reply had been sought following complaints from BJP and Congress.In his 14-page response to EC, the former Delhi chief minister has said that DJB’s CEO had identified indiscriminate discharge of industrial waste by Haryana as the root cause behind high toxicity in Yamuna water, and the state’s failure in controll ing pollution had resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis.He added that this issue had been raised earlier too and DJB had approached NGT and Supreme Court seeking relief. The consumption of such toxic water may lead to grave health hazards and fatality, Kejriwal said, adding that safe drinking water was a basic human right and raising the issue for society cannot be termed as an offence.He said the situation needed immediate institutional and govt intervention, and by no stretch of imagination could raising the issue be termed as “inciting enmity between different groups or prejudicial to national integration”.Referring to the high ammonia level in the Yamuna at the Wazirabad pond, from where the water treatment plants get supply of raw water, Kejriwal had on Monday accused Haryana of mixing “poison” in the river water and alleged that there was an “attempt of genocide” in the national capital.Kejriwal added that the ingestion of ammonia-contam inated water at elevated concentrations posed a severe and multifaceted health hazard and may lead to neurological impairment and encephalopathy, liver and kidney dysfunction, infant mortality risk and bacterial outbreaks.“Any failure to mitigate this contamination places millions of lives at immediate risk and constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to health under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” he said.Referring to various judgments delivered by SC, Kejriwal argued in his letter that his statements did not attract Sections 196 (promoting enmity between different groups), 197 (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 353 (statements conducing to public mischief) of BNS Act; Section 123(4) (corrupt practices-publication of false statements) of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951; and the model code of conduct.Instead, he said, his statements were “fully protected” under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and expression. “As per the law laid down by Supreme Court in similar matters, the effect of the said statement has to be seen and judged from the standard of reasonable and strongminded men and not weak vacillating minds,” he said. “Terming it as an offence has grave consequences for democracy and polity in India and causes a chilling effect on the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression…” he added.He said the chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab will write a letter to EC seeking an urgent meeting and intervention.“Any attempt to suppress discourse on such an alarming public health crisis is not only antithetical to democratic principles but also constitutes a direct affront to the citizens’ right to demand remedial action from the state,” he added.Kejriwal said his statement neither referred to, nor imputed anything against the personal character or conduct of any candidate contesting the elections and urged EC to close the issue.",Arvind Kejriwal says raw water received from upper riparian state had been “highly contaminated and (is) extremely poisonous” for human health.

NEW DELHI: Following a rest day in Wijk aan Zee on Monday, the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament returned with a bang as Gukesh Dommaraju of India became the sole leader in the Masters standings after defeating compatriot Leon Luke Mendonca in a 43-move game on Tuesday.Mendonca, who qualified for the Masters this time by winning the Challengers title in the 86th edition of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament last year, had a challenging task ahead, defending with the black pieces against the current World Chess Champion.Almost two months older than Gukesh, Leon has struggled with health issues during this tournament. Earlier, he also visited the doctor prior to his Round 3 match against Pentala Harikrishna.On Tuesday, he chose the Morphy Defense in a game that began with the Ruy López Opening. After Gukesh castled on the fifth move, Mendonca responded aggressively by pushing his pawns in the Columbus Variation.However, Gukesh opted to maintain his piece structure, and the first capture occurred when he sacrificed his opponent's knight with Bxe3 on move 15.The game remained evenly balanced up until move 30. However, on move 31, Mendonca's Bc8 marked his first misstep. Another mistake came on move 32 with Rd8, and a third error, Bd7 on move 39, gave Gukesh a decisive advantage as he used his queen to dominate Mendonca's central position.By the 43rd move, with Gukesh playing Rf2, Mendonca, sensing there was no escape, resigned immediately.This victory propelled Gukesh to claim sole leadership in the Masters standings. At the same time, the previous co-leader Nodirbek Abdusattorov settled for a draw against Fabiano Caruana, and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu suffered a heavy defeat to Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri .ALSO READ: India to host FIDE Chess World Cup 2025; Arjuna Awardee 'surprised' at the move In the longest-running game in the Masters section, Praggnanandhaa tried to hold his ground against Giri until the very last moment. However, Giri, determined not to take his foot off the paddle, handed the Indian GM his first loss of the tournament in Wijk aan Zee on Tuesday.The game started with a Catalan Opening, during which Praggnanandhaa initially advanced his rook before retreating and pushing his pawns.His first significant mistake came on move 17 when he pushed his pawn to e5. As pieces, including queens, were traded off and the complexity of the game began to evade, Pragg played Rd8.Since losing his opening game against Gukesh, Giri hadn’t lost another game on home soil. Capitalising on Praggnanandhaa's mistake was no challenge for the Dutchman, who expertly pinned the Indian GM to the left side of the board with some impressive moves.As the game entered the endgame, Praggnanandhaa finally accepted defeat on his 64th move and resigned.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In a morale-boosting result for Indian supporters, Arjun Erigaisi, who had been struggling for form, managed a commendable draw against defending Masters champion Wei Yi of China.

"Mumbai Airport Terminal 1 to shut this year, 10 million flyers to shift to Navi Mumbai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-airports-terminal-1-to-shut-this-year-10-million-flyers-to-shift-to-navi-mumbai/articleshow/117631636.cms,"Poll What’s the Most Annoying Part of Traveling Through Airports? Delayed or Canceled Flights Long Lines at Security

MUMBAI: Passengers will face a clear choice when the Navi Mumbai airport begins operations in late May: should they select the new airport or continue using the one in Mumbai? However, within a decade, this choice will become less pronounced as the Navi Mumbai airport takes the lead. According to projections, by the early 2030s, it should handle most flights in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), becoming its primary airport, with the Mumbai airport assuming a secondary role.This winter, though, only about one-fifth of the 55 million passengers currently handled by the Mumbai airport will head to the Navi Mumbai airport. Of the 15 million passengers handled by Mumbai’s Terminal 1 (T1) at Santacruz (East), flights carrying 10 million passengers are likely to shift to T1 of NMIA by the end of October, while the remaining 5 million will be accommodated at Mumbai’s Terminal 2 (T2) in Sahar, said an NMIA official. To accommodate this shift, the capacity of Mumbai T2 will be increased from 40 million to 45 million passengers, the source added.Currently, all flights—domestic and international—land on the single operational runway at Mumbai airport, after which passengers are transported to their respective terminals, T2 or T1. Most general aviation flights, including private and charter aircraft, will also transition to the Navi Mumbai airport in the coming months. This winter, air traffic congestion at the Mumbai airport is expected to ease, improving its punctuality record. As a result, the holding time for flights waiting to land at Mumbai airport or the waiting time to begin pushback for departures is likely to decrease, improving on-time performance.In the long term, the busy and congested Mumbai airport will take the number two position as MMR’s secondary airport. The world’s great cities are usually served by multiple airports, with one being the main airport and the others serving as secondary airports. For example, in London, Heathrow is the busiest airport, while Gatwick, Stansted, and Luton serve as secondary airports. Similarly, New York’s main airport is John F. Kennedy, with Newark Liberty and LaGuardia functioning as secondary airports.The current Mumbai airport handled 55 million passengers in 2024. It will remain Mumbai’s Heathrow this decade, during which the new Navi Mumbai airport at Ulwe will serve as the metropolis’s Gatwick, expected to handle around 10 million passengers this year and 20 million by mid-2026.The Navi Mumbai T1 has a declared passenger handling capacity of 20 million ppa, or about 55,000 per day. It is expected to reach saturation point by mid-2026—probably the shortest saturation time in the world for a greenfield airport terminal. Navi Mumbai T2, with a declared capacity of 30 million ppa, will be ready by 2029. “Between 2026 and 2029, Mumbai T2 and Navi Mumbai T1 terminal buildings will be expanded to exceed their declared capacity in order to handle the passenger traffic growth,” the official added.The new airport will continue expanding, adding terminal buildings and increasing capacity. It will continue to resemble a construction site for years, as work progresses across its 2,860 acres over the next decade.The congested Mumbai airport will struggle to keep pace with the growth of the Navi Mumbai airport, and by 2030, both airports will handle over 50-55 million PPA each, competing closely. But as the Navi Mumbai airport continues to expand, a role reversal will occur by 2032: it will take on the mantle of the region’s main airport—its Heathrow—complete with parallel runways. In 2032, the Navi Mumbai airport will have its Terminal 3, with a capacity of 20 million PPA, and later Terminal 4 in 2036, also with a 20-million PPA capacity. This will take Navi Mumbai airport’s capacity to 90 million PPA, a number that the congested Mumbai airport cannot match. Mumbai airport, much like Gatwick in London with its single runway, will become the region’s secondary airport.BVJK Sharma, CEO of Navi Mumbai International Airport, said: “The Navi Mumbai airport is well supported by multimodal connectivity, and we are confident in meeting MMR’s ever-increasing demand. I am positive that the airport will contribute greatly to the region’s and country’s growth.”The final stage of this competition between the two airports will mark a major decline for Mumbai airport, which was India’s busiest until 2010. Hemmed in by slums and without the possibility of land acquisition, the Mumbai airport hasn’t been able to expand. With infrastructure constraints stifling its growth, Delhi airport has surpassed it to claim the top spot among the country’s airports, a rank that the National Capital Region will continue to occupy.The Navi Mumbai airport will not restore the Mumbai Metropolitan Region's position as the leader in this category, as Delhi airport, along with the new Jewar airport—which is also set to open this year—will have a higher passenger-handling capacity than Mumbai and Navi Mumbai combined.","The new Navi Mumbai airport begins operations in late May.

All drawn by the faith that bathing in the holy waters can lead to salvation.Wednesday, we knew, was the big day - Mauni Amavasya - the most auspicious of the six dates for the Amrit Snan. Crores of faithful were expected. Though there were six ghats, it was Sangam that drew everyone. There was a short window till 4am for devotees before only sadhus were allowed access to the river.By 1am, we joined the flow of humanity - not to bathe, but to reach a photographers' platform, hoping to capture the scale of this grand spiritual gathering.

The aftermath was haunting - an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional cries of children, heaps of discarded clothes, footwear, and bags covered the ground, more than we had ever seen in our lives. We only hoped no one was trapped beneath them.We gathered our thoughts and cameras. We had come to capture vignettes of a vibrant spiritual celebration. We are leaving with frames of a heartbreaking tragedy.","At 1am, we joined the flow of humanity.

The area denial munitions have the capability to saturate a target area with multiple bomblets, including anti-tank and anti-personnel minelets.The two types of ammunition will be produced by the Nagpur-based private sector Solar Group and state-owned Munitions India Ltd in a 60:40 ratio, with the contracts now set to be inked with them within the next few days, sources told TOI.The Army currently has four Pinaka regiments, with some of the launchers also deployed in high-altitude areas along the northern borders with China, while the other six are in the process of being inducted.DRDO has developed a variety of ammunition for the Pinaka, including rockets with 45-km extended range and 75-km guided extended range. The plan now underway is to further enhance the range first to 120-km and then to 300-km.“As soon as we get longer ranges, we might drop plans for other alternate long-range weapons we are looking at and concentrate on it (Pinaka),” Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had stated earlier this month.","PM-led cabinet committee on security cleared two major deals worth around Rs 10,200 crore for its lethal ammunition.

How many triple talaq FIRs filed on Muslim men: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-many-triple-talaq-firs-filed-on-muslim-men-sc/articleshow/117710188.cms,"NEW DELHI: Terming the practice of instant divorce through triple talaq as indefensible after a five-judge bench in 2017 declared it unconstitutional, Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would examine the validity of the post-judgment legislation providing for up to three-year jail term for Muslim men persisting with the practice of abruptly ending their marriages by uttering the dreaded T-word thrice.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""If the practice of triple talaq is banned, no Muslim man can divorce his wife through this process. So, even if the marriage survives, the man would be liable for a jail term under Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, merely for uttering triple talaq.""To know the ground situation, the bench asked the Centre to furnish data on registration of FIRs against Muslim men across India for attempting to divorce their wives through triple talaq despite it being declared unconstitutional by SC in 2017 and criminalised by law in 2019.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said ""the statistics would give the real picture of the situation in rural areas"" and justified the need to criminalise the practice, adding that SC declaring talaq-e-bidat, or triple talaq, as unconstitutional did not deter Muslim men from continuing with the practice. He said unlike most laws enacted to protect women from abuse, harassment and discrimination that provide for a minimum punishment of three years, the 2019 law has set the maximum punishment at three years, while leaving it to the discretion of the court to decide the quantum of imprisonment and fine.Many Muslim organisations have questioned the validity of the 2019 legislation on the ground that once a practice was banned, there was no question of any Muslim man obtaining a legally valid divorce through this method. Senior advocate M R Shamshad and counsel Nizamuddin Pasha said mere utterance of triple talaq could not be criminalised and made liable to prison term. This threat of imprisonment for similar utterances by men professing other religions was not there, hence the 2019 law was discriminatory, they argued.CJI Khanna said for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians, marriage laws are codified and provide a procedure for divorce with no provision for instant divorce. ""Let the Centre file the requisite data. We will examine it,"" the bench said and posted the matter for the last week of March.Mehta said govt, by enacting the law, intended to stop exploitation of Muslim women who had the threat of triple talaq hanging over their heads. Referring to the 2017 five-judge bench judgment on the lead petition by 35-year-old Shayara Bano, who had challenged the regressive practice that ended her 15-year marriage in an instant, SG quoted a famous couplet, ""Talaq toh dete ho itab-o-kahar ke saath, mera shabab bhi lauta do meri mehr ke saath (you are giving me talaq with anger, but as you return my mehr money, also return my youth).""The Centre in its affidavit had countered the petitioners' argument that marriage being governed by personal law must be exempted from the ambit of criminal law. The Centre's affidavit said, ""Marriages are a social institution which the state has a special interest in protecting. It is beyond doubt that the state can protect the stability of marriages by resorting to the device of criminal law."" It cited enactment of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, and Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.Shamshad argued that police took months to register FIRs under DV Act despite allegations of physical assault by husbands, yet they registered FIRs instantaneously under the 2019 law and sent Muslim men to jail.",Supreme Court to examine validity of post-judgment legislation providing for up to three-year jail term for Muslim men persisting with the practice of abruptly ending their marriages by uttering the dreaded T-word thrice.

30 die in stampede at Kumbh on morning of auspicious dip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/30-die-in-stampede-at-kumbh-on-morning-of-auspicious-dip/articleshow/117706943.cms,"Cops Deny VIP Protocols Led To Slackness In Crowd Control



PRAYAGRAJ: At least 30 pilgrims died and over 60 were injured in a stampede on Akhara Marg early Wednesday after a rush of visitors converging on Sangam for a dip in the opening hours of Maha Kumbh's 'mauni amavasya' - the most auspicious period in the 45-day event's calendar - led to barricades collapsing and opened the gateway to chaos for close to an hour.The 1-2am tragedy capped a crowd management nightmare, marked by over 12 crore pilgrims swamping the Maha Kumbh area over the past two days leading to mauni amavasya. Nearly 5.5 crore had taken a dip in the waters of the Sangam by late Tuesday, according to official data. As the night wore on, the congregation only grew.Witnesses said some pilgrims started climbing over the barricades on Akhara Marg in their eagerness to reach the Sangam nose, causing these to collapse. The stream of people behind them approaching the Sangam Ram Ghat immediately rushed forward, trampling pilgrims sitting or lying on the ground on the other side of where the barricades stood in anticipation of ""Brahma muhurt"" (break of dawn).As ambulance sirens rent the night air, security personnel and rescue workers were seen carrying many of the injured on stretchers to waiting vehicles. Blankets, bags and footwear lay strewn across the stampede site.A 50-year-old woman from MP's Chhatarpur district was among those killed. Her daughter, 20, was critically injured. Hukum Bai Lodhi was in a group of 14 from Sunwaha village that had travelled 400km to Prayagraj.Sarpanch Chatur Singh, who led the pilgrims from Sunwaha, said it took workers nearly two hours to find Hukum Bai's body as the crowd kept surging. Her daughter Deepa was rescued and taken to a local hospital.Four of the dead were pilgrims from Karnataka's Belagavi. An injured woman, Sarojini, said she and the rest of the group were awaiting their turn to take a dip in Sangam when an avalanche of feet drove everyone to the ground. ""I don't know how I survived in the darkness,"" she said.Official sources said the authorities chose to withhold the official casualty figure until Wednesday evening to avert panic among the crowd of devotees already in the mela area.CM Yogi Adityanath, who arrived at the site within an hour and monitored the situation through the night, turned emotional while revealing that 30 people had died.He declared ex gratia of Rs 25 lakh each to the families of the deceased and instituted a judicial probe by a three-member committee led by former HC judge Harsh Kumar. Retired IPS officer V K Gupta and ex-IAS officer B K Singh are the other members. Police will conduct a separate probe.""What happened here is heart-wrenching, and a lesson. There is a need to go into the details of how it happened despite all the arrangements in place,"" Adityanath said. ""PM Narendra Modi called four times to inquire about the rescue effort. I urge pilgrims not to pay heed to rumours.""Akhara Parishad chief Ravindra Puri initially announced that the second Amrit Snan had been cancelled. At the CM's intervention, all 13 akharas went for Amrit Snan around 2.30pm instead of the scheduled 5am start.""I spoke to the Akhara Parishad heads and other seers, including Maha Mandaleshwars. They politely agreed to let devotees take a dip first,"" Adityanath said.Undeterred by the stampede, more than 7.6 crore people took the dip at Sangam during the Mauni Amavasya Amrit Snan by 8.30 pm on Wednesday. With this, nearly 27.6 crore devotees went for 'snan' in just 16 days during the ongoing Maha Kumbh, surpassing the previous record of 24 crore pilgrims in 2019 Kumbh.As per the data released by mela authorities, devotees took the dip at different temporary ghats built on the banks of the Ganga over a stretch of 12km. Nearly 2.8 crore devotees had taken the dip by 8am. The number swelled to over 5 crore by 2pm.Vehicles were stopped far away from the city to keep the situation under control and devotees were sent to ghats via a longer route. But the pilgrims were undeterred by the news of the stampede and route diversions put in place by the administration following the tragedy. They walked long distances for the dip.All roads leading to the mela area witnessed a heavy inflow of devotees, so much so that the entire stretch of a road was not visible at several points. Since early hours of Wednesday, a sea of devotees continued to move towards the mela area. All the roads in areas such as Civil Lines, Katra Shivkuti, Kydganj, Mutthiganj and Bahadurganj remained choked with devouts.DIG Vaibhav Krishna said rescue workers moved the injured pilgrims to various hospitals, of whom 30 died. At least 25 of the dead, including one each from Assam and Gujarat, have been identified.""A helpline (1920) has been set up to coordinate relief efforts, and hospitals have been reinforced with additional medical personnel to handle the crisis,"" Krishna said.On whether VIP protocols led to slackness in crowd management, the DIG said, ""No VIP vehicle was allowed entry to ensure an unrestricted pilgrimage experience for the general public.""Mela officer Vijay Kiran Anand confirmed this policy would continue for the upcoming Amrit Snan on Basant Panchami.Over 27 crore people have visited Maha Kumbh since it started on Jan 13, as per official estimates. The footfall surpassed the 2019 record of 24 crore in 15 days.","At least 30 pilgrims died and over 60 were injured in a stampede on Akhara Marg early Wednesday.

Poll Do You Think the Allegations Against Haryana Are Justified? No, It’s an Unwarranted Accusation Yes, It’s a Valid Concern

NEW DELHI: AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday responded to the Election Commission over the allegations he made against BJP government in Haryana of 'mixing poison in Yamuna water'. EC on Tuesday had served notice to Kejriwal, asking him to prove his claim to avoid legal troubles that could lead to three years of jail term.In a 14-page letter signed by him, addressed to Election Commission secretary BC Patra, Kejriwal claimed that, ""that the statement attributed to the undersigned was made in the context of an urgent and alarming public health crisis concerning the deteriorating quality of drinking water in Delhi, necessitating immediate institutional and governmental intervention.""Further asserting his claims, Kejriwal said, ""The alleged statements were made in furtherance of an imperative public duty to highlight the severe toxicity and contamination of raw water received from Haryana, which presents an imminent and direct threat to public health.""""The raw water received from Haryana recently is highly contaminated and extremely poisonous for human health. That the contamination levels in the raw water are so extreme that the Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) in Delhi are unable to process it to bring it within safe and permissible limits,"" the ex-Delhi CM added in his response.Amid his direct allegations against BJP, Kejriwal claimed that the statements are ""rooted solely in the public interest"". ""intention behind the said statement was to raise an important public issue about extremely toxicity raw water being supplied to Delhi and also to secure to the citizens of Delhi safe water for its consumption. The said statement by no stretch of imagination be termed as inciting enmity between different groups or prejudicial to national integration. On the contrary, the substance and purpose of these statements are rooted solely in the public interest, aimed at highlighting a legitimate civic concern that requires urgent institutional intervention,"" the letter read.Additionally, Kejriwal highlighted the serious health risks associated with elevated ammonia levels in water, noting specific conditions such as liver and kidney disorders, neurological complications, and encephalopathy.Kejriwal also addressed the concerns around his allegations lining up with the Delhi poll and thus breach the model code of conduct. ""Upon a careful examination of the facts, context, and legal provisions, it is respectfully submitted that the statement made by undersigned are fully protected under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and expression, and no offence or any violation of Code of Conduct is committed by the undersigned, "" he claimed.He also mentioned against viewing his claims as an offence, as such an interpretation could establish a problematic pattern that would weaken the ability to hold states accountable. ""The political and constitutional implications of labeling an environmental and public health crisis as an electoral offence are profound and deeply concerning. If raising genuine public grievances—particularly concerning the basic necessity of clean drinking water—is curtailed on the pretext of election law violations, it would set a dangerous precedent of silencing dissent and obstructing democratic accountability,"" was also stated in the letter.As the row continues, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini refuted the accusations, earlier in the day, by taking a sip from the river in Delhi's Palla village. Kejriwal countered Saini's actions by claiming that he didn't actually drink but ""spat it out"".Kejriwal has also been summoned by Sonipat court on February 17 over these claims.","AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday responded to the Election Commission over the allegations he made against BJP government in Haryana.

Trump admin set to push India to ink more defence deals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-admin-set-to-push-india-to-ink-more-defence-deals/articleshow/117703867.cms,"NEW DELHI: From fighter jets and armoured combat vehicles to aero-engines and missiles, Trump administration is set to push India to further crank up military purchase from US, which already stands at well over $25 billion just since 2007.President Donald Trump’s transactional approach was clearly evident in his phone conversation with PM Narendra Modi on Monday, where he called upon India to increase its procurement of US-origin weapon systems and platforms.“India will have to negotiate carefully with the new Trump administration. US military technology is certainly top-notch, but it will have to dovetail into our policy of ‘Make in India’ with foreign collaboration at a reasonable cost. India wants codevelopment and co-production instead of just outright purchases,” an official said.Trump’s push comes barely four months after India inked a mega $3.3 billion contract with US govt for 31 weaponized MQ-9B ‘Predator’ remotely piloted aircraft, along with another $520 million contract with drone-manufacturer General Atomics to set up an MRO facility here.But that was during the last days of the Biden administration. Trump will want his own pound of flesh in terms of big deals, apart of course from strategic convergence on several fronts. There are, of course, the ongoing techno-commercial negotiations, which began last month, for co-production of the American General Electric F414-INS6 aeroengines with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India for Tejas Mark-II fighters. The deal, which involves 80% transfer of technology of engine parts of the total value, will cost around $1.5 billion.US has also been hard-selling joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) as part of the bilateral defence-industrial cooperation roadmap, which was finalised in June 2023.With the Army projecting a requirement for 527 wheeled ICVs as part of its much bigger plan for mechanized infantry units, US quietly demonstrated the mobility and firepower of the eight-wheeled Stryker, with the Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, in high-altitude Ladakh in Sept, amid some criticism of indigenous options being ignored in the process.The US is also eyeing IAF’s long-standing quest for 114 new multi-role fighter aircraft to be manufactured in India, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration. With the defence ministry now working to break the logjam over the project, US will be showcasing its F-16 and fifth-generation F-35 fighters at Aero-India in Bengaluru from Feb 10 to 14. US would like India to also buy another six P-8I longrange maritime patrol aircraft to add to the 12 similar planes packed with weapons and sensors it has acquired for $3.2 billion earlier.","President Donald Trump’s transactional approach was clearly evident in his phone conversation with PM Narendra Modi on Monday.

A viral video showing a senior female professor and a first-year student performing a Hindu wedding ritual in the classroom has sparked outrage.The footage, which went viral, is from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT) in West Bengal. It showed the professor—dressed as a bride—and the student exchanging garlands and applying sindoor (vermilion), key customs of a traditional Hindu wedding.As the videos circulated on social media, outrage grew, with many questioning the appropriateness of such an act inside a university. According to PTI, the university administration quickly stepped in, forming a three-member inquiry panel to investigate the matter. Officials confirmed that the professor had been asked to go on leave until the probe was completed. The student involved has also been advised to stay away from classes for now.The professor, in her defence, told university authorities that the act was part of a psycho-drama demonstration for her class. She insisted there was no misconduct or immoral intent behind it. According to her, the videos were meant for internal documentation but were leaked to tarnish the reputation of the Psychology Department.PTI quoted MAKAUT’s officiating vice-chancellor Tapas Chakraborty acknowledging the professor’s explanation but said that, given the public reaction, the university had to take action. ""She has clarified that it was an academic project and not meant for external circulation,"" he said. ""However, since the videos have gone viral and created a controversy, we have asked her to proceed on leave until the committee submits its report.""The inquiry committee consists of three female faculty members from different departments. Their findings will determine whether the professor’s actions were purely academic or if any disciplinary action is needed.","A viral video showing a senior female professor and a first-year student performing a Hindu wedding ritual in the classroom has sparked outrage.

NEW DELHI: The water dispute between Delhi and Haryana escalated on Wednesday as AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal claimed that Haryana Chief Minister Naib Singh Saini 's act of drinking Yamuna water was deceptive, suggesting he ""pretended"" and ""spat back the water"".This follows Kejriwal's earlier assertion on Tuesday that Haryana administration had ""poisoned"" Delhi's water supply, potentially endangering residents.During his visit to Yamuna's banks at Delhi's Palla village today, chief minister Saini countered Kejriwal's allegations by taking a sip from the river.However, sharing the video, Kejriwal claimed, ""Haryana Chief Minister Naib Singh Saini pretended to drink Yamuna water... and then spat the same water back into the Yamuna.""""When I said that Yamuna water could be dangerous for the lives of Delhiites due to ammonia contamination, they threatened to file an FIR against me.

"Mixed schoolbag: Attendance up, but digi-learning uneven",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mixed-schoolbag-attendance-up-but-digi-learning-uneven/articleshow/117711222.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's education landscape in 2024 showed mixed progress in key areas such as school attendance, digital literacy, and the reduction in underage enrolment, according to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024. While overall school attendance had improved marginally, digital literacy among students remains uneven, and there was a noteworthy decline in the proportion of underage children enrolling in govt schools.Student attendance in govt schools had steadily increased since 2018. Nationally, attendance in govt primary schools rose from 72.4% in 2018 to 75.9% in 2024. However, ASER data revealed stark state-wise disparities. Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh recorded attendance levels above 85%, whereas states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar lagged with figures around 65%. UP played a crucial role in driving the national increase in attendance, according to the ASER survey.Digital literacy emerged as a crucial area of focus, yet the findings indicate wide variations across states. Nationally, about 70.2% of boys and 62.2% of girls aged 14-16 could access a smartphone for digital tasks. The survey assessed children on basic digital skills such as setting an alarm, browsing for information, and locating a video on YouTube. Over 75% of those tested were able to complete the tasks successfully.Gender disparities were evident, with boys outperforming girls in most states except Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, where the gap was either negligible or reversed. Access to smartphones was nearly universal, with 90% of students reporting availability at home, but ownership was significantly lower, particularly among girls. In Bihar, Jharkhand & MP, both access and usage of smartphones were below national average. ""Many students have smartphones at home but lack digital skills,"" stated an ASER field coordinator.The report highlights both progress and persistent challenges in India's education sector. While improvements in attendance and digital literacy are encouraging, gender gaps and regional inequalities remain concerns. The decline in underage enrolment marks a significant structural shift, likely to have positive long-term impacts on learning outcomes.

Desperation or calculated risk: What's behind Kejriwal's 'poisoned Yamuna water' remark?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desperation-or-calculated-risk-whats-behind-kejriwals-poisoned-yamuna-water-remark/articleshow/117696673.cms,"Poll Do You Think the Allegations Against Haryana Are Justified? No, It’s an Unwarranted Accusation Yes, It’s a Valid Concern

NEW DELHI: "" Biological warfare "", ""mass murder"", ""water terrorism"", ""genocide"" ... Is Arvind Kejriwal 's ""poisoned Delhi's water"" salvo against BJP's Haryana government a sign of desperation or is it a calculated risk to alter the direction of Delhi campaign by deflecting attention from opposition's relentless attacks over allegations of corruption against him and his Aam Aadmi Party Kejriwal's all-out offensive against the BJP-led Haryana government - accusing it of poisoning Delhi's water - has taken the centrestage in Delhi's campaign with Prime Minister Narendra Modi leading the charge against the AAP chief.""A former CM has made malicious allegations against the people of Haryana. AAP-da people have become desperate due to the fear of defeat. Is Haryana different from Delhi? Don't they have children and relatives in Delhi? Will they mix poison for their own people?"" PM Modi said at a rally hitting out at Kejriwal.""Can anyone think that to poison Modi, Haryana BJP has mixed poison in water? What are you saying? It is in Indians' character to forgive mistakes but neither Delhi nor India forgives sins committed with ill-intention,"" the Prime Minister added.The Congress was also quick to join the charge with Rahul Gandhi throwing an open ""drink Yamuna water"" dare at Kejriwal. "" Five years ago, he (Kejriwal) had stated that he will take a bath in the Yamuna and drink its water. Five years have gone by and he did not do so. You have to drink dirty water but Kejriwal lives in 'sheesh mahal' which is worth crores and lies to you,"" the former Congress chief said at a rally.Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini, who had earlier said that Kejriwal has lost his mental balance as he stares at imminent defeat in Delhi, went a step further and visited the banks of the Yamuna River in Delhi's Palla village and took a sip of water to counter the AAP chief's accusations. Saini accused Kejriwal of attempts to ""create fear in the minds of people"" for political gain.The Haryana government has announced to sue Kejriwal. ""Kejriwal has made an irresponsible statement spreading panic among the people of Delhi and Haryana. Haryana government is going to get a case registered against him before CJM Court in Sonipat under the Disaster Management Act's Sections 2 (D) and 54,"" Haryana's revenue and disaster management minister Vipul Goel said. The provision which Goel referred to regarding the Act pertains to anyone making or circulating a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic.Not just the Haryana government, even the Election Commission of India has put the AAP chief on notice.On Tuesday, the EC had warned Kejriwal of the grave consequences he could face if he did not provide evidence to substantiate his allegations. The EC had asked Kejriwal to provide details of the nature and extent of the chemicals used for ""poisoning"" the Yamuna which could have killed people in large numbers, as claimed by the AAP chief. Kejriwal was also asked to share details of his claim that engineers of Delhi Jal Board had actually detected and prevented it on time.Kejriwal has replied to the Election Commission. In his 14-page response, Kejriwal has said that his Yamuna water remark was in context of public health crisis due to drinking water quality in Delhi.""The statements on Yamuna water were made to highlight severe toxicity, contamination of raw water received from Haryana,"" Kejriwal has written in his reply. ""Raw water received from Haryana recently was highly contaminated and extremely poisonous for human health,"" he added.Earlier, the AAP chief had said that he is not afraid of legal action and had asserted he would not let people die in Delhi because of the ""dirty, poisonous water"". ""They are threatening to file a case against me. They sent me to jail, will they hang me now?"" he asked.Kejriwal, who is now ready to play the martyr, would have surely anticipated much of these reactions before levelling such serious allegations against a neighbouring state government.So, why did he precipitate the matter? Was AAP on a sticky wicket over corruption allegations?Well, no one would have a definitive answer to that for now. But the BJP's continued offensive against its government coupled with the sharp attacks from the Congress also seems to have put AAP under pressure.AAP was definitely in the pole position to do well in the 2025 elections after decimating its political opponents not once, but twice in the last ten years. In 2015, AAP won 67 out of 70 Delhi assembly seats with a vote share of 54.3%. Five years later in 2020, AAP maintained its dominance winning 62 seats and polling 53.6% of votes.But Kejriwal's campaign for a hat trick of victories in Delhi has been marred by allegations of corruption that saw the AAP chief and most of his ministers go to jail. Kejriwal, who is out on bail, eventually resigned and handed over the reigns of his government to Atishi. Kejriwal, whose claim to fame was his simple and transparent politics, also faces charges of extravagance in renovating the CM's bungalow, referred to by opposition as the ""Sheesh Mahal."" Besides, AAP also faces anti-incumbency after being in power for 10 years on the trot.While the issue of corruption and governance may have put the AAP on the backfoot, the Yamuna water pitch has allowed the party to go aggressive even at the cost of some legal action. Kejriwal, who has claimed that he is raising the water issue for the safety of people of Delhi, would not mind playing the martyr.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads the charge against the AAP chief.

""You drink Yamuna's water and then we'll meet in the hospital,"" he added while criticising Kejriwal for the pollution in the Yamuna river Additionally, Gandhi slammed Kejriwal for allegedly running a corrupt administration, saying the ""biggest scam"" in Delhi took place under his watch. He accused the AAP leader of deceiving the public with promises of clean governance while living in luxury. ""Today the whole Delhi knows that Kejriwal has committed the biggest liquor scam. Delhi has come to know that Kejriwal does not fulfill his promises,"" also said Rahul.Gandhi also reiterated the Congress party ’s commitment to conducting a caste census and breaching the 50% cap on reservations, challenging Kejriwal to take a clear stand on the issue.As the Congress and AAP contest the February 5 Delhi assembly polls separately despite being part of the INDIA bloc, Gandhi’s sharp attacks indicate an escalating political battle in the capital.",Rahul Gandhi steps up his attack on AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal.

NEW DELHI: Observing that there is no concept of state domicile in the Constitution, which only recognises domicile of India, Supreme Court on Wednesday said domicile-based reservation in specialised and higher studies like postgraduate (PG) medical courses is not permissible and quota for residents of states could be extended to a certain degree in undergraduate (UG) courses like MBBS.Differentiating between MBBS and higher studies, a bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia and SVN Bhatti said quota for UG courses was justified as the state spends money on creating infra and bears expenses on running a medical college.Supreme Court said quota for UG courses was justified as the state spends money on creating infra. Therefore, some reservation at the basic level of a medical course, i.e. MBBS, can be permissible for the residents, it said.""We are all domiciled in the territory of India. We are all residents of India. Our common bond as citizens and residents of one country gives us right not only to choose our residence anywhere in India, but also gives us right to carry on trade and business or a profession anywhere in India. It also gives us the right to seek admission in educational institutions across India,"" the bench said.""The benefit of reservation in educational institutions, including medical colleges, to those who reside in a particular state can be given to a certain degree only in MBBS courses. But considering the importance of specialists doctors, reservation at the higher level on the basis of residence would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,"" it added.Justice Dhulia, who penned the verdict for the bench, said if such reservation was permitted in PG courses, it would be an invasion on the fundamental rights of several students, who would be treated unequally simply for the reason that they belonged to a different state in the Union, and this would be a violation of the equality clause in Article 14. He said each citizen of the country carried with him or her one single domicile, which was the ""domicile of India"", and the concept of regional or provincial domicile was alien to the Indian legal system.The court said the classification between residents and others for MBBS courses could be justified as it sought to maintain a balance of local needs, backwardness of the area, the expense borne by the state in creating the infrastructure etc. The bench agreed with the submission of senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta, appearing for a batch of aggrieved students, that reservation in admissions to PG medical courses within the state quota was constitutionally invalid and impermissible. In this case, the students were challenging 32 seats earmarked for Chandigarh residents in Govt Medical College and Hospital.The bench referred to SC's earlier verdict, including one by a constitution bench, and said all admissions to PG courses in any institution should be open to candidates on an all-India basis and there should be no restriction regarding domicile in the state/UT in which the institution was located.","Supreme Court said quota for UG courses was justified as the state spends money on creating infra.

However, state-wise disparities remain stark, underscoring the uneven impact of interventions.The report, covering nearly 6.5 lakh children across 17,997 villages, revealed that in reading proficiency, the national average for children in standard III who can read a standard II level text has risen to 23.4%, the highest recorded in over a decade, up from 16.3% in 2022. The proportion of standard V students achieving this benchmark has also increased to 44.8% from 38.5% in 2022, surpassing the pre-pandemic 2018 level of 44.2%. Among states, Mizoram (64.9%) and Himachal Pradesh (64.8%) recorded the highest reading proficiency for standard V students in govt schools.UP emerged as the most improved state, where standard III reading levels rose from 16.4% in 2022 to 27.9% in 2024, marking a 69% increase in two years. Other notable gainers include Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Haryana, and Maharashtra. In contrast, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana saw declines in reading levels, particularly in standard VIII.Arithmetic skills have also improved, with 33.7% of standard III students demonstrating subtraction proficiency, up from 25.9% in 2022 and 28.2% in 2018. Among standard V students, 30.7% could solve a division problem, marking an increase from 25.6% in 2022.The strongest arithmetic gains were observed in Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Punjab. Uttar Pradesh recorded its highest arithmetic learning levels in 20 years, further strengthening its recovery trajectory. Private schools, however, showed weaker improvements compared to govt schools, highlighting the effectiveness of public sector interventions such as National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat.Despite these improvements, the lowest-performing states in reading for standard V include Bihar (14.8%), Madhya Pradesh (16.0%), Rajasthan (17.5%), Telangana (20.3%), and Punjab (14.0%).

He highlighted that, for the first time, 'Pasmanda' (backward) Muslims, the poor, women and orphans were included among the beneficiaries of waqf, an endowment made by Muslims for charitable and religious purposes.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as adopted, lays down that existing registered 'waqf by user' will continue to be recognised as waqf, except in cases where property is under dispute or owned by the govt. It has also endorsed the govt's move to include non-Muslims in waqf boards.As per the bill, waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community. Also, Muslim trusts that function similarly to waqf but are governed by trust laws will be excluded from Waqf Act, 1995, preventing legal conflicts. The finality of tribunal decisions has been removed. Any aggrieved person can now appeal to HC within 90 days of the tribunal's decision.In his dissent note, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said last-minute inclusion of the proviso to the clause omitting 'waqf by user' was ""wholly unhelpful"" as the principle will only be tested in cases where the property is placed ""in dispute"", in which case proviso will not apply.Congress member Gaurav Gogoi in his dissent note expressed fear over possibility of bad-faith actors instituting litigation over any part of the properties belonging to 'waqf by user' and preventing it from seeking any protection under the amended Act.TMC members Kalyan Banerjee and Nadimul Haque objected to the amendment to the original Act that states if any govt property is identified or declared as waqf property, before or after the enforcement of this Act, it shall not be a waqf property.",The Joint Parliamentary Committee examining the Waqf (Amendment) Bill on Wednesday adopted its report by a 15-11 majority vote. The report will be submitted along with the redrafted legislation to Lok Sabha speaker on Thursday. The bill is likely to be tabled in LS next week.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117710572,imgsize-41328,width-400,resizemode-4/117710572.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over ""deteriorating standard"" of public prosecutors, Supreme Court Wednesday said state govts should refrain from appointing them solely based on political considerations.SC said that the office of a public prosecutor is a public office, and only capable and competent lawyers with strong reputation and prestige should be appointed to it.Noting that a prosecutor didn't correct Punjab & Haryana HC when it committed a grave error in convicting three people in a case, SC said, ""Such is the standard of public prosecutors in HCs... This is bound to happen when state govts appoint AGPs and APPs based on political considerations. Favouritism and nepotism are additional factors for compromising merit."" TNNThis judgement is a message to all state govts that the AGPs and APPs in respective HCs should be appointed solely on the merit of the person.

Grap-3 bans construction activities and plying of BS-3 diesel and BS-4 petrol cars across Delhi-NCR.The air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was measured at 349 at 11 am, which further worsened to 360 at 3 pm and 379 at 6 pm, with many areas, including Bawana, Anand Vihar, Okhla, Punjabi Bagh, Rohini, Vivek Vihar and Wazirpur, badly hit.

The forecast suggests AQI will hover within 'very poor' range in the coming days.The minimum temperature rose to 6.4°C, two notches below normal, from 5.6 a day earlier. The maximum was recorded at 25.5, three notches above normal. IMD predicts temperatures to rise further by 2-3°C over the next few days.As the air quality began to dip, the CAQM called for a meeting to review the situation.

NEW DELHI: Canada continues to interfere in India's internal affairs, creating an ""environment for illegal migration and organised criminal activities"", the Centre said on Wednesday in a statement that strongly rubbished a Canadian inquiry commission report alleging interference by India in the country's internal affairs.""We reject the report's insinuations on India and expect that the support system enabling illegal migration will not be further countenanced,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.New Delhi's mention of illegal migration is significant as it comes amid a surge in the number of Indians looking to make their way unlawfully into US through Canada border.According to reports from Ottawa on Tuesday, an inquiry into foreign interference in Canada's recent elections called on intel agencies and federal govt to urgently reform how they respond to ""meddling"" by China, India and other state actors before the next national polls. The report alleged India is the second-most active country engaging in foreign interference in Canada.It (India) uses disinformation as a key tactic that may be used more often in the future, and it may have attempted to clandestinely provide financial support to preferred candidates during the 2021 election without the candidates' knowledge,"" the report in Canada said.India, however, has maintained that it is Canada that has sought to interfere in Indian affairs, and had expelled 41 Canadian diplomats in 2023, even accusing them of supporting terrorist activities. This followed a diplomatic row over the killing of a Sikh separatist, for which Ottawa blamed the Indian govt.According to US authorities, over 40,000 Indian nationals attempted entry through that route last year. The Indian govt has been under pressure from the Trump administration to take back close to 18,000 Indian nationals facing final removal order.","Canada continues to interfere in India's internal affairs, Centre says.

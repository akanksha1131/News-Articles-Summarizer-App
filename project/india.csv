'Invitees list given by Shashi Tharoor': Hardeep Puri on 2009 dinner with George Soros,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invitees-list-given-by-shashi-tharoor-hardeep-puri-on-2009-dinner-with-george-soros/articleshow/116523193.cms,"Hardeep Puri and Shashi Tharoor (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday hit back at Congress MP Shashi Tharoor 's claims regarding a 2009 dinner in New York attended by US billionaire George Soros . Puri, who was India's ambassador to the United Nations at the time, hosted the dinner where Tharoor, then minister of state, was a guest.Puri responded to Tharoor’s recent post on X, saying that it was Tharoor who provided the list of invitees for the dinner, which included Soros. ""In retrospect, it is clear the name was included because the gentleman in question was among the benefactors of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation , and the minister of state was keen to meet him,"" Puri wrote.He also added that Tharoor had previously met Soros in May 2009 and tweeted about the interaction. ""Language has frequently been accorded pride of place amongst the arts of deception. Some of my friends in the Congress Party excel in obfuscation; but they tweet at their own peril,"" Puri said, taking a dig at Tharoor.""Since I was just a few months old in the city then, but Dr Tharoor had spent considerable time in New York, I did not choose the list of invitees for the dinner. It was given to me by minister Tharoor,"" the Union minister added.The controversy arose after a BJP worker highlighted a 2009 tweet in which Tharoor referred to Soros as an ""old friend"" and praised his interest in India. In response, Tharoor clarified that he met Soros socially and had no ongoing relationship with him.In his post on X, Tharoor said that the meeting took place at a formal dinner hosted by Puri during his visit to New York. ""Ambassador Puri had invited a number of prominent Americans for a dinner discussion with me, and that was entirely appropriate,"" Tharoor wrote. He emphasised that he had not been in contact with Soros since the event and denied ever seeking or receiving funds from him or his foundations.BJP's annoyance with Soros, who has made no secret of his dislike for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has included him in the list of targets, which also include US President-elect Donald Trump, is not new. It has also accused him of working in league with Congress.The BJP has accused the Congress party of collaborating with George Soros, a billionaire investor, and his affiliated organisations to spread misinformation and disrupt Parliament. The BJP cites French media outlet Mediapart's claims about Soros's funding of Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and its alleged ties to the US government as evidence.","Hardeep Singh Puri hits back at Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's claims regarding a 2009 dinner in New York attended by US billionaire George Soros.

Director not liable if company cheque dishonoured: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/director-not-liable-if-company-cheque-dishonoured-sc/articleshow/116523346.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Providing a loophole to ingenious persons, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that if a person repays a personal loan through a cheque signed by him as a director of a company, then he would not be liable to be prosecuted under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act if the cheque bounced..A man took a personal loan of Rs 7 lakhs and returned the amount through a cheque drawn on an account of Shilabati Hospital, Kolkata, of which he was a director. The cheque bounced and the creditor had initiated proceedings under Section 138 of NI Act. The HC quashed the proceedings. The creditor appealed in the SC.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said Section 138, being a penal provision, has to be strictly construed and a man could face prosecution only if the cheque, issued by him from an account maintained by him, gets dishonoured.It said since the cheque was drawn from the hospital's account, the man as director cannot be prosecuted under the NI Act. There are as many as 36 lakh cheque bouncing cases pending in various courts as of 2023.Writing a detailed judgment analysing the provision threadbare, Justice Pardiwala said, “Section 138 of the NI Act clearly postulates that the cheque returned for insufficiency of funds should have been drawn by a person on an account maintained by him.”“It will amount to doing violence to the language of the statute if Section 138 of the Act is interpreted to mean that even if a person draws a cheque on an account not maintained by him, he shall be liable if the cheque is returned for insufficiency of funds. Such an interpretation will lead to absurd and wholly unintended results,” he said.Referring to the dishonour of the cheque signed by the debtor as a director of Shilabati hospital, the bench said, “The mere fact that the cheque signed by the accused in his capacity as a “Director” of the Company would in the normal course be honoured by the Bank to which it was presented does not satisfy the statutory requirement of Section 138 of the Act.”However, the bench said that though the debtor cannot be prosecuted under Section 138, he would be liable for the offence of cheating as it stands proved that he had undisputedly offered the cheque to settle the loan amount.“In such circumstances, although it is not possible to hold the accused liable for the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act, yet the possibility of him having committed the offence of cheating cannot be ruled out. Prima facie, the mens rea (guilty mind) of the accused speaks for itself,” the bench said.","A man took a personal loan of Rs 7 lakhs and returned the amount through a cheque drawn on an account of Shilabati Hospital, Kolkata.

"India, France sign pact for world's largest museum in Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-france-sign-pact-for-worlds-largest-museum-in-delhi/articleshow/116522638.cms,"World's largest museum features

Shekhawat in his speech, highlighted that the project would transform the understanding of adaptive reuse whilst demonstrating deep regard for India's architectural heritage.

The forthcoming Yuga Yugeen Bharat National Museum, set to be the world's largest, will feature eight themed sections chronicling India's 5,000-year history.

The new facility, situated in the North Block and South Block at the centre of the capital, will encompass 1.17 lakh sqm, featuring 950 rooms across a basement and three floors.

The development aims to revitalise these historic structures, maintaining their architectural significance whilst adapting their functionality.

The South Block currently houses the External Affairs and Defence Ministries, while the North Block accommodates the Finance and Home Ministries.

These two identical structures on Raisina Hill, along with the Rashtrapati Bhavan (formerly the Viceroy’s House), stand as iconic symbols of architectural magnificence and administrative authority.

Built between 1911 and 1931, they were key elements of the 'New Delhi' imperial capital, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S. Jaishankar highlighted the important role of culture as a cornerstone of "" soft power "" on Thursday. He noted that the transformation of the North Block and South Block on Raisina Hill into the world's largest museum, ""will veritably be seeing an inspiration for the remaking of Bharat"".The external affairs minister made these remarks during an event where India's National Museum and France Museums Développement signed an agreement.

When the South Block and North Block become the kind of museum that is envisage, I think we will veritably be seeing an inspiration for the remaking of Bharat,"" the minister added news agency PTI reported.During his address, the EAM also emphasised on the bilateral relations between India and France. ""For us, this has been a very strong relationship, what in our profession, we call it a strategic partnership, and underpinning that has been that India and France see in each other ""important poles"" in a multipolar world,"" the EAM said.""So, when we deepen our cultural collaboration, in many ways, we also adding to a particular kind of relationship, which we believe would create a new and more democratic world order,"" he added.Shekhawat announced that the museum would incorporate advanced digital narratives, virtual reality installations and interactive displays that would ""set a new benchmark for cultural institutions worldwide"".He commended France for its global expertise in the adaptive reuse of historic buildings , citing the Louvre Museum, which is housed in a former palace, as a prime example.The Culture minister indicated that mapping work in the North Block is nearly complete, with South Block mapping in progress.

A thinker who transcended religion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-thinker-who-transcended-religion/articleshow/116509038.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Recently, I was at Kanyakumari to participate in a college function. The authorities had booked a hotel near the sea for me. As twilight descended and the horizon shimmered in hues of orange and purple, I ventured out toward the southern edge of our vast country. Standing tall and resolute before me was the magnificent 133-feet statue of Thiruvalluvar, watching over the merging waters. Jan 1, 2025, will mark the completion of 25 years of this breathtaking statue’s installation.

Huge statues have an undeniable impact that stirs something deep within us. How inconsequential we seem against the great tides of time. And yet, history reminds us that a rare few—like Thiruvalluvar—defy time, their legacy lasting centuries.

My thoughts wandered to another statue of Valluvar , a much smaller one, seated in a temple at Mylapore. My mother often took me to that temple. Back then, my prayers were practical and childlike, for good marks in exams. Years later, when I revisited the temple as an adult, the sense of tranquillity it evoked was immense.

Another memory surfaced, this time of Shravanabelagola in Karnataka, which I visited years ago. The local guide informed me that Thiruvalluvar was worshipped there as a disciple of the Jain saint Kundakundacharya, who had walked those sacred grounds. I stood for a long time before a statue, wondering whether they belonged to Valluvar’s guru. The atmosphere was suffused with devotion and a quiet sense of surrender.

Whether it was the statue at Kanyakumari, the temple at Mylapore, or the lotus feet at Shravanabelagola, each experience left me with the same emotion: gratitude and an awe about the eternal wisdom that connects us all.

Discussions about Thiruvalluvar’s religion have persisted for a long time. Various sects have claimed him as one of their own, citing couplets that reference theological concepts or deities. Over the centuries, commentators—guided by their own faiths and philosophies—have interpreted the Kural accordingly.

Post the 16th century, efforts to establish Thiruvalluvar’s religious identity intensified. Yet, when one delves deeply into the Kural, it becomes evident that it defies such narrow classifications, Valluvar’s wisdom resonates with all who uphold ethics and morality.

India was never united by language or customs but by the shared ethical principles that wove together its fabric. The Kural exemplifies this unity. It stands apart, resisting any attempt to confine it within the limits of a single identity. Rather, it serves as a bridge, connecting people through the universal truths of virtue and morality; the writer’s religious identity does not matter.

Few works in world literature define ethics with the clarity and universality of the Kural. Thiruvalluvar’s words cut across barriers of religion, time and geography. Consider his profound insight:

“Manaththukkan Maasilan Aadhal Anaiththaran

Aagula Neera Pira”

“A blemishless mind is the basis of all virtue; everything

else is empty display.”

As the magnificent sun descended at Kanyakumari, casting its golden light upon Thiruvalluvar’s statue, I looked up at his face. It seemed as though he was smiling, silently asking, “Why imprison me within the walls of sectarianism?”

In that fleeting moment, I felt an indescribable oneness with the vastness of existence. Here, at the southernmost tip of India, the wisdom of Thiruvalluvar stands tall, as unyielding and eternal as the seas that surround him.

JAIPUR: An 800-metre stretch of the Jaipur-Ajmer National Highway near Bhankrota in the Rajasthan capital turned into a scene of unmitigated tragedy and devastation at dawn Friday after a collision between an LPG tanker and a truck set off a chain of explosions, killing 12 people, critically injuring at least 33, and leaving a row of cars and sleeper buses charred.Ten bus passengers are among the people unaccounted for. DCP (West) Amit Kumar said former IAS officer Karni Singh had also been reported missing.Authorities quoted witnesses as saying that the Bharat Petroleum tanker entering Jaipur from Ajmer was making a U-turn near the Delhi Public School junction when the linen-laden truck speeding down the opposite carriageway crashed into it. Such was the impact that it broke the tanker's nozzles, releasing a gush of LPG into the air that fuelled the serial explosions that followed.Vehicles trailing the tanker and the truck were reduced to metal barebones in the inferno. Some of the victims inside these vehicles, including buses, presumably had little or no time to escape.Over 40 vehicles were gutted in the fire trail. Officials said it could have been worse had the blaze spread to three fuel stations in the vicinity.CCTV footage from the scene captured the scale of explosions at 5.45am, with the flames visible from a distance and the noise waking up people several kilometres away. Seven of the deceased were identified as Harlal (32); motorcyclist Radheyshyam Choudhary (32); truck driver Shahbuddin (34) of UP's Rae Bareli; Shahid (34) and Faizan (20) from Udaipur' Mahendra (27) of Makrana; and Anita Meena (28), an armed police constable.The tanker driver was unaccounted for until evening. Unconfirmed reports said he tried to flee but was unlikely to have made it through the inferno. The seven injured who are on ventilator support at Jaipur's SMS Hospital include Yusuf (45), a Banswara resident; Vijeta (23); Raju Ram Baberwal (40) of Sikar; and Govind (32) from Kekri.A witness said gas “gushed out of the nozzles like water from an overflowing dam”. A sleeper bus from Udaipur ferrying 24 passengers went up in flames. A truck filled with cartons of matchboxes caught fire just outside a fuel pump. Another tanker filled with gas broke down. Fire tenders used foam and water to avert an explosion.Officials said over 25 fire engines were deployed, with teams arriving from Mansarovar, VKI, Vaishali Nagar, and Bani Park. The fire brigade removed the LPG tanker that exploded from the middle of the road. The residual gas was transferred to another tanker. In an official statement on X, Bharat Petroleum condoled the deaths and pledged Rs 6 lakh each to the next of kin of the victims and Rs 2 lakh to the injured.PM Modi announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh and Rs 50,000 for the injured. CM Bhajan Lal Sharma announced assistance of Rs 5 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 1 lakh each to the injured. Transport secretary Shuchi Tyagi directed Jaipur district magistrate to set up a six-member committee to investigate the accident.The Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety, too, wrote to Rajasthan govt, seeking a report on the accident. The committee asked for a plan to improve road safety, officials said.","A collision between an LPG tanker and a truck set off a chain of explosions, killing 12 people, critically injuring at least 33, and leaving a row of cars and sleeper buses charred.

Marathi vs non-Marathi fight flares up in Maharashtra over lighting of incense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/marathi-vs-non-marathi-fight-flares-up-in-maharashtra-over-lighting-of-incense/articleshow/116516113.cms,"Mumbai & Maharashtra belong to Marathi people: CM Devendra Fadnavis

KALYAN/NAGPUR: An argument between two residents of a building in Kalyan over lighting of incense escalated into a Marathi vs non-Marathi dispute , which echoed in the Maharashtra legislative assembly on Friday and led to suspension of the MTDC officer who allegedly assaulted his neighbour.CM Devendra Fadnavis told the House an FIR had been registered against the officer, Akhilesh Shukla, and the process to suspend him had been initiated. On Friday, police arrested Shukla and two associates for assault and use of derogatory language against his next-door Marathi couple.Replying to opposition's charge in the assembly that Marathis were being discriminated in their own state, Fadnavis said: ""Mumbai and Maharashtra belong to Marathi people. Sometimes such characters (Shukla) display arrogance and make brazen statements. But we will not rest until the arrogance of such people is taken down,"" he said. ""Just like we have a national identity, we also have a regional identity. That regional identity means we are all Marathi. If anyone is attacking that, then we are as upset as you are, so strict action will definitely be taken.""In the same breath, Fadnavis added that the metropolis was ""a global city"" which draws people and ""everybody lives in harmony.""Shiv Sena UBT MLC Anil Parab said the incident occurred because BJP was in power. ""This is arrogance of power of BJP."" Congress MLC Bhai Jagtap said: ""From where are people deriving this confidence to make brazen statements?"" However, Fadnavis said opposition was needlessly giving the issue a political colour and blaming BJP for it.The fight among neighbours in Kalyan's Ajmera Heights started on Wednesday night when Shukla's wife Geeta lit incense and put it in the common corridor. The Marathi neighbours, Deshmukhs, objected. The Deshmukhs alleged that the Shukla family made comments about Marathi people for their non-vegetarian dietary habits.Dheeraj Deshmukh told TOI, ""When I objected to Shukla and his wife's remarks, they got angry. After the argument, we came back to the house."" He said after a while 8-10 people from outside the society knocked on his door, called him out, and began hitting him, during which his brother Abhijit too suffered head injuries. Alleging that Shukla took out a revolver from his pocket, he said that the family has intimidated other residents in the building in the past, saying he worked at Mantralaya. Deshmukh also accused Shukla of using an official blue beacon on his car. He said when he first went to the local police station to register a complaint, police were reluctant to record it, which forced him to take to social media.Shukla surrendered to Khadakpada police on Friday, while his associates, Darshan Borade and Sumit Jadhav, were arrested earlier. Shukla later issued a statement rebutting allegations by the Deshmukhs, saying it was a personal dispute and that he had made no remarks against Marathis in general.DCP Atul Zende said they are probing if Shukla had eligibility to use the beacon on his vehicle. Police have seized CCTV footage of the incident from the building. Police have also registered a cross-complaint against the Deshmukh family, in which Deshmukh has been accused of assault. Meanwhile, after news about a Marathi family being attacked went viral, MNS and Shiv Sena workers raised the issue and demanded action against the Shukla family.",An argument between two residents of a building in Kalyan over lighting of incense escalated into a Marathi vs non-Marathi dispute. MTDC officer Akhilesh Shukla and two associates arrested for assault and use of derogatory language against his next-door Marathi couple.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116516137,imgsize-14226,width-400,resizemode-4/116516137.jpg"
Can't expect man to maintain ex-wife as per his status all his life: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-expect-man-to-maintain-ex-wife-as-per-his-status-all-his-life-sc/articleshow/116516872.cms,"NEW DELHI: For a rich man, both marriage and divorce are costly affairs. An India-born American citizen, running a successful IT consultancy service in the US, realised this as he had to cough up Rs 500 crore as alimony to his first wife in Nov 2020 and has now been ordered by SC to pay Rs 12 crore to his second wife, with whom his marriage lasted less than a year.Responding to the husband's plea to the SC to annul the ""irretrievably broken"" marriage, which lasted only for a few months after they tied the knot on July 31, 2021, the second wife said she should get a permanent alimony on par with the divorced first wife.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Pankaj Mithal frowned at the woman's demand for parity with the first wife, who had spent several years in matrimony with the man, in terms of alimony and her attempt to seek equalisation of her wealth with that of her husband.Writing a detailed 73-page judgment , Justice Nagarathna said, ""We have serious reservations with the tendency of parties seeking maintenance or alimony as an equalisation of wealth with the other party. It is often seen that parties highlight the assets, status and income of their spouse, and then ask for an amount that can equal their wealth to that of the spouse."" She asked why such demands were conspicuously absent when the spouse's wealth decreased substantially after separation.The bench said the law of maintenance was to save the estranged wife from destitution, maintain her dignity and deliver social justice. ""As per settled law, the wife is entitled to be maintained as far as possible in a manner similar to what she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home while the parties were together,"" it said.""But once the parties have separated, it cannot be expected of the husband to maintain her as per his present status all his life. If the husband is fortunately doing better in life post his separation, then to ask him to always maintain the status of the wife as per his own changing status would be putting a burden on his own personal progress,"" the bench said.""We wonder, would the wife be willing to seek an equalisation of wealth with the husband if due to some unfortunate events post-separation, he has been rendered a pauper,"" the bench asked.","An India-born American citizen, running a successful IT consultancy service in the US, realised this as he had to cough up Rs 500 crore as alimony to his first wife in Nov 2020.

He linked events such as the 1975 coup, which resulted in the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family, and the ongoing protests in 2024 to efforts to reduce Bangladesh's dependence on India.He claimed that for Bangladesh to achieve true independence and liberation, it must break free from its current constraints and expand its territory. He said that this was just the beginning of their efforts.Responding to his (now deleted) facebook post, the MEA spokesperson said, ""We would like to remind all concerned to be mindful of their public comments. While India has repeatedly signalled interest in fostering relations with the people and the interim government of Bangladesh, such comments underline the need for responsibility in public articulation.""Mahfuz was previously introduced by Yunus at a Clinton Global Initiative event in New York in September as the ""mastermind"" behind the protests that led to the ousting of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh.","Mahfuz Alam, an adviser in Bangladesh’s interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, had sparked controversy with a provocative facebook post.

NEW DELHI: The winter session of Parliament saw differences within the INDIA bloc come to the fore with some regional parties differing openly with the Congress and some even questioning its leadership of the opposition alliance . The session saw the Congress navigating a tough path as the grand-old-party came under repeated attacks from the ruling NDA and also found itself isolated within the opposition's INDIA bloc on some key issues. At the end of it, it was the controversy over Amit Shah's Ambedkar remarks that once again united the Congress and other opposition parties as they protested together to corner the government.For the Congress, the impact of two disastrous electoral performances was evident as the grand-old-party came to Parliament losing the psychological advantage that had come with the Lok Sabha gains when it had almost doubled its tally.While the ruling NDA left no opportunity to corner the Congress over its shock defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, INDIA bloc ally Mamata Banerjee slammed it's leadership and staked claim to lead the opposition alliance. Mamata got support from two top leaders of the alliance - NCP-SCP chief Sharad Pawar who called her a ""capable leader"" and RJD chief Lalu Prasad who said the West Bengal chief minister should be allowed to lead the opposition bloc. Lalu, an old time ally of the Congress, also made light of any objections that the grand-old-party may have over change of leadership. However, allies like DMK in Tamil Nadu and National Conference chief Omar Abdullah backed the Congress. When Trinamool cited Mamata's track record of defeating the BJP again and again in West Bengal, Congress leaders questioned her track record outside the state leading to a war of words between the allies.On the Adani US indictment issue, Congress did not get the support of two key regional leaders who refused to join the party-led protests. This was after Gautam Adani was charged by US prosecutors over his role in an alleged years-long scheme to pay $250 million bribe to Indian officials in exchange for favourable terms for solar power contracts. Rahul Gandhi once again led the charge and demanded that Gautam Adani should be arrested after his indictment in the US and accused the government of protecting him. But Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party insisted that the controversy in UP's Sambhal was far more important and distanced itself from INDIA bloc protests over the issue. Mamata's party, on the other hand, not just stayed away but also blamed the Congress along with the BJP for repeated adjournments of Parliament.However, several other allies of the Congress including AAP, RJD, Shiv Sena (UBT), DMK and the Left parties joined the protests against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded accountability.Then came the issue of misuse of EVMs on which the Congress was again pushed to the corner by some of its own allies. Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah advised the grand-old-party to not keep whining about the EVMs and at the same time, continue fighting elections. “The same EVMs gave you 99 seats. You celebrated that victory, but then you go on complaining about the same when you lose elections. You can’t be selective in blaming the EVMs,” he said.Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee then rubbed salt on Congress's wounds as he said those raising questions on EVMs should give a demonstration of any ""discrepancies"" to the Election Commission. He went on to call the allegations made by some leaders as ""random statements.""""The people who raise questions about EVMs, if they have any evidence, should go and show a demo to the Election Commission. If the work is done properly during the EVM randomisation and the booth workers check during mock polls and counting, then I don't think there is any substance in these allegations,"" Abhishek Banerjee said.""If still someone feels that EVMs can be hacked, then they should meet the Election Commission and show how EVMs can be hacked... Nothing can be done by just making random statements,"" the TMC MP added. The Congress reacted strongly to the remarks of these allies and reminded them that it was not alone in doubting the EVMs.Then happened the Constitution debate in Parliament and the Congress once again come under vicious attack from the BJP and other partners of the ruling NDA, who accused the grand-old-party and the Gandhis of using the Constitution for their own benefit.While the Congress and other opposition leaders would have hoped to pin down the government over some of the recent incidents, the idea perhaps boomeranged as the BJP used the debate to unleash a scathing attack on the Congress reminding it of Emergency, Shah Bano case and several other constitutional amendments carried out under the party's rule. Prime Minister Narendra Modi not just cited these incidents but also alleged that the Congress had misused its own party constitution to target leaders who had differences with the Gandhis.However, much to the relief of Congress, at the end of the 4-day debate, Amit Shah's reference to Ambedkar in his concluding speech in Rajya Sabha gave the grand-old-party some ammunition to bounce back and aggressively attack the government.The Congress and other opposition parties joined hands to mount pressure on the government demanding an apology and resignation of Amit Shah. Prime Minister Modi, who led the defence against Shah, was also targeted for not taking action against his Cabinet minister.A face-off between the opposition and NDA MPs on the Parliament premises over the issue left two NDA leaders former minister Pratap Chandra Sarangi and Mukesh Rajput injured. After the incident, the BJP filed a police complaint against Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of ""physical assault and incitement"" and sought his indictment under sections of attempt to murder and other charges. The Congress, meanwhile, accused the BJP MPs of pushing its chief Mallikarjun Kharge and ""physically manhandling"" Gandhi. A delegation of Congress MPs, also filed a complaint visiting the police station in person.The last few days of the session saw a lot of drama with the Congress dominating the show. But the respite for the grand-old-party would be short-lived. Already, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has announced that it will not contest Delhi elections early next year in alliance with the Congress. In Bihar, where elections will be held towards the end of 2025 - the ties between Congress and RJD are already under strain. Clearly, the Congress needs to perform in elections and also put its house in order if it wants to continue to assert over its regional allies, many of whom are its political rivals in the states.","The winter session of Parliament saw differences within the INDIA bloc come to the fore. Some regional parties differing openly with the Congress and some even questioning its leadership of the opposition alliance. At the end of it, it was the controversy over Amit Shah's Ambedkar remarks that once again united the Congress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116512124,imgsize-1449161,width-400,resizemode-4/116512124.jpg"

BHOPAL: In a latest development, the Income Tax Department’s discovery of 52 kg of gold and ₹10 crore in cash from an abandoned vehicle near Mandora village has been linked to the Lokayukta’s raid on former RTO constable Saurabh Sharma and his associate, Chandan Singh Gaur. The seizure has brought further attention to the duo, already under investigation in a disproportionate assets case.The Lokayukta’s Special Police Establishment (SPE) raided the residences of Sharma and Gaur on Thursday, unearthing Rs 2.5 crore in cash, gold, silver jewellery, and property documents from Sharma’s home in Arera Colony. The value of these assets is expected to exceed Rs 3 crore.Saurabh Sharma, who took voluntary retirement from the Transport Department a year ago, is now active in real estate.Raids revealed investments in multiple properties, a hotel, and a school. Properties linked to Sharma are spread across multiple districts, including Bhopal. Complaints of corruption and illegal land use prompted the investigation.Sharma, originally from Gwalior, joined the Transport Department on a compassionate appointment after his father’s death. During his 12-year tenure, his lifestyle and assets saw a drastic transformation, raising suspicions. After clashes with bureaucrats and complaints regarding a school allegedly built on reserved land, Sharma retired early to focus on real estate ventures.Both Sharma and Gaur have been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act, with ADG Lokayukta Jaideep Prasad confirming that investigations are ongoing. Officials believe the gold and cash found in the abandoned vehicle may be part of the illicit wealth amassed by the duo.

NEW DELHI: Parliament's winter session, adjourned sine die on Friday, was one of the most tumultuous in recent memory, characterised by violence, protests and a significant drop in productivity.Despite the disruptions, the session introduced the one nation, one election bills and the two Houses held a two-day debate on 75 years of the Constitution. The session operated for roughly half its scheduled time, with Lok Sabha functioning for 57% of its scheduled time and Rajya Sabha for 43% (as of Dec 18).Dissatisfaction with the session was evident as Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla skipped the customary valedictory speech. Instead, he issued a stern warning just before 'Vande Mataram' was played to signify the session's end.Do not resort to demonstrations or protests at any gate or anywhere within the Parliament premises. Otherwise, the House will take serious action,"" Birla said amidst sloganeering by opposition MPs. ""It is improper to hold any protests or demonstrations at any of Parliament's gates. You must follow the rules in this regard. I urge you once again to take this warning seriously.""Birla adjourned Lok Sabha within three minutes without summarising the session's highlights. Notably, opposition leaders did not attend the traditional tea hosted by the Speaker, resulting in no photo release from the secretariat.PM Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, BJP president J P Nadda, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju and leaders from other NDA parties assembled in Birla's chamber after the session was adjourned.The discord between the treasury and opposition sides was stark, with only one bill - Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak - passed in the first six months of 18th Lok Sabha, marking the lowest legislative output in the last six terms according to PRS Legislative Research.The functioning of question hour in the winter session was severely hampered; in Rajya Sabha, it did not function for 15 out of 19 days while in Lok Sabha, it went on for more than 10 minutes on only eight out of 20 days. Also, there was no private members' business in Lok Sabha, and only one resolution was discussed in the upper House.In his closing remarks, Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar urged parties to transcend political differences and restore the dignity of parliamentary discourse, amid criticisms of partisanship from the opposition.The session hit its nadir with physical altercations on Thursday, involving MPs from rival parties, which resulted in two BJP members landing in hospital and an FIR against Rahul Gandhi. The session's highlight, however, was the two-day discussion on the 'Glorious Journey of 75 Years of the Constitution of India'.","Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla skipped the customary valedictory speech.

At the Arulmigu Kandaswamy temple at Thiruporur, near Chennai, a devotee inadvertently dropped not a baby but an iPhone into the hundi. The result is the same. This temple too has claimed the phone as its property.Dinesh, a devotee from Vinayagapuram, had to return home empty-handed on Friday as the temple authorities said anything dropped into the hundi belongs to the deity. They, however, offered to give him the SIM card and to let him download data from the phone.Dinesh had visited the temple with his family a month ago and after worship went to drop some money in the hundi. He said that while he was pulling out currency notes from his shirt pocket, his iPhone accidentally fell into the hundi. Since the hundi was placed at a height, he couldn't retrieve the phone. Panic-stricken, Dinesh approached the temple authorities. However, they told him once an offering is placed in the hundi, it is considered the property of the deity and cannot be returned. Besides, according to tradition, the hundi is opened only once in two months. Dinesh lodged a complaint with the HR and CE (Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments) officials, requesting to be informed when the hundi would be opened.When the temple authorities eventually opened the hundi on Friday, Dinesh rushed to retrieve his phone, only to be told that the device would remain in the temple's custody. He was offered the option to take the SIM card and download any important data from the phone. Dinesh had already obtained a new SIM card and left it to the authorities to decide on his plea to return the phone. Temple executive officer Kumaravel said the tradition of treating anything dropped in the hundi as belonging to the temple and deity would be followed and that the phone would be kept in the temple's custody. ""We are not clear whether he dropped it as an offering and later changed his mind, because the hundi is well protected with an iron fence,"" Kumaravel said.","Dinesh, a devotee from Vinayagapuram, had to return home empty-handed.

JAIPUR: If pain and tragedy needed a face, the lumbering figure of 32-year-old Radheyshyam Choudhary with his arms outstretched and body enveloped in flames would encapsulate everything that went horribly wrong on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway early Friday.Radheyshyam, a motor mechanic with National Bearings Company Ltd in Jaipur, had left his home near Ring Road on his motorbike as usual, having no inkling of the catastrophe that awaited him and many others barely 2km ahead.By mid-morning, videos of the aftermath of the gas tanker explosion on the national highway were circulating online, with more than one showing a burning man struggling to stay on his feet as he scampered for help amid the cacophony unleashed by the accident.Radheyshyam's elder brother Akheram recalled being woken up at 5.50am by a stranger calling to deliver an ominous message, ""Come to Heerapura bus terminal immediately. Your brother is in trouble.""Half-asleep and disoriented, Akheram rushed to the area with two neighbours. What he saw on reaching the accident site would haunt him forever.

They said he was crying for help as he struggled down the road. But instead of helping, most bystanders just made videos.""Realising it would be futile to expect an ambulance to arrive anytime soon because of the traffic chaos, Akheram and his neighbours carried Radheyshyam to their car.""He was conscious, talking coherently all the way to the hospital,"" Akheram said. ""He told us exactly what happened, intermittently trembling. He mentioned giving my number to the caller who alerted me. It was unbelievable how he managed to recall my number despite experiencing excruciating pain. Watching him writhe in agony, yet speak so clearly, was unbearable.""During the journey, Radheyshyam recounted the harrowing moments leading up to the tragedy. He described how he felt the ground shake seconds before a wave of flames swept everything in its way.Instinctively, Radheyshyam jumped off his bike and ran in the opposite direction, but the flames caught up with him. Despite his burns, he alternately ran and walked until he found someone to call his brother.At SMS Hospital, the medical staff, already overwhelmed by the surge of accident victims, admitted him.

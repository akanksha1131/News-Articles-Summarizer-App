'People have learned to take disorder as order': VP Dhankar's jibe at MPs after Parliament ruckus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-have-learned-to-take-disorder-as-order-vp-dhankars-jibe-at-mps-after-parliament-ruckus/articleshow/116582931.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reiterating his disappointment over the chaotic Parliament session, vice president and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday warned lawmakers not to mistake 'disorder' for 'order.' His message comes against the backdrop of a winter session that has proven to be the most unproductive in more than a year.The session, held from November 25 to December 20, was marred by violence, protests, and a significant drop in productivity. It operated for roughly half its scheduled time, with the Lok Sabha functioning for 57% of its scheduled time and the Rajya Sabha for 43%.Calling for accountability, Dhankhar said, ""Make no mistake, I am referring to parliamentarians. People have learned to take disorder as order. There is no sense of revulsion.""""Hopefully, people will write and their thoughts will move. People will force you to think, 'Why did you go there (Parliament)?'"" the RS chair added.The dissatisfaction over the lack of productivity in both Houses was echoed on the last day of the session. Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar urged political parties to rise above political differences and restore the dignity of parliamentary discourse. Meanwhile, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla skipped the customary valedictory speech, instead issuing a stern warning just before 'Vande Mataram' was played to mark the session's end.""It is improper to hold any protests or demonstrations at any of Parliament's gates. You must follow the rules in this regard. I urge you once again to take this warning seriously,"" LS Speaker Om Birla said on Friday.""The world watches our democracy, yet we fail our citizens through our conduct. These Parliamentary disruptions mock public trust and expectations. Our fundamental duty to serve with diligence lies neglected,"" the Rajya Sabha chairman said in his address to the House before it was adjourned on Friday.Referring to the unabated disruptions since the session began, Dhankhar lamented, ""Where reasoned dialogue should prevail, we witness only chaos."" The Vice President, against whom the opposition submitted a no-confidence motion, urged every parliamentarian from all parties to ""examine their conscience.""""The citizens of our democracy – one-sixth of humanity – deserve better than this spectacle. We squander precious opportunities that could serve the greater good of our people. I hope Members will introspect deeply, and citizens exercise their accountability. These hallowed chambers deserve conduct that honours our oath, not theatrics that betray it,"" he concluded.","Jagdeep Dhankhar urges political parties to rise above political differences and restore the dignity of parliamentary discourse.

Amit Shah inspects Bru package rollout; gets feedback from Brus at their village in Tripura,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-inspects-bru-package-rollout-gets-feedback-from-brus-at-their-village-in-tripura/articleshow/116581163.cms,"DHALAI: “Are you receiving 35 kg rations per family….and do you check if it’s actually 35 kg?” “Have all of you received your Ayushman scheme cards?”. “Does the school in your settlement here have teachers?” Home minister Amit Shah, here on Sunday to visit a Bru village in Bruha Para, put these queries to members of the Bru-Reang community now resettled in Tripura as part a quadripartite agreement signed in 2020.The purpose was to take stock of the status of implementation of the resettlement package offered to Brus as part of the 2020 agreement among the Centre, Mizoram govt, Tripura govt and Bru-Reang organisations. The pact provided for permanent settlement and rehabilitation of 6,958 Bru-Reang families, comprising around 38,000 people, in Tripura, almost 25 years after they were displaced from Mizoram due to ethnic violence between the Mizo and Bru-Reang communities.As the interaction between the home minister and Brus saw the latter appreciating the Govt of India for keeping its promises regarding housing, free ration supplies, schools, skill building and medical care etc, Shah said: “I am happier than you all are…Prime Minister Narendra Modi too is happy that he could ensure your permanent settlement in Tripura”.The frank exchange between the home minister and Brus on Sunday also brought out a few areas with scope for improvement. Shah directed the accompanying officials to address the grievances and issues raised by the community members without any delay.For instance, a community member told Shah that the 35 kg ceiling for rations per family was falling short for her 10-member household. “Why is there one ration card for a large family? As per the criteria adopted by govt of India, should it not be 35 kg or 5 kg per person in a large household?” he asked the officials. “Where is the PDS shop in charge? Call him. This should be corrected today itself,” Shah insisted.Tripura chief minister Manik Saha later told TOI that these gaps were being suitably tackled.Similarly, when the Bru members — a riot of colours in their traditional attire — replied in the negative to the home minister’s query on whether they all had Ayushman or CM Aarogya cards, both of which entitle them to free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, promptly came his next instruction to the officers: “Issue the remaining cards in the next 2 days”.A demand was raised by a woman community member to upgrade the school inaugurated within their relief camp, to Class 12th from Class VIII currently. As regards the demand for creating jobs for members of the community, Shah suggested that rather than waiting for jobs that are scarce, the skills and livelihood opportunities being imparted to them as part of the settlement package, should be used for self employment.He said 25 new skills have been identified in which the Bru-Reang members will be trained and can take up self-employment and livelihood opportunities. These include dairy farming that will allow them to retain the profit, floriculture, beekeeping, handicrafts and millets farming, said Shah.Asked about the status of their voting rights in Tripura, now their permanent home, the Brus happily updated Shah that they had voted in both in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls. “You must vote for BJP,” he said with a smile.For Shah, it was instant connection with the Bru settlers as he broke security protocol to freely walk into their homes, constructed over 1200 sq ft area with Rs 1.5 lakh offered under the settlement package. He inspected the Aarogya Ayushman Mandir (a local health centre), anganwadi, vegetable market, PDS shop and handicrafts outlet and talked to Brus as he went around the settlement. The resident Bru-Reang community members could be seen clicking his pictures on their mobiles and chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’.Bru resettlement colonies, as part of the 2020 agreement, have been established at a dozen locations in Tripura — spread across North Tripura, Dhalai, Gomati and South Tripura districts — out of which nine locations are on forest land and three on government land.","Home minister Amit Shah visited Bru village in Bruha Para, Tripura.

CLAT '25 admission list delayed after HC order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clat-25-admission-list-delayed-after-hc-order/articleshow/116579080.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Consortium of National Law Universities (NLUs) has delayed the release of first admission list for Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2025, originally scheduled for Dec 26, 2024. The decision follows Delhi HC's directive to revise the merit list after discrepancies were identified in the final answer key for the undergraduate examination.Candidates were informed of the delay via SMS, with the Consortium assuring them of its commitment to transparency and fairness. Legal experts are reportedly being consulted to address the implications of the revised marking scheme and its impact on rankings.This marks another instance of national-level entrance exams coming under scrutiny. Earlier this year, NEET-UG, CUET-UG and UGC-NET results were delayed amid controversies, involving technical glitches, improper evaluations, and errors in question papers.The CLAT 2025 controversy began with a writ petition that flagged errors in two questions from Set A of the exam paper. Delhi HC upheld the petitioner's claims for one question, directing that marks be awarded to all candidates who selected the correct option as determined by the court. For another question, found to contain blatant errors, the court ruled it invalid and ordered its exclusion from evaluation. Justice Jyoti Singh, while delivering the judgment, emphasised the importance of academic integrity, stating that judicial intervention was necessary to address such lapses and protect the fairness of the admission process.The petitioner also contested other questions, highlighting inconsistencies in evaluation and transparency. Although the Consortium had addressed objections to three questions during its initial review, unresolved concerns prompted the petitioner to demand a Grievance Redressal Committee. A formal representation was submitted on Dec 9, 2024, calling for a comprehensive reassessment of marks and rankings.In its message to candidates, the Consortium stated, ""We acknowledge that this development may create some uncertainty, and we assure you that the Consortium is committed to ensuring transparency and fairness in the process. Consequently, the release of the first admission list for NLUs, originally scheduled for Dec 26, is likely to be delayed.""","First admission list for Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2025, originally scheduled for Dec 26, 2024.

No BNS test for those who failed in IPC exam: HC to law university,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-bns-test-for-those-who-failed-in-ipc-exam-hc-to-law-university/articleshow/116578675.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka high court has directed Karnataka State Law University to conduct examination for repeater-students who had Indian Penal Code (IPC) as subject, and not insist on taking up Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Justice Suraj Govindaraj gave this direction recently while quashing the Dec 6 notification issued by the university.Two students - one from Shivamogga and the other from Bengaluru city - approached HC , challenging the notification and seeking a directive to the university to conduct the exam for IPC - not BNS - for repeaters who had failed in IPC and were reappearing for the subject.The petitioners argued that since they had studied IPC and were unsuccessful in the examination, they cannot be asked to take up the supplementary examination in BNS as they never attended any class related to the new code.On the other hand, the university claimed that with IPC repeal and implementation of BNS from July 1 this year, the examination cannot be held on the repealed code.Justice Govindaraj said the university's argument would be applicable to students who currently or in the future take up BNS as a subject. ""It cannot be expected students who studied IPC take up the examination for BNS, which has never been taught to them in the course structure,"" the judge added.","Karnataka high court quashes notification issued by Karnataka State Law University.

Police sources said they have requested detailed information regarding rules and regulations governing the transport of petroleum, oil, and gas products on roads from relevant companies. The SIT was constituted to investigate the cause of the accident.The accident occurred when an LPG tanker, carrying gas from Mundra Port in Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh via the Ajmer-Jaipur National Highway, attempted to make a U-turn in Bhankrota area. Shortly after, at 5.44am, a truck filled with blankets and bedsheets, approaching from the opposite direction, collided with the tanker while it was negotiating the turn.Officials said the driver of the tanker involved in the accident was identified. He had managed to escape the impact zone. ""We contacted the vehicle's owner on Friday and tried reaching him again on Saturday, but he was untraceable. SIT is now looking for whereabouts of the driver,"" the official said.""The nozzles and what appear to be safety valves could not withstand the pressure and broke. However, we have to check if the nozzles and valves broke because of the crash with the truck,"" officials said. ""Our primary assessment is that the tanker driver is the only person who escaped unscathed from the impact zone,"" the official said.Sources said while there have been prior incidents of LPG and CNG tankers overturning on highways, this is the first time that the city police have seen safety valves and nozzles come undone immediately after a crash. The SIT requested the tanker's fitness certificates and details of the LPG content at the time of the accident, among other things.

Consortium’s response and next steps

The Delhi High Court has directed the Consortium of National Law Universities (NLUs) to revisit the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2025 merit list, originally published on December 7, 2024.The Court’s order follows a writ petition challenging the final answer key for the CLAT 2025 undergraduate examination and seeking a revision of the petitioner’s result. The petitioner argued that discrepancies in the answer key affected their ranking, potentially impacting admission to more prestigious institutions.The court identified significant issues with two specific questions in Set A of the CLAT 2025 exam paper:Justice Jyoti Singh upheld the petitioner’s claim, agreeing with the Expert Committee’s assessment that option ‘C’ was the correct answer. The court ruled that marks should be awarded to all candidates who selected this option.""Since the Court has upheld option ‘C’ as the correct answer, which was also the view of the Expert Committee, benefit cannot be restricted only to the petitioner and will extend to all candidates who have opted for option ‘C’,"" the judgment stated, as reported by Bar and Bench.The court directed that this question be excluded from evaluation. It accepted the Expert Committee’s advice, citing blatant errors that rendered the question invalid.The court’s orders necessitate revisions to the merit list, affecting all candidates who attempted these questions. Justice Singh emphasized that ignoring such clear errors would amount to an injustice.. Consequently, the Consortium of NLUs has been instructed to extend the revised marking scheme to all affected candidates, not just the petitioner.The petitioner’s plea also sought the court’s intervention for other disputed questions, including numbers 37, 67, 68, 89, 99, and 102. While objections to questions 89, 99, and 102 were upheld during the initial review process, the petition also demanded corrections to the remaining contested questions and a reassessment of the petitioner’s marks and rank.In addition, the petition raised concerns about the evaluation process and the transparency of the CLAT 2025 final answer key. A representation highlighting these discrepancies was submitted on December 9, 2024, alongside demands for the formation of a Grievance Redressal Committee to address candidate grievances.While the Supreme Court has cautioned against frequent interference in academic matters, the Delhi High Court justified its intervention due to the blatant nature of the errors in the answer key. The judgment highlighted that courts must exercise restraint but can act when evident mistakes compromise the fairness of results.The Consortium of NLUs acknowledged the court’s directives and announced a delay in the release of the first admission list, which was initially scheduled for December 26, 2024. According to various media reports and social media responses from candidates, the Consortium is consulting legal experts to determine the most appropriate course of action. In its communication to candidates, the Consortium reportedly stated, ""We acknowledge that this development may create some uncertainty, and we assure you that the Consortium is committed to ensuring transparency and fairness in the process.""","The Delhi High Court has directed the Consortium of National Law Universities to revisit the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2025 merit list.

Crippling IAF gaps force government to set up panel for new road map,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crippling-iaf-gaps-force-government-to-set-up-panel-for-new-road-map/articleshow/116576095.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the IAF grappling with an acute shortage of fighter aircraft as well as force-multipliers, the govt has constituted a high-level committee under defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh to chalk out a roadmap to plug the major operational gaps in the force.The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects. ""Among the three Services, IAF has the most critical capability voids. The committee will submit its report by the end of Jan,"" a source said.DRDO chief Samir V Kamat, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and IAF deputy chief Air Marshal Tejinder Singh, among others, are the members of the committee.The need to fast-track projects has been reinforced by the way the Chinese air force has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at all its airbases facing India, like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping, after upgrading them with new runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities.With the IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised to tackle the threat from China and Pakistan, one of the major challenges before the committee will be to break the logjam over the long-pending project to manufacture 114 new 4.5-generation fighters, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration. ""Some jets will be directly acquired, while the bulk will be produced in India,"" a source said.Then, there is also the induction of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which has taken a hit primarily because of the continuing delay in supply of engines by US major General Electric.Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will be able to deliver only two to three Tejas Mark-1A fighters instead of 16 promised to the IAF in the 2024-25 fiscal, under the Rs 46,898 crore deal for 83 such single-engine jets inked in Feb 2021. The order for another 97 TejasMark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.Meanwhile, GE has promised to begin the deliveries of the contracted 99 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by March 2025 now, around two years behind schedule.HAL and GE, of course, are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 aero-engines in India for the planned induction of at least 108 Tejas Mark-II fighters, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.Induction of force-multipliers is also crucial. IAF, for instance, has just six IL-78 mid-air refuelers, inducted in 2003-04, when it requires at least 18 such aircraft to extend the operational range of its fighter jets.In the ""eyes in the sky"" arena, India is even behind Pakistan, let alone China. IAF has just three indigenous 'Netra' airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, apart from the three Israeli Phalcon AWACS inducted in 2009-11. Consequently, the plan to develop six Mark-1A and six Mark-2 versions of the Netra aircraft also needs to be fast-tracked.","The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects.

"Allu Arjun told about stampede death, didn't leave: Cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/allu-arjun-told-about-stampede-death-didnt-leave-cops/articleshow/116576623.cms,"Congress netas snipe at Allu, BJP claims conspiracy



HYDERABAD: A day after Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Allu Arjun over the Dec 4 stampede at the premiere of his film, ' Pushpa 2: The Rule ', Hyderabad police alleged Sunday that the actor insisted on sitting through the show even after being told that a woman had died in the crush outside.The stampede at Sandhya Theatre left 39-year-old Revathi dead and her minor son severely injured. Arrested and granted bail, the actor claimed at a presser Saturday that no cop had asked him to leave the theatre. He called it ""character assassination by spreading misinformation"".Despite being briefed about the situation outside, the actor refused to leave the theatre. He was adamant on watching the entire film. We not only told him about the fatality but also assured to clear the road outside for him to leave as he is a celebrity. Even then he refused to leave. It was only after the DCP stormed inside and gave him a deadline of 15 minutes to clear out, did he budge from there,” ACP L Ramesh Kumar said Sunday at a presser with colleagues.Telangana DGP in-charge Jitender emphasised that public safety supersedes film promotion. “With regard to Allu Arjun, we have nothing against any individual. At the same time everyone should be responsible towards the state. They should understand that safety and security of citizens is of utmost importance. They are heroes in films but on ground they should understand the problems of society. Promotion of films is not as important as the safety of citizens.” Jitender said.City police chief CV Anand released a 6.5-minute video to chronicle sequence of events that unfolded on Dec 4, with some visuals purportedly showing the actor being escorted out of theatre by cops.B Raju Naik, SHO of Chikkadpally area in which the theatre falls, also addressed the presser, echoing his senior colleagues and asserting that the crowd was “out of control”. “I somehow managed to escape death. But for the past 15 days, the fact that one woman (Revathi) died in my hands, and that we could not save her, has been haunting me. I pray for the soul and speedy recovery of her child,” Naik said, fighting back tears.As Revanth defended cops, some of the CM’s Congress colleagues insinuated Sunday that Allu had lacked empathy for the stampede victims and urged him to behave like “a real hero, not a reel hero”.“How can he prioritise box office collections over public safety? The actor should be a role model both on and off the screen,” said Congress MP Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy. Congress MLC Balmoori Venkat questioned Allu’s statements that he and the film brought pride to Telugu people. However, CM Revanth’s rivals slammed his criticism of Allu in the assembly Saturday. Junior Union home minister Bandi Sanjay accused the Congress govt of collaborating with AIMIM to target Tollywood as part of a “calculated conspiracy”.Sanjay pointed out that Allu had informed the cops beforehand and blamed the govt for the chaos. “An AIMIM member was prompted to raise a scripted question in the assembly, weaving a narrative like a movie plot to reignite this issue. This is shameful,” Sanjay said in a statement, referring to AIMIM’s MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi and his tirade against Allu.",Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Allu Arjun over the Dec 4 stampede at the premiere of his film.

Liquor sale hits new high on Air India Express's first Surat-Bangkok flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/liquor-sale-hits-new-high-on-air-india-expresss-first-surat-bangkok-flight/articleshow/116576170.cms,"NEW DELHI: A large number of Indian holidayers headed to Thailand get in ""high spirits"" while winging their way to the tourist paradise for desis. And when the holidayers are going from the dry state of Gujarat, the demand for onboard liquor touches new highs. Air India Express witnessed this on its inaugural Surat-Bangkok service on Dec 20 when, sources say, the airline had one of its highest ever liquor sale on a flight and had to refuse more to some flyers to avoid them turning unruly.The first flight was operated on AI Express' 176-seater Boeing 737 MAX and had 175 ""enthusiastic guests"". AI Express sells 50 ml miniatures of Chivas Regal for Rs 600 and 50 ml miniatures of Red Label, Bacardi White Rum, Beefeater Gin and 330 ml Bira Lager (beer) for Rs 400. ""On that flight, we saw a lot of demand for Chivas and Bira. As a policy we don't sell beyond two miniatures/cans to a passenger as there were several cases of unruly behaviour by passengers across airlines in the recent past. Our crew may sell more only if a passenger seems to be in complete control of him/herself after two drinks,"" sources said.On the first Surat-Bangkok flight, some passengers had to be refused their third miniature/can for this reason. Kunj Patel, a passenger wrote on X: ""The combination of alcohol and khaman, Suratians went viral! Air India (Express') first flight from Surat to Bangkok received 98% passengers on the first day itself. Passengers finished their stock of whiskey and beer. 300 passengers drank 15 litres of alcohol worth more than Rs 1.80 lakh in a 4-hour journey.""While that may not be entirely correct for a 176-seater plane, the tweet shows how ""maja ma"" the passengers were.""Our onboard liquor is very affordable and we offer hot meals unlike many other low cost carriers. For that reason, we see a significant demand for the two on our flights. On the Surat-Bangkok flight, the maximum demand was for Chivas, veg biryani and non-veg noodles. Many passengers enjoyed their drinks with their theplas and khakras,"" said sources.While not disclosing the number of drinks sold as ""that is commercially sensitive"", an AI Express official said, ""We did not run out of drinks. Some passengers who may have been refused third miniature/can could have felt that way. But that wasn't the case.""Thailand, cheaper than most prime desi beach destinations like Goa due to prohibitive hotel tariffs and airfares in peak travel seasons, is attracting Indians by the droves.","Air India Express witnessed this on its inaugural Surat-Bangkok service on Dec 20.

Why some are angry with Allu Arjun



Telangana CM vs Allu Arjun



NEW DELHI: Hyderabad police detained 6 people in custody who claimed to be affiliated with Osmania University Joint Action Committee (OUJAC), unlawfully entered Telugu actor Allu Arjun 's Jubilee Hills residence and vandalised flower pots and other things.Hyderabad DGP said that the case has been registered against the 6 persons and others who were involved in the said offences and stringent action as per law is being initiated against them all.""Today at around 4.45 pm, some persons holding placards in their hands suddenly rushed to the residence of actor Allu Arjun in Jubilee Hills and started sloganeering and one of them mounted the compound and started throwing tomatoes. When the security staff objected and persuaded them to get down from the wall, they got into an altercation. They climbed down the wall, manhandled the security staff and damaged some flower pots kept along the ramp,"" DCP West Zone, Hyderabad said.""On receiving the information, Jubilee Hills Police reached the place and took the 6 persons into custody. They all claim to be part of the Osmania University Joint Action Committee (OU-JAC). A case has been registered against the 6 persons and others who were involved in the said offences and stringent action as per law is being initiated against them all,"" DCP West Zone, Hyderabad added.The intruders climbed over the property's boundary wall and pelted tomatoes at the residence. They proceeded to enter the grounds and damaged ornamental plants whilst shouting slogans, creating a tense atmosphere.The protesters raised slogans against the actor and sought justice to the woman who died in a stampede at a movie theatre here earlier this month on the occasion of screening of the actor's latest film 'Pushpa-2'.Law enforcement officers subsequently arrived and detained the protesters.On December 4, the actor went to the Hyderabad's Sandhya Theatre to attend the premiere of his movie Pushpa 2: The Rule.A massive crowd gathered to catch a glimpse of the star. The situation escalated when Arjun waved to fans from the sunroof of his vehicle, leading to the tragic death of a woman named Revathi in the ensuing chaos.Following the incident, Allu Arjun was arrested but released the next day after being granted bail by the Telangana High Court upon furnishing a Rs50,000 bond.On Saturday, chief minister A Revanth Reddy expressed criticism towards the actor for attending the theatre despite police withholding permission for the film's cast to visit the venue.In response to AIMIM MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi's query in the Assembly, Reddy highlighted concerns about Allu Arjun's interaction with large crowds, citing circulating videos as evidence.According to Reddy, the theatre management had requested security arrangements on December 2 for prominent actors' visits scheduled for December 4. The police declined the request, citing crowd management challenges and the venue's limited access points.Following Reddy's criticism, Allu Arjun promptly organised a press conference to deny the accusations, stating that police officers facilitated his arrival at the venue.The actor specifically contested claims about conducting a roadshow or engaging with crowds.""Had there not been permission, they would have told us to return and I am a law-abiding citizen. I would've followed that. Nothing of that sort of information was given to me. I was following as per their guidance and it was not a roadshow. There was no procession. It was just a crowd a few meters away from the theatre,"" he said, adding it was the police who were clearing the way for him and he reached the venue under their directions.The chief minister asserted that the actor greeted fans through his car's sunroof whilst entering and leaving the theatre, drawing thousands of enthusiastic supporters.Reddy noted that the actor's arrival attracted massive crowds due to multiple theatres in the vicinity.Reddy reported that the situation became precarious when the actor's security personnel pushed back fans, nearly causing a stampede.", Hyderabad police detained 6 people in custody who claimed to be affiliated with Osmania University Joint Action Committee (OUJAC) The intruders unlawfully entered Telugu actor Allu Arjun's Jubilee Hills residence and vandalised flower pots and other things.

Ayushman driving big gains in cancer treatment: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayushman-driving-big-gains-in-cancer-treatment-lancet/articleshow/116577359.cms,"NEW DELHI: Odds of timely initiation of treatment of cancer patients in India have gone up by nearly 36% in the past six years, a new study claimed. It credited Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) for this change. Treatment initiation is considered timely if it starts within 30 days of diagnosis of the disease.According to the study published in The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia, which investigated treatment history of 6,695 patients undergoing cancer treatment at seven major hospitals in the country, most received treatment in 20 days. There were few instances of people getting treatment in two months from cancer diagnosis.As compared to patients who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2017, those diagnosed after 2018 had 36% higher odds of timely initiation of treatment, the study found.AB-PMJAY, a central health scheme, was launched in 2018 to provide an annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to the poor and vulnerable families. Recently, govt extended the scope of the scheme to all senior citizens aged 70 years and above, regardless of their income.The study claims while access for timely treatment initiation has increased by 30% for those who are not enrolled under the health scheme, it has increased by 90% for AB-PMJAY beneficiaries.The study, led by Dr Prinja Shankar from PGIMER-Chandigarh, was funded by department of health research, health ministry. Poor education, lower socio-economic status, socio-cultural belief, gender, distance from healthcare facility, and access to appropriate financial protection such as insurance are key factors for delayed treatment, the researchers pointed out in the Lancet study. Each of these place the poor and vulnerable at a disadvantage, they added.A NHA official said AB-PMJAY has helped bridge the gap to some extent. ""Now, the poor don't have to think about the cost as they have assurance of treatment up to Rs 5 lakh,"" the official added. AB-PMJAY comprises 557 health benefits packages for cancer treatment.The Lancet study found that cancer patients who required radiotherapy faced maximum delay in the initiation of treatment. In most high-income countries, there is at least one radiotherapy unit available for every 2,50,000 people. This, on an average, would mean 4 radiotherapy machines per million population. The study said applying this factor to India would translate into requirement of 5,000 radiation therapy units when there are less than 1,000 such units, a shortfall of over 4,000 machines.The researchers have recommended that govt should increase infrastructure for radiotherapy, promote local production of quality equipment like linear accelerators and provide affordable and equitable radiation treatment by rationalising the existing health benefit packages pertaining to radiotherapy under AB-PMJAY.As unknown cancer stage has also been observed as a determinant of delayed timely initiation of treatment, so there should be more focus on increasing population coverage under screening programmes, they added.",Treatment initiation is considered timely if it starts within 30 days of diagnosis. Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) was launched in 2018 to provide an annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116577401,imgsize-486241,width-400,resizemode-4/116577401.jpg"

What is the Pegasus controversy?

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala on Sunday, highlighting the recent verdict by a US court in a Pegasus case, asked if the Supreme Court would carry out a further inquiry into the alleged use of software to illegally hack the devices.On Friday, a US judge ruled against Israel's NSO Group , holding it responsible for hacking WhatsApp and breaching its contract. The lawsuit accused NSO of exploiting a flaw in WhatsApp to install spyware called Pegasus. The case will now proceed to trial to determine the damages NSO must pay.Surjewala, citing the US ruling, claimed that 300 WhatsApp numbers of Indians were targeted.""The Pegasus spyware case verdict proves how 300 WhatsApp numbers of Indians were targeted in the illegal spyware racket,"" Surjewala said in a post on X.The Congress's Rajya Sabha MP further said it was time for the central government to disclose the 300 names targeted through the spyware.""Who are the two Union ministers? Who are the three opposition leaders? Who is the constitutional authority? Who are the journalists? Who are the business persons? What information was retrieved by the BJP government and agencies? How was it used - misused and to what consequence?"" the Congress leader asked.Surjewala further said: ""Will the Supreme Court take note of the judgment of the US court in Meta v/s NSO ? Will the Supreme Court proceed to make public the report of the Committee of Technical Experts on Pegasus Spyware, submitted to it in 2021-22?""The Congress leader asked if the top court, considering the US verdict, would direct Meta to submit 300 names to put Pegasus case to a conclusive end.""Will the Supreme Court now ask Meta to submit to itself the 300 names to meet the ends of justice in the Pegasus case?"" Surjewala asked.""Shouldn't Facebook (now Meta) now have a responsibility to release the names of 300 Indians targeted by Pegasus, considering WhatsApp and Facebook have the biggest subscriber base in India and they have a 'duty of care and disclosure' to its clients in India?"" he further said.The high-profile Pegasus snooping scandal brought the hot-button issue of state surveillance back into focus in India in 2021. The issue blew up after an investigation by an international media consortium under the Pegasus Project revealed that thousands of phone numbers were allegedly targeted by the Pegasus spyware created by NSO Group, an Israeli software company.Several prominent Indians, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Union ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Pralhad Patel, poll-strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor, were said to be potential targets of the spyware.The issue led to multiple disruptions in Parliament sessions then, with opposition members causing a ruckus in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Later, the Supreme Court said its technical expert committee, after months of forensic scrutiny, could not find Pegasus spyware in the 29 mobile phones of complainants, but detected malware in five of them.","Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala asked if the Supreme Court would carry out a further inquiry into the alleged use of software to illegally hack devices.

"TB patients spend up to Rs 32,000 despite free care under government schemes: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-patients-spend-up-to-rs-32000-despite-free-care-under-government-schemes-report/articleshow/116577513.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new research has revealed that a person with TB in India spends, on average, close to Rs 32,000 during treatment. While some of the costs incurred out of the patient's pocket are direct, such as those spent on diagnosis or hospitalisation, the rest are indirect, for example, costs incurred due to loss of wages.Despite free diagnosis and care under National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP), research conducted by leading experts from Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), TB support network of WHO country office for India, and Central TB Division shows that patients incur high costs, primarily due to lost productivity and hospitalisation.The researchers measured cost of treatment of over 1,400 TB patients notified under NTEP between May 2022 and Feb 2023. Catastrophic costs were defined as expenditure on TB care being more than 20% of annual household income.According to results published in Global Health Research and Policy (GHRP) journal, the median of total costs of TB care among the study participants was Rs 32,000 (approx). ""Catastrophic costs, experienced by 45% of persons with TB, affected the poor mostly,"" the study found.Enabling early notification of TB, expanding coverage of health insurance schemes to include persons with TB, and implementing TB sensitive strategies to address social determinants of TB may significantly reduce catastrophic costs incurred by patients, the researchers pointed out.Though TB diagnosis and treatment is free of cost under NTEP, persons with TB incur loss of wages and experience loss of productivity both due to periods of absence from paid work, visits to health facilities for diagnosis, drug collection or follow-up investigations which amounts to non-direct costs.Direct costs, the researchers pointed out, are incurred mostly before diagnosis or during hospitalisation for TB diagnosis or treatment. ""Several health facility visits are made before a person with presumptive TB is diagnosed with TB, with longer pre-diagnosis period leading to higher expenditure,"" says the study.","A person with TB in India spends, on average, close to Rs 32,000 during treatment.

They have opted not to tranquilize the animal, hoping it will return safely to Kuno.Residents of Sheopur were thrilled to catch a glimpse of the cheetah as it moved through the area. Locals excitedly shared videos on social media, celebrating this rare sighting outside the protected habitat.It seems to be following in the footsteps of cheetah Pawan aka Oban, the original ghumakkad, who kept wandering beyond Kuno's confines, keeping foresters on the tenterhooks.

This April, female cheetah Veera was rescued by foresters after going for a stroll in Jaura, Pahargarh, and Kailaras areas of Morena for 25 days.Rajasthan's forest officials have been alerted to the wandering cheetah's movements.

Digress tigress: Zeenat's diary of adventure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digress-tigress-zeenats-diary-of-adventure/articleshow/116577184.cms,"Hello, world! My name is Zeenat and I am a stripingly pretty three-year-old tigress (think of me as wild feline equivalent of an 18-year-old human). I was born in Tadoba-Andheri Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra. But life has bigger plans for me. They told me I am to be a pioneer, a bringer of fresh genes to Similipal Tiger Reserve in Odisha, a role meant to strengthen the tiger lineage. I was brought to Similipal on Nov 14, and I spent 10 days in a soft enclosure.Nov 24: The gates to my new wild home are finally opened at Chahala. Sure, the humans have their reasons for releasing me into the wild, hoping I will breed a strong generation of tigers. But honestly? I am not interested in playing the part yet. I slip through a gap in the fence and, just like that, I am off.Dec 9: Something in me purrs, ""Go further."" I listen. With moonlight as my guide, I cross over from Similipal into Jharkhand overnight, fording the Subarnarekha. When the sun rises, the humans seem puzzled. They track me through that little gadget they put around my neck - a radio collar - and realise I am no longer in Odisha. I wander 5km into Jharkhand's Chaibasa. It is not a difficult journey.Dec 10: The humans are nervous and track me with their devices, making sure they know exactly where I am. They send out alerts to authorities in Bengal, just in case I decide to make a run for it into their forests. They also reach out to Jharkhand's authorities. I hear their whispers in the wind, their worry travelling faster than my paws. But I am not interested in returning to Similipal. Not yet. For now, I stay put in Jharkhand.Dec 11: Oh, they're getting serious. The humans want to tranquillize me and bring me back to Similipal. A whole team armed with darts is sent to keep an eye on me. The idea of being knocked out doesn't sound appealing. I keep moving, covering distances at night, always staying a few steps ahead.Dec 15: I stay put for a bit in Rajabasa of Chakulia range (in Jharkhand). I take down some prey and need a rest. The humans monitor me closely, following every signal from my collar. They are relieved I haven't gone closer to villages or gotten too curious about human settlements.Dec 17: I start heading south, inching closer to Odisha. Kumki elephants are brought in, and the humans hope they will help guide me back. As if I am going to let them herd me like cattle. I am not playing along. I retreat deeper into the forests of Chakulia range. I become a shadow.Dec 18: The humans seem unsure whether to tranquillize me. I overhear them saying I am weak and haven't eaten since Saturday (Dec 14). Weak? Me? I smile inwardly at the irony. Tigers like me thrive on resilience. They hope to catch me in one of their darting operations, but every move they make, I counter with stealth.Dec 20: Surprise! I have crossed into Bengal's Jhargram forest. The humans are on edge. They are worried I might stray too close to densely populated areas. I am not planning to cause trouble. So, I move quietly, avoiding people and their villages. The landscape here is more challenging, more rugged, and I am loving it. I move swiftly.Dec 21: Belpahari range in Jhargram, a pit stop. The radio collar's signals are patchy, and I sense the humans' frustration. They can't seem to figure out where I will pop up next. The forests here are different, the prey scarce, and the human presence palpable. I don't linger.Dec 22: Here I am, deep in Purulia district's Bandwan, 50km from where I was last spotted. The humans are trying to get a lock on my position through the collar, but it is not easy when the land is tricky. I am careful, staying away from villages and focusing on wildlife around me. Will I return to Similipal? Perhaps. But for now, my adventure continues.","Three-year-old Zeenat was born in Tadoba-Andheri Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra.

i tells

TOI’s Subodh Ghildiyal

. Excerpts from the interview:

How do you see the winter session?

INDIA bloc unity seems to be fraying. Many allies did not agree with Congress focus on Adani.

Congress was gung-ho after Lok Sabha polls, but much seems to have changed after the defeats in Maharashtra and Haryana.

About the LS numbers not changing over five years, the speculation is that Maharashtra allies NCP and Shiv Sena could switch sides.

The opposition managed to raise the questions it wanted - Adani indictment and role of Sebi chief, Manipur, farmers demand for support price, railways, erosion of autonomy of law enforcement institutions. Govt evaded all questions.The fact that the govt had no reply on Adani showed it was on the backfoot on this matter and is hiding something. Sometimes, we will have difference of opinion, which is normal. When we were protesting over Adani, many allies took part in our protest outside the House. And when we protested against home minister Amit Shah, everybody participated on all days. There are bound to be differences on select issues and yet, we maintained a healthy relationship.There are many state elections to be fought and there will be victories and defeats. But the numbers inside Parliament will not change, and we saw the govt barely scrape through on the introduction of the bill on 'simultaneous elections'. If we had some more people there, we could have blocked it. The results of the state elections over five years will not change the distribution of numbers inside LS.This question is not worth answering. We are united and serious about questioning the partisan role of the Election Commission, the voters' list and the way the poll officers are appointed. I think the Maharashtra elections pose very serious questions about the faith of voters in the integrity of the EC.","The opposition managed to raise the questions it wanted - Adani indictment and role of Sebi chief, Manipur, farmers demand for support price, railways, erosion of autonomy of law enforcement institutions.

He said that while just 2.5% households in the state had access to drinking water before 2018, now 85% had tap water.

Forest cover of eight mountain states down in 2 years: Government report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forest-cover-of-eight-mountain-states-down-in-2-years-government-report/articleshow/116576551.cms,"Some districts in Mizoram, J&K, HP, Karnataka saw green cover rise



DEHRADUN: The latest India State of Forest Report (ISFR), which provides an assessment of the country's green cover situation, has revealed a decline in forest cover in eight mountain states over the period between 2021 and 2023, with several northeastern states on the list.Tripura recorded the largest loss of 95.3 sq km, followed by Arunachal Pradesh (-91 sq km), Assam (-79 sq km), Manipur (-54.8 sq km), Nagaland (-51.9 sq km), Meghalaya (-30 sq km), Uttarakhand (-22 sq km) and West Bengal (-2.4 sq km). ISFR further shows that in Uttarakhand, the decline of 22.9 sq km includes forest cover of Corbett, Rajaji and Kedarnath forest divisions, among other 21 forest divisions that saw a dip in forest cover in two years.The report prepared by the Dehradun-based Forest Survey of India, while explaining the significance of forest cover for mountain districts, stated: “Forests in hill areas act as natural barriers to soil erosion and landslides as their root systems bind soil. They support biodiversity, sustain water sources and regulate microclimates. Besides providing environmental benefits, these forests impact local livelihoods and traditions.”Kumaon-based historian, environmentalist and Padma Shri awardee Shekhar Pathak, told TOI: “The Forest Policy of 1952 or The Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 mentioned that all the mountain states should have at least 66% forest cover while other states should have 33% forests. But these laws have been diluted over the years, resulting in reduced forests in the ecologically- sensitive mountain states.”Pathak added: “In both Himalayan and Western Ghats, natural ecosystems are fragile. And due to rising extremities of climate change, rapid urbanisation of mountains and increasing calamities, in the event of natural or man-made disasters, the destruction would be manifold. A new phenomenon of urban landslides can be seen everywhere — whether it is Shimla and Nainital or Darjeeling and Gangtok.”“The entire belt of forests from Kashmir to Mizoram is uniquely sensitive alongside its fragile geological and tectonic diversity, apart from different climatic zones which thrive on forests, and need protection from felling,” Pathak cautioned. It is not all gloomy for the hill districts in the country though. Some hill districts in a few states, including Himalayan and coastal states and UTs, registered “gains in forest cover of 234 sq km”. These include Mizoram (241.7 sq km), J&K (83.5 sq km), HP (54.7 sq km), and Karnataka (54.68 sq km). Notably, the biennial report analysed forest cover across 172 mountain districts in 17 states and UTs","Tripura recorded the largest loss of 95.3 sq km, followed by Arunachal Pradesh (-91 sq km), Assam (-79 sq km) and Nagaland (-51.9 sq km).

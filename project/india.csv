What led to 'unprecedented' rush that caused stampede?



Also read:

NEW DELHI: At least 18 people died, including 14 women and three children and over a dozen sustained injuries in a stampede that occurred on Saturday night at the New Delhi Railway station. The incident occurred after a massive surge in passengers heading to Maha Kumbh and those waiting for the trains that had got delayed.A two-member high-level committee has been formed to investigate the matter and determine the cause of the stampede, executive director of information & publicity at the Railway Board, Dilip Kumar said.This comes after the recent stampede at Maha Kumbh due to sudden surge in devotees on Mauni Amavasya that led to the death of 30.The authorities have said that the ""unprecedented"" rush of passengers at two platforms- 13 and 14- led to chaos and panic ultimately causing the stampede.In an official statement, the deputy commissioner of police (railway) reported that platform number 14 was already heavily crowded as the Prayagraj Express awaited departure. Additionally, delays in the Swatantra Senani Express and Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani Express led to an increased passenger presence on platforms 12, 13, and 14, further contributing to the congestion.""As per CMI, every hour 1,500 general tickets were sold by railways due to which the station got overcrowded and became uncontrollable. There was a stampede at platform no. 14 and near escalator near platform no. 16,"" the DCP said.DCP KPS Malhotra elaborated that the crowd surged within 15-20 minutes after the announcement of a special train, as passengers hurried to board. ""Two trains were delayed, and due to the increased footfall, the crowd grew massive. A few people sustained injuries. As of now, the situation is under control,"" he had said.An eyewitness recalled similar situation and said, ""The stampede broke out around 9.30pm... When people on platform number 13 saw trains on platforms 14 and 15 - they moved towards these platforms. The platforms of the trains were not changed, but the crowd was so huge that it could not be controlled....""One of the passengers, Dharmendra Singh, recounted his experience, stating that he was traveling to Prayagraj but faced difficulties as many trains were either delayed or canceled. ""I was going to Prayagraj but many trains were running late or were cancelled. The station was overcrowded. There were far more people than I have ever seen at this station. In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers.""Likewise, the railway ministry said, ""An Unprecedented rush situation developed today at about 10 pm in New Delhi railway station near platforms 13 & 14. Some of the passengers present there on the platforms fainted due to this sudden rush further leading to the rumours of stampede like situation. This led to the spread of panic.""The railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has ordered a high level inquiry into the incident.","At least 18 people died, including 14 women and three children and over a dozen sustained injuries in a stampede that occurred on Saturday night at the New Delhi Railway station.

Deepa Sarai has history of radical connections

BAREILLY: There was nothing for over a decade. Mohammad Usman 's whereabouts had remained a mystery. A resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal, he vanished in 2012 without a trace - no calls, no letters, no clue about his fate. Then, on Saturday, the silence was shattered. Police suddenly received a letter from the home department confirming that Usman, now 46, was lodged in a jail in Lahore, Pakistan.The revelation left his family in shock and prompted intel agencies to investigate whether his disappearance was part of a larger, more sinister network - terrorism.With the Pakistani foreign ministry recently informing Indian authorities that he was arrested ""last year"", the mystery surrounding Usman has only deepened.Usman had told his family he was going to Delhi before he went missing. His brother, Mohs Farman, recalled a different timeline: ""In 1995, Usman had gone to Delhi, where he learnt AC repairing. He remained in touch with the family until 2012 but vanished after security agencies began searching for him as a suspected al-Qaida terrorist.""Where was he all this while then? Caught off guard by the revelation, Indian home ministry has now tasked Sambhal police with retracing his movements and determining how he ended up in Pakistan. There is also the need to fill up gaps in the chronology.Authorities suspect Usman may have been linked to a terrorist organisation, though no concrete evidence has emerged. His wife, Razia, and other family members have been questioned, but none could explain how he reached Pakistan, by which route and showing what papers. Meanwhile, police have stepped up surveillance in the entire district, scrutinising travel records and monitoring those who have visited Pakistan in recent years.Usman's case is not an isolated one. Deepa Sarai has a history of radical connections. The neighbourhood was home to Maulana Asim Umar, also known as Shannu or Sana-ul-Haq, who became the head of al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent before being killed in a US-Afghanistan operation in 2019. Umar disappeared in the 1990s, and intelligence reports indicate that 10 to 12 young men from Deepa Sarai have gone missing since - many later surfacing in Pakistan.Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi confirmed Usman's arrest to TOI, adding an unexpected detail.""During questioning in Pakistan, Usman mentioned that former Sambhal MP Shafiq-ur-Rahman Barq (grandfather of current Samajwadi Party MP Zia-Ur-Rahman Barq) lived in his neighbourhood and that he also knew a certain Haji Nazeeb well. However, he was unaware that Barq had passed away. We are still trying to find out who Nazeeb is""Police have intensified their investigation, gathering data on Usman's finances, communication records, and past movements. ""His family members have been questioned, and security agencies are probing all angles,"" Bishnoi said. ""We are collecting data on mobile numbers, bank accounts, and properties. Possible hawala transactions or high-value bank transfers are also being examined,"" he added.","Mohammad Usman's whereabouts had remained a mystery.

Mucherla organ donation

success inspires villages in neighbourhood

HYDERABAD: At less than one per million population, India has one of the poorest organ donation rates in the world. But Mucherla in Telangana's Hanumakonda district is known for another kind of statistic - the 500 residents of this village have all pledged to donate their eyes after death.Over the past few years, around 70 villagers have donated their eyes.Mandala Ravinder, a divisional engineer in the irrigation department and a resident, told TOI he took the first step a decade ago by pledging to donate his mother's eyes. ""I strongly believe organs should not go waste after death. I pledged to donate my own organs and previously donated my father's organs in 2019. I encouraged others to follow suit, hoping it would help those in need and bring about positive change,"" he said.Inspired by Ravinder, many villagers followed suit, joining the movement to donate their organs and eyes. ""We inform Ravinder sir if a death occurs in the family. He, in turn, contacts the doctors, who do the needful. He is our go-to man,"" said Malla Reddy, a villager. Families actively participate in the cause, with many expressing how the decision has brought them closer, reinforcing the idea that even in death, one can continue to give, and live.The movement began several years ago when a few villagers took the first steps by pledging their eyes, and it quickly gained momentum. The success of Mucherla's organ donation initiative has sparked a ripple effect in neighbouring villages, with at least 20 individuals pledging to donate their eyes to the LV Prasad Eye Institute after their passing. Medical professionals regularly visit the village to conduct health camps and raise awareness about the importance of organ donation.Mucherla has also set up a well-organised system, keeping detailed records of those who have pledged to donate, and coordinating with hospitals in Hanumakonda district to ensure a prompt response when needed. ""We donated my mother's eyes, and I take immense pride in our contribution to reduce visual impairment in society,"" said B Sujatha, a villager. ""Our community's commitment has created a model of organ donation that continues to grow and inspire change. This achievement proves that when a community comes together with a shared purpose, we can make a meaningful difference,"" she told TOI.The village's dedication was recently acknowledged when it received the 'excellence in eye donation' award from the governor.","Mucherla in Telangana's Hanumakonda district has one of the poorest organ donation rates in the world.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?

For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

Canada has announced new regulatory measures granting border and immigration officials broader authority to annul temporary resident documents, including study and work permits. Implemented by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), these amendments took effect on January 31, 2025, as documented in Canada Gazette II. The initiative seeks to reinforce border security, thwart immigration fraud, and uphold the integrity of Canada’s temporary residence programmes.The updated framework marks a paradigm shift from previous policies, significantly widening the scope under which officers can rescind temporary resident documentation. The pivotal changes include:Immigration officers now possess the authority to annul study and work permits under the following circumstances:Officers now wield expanded powers to rescind eTAs and TRVs in instances of:Canada has introduced stricter immigration enforcement measures to stem fraudulent study permits and unauthorized stays.

Here is a look at how the new immigration rules will help the Canadian governmentCanada’s study permit system has been subject to increased scrutiny amid concerns over fraudulent acceptance letters and unauthorized stays. With the revised regulations, immigration officers can now rescind permits where misrepresentation or non-compliance with visa conditions is detected.Historically, immigration officials could refuse applications but had restricted authority to revoke already issued permits. The new amendments rectify this shortfall, equipping officers with the ability to act decisively when a permit holder is found ineligible, thereby safeguarding the credibility of Canada’s temporary residence programmes.Beyond deterring the misuse of immigration documentation, these regulatory enhancements align with Canada’s overarching border security objectives. Officers can now annul temporary resident documents if they suspect an individual intends to overstay their authorised duration. Furthermore, permits reported as lost, stolen, or abandoned may be revoked, mitigating risks associated with identity fraud.","Canada has introduced stricter immigration enforcement measures to stem fraudulent study permits and unauthorized stays.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.","The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

NEW DELHI: A planeload of 119 illegal Indian immigrants from the US landed in Amritsar on Saturday making it the second deportation flight this year. This is one of the two flights of deportees expected to land in the country this weekend, news agency PTI reported, quoting official sources.It comes a day after PM Modi and US President Donald Trump vowed to address the issue during their bilateral talks. PM Modi had categorically mentioned the need to end the ecosystem that exploited people and ""fooled (them) with big dreams"" to travel to the US illegally.However, there was no discussion on the treatment meted out to the deportees, who were shackled and handcuffed on the US military aircraft, drawing criticism from the opposition leaders.Last week, a US military plane with 104 deportees landed in Amritsar drawing flak from the Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann. The CM slammed the central government and called it an effort to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis"" by turning the city into ""a deportation centre"".""This is a deliberate attempt to send out the message that only Punjabis travel illegally,"" Mann said, adding that the Centre should ""divert the aircraft to Delhi or Ahmedabad. Punjab govt will bring back Punjabis with honour. But we maintain that illegal immigration is not just Punjab's problem, but a national one.""India is the largest source of illegal immigration to the US outside Latin America, with over 7,25,000 undocumented individuals, according to US officials.Amid rising MAGA-driven opposition to immigration, which affects over a million Indian professionals and students on legitimate H-1B, L, and F1 visas, Indian officials have pushed back, emphasizing their economic contributions and the role of people-to-people ties in strengthening US-India relations .",A planeload of 119 illegal Indian immigrants from the US landed in Amritsar on Saturday.

Kharge slams Modi govt over stampede



NEW DELHI: At least 18 people killed, including 14 women and several others were injured in a stampede at New Delhi Railway Station late Saturday night, according to Delhi Police.The incident was triggered by a surge in the crowd of passengers waiting to board trains to Prayagraj, where the Maha Kumbh is underway, on platforms 14 and 15 of the station. Within 15-20 minutes, chaos broke out as passengers rushed forward, leading to multiple casualties and injuries.Eyewitnesses reported that the crowd surge was sparked by the delay of two trains, which led to an unexpected influx of passengers. As people rushed to board the special train, the situation spiralled out of control, with some passengers fainting amid the sudden surge. This sparked rumours of a stampede, leading to further panic.One victim recounted the loss of his mother in the chaos. ""We were traveling to Chhapra, Bihar, but my mother lost her life in the crowd. People were pushing each other,"" he said, adding that the doctor confirmed her death. Another family member collapsed in grief at the hospital.The Northern Railways CPRO, however, initially denied that a stampede had occurred, calling it a ""rumour."" Despite this, authorities confirmed multiple casualties and injuries, prompting an emergency response.Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed sorrow over the incident. In a post on X, he said, ""Distressed by the stampede at New Delhi Railway Station. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede.""Following the incident, the Delhi Fire Service received an emergency call, and four fire tenders were deployed to the station. Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel and Delhi Police officials assisted in evacuating injured and fainted passengers, who were rushed to nearby hospitals for medical treatment.Northern Railway’s Chief Public Relations Officer, Himanshu Upadhyay, stated that the overcrowding led to people pushing each other, causing injuries. ""They were taken to hospitals for first aid,"" he said.Authorities have since brought the situation under control. DCP Railway KPS Malhotra stated that the rush had subsided and confirmed that the unexpected crowd surge was the primary reason behind the chaos. Further investigations are underway to determine the exact sequence of events that led to the tragedy.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced a high-level investigation into the incident. In response to the massive crowd, he also confirmed that four special trains were arranged to manage the unexpected rush, with additional trains on standby.In a post on X, Vaishnaw said, “4 special trains to evacuate this unprecedented sudden rush at NDLS. The rush has now reduced.”While the railway minister denied reports of a stampede, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh referred to the incident as one in his message.Defence minister Rajnath Singh expressed condolences on social media, saying, “Devastating news from New Delhi Railway Station.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States. Tharoor acknowledged key achievements from PM Modi ’s visit, particularly on trade negotiations and defence cooperation. He welcomed the trade deal discussions and expressed optimism over India’s diplomatic engagements.However, his remarks prompted a clarification from the Congress party , which said that individual opinions do not reflect the party’s official stance.He stressed that when someone in the government does the right thing, it should be recognised, irrespective of who's in power.“For 16 years, I have been in politics. My attitude has been that when somebody in the government, whether it’s our government or some other party’s government, does the right thing or does something well, one should acknowledge and praise it, and when they do something badly, one should criticise it.”“If I were to praise all the time, no one would take me seriously. If I were to criticise all the time, no one would take me seriously either… There’s got to be some give and take in democracy,” the Congress MP said.Tharoor also welcomed the progress on trade talks between India and the US, saying that an agreement had been reached to conduct negotiations over the next nine months. “It’s far better than Washington hastily and unilaterally imposing some tariffs on us, which could have damaged and hurt our exports. It seems to me that something good has been achieved, and I applaud that as an Indian,” he said.On illegal immigration, he questioned whether Modi had raised concerns over the treatment of Indian nationals deported from the US. “There are some questions that still remain… Why did the question of the way in which those illegal immigrants were returned to India not get addressed? Did PM Modi raise it behind closed doors?”He further elaborated, “The only thing missing from what Prime Minister Modi said was the question of the manner in which those people were treated and sent back. I think otherwise his stand was absolutely correct. These are misled youth who have been encouraged or induced to migrate illegally, and they should be taken back. If they are Indian citizens, they belong in our country, we take them back. But I hope that something was said behind closed doors, not perhaps in the press conference, but inside privately, that this manner of doing it—the handcuffs, the insults, the mistreatment, the military aircraft—all that should be avoided in future.”On Trump calling PM Modi a better negotiator than himself, the Congress MP called it an ""astonishing"" acknowledgment. He noted that Trump, known for branding himself as a master dealmaker, rarely compliments others, especially in areas he considers his expertise.""I think calling Mr. Modi a better negotiator than himself is astonishing because Mr. Trump takes pride in being this sort of art of the deal that is his strength. And his admirers, including yesterday the defense secretary of the US, had said that Mr. Trump is the greatest negotiator in the world.""""And here Mr. Trump says Mr. Modi is better than him. So I think we are looking at a very high degree of praise from a man who is not known for saying praiseworthy things. So this is good news,"" Tharoor said.Following Tharoor’s comments, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took to social media to clarify the party’s position without directly naming Tharoor. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Indian National Congress is our country’s ONLY political party where there is absolute freedom of speech as well as freedom after speech. Members give their views on issues which are, on occasion, their own and do not reflect the opinion of the party as a collective entity. It is the party’s stance that is paramount.”","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States.

The survey forms were filled up or signed by the family member who gave details. Now, we have started a second round of survey to give an opportunity to the remaining 3.1 per cent,"" Revanth said.""It doesn't matter even if I end up as the last chief minister from the Reddy community. As a disciplined party worker and CM, I took up the caste survey to keep the promise given by our leader Rahul Gandhi. This is my commitment. The caste census was not done for my benefit or my position. The caste survey is accurate and there are no faults in its statistics. I am ready to remain an activist to uphold the ideals of our leader Rahul Gandhi. If the BCs fall prey to opposition campaigns, they will lose forever,"" the CM said.Reacting strongly, BJP leader N Ramchander Rao also condemned Reddy's remarks terming them as ""cheap"" and in poor political taste.Rao said that the statement was made to divert the people's attention from the caste census ""fiasco"" of the Congress government in the state.""The remarks by the chief minister of Telangana about the caste of Prime Minister Narendra Modi are cheap and in poor political taste. This statement has been made by the Congress party only to divert their caste census fiasco, which has failed in the state,"" Rao told ANI.""Their ministers themselves said that the entire census needs to be reviewed since some people have been left out,"" he added.BJP OBC Morcha national president K Laxman also lashed out at Telangana chief minister, saying that his statement about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's caste was ""false.""""The statement made by CM Revanth Reddy on PM Narendra Modi's caste is completely false... Before becoming the CM of Gujarat, PM Narendra Modi's caste was added to the OBC list of the Gujarat government in 1994 and to the Centre's list before 2000... Revanth Reddy has given this statement to distract people's anger against him for not fulfilling the promises he made before being elected,"" Laxman said.","Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy claimed PM Modi did not belong to the backward classes at the time he was born. Union minister G Kishan Reddy hit out at Reddy for the comments, saying the CM ""should make statements based on facts""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118278173,imgsize-760467,width-400,resizemode-4/118278173.jpg"

Smugglers use TikTok to target Indians for illegal US migration: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smugglers-use-tiktok-to-target-indians-for-illegal-us-migration-report/articleshow/118280916.cms,"New York Post

As a second US plane carrying deported Indian nationals prepares to land in Amritsar, a report has revealed that smugglers are openly using social media to facilitate illegal migration to the United States. According to the, human traffickers , known as ""coyotes,"" have been advertising their services on TikTok, offering Indian nationals a route into the US via Canada for as much as $5,000. These posts, claim to provide a ""100% safe"" journey with ""payment after reach.""The social media posts promise a hassle-free crossing from cities like Montreal, Brampton, and Surrey into the US states of New York or Washington. The New York Post contacted a smuggler who confirmed a charge of $4,500 for a journey involving a two-hour car ride and a 25-minute walk through the woods, where migrants are given a map to navigate the border. Up to five individuals are reportedly taken at a time in these ""group walks.""While smugglers continue to exploit social media for illegal migration, the US has intensified its crackdown. On Saturday, a plane carrying 119 deported Indian nationals is set to arrive at Amritsar’s Sri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport. This marks the second batch of deportees under the Trump administration’s stricter immigration policies. Official told confirmed that 67 of those being deported are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, three from Uttar Pradesh, two each from Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. A third flight, carrying 157 deportees, is expected to arrive on February 16.Earlier this month, a US military aircraft transported 104 deportees back to India. Many of them had attempted to enter the US using “donkey routes,” a term for the illegal and often dangerous paths taken by migrants. These individuals had reportedly paid large sums to human traffickers but were caught at the border and sent back in shackles.The deportations have sparked controversy, particularly in Punjab, where chief minister Bhagwant Mann has accused the central government of deliberately choosing Amritsar as the landing site to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis."" Addressing the media on Friday, Mann questioned the selection of Amritsar over other major airports like Delhi, alleging a political agenda behind the move. He claimed that the Centre was portraying Punjab as a hub for illegal migration, despite the issue being a nationwide problem.“The BJP-led Centre always discriminates against Punjab. It does not let go of any chance to defame the state,” Mann said. He insisted that Punjab would welcome the deportees with dignity and offer them support, including a visit to the Golden Temple’s langar. Mann also demanded action against fraudulent agents responsible for misleading youth into illegal migration.In response, BJP leader Tarun Chugh accused Mann of playing politics over the issue. He argued that the real concern should be why so many young people were forced to migrate illegally in the first place. “People of Punjab want to know who misled these youths, who forced them to sell their land and homes. Rather than catching the culprits, the AAP leader is politicising the issue,” Chugh said.","Smugglers are advertising their services on TikTok, offering Indian nationals a route into the US via Canada for as much as $5,000.

Additionally, another Congress MP Manish Tewari came out in support of Punjab CM.""He is absolutely right. The first aircraft that landed with immigrants who were brought back in inhuman conditions had most of the people from Gujarat.

If you are not able to crack down on agents, it is a failure of the government..,"" Priyanka Chaturvedi said.""What Bhagwat Mann said was merely to create headlines. It was all meaningless. The flight should have been landed in Delhi... Punjab is not getting defamed in any way. Punjab has a lot of NRIs, and they contribute to our economy in a big way. Punjabis are living a happy life abroad... What are the governments doing to stop such large-scale emigration?"" asked Congress's Gurjit Singh AujlaHe further questioned the state government over the actions taken to create employment in the state. ""What has the state government done to employ our people, and what is the state's law and order?... Because the people of Punjab are economically well-off, they prefer to go to the US.

You select Amritsar to defame Punjab. America's military planes are landing in Amritsar, and an enemy country, Pakistan, is right next to it. Lahore is 40 km from there...

Amritsar is being chosen deliberately to portray that only Punjabis are illegal migrants... Why is Ahmedabad or Ambala not chosen?... BJP always conspires to defame Punjab... They don't let international flights operate from Amritsar, claiming that it is not suitable for it, so why are flights coming in from the US now?... I will strictly oppose this... I demand to the MEA and the MHA that the plane is still onboard, change the route and make it land in Delhi, Hindon or Ahmedabad...,"" he added.BJP leaders dismissed the claims saying that this wasn't the first time that illegal immigrants have been deported.

Most deaths due to suffocation amidst chaos



NEW DELHI: A stampede at New Delhi railway station on Saturday night because of an unprecedented number of passengers headed for Maha Kumbh is learned to have claimed at least 15 lives, including three children. Many people were injured in the ensuing panic and mad scramble to either board the trains or rush out of the station.The chief casualty medical officer at LNJP confirmed that 15 people had lost their lives and 10 others were injured. The casualties we- re mostly due to suffocation. “Distressed by the stampede... My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones,” PM Modi posted on X.Thousands of passengers were caught in the deadly crush that unfolded in a matter of minutes, leaving a trail of death in its wake. Frantic screams and cries for help filled the air. The chaotic situa tion began to unfold at 9.45pm.

According to railway police, 1,500 general tickets had been sold and that was the primary reason the crowd became unmanageable.“The stampede-like situation was mainly on platform no. 14 and near the escalator near platform no. 1,” said a senior cop. The announcement of the arrival of a special train may have added to the chaos. An FIR of causing death due to negligence was being registered and a special team formed to investigate the matter.“Situation under control at New Delhi railway station.

AMRITSAR/JALANDHAR: Leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly Partap Singh Bajwa criticised Punjab CM Bhagwant Singh Mann and the state's AAP-led govt even as a US aircraft carrying Indian deportees was to land in Amritsar on Saturday, accusing Mann of failing to curb the human trafficking of Punjabis in the last three yearsThe Congress politician said Punjab Prevention of Human Smuggling Act, 2012, regulated the profession of travel agents to check and curb illegal and fraudulent activities and malpractices of travel agents and others involved in human trafficking in Punjab. ""Can Bhagwant Mann, who also holds the home portfolio, let Punjabis know how many travel agents were booked under the same law in the last three years,"" he asked.Mann, meanwhile, promised that the state govt would first investigate why the deportees had gone abroad, which agents deceived them, and how much money they had lost, so that efforts could be made to recover the money. He also said 10 FIRs had been registered against the travel agents in earlier cases and investigation had begun.Touching upon the returnees' rehabilitation, he said govt will provide them opportunities based on their skills - whether it's helping them open a restaurant if they worked in one, or offering employment if they clear a competency exam. He reiterated that Centre was determined to transform the holy city - home to the Golden Temple, Durgiana Temple, Ram Teerath, and Jallianwala Bagh, along with its rich textile heritage - into a ""deporation centre"".Expressing sympathy for Indians being deported from the US, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee offered to provide them transportation from the airport to their homes. In a statement issued ahead of the arrival of another plane from the US on Saturday, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said the committee was ready to also arrange accommodation for the deportees. ""Those in need can approach the SGPC staff stationed at the airport for assistance,"" said Dhami.He also expressed concern over the ""inhumane treatment"" of the deportees, asking why they were being treated in such a manner. BJP national secretary and now Delhi MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa too attacked Mann, alleging that travel agents in Punjab had looted these deportees while Mann's govt and Punjab police kept on taking money from the unscrupulous travel agents. ""Otherwise, how could such travel agents have a thriving business in Punjab,"" he asked.Punjab BJP also posted on its social media accounts asking Mann if Punjab's reputation was not tarnished ""when there were explosions in Punjab, homes were being destroyed daily by drugs, gangsters were demanding ransoms, unemployed teachers were being beaten, and Punjab was drowning in debt."" The party unit reminded him of his promise of building a system where children would return from abroad, and even foreigners would seek jobs here, but no policy for this had been implemented in three years of his govt.Punjabi netizens, meanwhile, criticised Punjab CM for not speaking up and raising questions when the first plane carrying deportees landed at Amritsar even though it carried more deportees from Gujarat and Haryana than from Punjab.","Partap Singh Bajwa accuses Bhagwant Singh Mann of failing to curb human trafficking of Punjabis in the last three years.

Accused's lawyer: Murder case did not reach court. What can we do?

MEERUT: A court in UP's Bulandshahr has pulled up police for failing to file a chargesheet in a 26-year-old murder case despite arresting the accused, recovering the alleged murder weapon and even filing a separate chargesheet against him in an arms Act case.The lapse, which allowed the accused to remain a free man for over two decades, came to light only when the arms Act case was recently heard in court.Expressing strong displeasure over the negligence, the judge ordered immediate filing of the charge sheet and an inquiry into why it had not been submitted earlier. Police are now scampering to find answers and frame a charge sheet.In March 1999, 65-year-old Lakkhi Singh was murdered by unidentified assailants in Bulandshahr's Kotwali area. His son, Vijaypal Singh, lodged a police complaint, and an FIR was duly registered. During the investigation, police arrested Lakkhi's grandson and Vijaypal's nephew Kailash Chand , now 55 years old, accusing him of murder over a property dispute. A pistol allegedly used in the crime was seized from him, leading to a case under the Arms Act. However, Kailash was granted bail within days due to lack of evidence. Charge sheet for the murder, though, was never filed in court, and Kailash was never formally put on trial, allowing him to continue living freely.District judge Manjit Singh Shyoran, who was hearing Arms Act case, discovered the ""serious lapse"" and questioned why the fard challan, a receipt issued when case documents are filed in court, was missing. The advocate handling the case must submit this receipt. If police had filed the charge sheet, the fard challan too would have been deposited.Kailash's advocate, Dolly Sharma, criticised police for failing in their duty. ""My client has been attending hearings for Arms Act case, but the murder case has not reached court. What can we do?""Bulandshahr SSP Shlok Kumar confirmed receiving a letter from the court regarding the issue. ""An in-depth investigation is underway,"" he said.Officials are now trying to determine why the charge sheet was not filed, who was responsible for the error, and whether any police personnel should be held accountable now that a quarter of a century has gone by.",A court in UP's Bulandshahr has pulled up police for failing to file a chargesheet in a 26-year-old murder case.

Army & IAF intensify hunt for advanced anti-drone systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-iaf-intensify-hunt-for-advanced-anti-drone-systems/articleshow/118290751.cms,"-Picture-

NEW DELHI: With the threat from hostile drones and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in both conventional and irregular warfare continuing to expand exponentially, the armed forces are stepping-up induction of a wide array of anti-drone systems but underline the urgent need for more advanced ones.The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDD&IS) to add to the ones already inducted under emergency procurements for the frontier with China.The IAF, in turn, wants 10 new kamikaze drones-based anti-swarm drone systems, 10 mobile micro munitions-based anti-swarm drone systems and 100-200 vehicle-mounted counter-UAS .Among other systems, IAF will begin inducting 200 radio frequency jammer guns from next month under a contract inked a year ago, while Army is getting around 30 vehicle-based drone jammers .“But much more advanced anti-drone systems, with multiple `soft-kill’ and `hard-kill’ options as well as much longer interception ranges, are urgently needed,” a senior officer said. These systems range from jamming, spoofing and blinding systems that disrupt the satellite or video command-and-control links of drones to laser-based directed energy weapons (DEWs) for hard-kills.A major problem, however, is that India is way behind other countries in indigenously developing such complex technologies. After DRDO developed anti-drone systems with 2-kilowatt to 10-kilowatt lasers, the armed forces ordered 23 such systems for around Rs 400 crore.“DRDO is developing DEWs with higher power. Many domestic private firms are also tying up with foreign companies for advanced anti-drone solutions. Let’s hope they work out,” another officer said.The Modi-Trump summit, incidentally, welcomed the new partnership between US company Anduril Industries and Indian Mahindra Group on advanced autonomous technologies to co-produce an “advanced AI-enabled counter-UAS”.The Army still relies heavily on old air defence systems, many of which have outlived their operational lives. “Though emergency procurements of anti-drone systems have been undertaken in recent years, they remain inadequate in countering the rapidly evolving threat from drones, which has been repeatedly reinforced by the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts,” he added.There is, for instance, the need to develop more advanced versions of the existing vehicle-mounted IDD&IS inducted by the Army Air Defence, which at present can soft-kill drones by jamming at 2 to 5-km range, with the effective hard-kill range through lasers only around 800-metre. “There is a mounting threat from low radar cross-section UAS and swarm drones,” an officer said.IAF air defence systems, with advanced radars and ground-to-air missile systems, are also geared towards thwarting air intrusions by large UAS, aircraft and helicopters. “The lack of adequate effective multi-sensor, multi-kill systems against smaller drones is an operational gap,” an officer said.A concerted effort is required to reduce the R&D time, fast-track procurement processes and ensure rapid induction of advanced counter-drone technologies. “The domestic defence industry should accelerate the production of advanced and scalable anti-drone systems to protect critical assets, particularly during wartime and heightened tensions,” he added.","The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems.

AMRITSAR: An American aircraft carrying 116 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US was delayed and arrived at Amritsar's international airport a little past 11.30pm Saturday, the second such flight after a US military C-17 plane had brought back 104 deportees to the same airport on February 5.At a press conference earlier Saturday, Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Singh Mann had once again expressed anger over the flight landing in the holy city amid allegations of attempts by the Centre to ""tarnish the image of Punjab and Punjabis"". A third US flight carrying Indian deportees is expected to also land on Sunday, PTI reported, quoting official sources.When it was pointed out that the Centre had probably chosen Amritsar as the landing point for deportation flight as it was nearer to the US than other Indian airports, Mann shot back: ""If Amritsar is so close, then it would make sense to start flights from here to the US and Canada as we have been demanding.""Sixty-five of Saturday's deportees are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, 8 from Gujarat, two each from UP, Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, and one each from HP and J&K , PTI quoted official sources as saying, adding that 119 had been expected but an updated passenger manifest had been provided later.BJP national spokesperson RP Singh had said in a post on X on Saturday, in which Mann was tagged, ""Amritsar is the closest international airport for flights entering India from the US"" and that was why the US plane was landing there"".Mann also questioned the appropriateness of allowing a US military plane to land in a city close to the border, saying, ""Other countries are sending their civilian planes to bring back their deportees, so why are we allowing a US military plane to land here?"" He also asked whether Vatican City would allow a US military plane to land in its territory. [Vatican City has a heliport for VIPs; other visitors use Rome's airports.]Punjab's govt has arranged temporary accommodation for deportees from outside the state, who will leave for Delhi on a 6.30am flight on Sunday.

They had spent 45 lakh on each of the cousins to send them to the US. Their uncle, Nishan Singh, said the two young men from Khanowal, in Gurdaspur, had reached the US just 10 days ago but were caught and deported. He added that a US-based travel agent had assured them of legal entry into US.CM Mann, Union junior minister for railways Ravneet Singh Bittu and Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla had visited the airport for some time earlier in the day.Mann, asked at Saturday's press conference whether Indian deportees would be in restraints, said state govt did not have any information about this, and that PM Modi should have raised the issue with Donald Trump when he met him.",65 of 116 deportees in 2nd flight are from Punjab.

NEW DELHI: ""We didn't stop teaching arithmetic just because we got calculators. We need to teach students what the machines can't do and how to use machines (more efficiently)."" That's how the world's leading universities are coping with AI, according to Michael Spence , University College London ( UCL ) president & provost.Speaking at the ET Now Global Business Summit here Saturday, Spence said: ""There are three things we need to teach our students - the skills the machines will never have (like) interpersonal and cross-disciplinary skills. Then, we need to teach them to use the machines. My vice provost research is a cognitive neuroscientist who works on the consciousness of AI.

Interestingly, almost everybody came back and said a deep understanding of the discipline. And that's because you need to know something about anything to develop core critical thinking skills that actually are going to mean that you survive. You also need a capacity to think across disciplines, a sort of T-shaped education that is multi-disciplinary, as well as disciplinary,"" Spence said.Students, he said, need an ""international perspective.""""We not only have students from about 160 countries, but we send our students right across the world for learning experiences of one kind or another.

"Move over tapas, Kerala chef’s NYC debut bets big on toddy shop ‘touchings’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/move-over-tapas-kerala-chefs-nyc-debut-bets-big-on-toddy-shop-touchings/articleshow/118282661.cms,"Chef Regi Mathew

Newly launched

Chatti restaurant

gives a global makeover to the

spicy side dishes

that are a mainstay of local liquor dens in Kerala

“If tapas can be the global face of Spanish food, why can’t 'touchings' be the same for Kerala?” It’s with this thought that chef Regi Mathew launched his first international venture Chatti in Manhattan’s Garment District in early February, blocks away from Times Square.‘Touchings’ are small, spiced side dishes made in toddy shops (kallu shaaps in local parlance) across Kerala. “While you’re having toddy, you touch and eat. That’s why it’s called touchings,” explains Mathew who as culinary director and founder of Kappa Chakka Kandhari (KCK) in Chennai and Bengaluru, has earned multiple Chef of the Year awards for celebrating Kerala’s homestyle cooking.For Chatti, Mathew was inspired by the food of Kerala's toddy shops where locals and curious tourists gather over frothy toddy — a fermented palm sap liquor — paired with fiery touchings. Think karimeen pollichathu (spiced pearl spot fish steamed in banana leaves), duck mappas, and spicy red fish curries. “In a state that values equity, debate, and free expression, toddy shops create space for people from all walks of life to come together, share a table, and engage in conversation over toddy and touchings,” he says, moved by the community spirit of these beloved, barebones drinking dens that act like cultural equalizers.Chatti (which means a traditional clay pot for cooking curries) joins a wave of Indian restaurants in the US that champion hyperlocal regional flavours, like Bungalow and the Michelin-starred Semma which spotlights Tamil Nadu’s rural homestyle cooking. These chefs are redefining Indian cuisine beyond idli-dosa-sambar and butter chicken, highlighting bold, unapologetic flavours from Indian homes and farms.‘Touchings’ are central to the Chatti experience. To guide diners, Mathew has done it up like a tapas bar. “The images are displayed on a table mat with an explanation, which guests find quite interesting. They can read up, point to the picture and say, ‘I want one of this’ or ‘One of that, please’,” says Mathew.The strategy works. “If two people come, they’ll order at least six to seven ‘touchings’. We have kept the pricing and portion smaller so they can try a lot of dishes,” he adds, holding out a menu that spans Kerala’s diverse landscape, from ‘prawn pouches steamed in banana leaves’ to ‘toddy shop beef fry’, ‘tender jackfruit cutlets’, ‘pearl spot parcels’, ‘clay pot fish curry’ and ‘gooseberry masala with pomfret’.Chef Mathew’s passion for food began in childhood, learning from his mother. He later trained globally, launching restaurants like Benjarong and Ente Keralam in Chennai. Known for his rigorous research, Mathew and his team spent over three years travelling across Kerala, visiting more than 300 homes and 100 toddy shops, testing around 800 recipes and perfecting rare home cooking techniques. This led to his flagship KCK’s Chennai launch in 2018, followed by Bengaluru.“When we went around Kerala, we realised our cuisine has so many hidden treasures, which we wanted to bring to the world. But I didn’t want to rush it,” says Mathew.The restaurant maintains deep ties with Kerala’s farming communities. “We are still bringing our spices from India because I’m particularly picky about what spice I should use. Peppercorns are sourced from Pulpally in Wayanad, jaggery from Marayoor, fresh tea leaves from Munnar, and cold-pressed coconut oil from a homemakers’ collective in Ernakulam,” says Mathew. Beyond spices, key ingredients like tapioca, coconut, jackfruit, and seafood are imported directly from Kerala. He collaborates with small enterprises and women’s groups for hand-picked spices and artisanal blends as well.Mathew smiles as he recalls the toddy shops of his youth in Kottayam. ""Growing up, we weren't allowed to visit these places. My mother would worry, thinking, 'I sent him to college, and he's off to a toddy shop instead!'"" he chuckles.But now with Chatti, Mathew has created a cultural bridge, bringing the warmth and conviviality of Kerala’s toddy shops to the world.","'Touchings' are small, spiced side dishes made in toddy shops (kallu shaaps in local parlance) across Kerala.

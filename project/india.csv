NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has appointed four additional special roll observers for West Bengal to bolster oversight of the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the state, according to a notification.The appointees are Ratan Biswas, Vikas Singh, Sandeep Rewaji Rathod and Dr Shailesh.""The SROs will closely monitor the revision and verification exercises and ensure strict adherence to statutory instructions,"" an official was quoted as saying by PTI.""The SROs were appointed to ensure transparency, accuracy, and uniform implementation of instructions related to electoral rolls. They will independently review the process on the ground and flag any deviations for immediate corrective action,"" he added.In addition to the SROs, the Election Commission has deployed observers at various levels to monitor the Special Intensive Revision exercise. The official said the move aims to strengthen public confidence in the integrity of the electoral rolls. The appointments take effect immediately and will remain in force until further orders, the notification read.The revision drive has been ongoing in West Bengal for more than two months, causing confusion among citizens and placing extreme pressure on field staff.Several BLOs have reportedly died from health complications or suicide, attributed to the increased workload.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee criticised the ongoing SIR in the state, alleging that a process meant to be constructive has already led to 77 deaths and left several others hospitalised.""It is shocking that an exercise which should have been constructive and productive has already seen 77 deaths with 4 attempts to suicide and 17 persons falling sick and necessitating hospitalisation,"" she wrote in her letter to the Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar.Mamata Banerjee also criticised the Election Commission, saying the ongoing Special Intensive Revision is putting citizens under undue pressure and scrutiny.She described the process as “relentless harassment” of ordinary people and emphasized that careful human judgment is essential, as the revision forms the foundation of democracy and the constitutional framework.Criticising the Election Commission, the Chief Minister said even the “elderly, infirm, and seriously ill” are not being spared. She added that many voters are being forced to travel 20–25 km to attend hearings, which have been centralised rather than decentralised.Amid the outcry, the poll panel announced 160 additional SIR hearing centres, mostly in North Bengal, taking into account geographical challenges and voter accessibility, officials said.",The Election Commission has appointed four additional special roll observers for West Bengal. The SROs will bolster oversight of the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the state.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

BHAGALPUR: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) MP Nishikant Dubey on Saturday reacted to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid at the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) office and matters involving West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee , stating that the Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) leader is not troubled by the ED but by a purported ""CD"" that could potentially end her political career.Speaking to ANI, Dubey said, ""They (Mamata Banerjee) are not troubled by ED but by their CD, their CD is very dangerous, perhaps it could end their entire political career, so they are not troubled by ED but by CD...""The remark comes after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee allegedly interfered during an ED raid in Kolkata at the offices of political consultancy firm I-PAC in connection with the coal smuggling case.Earlier, Banerjee questioned the legality of the raid, alleging that the central agency had seized party-related materials, including hard disks, candidate lists and strategic documents, and accused Amit Shah of misusing central agencies.""Is it the duty of the ED, Amit Shah, to collect the party's hard disk, candidate list? The nasty, naughty Home Minister who cannot protect the country is taking away all my party documents,"" Banerjee said while speaking to reporters.""At 6:00 am, they arrived and seized the party's data, laptops, strategies, and mobile phones. Their forensic experts transferred all the data. I believe this is a crime,"" she said.Countering the Chief Minister's allegations, the ED accused Mamata Banerjee of entering the residential premises of Prateek Jain, director of I-PAC, during the ongoing search operation and taking away ""key evidence"", including physical documents and electronic devices.""Banerjee entered the residential premises of Prateek Jain and took away key evidence, including physical documents and electronic devices,"" the ED said, adding that her convoy then proceeded to I-PAC's office, from where ""Ms Banerjee, her aides and the state police personnel forcibly removed physical documents and electronic evidence"".On Friday, TMC MPs in Delhi staged a protest at the Home Ministry in Delhi, raising slogans against Amit Shah, alleging ""misuse"" of the probe agency.

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk-owned X social media platform admitted its mistake and stated it would comply with Indian law as it blocked 3,500 pieces of content and deleted over 600 accounts linked to obscene imageries generated using the platform's AI tool, Grok.""The social media platform 'X' has admitted its mistake and stated that it will comply with Indian law. Around 3,500 pieces of content were blocked, and over 600 accounts were deleted. Going forward, X will not allow obscene imagery,"" government sources told news agency ANI.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had raised concerns over obscene and harmful content allegedly generated by Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok.The ministry sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk, pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform.The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.Now, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.",The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had raised concerns over obscene and harmful content allegedly generated by Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok.

LONDON: UK shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel has called on the British government to intervene in the ""increase in violence"" in Bangladesh that has involved murders of Hindus and use its influence to bring about stability in the country.The British Indian Opposition Conservative MP posted her letter to Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on social media on Friday, which also calls upon the Labour Party government to make a statement on the issue in the House of Commons.""The situation in Bangladesh is very concerning.

Upcoming Dwarka exploration phase to be more extensive: ASI

AHMEDABAD: Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna and home to the revered Dwarkadhish Temple, is set to witness renewed rounds of archaeological excavations, both on land and underwater, senior officials of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have said. The proposed work aims to explore previously unexamined areas using modern technology to gain a deeper understanding of the region's historical and cultural past, reports Parth Shastri.Underwater archaeological excavations at Dwarka were last carried out between 2005 and 2007, while limited exploratory studies were conducted again in 2025.According to ASI officials, the upcoming phase will be more extensive and systematic. Alok Tripathi, additional director-general of ASI, told TOI that new areas at Beyt Dwarka and unexplored underwater zones will be covered by the agency's Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW).""Dwarka has been under study for nearly 40 years, but the work so far has been limited in scope and objectives. We are now examining the other side of the mouth of the Gomti river,"" Tripathi said.Experts said modern tools and technology would be deployed to enable larger and deeper excavations in the Arabian Sea.Tripathi himself was part of the five-member UAW team that conducted underwater exploratory work at Dwarka in Feb last year. During that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also dived underwater off Dwarka coast to view submerged remains discovered on the seabed, drawing national attention to the site.On land, the focus will be on relatively undisturbed areas of Beyt Dwarka. Earlier excavations were largely concentrated near the cliff area. ""We are now going deeper inside the forest area, where we have observed signs of a significant settlement. The site has some remarkable features, and excavations at lower levels could reveal important details about settlement planning, economic activities, arts and crafts, and the way of life of the inhabitants,"" Tripathi said.The site has attracted attention alike due to the legend of the sunken city of Dwarka, believed to be founded by Lord Krishna. The ASI website indicates that explorations were carried out to understand the submerged archaeological remains off the coast of Dwarka as sculptures and stone anchors were found during low tide in coastal areas.The excavations so far have yielded many antiquities, including terracotta objects, beads, fragmented bangles, copper rings, iron ingots and pottery among others, according to the ASI website.Apart from Dwarka, the ASI has also initiated excavations at other key sites in Gujarat. Work has begun at Valabhipur, the ancient capital located in Bhavnagar district, and at Lothal, the Harappan-era site renowned for its water structure believed to be among the world's oldest dockyards. With the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex near Lothal, archaeologists are exposing a larger area of the site using advanced tools and techniques. Tripathi emphasised that archaeology goes beyond excavation. ""Our task is to place findings in perspective and fill gaps in historical understanding,"" he said, adding that India's use of technology in archaeology is on par with global standards and increasingly relies on interdisciplinary approaches.Gujarat has seen significant archaeological activity over the past decade, including extensive ASI-led excavations at Vadnagar in Mehsana district, PM Modi's hometown, uncovering evidence of continuous habitation over two millennia. The state is also home to major Harappan sites such as Dholavira, now a Unesco World Heritage Site, and Lothal, highlighting Gujarat's rich and layered archaeological heritage.","Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna, is set to see renewed rounds of archaeological excavations.

US Supreme Court ruling: Treasury has enough funds if Trump’s tariffs are struck down; when refunds could begin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-supreme-court-ruling-treasury-has-enough-funds-if-trumps-tariffs-are-struck-down-when-refunds-could-begin/articleshow/126448985.cms,"'No Call From PM Modi': Trump Aide Lutnick's Shocker On India-US Trade Deal Amid Tariff Threats

If the US Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for the tariff refunds, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said. The timeline of payments, however, might extend to weeks or even a year, he told Reuters.In an interview, Bessent said he doubted the court would rule against Trump's tariffs, but suggested that any refunds could become a “corporate boondoggle” for companies that passed on the costs to their customers.""It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,"" he said.""Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?""Bessent added that, in general, companies had not been passing tariffs on to consumers, stating there was ""very, very little, if any, pass-through,"" and disputed that Trump's tariffs had contributed to inflation. He noted that goods inflation had remained below headline inflation.Importers and trade lawyers had expected a Supreme Court ruling on Friday, but the court issued a decision on a different matter instead.It remains unclear when the court will rule on the tariff case, which challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.Bessent said he believed that the longer the decision is delayed, the more likely the Supreme Court will rule in Trump's favour.With nearly $774 billion in cash as of Thursday, the treasury has more than enough to cover any refunds. Treasury borrowing estimates for January-March 2026 project an end-March cash balance of around $850 billion.""We're not talking about the money all goes out in a day. Probably over weeks, months, may take over a year, right?"" Bessent told Reuters.He also indicated that Treasury budget data for calendar year 2025 would likely show a deficit reduction of $300 billion to $400 billion from 2024, providing additional capacity. The government reported a fiscal-year deficit of $1.775 trillion for 2025, which ended on 30 September.Importers have warned that recouping any tariffs paid could be difficult if the Supreme Court finds Trump's IEEPA-based duties illegal. According to Customs and Border Protection data, $133.5 billion in such tariffs had been assessed through 14 December, with the total likely approaching $150 billion, based on Reuters calculations.Bessent disputed this estimate, saying it was ""not the number"" for tariffs potentially subject to refunds. He noted that revenues from tariffs imposed under other legal authorities also existed, but did not provide a specific figure for IEEPA-based tariffs.",Treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for tariff refunds.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

A senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official’s comment calling former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" has drawn criticism from players in the country. Tamim, one of Bangladesh’s leading openers, had advised the BCB not to be driven by emotion while deciding on the national team’s participation in the T20 World Cup in India.Nazmul, chairman of the BCB finance committee, made the remark in a Facebook post.""This time, the people of Bangladesh witnessed, with their own eyes, the emergence of yet another proven Indian agent,"" he wrote.The post received immediate backlash from former and current cricketers, including Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, and Taijul Islam.The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) also expressed concern.""A comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal has come to the attention of the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh. We are stunned, shocked, and outraged by it. Such a remark by a board official about the most successful opener in Bangladesh's history, who represented the country for 16 years, is utterly condemnable.""""Not only because it concerns a player like Tamim, but such comments about any cricketer of the country are unacceptable and insulting to the entire cricketing community,"" the players’ body said in a statement.The 36-year-old Tamim played 70 Tests, 243 ODIs, and 78 T20 Internationals for Bangladesh.""We strongly protest against this comment. When a responsible board director makes such remarks on a public platform, it also raises serious questions about the code of conduct of board officials,"" CWAB said.""We have already submitted a protest letter to the BCB president, demanding a public apology from the concerned board director and that he be brought under accountability. We hope the BCB president will take appropriate action as soon as possible,"" the statement added.Bangladesh had written to the International Cricket Council requesting their T20 World Cup games be moved out of India after the BCCI asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman ahead of the 2026 edition.""Cricket is the life of Bangladesh.

I hope the concerned authorities will consider the matter seriously and adopt a more responsible stance in the future,"" he added.In 2007, Tamim’s half-century had helped Bangladesh eliminate India from the ODI World Cup in the Caribbean.Former Bangladesh captain Mominul said Nazmul’s remarks were unacceptable.""The comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal is completely unacceptable and insulting to the country's cricketing community. Such behaviour towards a cricketer is in direct conflict with the board's responsibility and ethics,"" Mominul said.""A senior cricketer was not given even the minimum respect; instead, he was deliberately humiliated in public. Such remarks show a lack of even basic decorum regarding where and how to speak while holding such a high responsibility.""I strongly condemn this comment and firmly demand a public apology from the concerned director and that he be brought under accountability.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

PUNE: Estranged cousins Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule came together for the first time on a political platform on Saturday to release the joint manifesto of NCP and NCP (SP) for the Pune civic polls nearly two-and-a-half years after the split in the family and party. However, both remained non-committal on a possible merger of their outfits. ""Wait and watch,"" said Ajit Pawar, without giving a specific answer to the issue of speculation over the parties' merger.Ajit Pawar's NCP and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP) formed an alliance for the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation elections despite being on opposite sides in the state govt and at the Centre. NCP is with the governing alliance in both govts, while NCP (SP) is in the opposition. After the two NCPs forged the alliance, some workers from both sides were disappointed. Speaking on the issue, Sule said, ""When any alliance is formed, some party workers get disappointed. But we will not leave them on their own. On both sides of the alliance, our focus is on workers and not on netas.""When Sule was asked about her absence in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) poll campaign, her cousin Ajit Pawar came to the rescue.""She told me to take the lead in the campaign as I am older to her and promised that she would follow me,"" he said. The PMC will go to polls with 28 other municipal corporations in the state on Jan 15.The bonhomie between members of the two parties was visible during the release of the joint manifesto. They had trained guns on each other during the Lok Sabha and assembly polls in 2024 following the split in NCP in July 2023. Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP) approached the court against Ajit Pawar's NCP, claiming ownership of the party's name and the ""clock"" symbol.Asked about speculation over the parties coming together when the case was still in court, the deputy chief minister said, ""We respect the court's order and follow it. As far as the solution to the issue is concerned, Supriya and I will sit together and find it on our own; nobody else needs to bother about it.""",Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule came together for the first time on a political platform.

Ayodhya Faced Conspiracies But Sanatan Prevailed, UP CM Yogi Adityanath Says At Ram Temple Event

AYODHYA/LUCKNOW: A 55-year-old man from Kashmir entered the Ram temple in Ayodhya and attempted to offer namaz near a restricted area on Saturday evening, sending security posted at the complex into a tizzy.The person, identified as Abu Ahmad Sheikh (55), was detained as he was trying to offer namaz near the southern circumambulatory corridor of the Ram Janmabhoomi complex, close to Sita Rasoi.Sheikh is a resident of Wodapora village in J&K's Shopian district. Officials said he had completed darshan and was exiting the premises when security personnel noticed his actions and immediately restrained him.Sources said the man raised slogans after being stopped, following which intelligence agencies and police swung into action. He was taken to the Ram Janmabhoomi police outpost, and was being questioned under the supervision of SP (security) Balramachari Dubey.Ayodhya SSP Gaurav Grover said the man's antecedents were being verified and a detailed report had been sought from J&K Police. No suspicious object was recovered from him, Grover said.The district administration and the Ram Temple Trust had not issued any statement till late evening.The incident inside the high-security temple complex has brought Ayodhya's security architecture under sharp focus. Several former DGPs TOI spoke to said the shrine's protection must remain uncompromising and should be constantly evolving in view of its religious significance, high footfalls and rising threat perception. Since the consecration of Ram Lalla, around 1.5 lakh devotees have been visiting the shrine daily on an average.In view of repeated threats and high footfall at the complex, the state is planning a permanent NSG hub in Ayodhya to strengthen rapid response to terror threats and high-risk situations.","The man, identified as Abu Ahmad Sheikh (55), was detained as he was trying to offer namaz near the southern circumambulatory corridor of the Ram Janmabhoomi complex.

MUMBAI: Just four days before her retirement on Jan 3, former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to the state home department saying an offence should be registered against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, along with two other police officers, for conspiring to arrest Devendra Fadnavis, who was opposition leader, and Eknath Shinde, who was UD minister, during the tenure of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) govt.An SIT was formed to probe the issue raised in the assembly by MLC Pravin Darekar, and it submitted its report to the govt. Shukla was asked to submit her opinion on the report. Pandey declined to comment.The SIT had investigated the allegation of a criminal conspiracy to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an urban land ceiling (ULC) certificates scam case. The scam pertained to builders who allegedly submitted bogus ULC certificates and were exempted from surrendering 5% excess land to govt. During the MVA govt's tenure, Thane police had investigated businessman Sanjay Punamia, who was in a dispute with his business partner Shaymsundar Agarwal, in the scam. Afterwards, Punamia had alleged he was pressured to give a statement against Fadnavis and Shinde.Shukla suggested the govt register an FIR against Pandey and police officers Laxmikant Patil and Sardar Patil for criminal conspiracy, a public servant disobeying the law, fabricating evidence, threatening a person to give a false statement, and for conspiring to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an old case registered in Thane in 2016.A retired police officer said there is no provision in law where a mere alleged intention to arrest, when no arrest was made, becomes an offence.Laxmikant Patil, then DCP, crime, Thane, used a govt vehicle to visit Mantralaya, Vidhan Bhavan, office of the DGP and Sahyadri guest house in Mumbai, but instead of mentioning the exact location, his drivers wrote only ""Mumbai"" in the vehicle's log book. It was also alleged Laxmikant Patil exerted pressure on the accused and witnesses. It was further said Shukla found that while Punamia was in custody in a 2021 case registered in Thane, Patil interrogated him regarding the ULC scam and pressurised him to give a false statement that Fadnavis extorted money from builders. Retired ACP Sardar Patil was investigating the case.The investigating officer conducted a re-investigation on the basis of an application submitted by one Raju Shaha to the then DGP Pandey in May 2021. The chargesheet in the case was submitted in 2017. The SIT said that on the instruction of Pandey, Laxmikant Patil arranged an appointment for Shaha with him (then DGP) for submission of an application, based on which police started the re-investigation of the Thane case with an intention to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde. Subsequently, Pandey became Mumbai police commissioner, and he allegedly pressured a junior officer to file charges against Fadnavis in an offence registered with cyber police in BKC. Pandey spent five months in jail after retirement on charges of alleged money laundering.BJP Mumbai president Ameet Satam said there ""was an invisible hand which was none other than that of then CM Uddhav Thackeray"" behind Pandey's act.","Former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to govt just 4 days before her retirement on Jan 3 against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey.

BENGALURU: Photonics and defence technology firm olee.space Friday said it has successfully demonstrated an indigenous wireless laser communication system capable of transmitting data at 10Gbps over a distance of 20km.The system, built with about 85% locally sourced components, was designed, manufactured and tested in India. The company said the demonstration validated its ability to deliver long-range, high-capacity optical wireless links suitable for defence and other strategic applications under representative atmospheric conditions.Wireless laser communication offers advantages such as independence from radio-frequency spectrum, low probability of interception and resistance to electronic jamming, making it relevant for defence and government use where conventional RF systems face limitations.According to olee.space , the platform integrates precision opto-mechanical subsystems developed in-house, including a high-accuracy, Indian-manufactured gimbal with arc-second level pointing precision.It also features an internally integrated fast steering mirror assembly. “Together, the dual-stage stabilisation system uses voice-coil and piezo-mounted actuators [mechanisms that convert electrical energy into motion] to maintain link stability over long distances, even under dynamic atmospheric or platform-induced disturbances,” the firm said. olee.space founder and CEO James Solomon said the achievement marked a significant milestone for indigenous optical communication capabilities.“Achieving a 20km, 10 Gbps optical link with carrier-grade availability under Indian operating conditions establishes India’s ability to design, manufacture and validate advanced wireless laser communication systems using predominantly indigenous technologies,” he said.During performance validation, the system achieved a carrier-grade link availability of over 99.9%, meeting operational requirements for mission-critical communication.The company said the entire design, integration and field demonstration were completed within four months of project funding. This, it noted, reflected the growing maturity of India’s private-sector defence manufacturing ecosystem and its capacity to deliver advanced optical communication systems at speed.The system’s architecture is designed to be adaptable across terrestrial, maritime, aerial and high-altitude platforms, with potential for future space-based applications, subject to integration requirements. By reducing reliance on imported optical communication subsystems, the capability supports India’s push towards end-to-end indigenous development in advanced wireless communication technologies.","Olee.space Friday said it has successfully demonstrated an indigenous wireless laser communication system.

It said the issue must be looked at through science and psychology, adding that while the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules may not be perfect, they need to be reviewed, not discarded.The counsel said the law already recognises a difference between normal street dogs and aggressive dogs and argued that some aggressive dogs can improve after treatment and behavioural care, though it accepted that aggression can return in some cases. Such dogs, he said, must be clearly identified by designated committees.When the Counsel cited example of a long-standing stray dog at AIIMS, the court said any dog living on the streets is likely to carry ticks and warned that allowing such animals inside hospitals could have “disastrous consequences”. The judges told the counsel not to romanticise the presence of dogs in sensitive public spaces.""Was she being taken to the hospital theatre also? Any dog that’s in the streets is bound to have ticks.And a dog with ticks in a hospital will have disastrous consequences. Do you understand? We’ll let you know the reality of what is being argued. You (the dog lover’s side) are completely removed from reality. Don’t try to glorify these dogs in the hospitals,"" the bench said.Suggestions like colour-coded collars to identify dogs with a history of biting were also raised by Tagore's counsel, citing examples from other countries. The court questioned the comparison and asked lawyers to remain realistic, pointing to differences in population size.The Supreme Court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.",Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs.

2026 assembly elections: Survive or revive? Congress's alliance dilemma in states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2026-assembly-elections-survive-or-revive-congresss-alliance-dilemma-in-states/articleshow/126451589.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is gearing up for the latest round of electoral challenges in 2026. With assembly elections due in four key states - Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu , and Kerala, as well as one Union Territory, Puducherry - there is a lot at stake for the grand old party. The Congress is the principal challenger to the ruling dispensation in Kerala and Assam, while in Tamil Nadu, it will try to win a second term along with its ally, the DMK.2025 was a disastrous year for the Congress electorally. It could not open its account in the Delhi assembly elections, while it was reduced to its lowest score in Bihar.So, will 2026 see a change in the electoral fortunes of the Congress? Well, it all depends on how the grand-old party negotiates with its “grand-old problems.”And one of the biggest problems of the Congress in recent times has been its dilemma over alliances. The party, which successfully ran two coalition governments at the Centre between 2004 and 2014, has been struggling to get its alliance arithmetic right ever since it was pushed out of the ‘centre’stage of Indian politics by the BJP in 2014.A string of electoral defeats and the simultaneous winning spree of the BJP forced the Congress to join hands with parties that were once its political opponents in several states.And this perhaps explains why the grand-old party struggles when it comes to forming alliances. While on the one hand, the Congress wants to use coalitions to stay politically relevant, on the other, it also does not want to cede much space to the regional partners to ensure that it does not lose its political ground and influence. Torn between these two objectives, the Congress often finds itself juggling between “bullying”, “blackmailing” and “bargaining” to stitch alliances.2026 is unlikely to be any different, as the initial developments show. In Tamil Nadu, the Congress seems to be flexing its muscles with the DMK, with which it has had a stable alliance for a very long time, but is not part of the state government.Congress MP Manickam Tagore had set the stage for this arm-twisting earlier this week when he said that alliances remain the political reality in Tamil Nadu and the time has come to move beyond seat-sharing and initiate discussions on the sharing of power.However, with his statement leading to speculations on the future of the alliance, Manickam Tagore was quick to do damage control and said: ""Tamil Nadu is an important state, and we all know that the INDIA alliance is a significant alliance, with Congress being a part of it and the DMK as its major partner. We have contested eight elections together, as the DMK is a long-term ally of Congress.""Tagore’s remark was the second time that a Tamil Nadu Congress leader had spoken of the party joining the state government. Months ago, Killiyoor MLA S Rajeshkumar had said that the party legislators and office bearers would urge the All India Congress Committee to persuade the DMK to accept ""coalition government"" and allot more seats to the party.So, is the Congress-DMK alliance really under strain? Or is the Congress trying to use pressure tactics to renegotiate its position within the alliance?The emergence of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) under Vijay as the third regional player in the state’s politics has made the game of alliances in the state interesting.Vijay has had a growing political presence in Tamil Nadu politics and the public response to his meetings and rallies has been impressive. The TVK chief has made it clear that he will not join hands either with the “corrupt” DMK or the “communal” BJP.While the party has kept the alliance cards close to its chest, a comment by its national spokesperson Felix Gerald triggered speculations about its preferences.""The Congress and TVK are natural allies in terms of secularism and their stand against communalism. In that sense, we have always been natural partners. Rahul Gandhi and our leader are also friends,"" Gerald had said.Later, when senior Congress leader and head of the party's Data Analytics Unit, Praveen Chakravarty, met TVK leader Vijay, it added fuel to the fire. While Chakravarty called the meeting personal, it did little to help end the speculations.The Congress perhaps wants to use Vijay’s TVK to increase its bargaining power vis-a-vis the DMK. But it should be careful of the flip side of these pressure tactics.History is replete with instances when Congress has suffered due to its botched alliance experiments.The most recent example is Bihar, where the Congress and the RJD could not come to an agreement on seat sharing even after the date for filing of nominations for the first phase was over. The fallout of this was that when RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav went to file his nomination papers, no Congress leader was by his side. Though the allies did manage to come to an agreement eventually, it was perhaps too late for them to pose any real challenge to the NDA.In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress refused to give seats to the Samajwadi Party, leading to an open war of words between the two parties. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had then reacted strongly to the Congress’s move. However, the two parties eventually managed to iron out differences and contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in alliance in Uttar Pradesh.In Delhi, the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP have been in and out of alliance several times. While they contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections together, in the last assembly elections, they went all out against each other. Analysis of the results later showed that Congress played a key role in the defeat of AAP at the hands of the BJP, facilitating its return to power.In Maharashtra, the Congress has walked out of the opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi and is contesting the civic polls alone. This was after the Thackeray brothers decided to join hands for the BMC polls and also the NCP factions scripted a union of sorts.In West Bengal, which also goes to polls in a few months, the Congress and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress are allies at the national level under the INDIA bloc, but are bitter political rivals in the state. The two parties have made several unsuccessful attempts to reach an understanding. The ruling Trinamool accuses the Congress, which has been literally wiped out in the state, of being unreasonable in its demand for seats. The Congress, on the other hand, argues that complete surrender to Trinamool would mean that the doors for the party’s possible revival in future are closed forever.Clearly, in many of these states, the Congress seems to be stuck between the devil and the deep sea in terms of its choices. The party’s first predicament is to decide if it wants an alliance or wants to contest alone to start the process of revival. Once it decides on an alliance, the priority shifts to safeguarding its long-term interests by not conceding too much to the regional partner. This often results in protracted bargaining, bullying and even blackmailing. And at the end of all this, more often than not, the Congress ends up having egg on its face.So, the question is: Has the Congress learnt its alliance lessons? Well, we will have answers in the next few months.","The Congress is gearing up for the latest round of electoral challenges in 2026.

Amit Shah Outlines Foolproof NIDMS Mechanism To Counter Future Terror Attacks

JAIPUR/JODHPUR: Union minister Amit Shah Saturday credited the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP govt in Rajasthan with streamlining the recruitment system in the state, putting an end to the paper leak scandals, which he alleged had become a recurring feature during the previous Congress dispensation.Shah was addressing newly recruited police constables, while distributing appointment letters at the Rajasthan Police Academy. He said nearly 9,000 candidates were recruited, including over 2,500 women, and symbolically handed appointment letters to 10 constables.""Before coming here, I learnt about the entire (recruitment) process. I want to tell the people of Rajasthan that these 9,000 youths got jobs without paying anything, and without any recommendation, purely on merit and hard work,"" Shah said. He added that the recruitment process ensured transparency, eliminated corruption and respected skills.The home minister maintained that the 2025 constable recruitment examination was conducted transparently with the use of technology.Highlighting the challenges of policing in the state, which has a 1,070-km international border with Pakistan, rugged ravines and the Thar Desert, Shah urged the new recruits to undergo training with full dedication to contribute to the goal of a ""surakshit (safe) Rajasthan"".Shah said this would be the first batch to join Rajasthan Police after the introduction of three new criminal laws, and claimed that once the laws are fully implemented, any FIR registered will have a system in place for justice to be delivered up to the Supreme Court within three years.On the occasion, CM Sharma announced the establishment of Rajasthan Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (R4C) on the lines of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to tackle cybercrime. He said the R4C would be developed as a centre of excellence and provide a centralised framework for coordination, information sharing and research on cyber crimes across all districts.Addressing a convention in Jodhpur later, Shah praised the Maheshwari community for its sustained contributions to India - from the era of battles against Mughals through the freedom struggle and into post-Independence nation-building.","Shah was addressing newly recruited police constables, while distributing appointment letters at the Rajasthan Police Academy.

Only 1 in 5 deaths in India medically certified: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-1-in-5-deaths-in-india-medically-certified-study/articleshow/126458125.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India records one of the highest numbers of deaths globally, yet the country still does not know what most people die of - a gap most pronounced in north India and even the national capital. A nationwide study published in Scientific Reports has found that only 22.5% of deaths in India are medically certified, leaving nearly four out of five deaths without a doctor-confirmed cause in official records.The findings are particularly significant for Delhi and north Indian states, which together account for a large share of the population. North India has the poorest medical certification of deaths, averaging just 13%, while Delhi's rate has remained stagnant at around 57-59% for years - far from universal coverage despite its dense network of hospitals and medical colleges.The consequences extend well beyond record-keeping. ""Without knowing the cause of death, it becomes difficult to assess disease prevalence nationally or regionally, which in turn affects health delivery, especially in remote areas,"" said Dr Vinay Aggarwal, former national president of Indian Medical Association. He added that poor death documentation also affected processes such as electoral roll revision, underlining the wider administrative fallout.Public health experts warn that unreliable cause-of-death data means govts are effectively planning health policy without knowing which diseases are killing people. Deaths from heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, infections, maternal causes, injuries and suicides cannot be accurately tracked, distorting disease burden estimates and skewing health spending. Weak certification also delays outbreak detection and undermines surveillance at a time when non-communicable diseases account for a growing share of adult deaths.The study tracked death certification patterns across India over 15 years, from 2006 to 2020.Regional disparities are stark. Large parts of north and east India continue to report single-digit or low double-digit certification rates, pulling down national averages and leaving millions of deaths each year without medical explanation.In contrast, southern and western states perform far better, reflecting stronger hospital reporting and administrative compliance. Some Union Territories are close to universal coverage - Lakshadweep reports over 94% medical certification, while Goa has near-complete coverage.The study challenges the assumption that doctor shortages alone explain the gap. While poorly performing states have fewer physicians, the strongest determinant is whether hospitals actually report deaths. In low-performing states, only about half of registered hospitals submit cause-of-death data, compared with over 90% reporting in high-performing states and UTs.The scale of the problem is stark. In 2020, India recorded around 8.8 million deaths. While about 80% were registered, only around 2 million had a medically certified cause. Progress has been slow, with certification improving by just 2.5 percentage points over a decade, despite expanded health infrastructure.Researchers warn that unless medical certification becomes routine and enforceable - particularly in north India and large urban centres like Delhi - India will continue to underestimate major killers, knowing far more about how many people die than why they die.","Only 22.5% of deaths in India are medically certified.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

Multiple FIRs filed 'in malicious manner' against officers: ED

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has decided to move Supreme Court seeking remedy against the ""unfortunate action of West Bengal chief minister"" in obstructing the probe and tampering with evidence in a PMLA case against I-PAC, and a nod to continue with its probe against the political consultancy agency. The petition is likely to be filed late in the night or early Sunday morning.Lawyers aware of the developments told TOI that ED has, in its petition, accused the West Bengal police of actively acting under the directions of the TMC govt to thwart the probe into the money laundering case against I-PAC, by an FIR against the directorate officials to coerce them not to conduct investigations in the case.ED is trying to get the petition listed for Monday amid indications that the solicitor general may represent it if the Supreme Court entertains the plea.The West Bengal govt has already filed a caveat in SC to preempt ED from seeking and getting an ex parte order, amid its continuing political slugfest with central agencies which began with the state govt in Nov 2018, withdrawing general consent to CBI to investigate cases inside the state.ED, it is learnt, has argued that its attempt to raise its grievances before Calcutta HC was unsuccessful as unruly scenes during the hearing on Friday forced the judge to adjourn hearing on a case which required urgent interim orders to protect the sanctity of investigations.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also contemplating requesting Supreme Court to transfer the pending petitions, one by ED and the other by Trinamool Congress relating to I-PAC case, to Delhi high court to be in an atmosphere conducive to adjudication by a constitutional court.The agency had petitioned Calcutta high court on Friday to order a CBI probe against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , DGP Rajeev Kumar, Kolkata Police commissioner Manoj Varma and others for ""theft of digital and other evidence, wrongful restraint and confinement of central govt officers, and breakdown of the rule of law"".It said that multiple FIRs had been registered ""in a malicious manner"" against its officers for conducting an investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) into the financial dealings of political consultancy I-PAC, which has been associated with TMC and the Bengal govt for years.The 28-page petition, filed in response to Mamata and the police brass's allegedly ""illegal and unconstitutional interference"" in ED's search of addresses linked to I-PAC, details how the Bengal CM and her entourage tailed the central agency throughout Thursday - from the Loudon Street residence of the firm's director Pratik Jain to its office in the tech hub of Salt Lake's Sector V.The petition alleges that Mamata entered Jain's residence around 12.05pm and ""took possession of all digital devices along with key incriminating documents"" from an ED officer, ignoring requests not to interfere with the investigation into I-PAC's alleged role in money laundering linked to a 2020 coal scam.At I-PAC's Salt Lake office, ED officers were ""obstructed"" while performing their duties as the CM and a contingent of Trinamool functionaries and workers refused to budge from there for nearly four hours, the petition stated.Countering the CM's allegation that Union home minister Amit Shah had sent ED to ""snatch"" documents and digital storage containing Trinamool Congress's poll plans under the garb of an investigation into I-PAC's dealings, ED informed the high court that its officials officially recorded the sequence of events in a panchnama.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has decided to move Supreme Court seeking remedy against the ""unfortunate action of West Bengal chief minister"" The petition is likely to be filed late in the night or early Sunday morning.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: Coinciding with its fight against ED over searches on I-PAC, Trinamool Congress released on Saturday a three-minute campaign song and music video titled 'Jotoi koro hamla, abar jitbe Bangla' (Attack as much you can, Bengal will win) to galvanise workers ahead of the Bengal elections this summer.The song has echoes of TMC's 2021 campaign theme, ""Bangla nijer meye-kei chaye"" (Bengal wants its own daughter), in a reference to chief minister Mamata Banerjee . This time, weaving ""Bengali asmita"" (pride) into its campaign narrative, the video outlines TMCs core campaign planks in the run-up to the polls.The video highlights attacks on religion and Bengali language, stressing that the political battle is also about ""saving Bengal's plurality"" both in religion and personal choices. Protests against attacks on Bengali-speaking migrants also feature in the clip.According to a TMC senior, two images spell out the narrative for party workers. One is Mamata's fighter perception, reinforced by a split-second image in which she transforms into a Royal Bengal tigress. The second is the positioning of black-and-a-white images of PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah - to mark out the key adversaries.The campaign this time is a repositioning of TMC's 2024 Lok Sabha election theme, ""Jonogoner Gorjon, Banglay BJP er Bisorjon"" (Roar of the people, BJP's ouster from Bengal), TMC's senior functionaries said.TMC had first used this theme ahead of the 2021 assembly elections, a contest that came with a series of firsts for Mamata.""This was the first time she contested from a seat outside Kolkata. It was the first time she had to deal with poll-eve defections on a large scale, including two senior ministers led by Suvendu Adhikari,"" a TMC senior said.Listing the other milestones, the senior pointed out that it was the first time that Mamata led an entire 50-day election campaign, ""not on her feet but on a wheelchair"" after she was injured in a pre-poll car mishap. ""It was the first time she had allowed a poll strategist to recalibrate her political strategy,"" the senior said, alluding to I-PAC founder Prashant Kishor.","The song has echoes of TMC's 2021 campaign theme, ""Bangla nijer meye-kei chaye"" (Bengal wants its own daughter) This time, weaving ""Bengali asmita"" (pride) into its campaign narrative, the video outlines TMCs core campaign planks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126460307,imgsize-1384303,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-24.jpg"

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: A Rs 20 crore hawala transaction allegedly changed hands six times to erase its trail before reaching political consultancy, Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC)'s Goa office from Kolkata, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has alleged in a petition filed before Calcutta high court.ED said that proceeds of crime generated from alleged coal smuggling in West Bengal were routed through domestic and international hawala channels and used to fund political campaigns. One such transfer reached I-PAC during Goa assembly elections in 2021-22, the agency claimed. The allegations are part of an ongoing investigation and are yet to be tested in court.According to ED, investigators traced the money trail to a former director of a New Delhi-based non-banking financial services firm, who allegedly contacted a person known as Munna to move the funds. ED said that Munna linked up with another member of a hawala network, after which money reached a manager of a Kolkata-based hawala firm.In a statement to ED, the hawala firm manager allegedly said that he arranged cash delivery in Goa during 2021-22. The cash was to be handed over to an employee of an event management company, who then contacted the firm's director and its sister concern.ED claimed both companies were handling events and campaign-related work for I-PAC during Goa assembly elections.ED told high court that I-PAC co-founder and director Pratik Jain handled the consultancy's Goa operations at the time. Based on these findings, searches were carried out on Jan 8 at 10 locations in New Delhi and Kolkata, ED said. One of the locations was Jain's home on Loudon Street in central Kolkata.The agency alleged that proceeds originated from a coal smuggling syndicate led by Anup Majee, accused of stealing and illegally excavating coal from premises of Eastern Coalfields Limited, a central public sector coal producer operating across parts of Bengal and Jharkhand. ED claimed stolen coal was sold to factories and plants in districts, including Bankura, Purba Bardhaman and Purulia - all in western and central parts of Bengal.Factory owners allegedly paid in cash, which syndicate members collected and deposited at an office in Bhamuria, a locality in Asansol subdivision of Paschim Bardhaman district, the central agency said."," Enforcement Directorate (ED) claims proceeds of crime generated from alleged coal smuggling in West Bengal were routed through domestic and international hawala channels.

'No Courage, No Strength': Lt Gen Katiyar Ridicules Pak, Exposes Terror Strategy, Warns Against War

CHANDIGARH: Clarifying that the death of a soldier cannot be solely attributed to alcohol consumption, Armed Force Tribunal has held that other service-related factors, including deployment on higher altitude are also contributing factors, reports Ajay Sura. The tribunal passed these orders while granting special family pension to the widow of an IAF soldier who died from a fatal medical condition at 1,500m Kurseong in Darjeeling (West Bengal).A division bench comprising Justice Suresh Kumar Gupta, judicial member, and Major General Sanjay Singh (Retd.), administrative member, of Lucknow bench of AFT passed these orders while allowing an application filed by Kavita Talan, wife of late Corporal Jasvindra Singh Talan. The tribunal held that her husband's death occurred in the performance of official duty. Talan died on July 15, 2015.During the hearing, govt argued that medical summary shows Talan was a 'regular alcohol consumer' for six years prior to his death. The bench observed attributing the death solely to alleged alcohol consumption was unsustainable & lacked a definitive medical basis.","Armed Force Tribunal has held that other service-related factors, including deployment on higher altitude are also contributing factors.

Why Is Divorce Still Treated Like a Sin? The Truth Society Refuses to Accept | Anand Handa

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat HC ruled that terms and conditions agreed during the divorce are fully enforceable and executable by a family court, which earlier refused to direct a divorced woman to relinquish her rights in a joint property with her ex-husband.The couple involved in this case married in 2008 in Ahmedabad. They had a daughter in 2015 and got a divorce decree from the family court in 2019 by mutual consent. Their petition under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act included various terms and conditions for peaceful separation, including that daughter's custody would be with the mother, and she would relinquish her ownership rights in a flat in Vastrapur and cooperate in getting the release deed registered with the sub-registrar.In 2021, when the husband requested his ex-wife to give up her property rights as agreed in the petition, the woman dragged her feet and asked him to transfer the right to their daughter instead. The man approached the family court and sought execution of the settlement to remove the wife's name from the property records.In 2023, the family court declined relief, holding that the divorce decree did not specifically direct execution of a document.The family court said that if the petitioner was desirous of getting the release deed executed, he could do so by filing a separate suit seeking specific performance of the agreement according to the provisions of the Specific Relief Act.The man challenged family court's order. A bench of Justice Sangeeta Vishen and Justice Nisha Thakore quashed the order and held that once settlement terms are incorporated into a consent divorce decree, they become part of the decree itself & must be enforced in execution.The HC questioned whether the wife was permitted to turn around and raise a grievance against the divorce deed and judgment after accepting the family court's decree once. It further said, ""Also, the family court, for executing the decree, cannot relegate the party to file a separate suit for the issues already agreed and judgment having passed in terms thereof. If such a course is allowed, it would go against the spirit of the Act of 1984 as well as the Act of 1955, as the central theme underlying both the legislations is to lessen the litigation, providing early resolution to the disputes between the parties.

CISF designated as nodal agency for port security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cisf-designated-as-nodal-agency-for-port-security/articleshow/125498710.cms,"File photo: X/CISF

NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which currently guards over 70 key airports and 13 seaports, has been mandated by the govt to act as the nodal or regulatory authority for all matters related to port security.The govt on Nov 18 designated CISF as the ‘recognised security organisation’ (RSO) for port security under the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPFSC). The mandate, which aligns with the govt’s vision of port-led growth as it focuses on a ‘blue economy’ as a key driver of economic expansion, followed the recommendation of a joint committee of CISF and DG, Shipping, constituted in Sept 2024 to study port security, conduct gap analysis and suggest remedial measures.As the RSO for ports, CISF said it will carry out a fresh assessment of security systems, prepare standardised security plans compliant with ISPFSC and carry out core security functions at all seaports engaged in export and import (EXIM) operations across the country.There are around 77 EXIM ports in the country, including 12 major and around 65 non-major ports. Also, there are around 200 minor ports where no cargo is handled as of now.However as and when these ports become EXIM ports, CISF will regulate their security as well.“For all things related to port security, the CISF will be the nodal or regulatory authority. We will work in three domains — providing consultancy for the establishment of security systems and gadgets, deploying hybrid security manpower and training all stakeholders in the sector,” said a senior CISF officer.“The initiative aims to resolve longstanding gaps arising from non-standardised security arrangements at non-major ports and ensure oversight by a domain expert security agency across all such facilities,” added CISF DIG(Int) Ajay Dahiya.A hybrid security model, improved screening systems and dedicated training institutions and courses for port-security personnel are also being introduced, officials said.The core security functions to be handled by CISF include access control, CCTV surveillance, perimeter security, seafront patrolling, quick reaction teams and the integrated operations centre. Non-core duties such as traffic management, container terminals and ancillary tasks may be handled by state police, state industrial security forces or private security agencies. However, these personnel too will be trained by a team of CISF experts to ensure professional and standardised port security services.CISF has prepared different training modules, focused on basic port security, specialised security and audit.Till now, seaport security was being dealt with by the Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) under the Directorate General of Shipping, and there was a requirement for a professional agency in this area, a CISF officer said.The officer disclosed that the idea to have a professional and sovereign RSO, had emerged from various top-level security meetings chaired by the prime minister and the home minister over the last few years, where the vulnerability and security gaps in the 254 big and small seaports of the country were underlined.",The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) currently guards over 70 key airports and 13 seaports.

“Arindatri Cheygirparkku Allaal Vinaidhaan







Sirandhaanendru Evearpaart Randru.”

Sheryl Sandberg once wrote about an incident from her early days at Facebook. There was a floor reserved exclusively for directors, where there were no restrooms for women. Not because anyone opposed the idea — but because no one had imagined a woman would rise to that level. It was not hostility, but the soft silence of assumption. This, in essence, is how unconscious bias operates: quietly, invisibly, and often without intent.It is far more pervasive than open prejudice. It does not walk in announcing itself; it seeps into our choices disguised as instinct.Some of the most damaging kinds of favouritism is almost innocent — the kind that arises from unconscious bias. No doors are slammed. No words are spoken. Yet someone is quietly not considered or included. To the decision-maker, it may even feel perfectly fair.I was reminded of this recently during my visit to Sydney, where I addressed a warm and vibrant Tamil gathering. As soon as the programme ended, I rushed to the airport in the same attire I had worn on stage — my favourite sari, a, and slippers without heels. The organisers had booked me in business class, and check-in went smoothly.At the gate, an airline employee took one glance at me and directed me towards the economy class without checking my boarding pass. Only at the aircraft door did another crew member gently redirect me. I did not need to ask why. My profile — a South Indian woman travelling alone, in traditional attire with an unbranded handbag — simply didn’t match her mental picture of a business class passenger. I recall Sudha Murthy narrating a similar experience. She was waiting to board an international flight in the business class passenger line. She was dressed simply, and a couple of fellow women passengers behind her asked her to switch to the economy queue. They felt that they are rendering a helping hand to a passenger!The Sydney airport incident did not offend me. But it made me think. If these assumptions exist in others, do any such layers lie quietly within us too?Remnants of bias are in all of us — carried through culture, upbringing, fears.A recent incident involving actor Gauri Kishan revealed how deeply unconscious bias prevails. At a film press meet, a YouTuber casually asked the hero, “What was the heroine’s weight when you lifted her for that shot?” Gauri immediately objected, but a few reporters kept interrupting her, determined to drown her voice, defending the question.In their world of beliefs, such questions about women were normal — even acceptable. It would never occur to them to treat a man in the same way. Their confidence came from conditioning not cruelty. That is the quiet danger of unconscious bias: it makes the unreasonable appear reasonable.In workplaces, this bias influences hiring, promotions, and leadership opportunities. Organizations need inclusive policies and continuous reflection to ensure fair treatment and equity in preparing the floor for all employees to raise to their potential.Thiruvalluvar’s chapter Therindhu Vinayaadal – Art of Right Choice – is as good as an HR hiring guidebook especially couplet 515:Make competence the basis of your choice — not thePreferences or partialities of the hirer.Unconscious bias whispers: favouritism follows. To hear that whisper, and question it, is the first step towards a fairer world — one where ability shines sans prejudices.","Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text.

Rs 10k crore: Cost of health cover fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-10k-crore-cost-of-health-cover-fraud/articleshow/125497230.cms,"MUMBAI: Fraud and waste continue to drag India’s health-insurance system, with Rs 8,000–10,000 crore leaking from claim payouts each year, says a Boston Consulting Group–Medi Assist report. Fraud and unnecessary claims inflate premiums, strain insurer finances and drain public funds. Weak data systems and loose checks also push patients into higher out-of-pocket spends.The analysis shows retail health portfolios carry higher fraud risk than group portfolios. Within group covers, fraud is consistently elevated in BFSI and healthcare. Reimbursement claims pose the biggest threat: group reimbursement claims show 9x more fraud than group cashless, while individual reimbursement claims show 20x the incidence of group cashless. Misrepresentation and document fabrication remain the top fraud types across IPD/OPD. Fraud risk clusters in mid-ticket claims (Rs 50,000-Rs 2.5 lakh), where incentives are high and oversight moderate.“Small-ticket fraud and abuse are often rationalised as harmless… This mindset has turned into a systemic behavioral challenge… contributing materially to the broader issue of FWA (fraud, waste and abuse) in the health insurance ecosystem,” the report said.The report urges tighter fraud prevention/detection, unified medical-coding rules, AI-driven oversight and faster data-sharing via the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and the National Health Claim Exchange.Medi Assist says tech will do the heavy lifting. “As India’s health system stands at an inflection point, the next decade will be defined by connected data and intelligent automation,” said Satish Gidugu, Medi Assist’s CEO. Reducing fraud and rebuilding digital trust, he said, will help keep care “accessible, affordable, and accountable for all citizens.”For BCG’s Swayamjit Mishra, the biggest gains lie in the “remaining 8%” of claims that sit between harmless and outright fraudulent.","Fraud and waste continue to drag India’s health-insurance system, with Rs 8,000–10,000 crore leaking from claim payouts each year, says a Boston Consulting Group–Medi Assist report.

SC: Accused has right to speedy investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-accused-has-right-to-speedy-investigation/articleshow/125497152.cms,"Right to speedy trial covers all stages: SC

NEW DELHI: ""The accused cannot be made to suffer endlessly with this threat of continuing investigation,"" the Supreme Court said, holding that the right to speedy investigation is also part of fundamental rights. The court said it will benefit the accused, the victim, and society if the investigation and trial are done quickly and completed within a reasonable time.Though it refrained from framing any timeline for completion of probe, which it said was not practical and feasible, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N Kotiswar Singh said that an accused could approach courts for quashing of a case for inordinate delay in the probe. The court noted that there had unfortunately been many cases in which there was massive delay in filing chargesheet/taking cognisance etc. It said the right to speedy trial is an important facet of Article 21 (fundamental right to life). ""Timely completion of investigation is inherent thereto,"" it said.The bench said the court has repeatedly underscored the necessity of speedy investigation and trial but for various reasons this is still not a reality.It said the right to speedy trial covers all the stages - investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and re-trial - and shouldn't be seen narrowly.""The accused cannot be made to suffer endlessly with this threat of continuing investigation and eventual trial proceedings bearing over their everyday existence,"" the bench said and added that the apex court in its various rulings hold unequivocally that investigation is covered under the right to speedy trial and that violation of this right can strike at the root of the investigation itself, leading it to be quashed.""At the same time, it must be said that timelines cannot be set in stone for an investigation to be completed nor can outer limit be prescribed within which necessarily, an investigation must be drawn to a close. This is evidenced by the fact that further investigation or rather permission therefore, can be granted even after commencement of trial,"" it said.Supreme Court said the process of investigation has many moving parts and is therefore impractical to have strict timelines in place but emphasised that investigations cannot continue endlessly.","Supreme Court said it will benefit the accused, the victim, and society if the investigation and trial are done quickly and completed within a reasonable time.

Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time

Also read |

After GST rollout, state finance portfolio lost some sheen

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has ceded the home portfolio to BJP for the first time in his two decades at the helm and his party JDU has, in lieu, got control of finance, which was kept by BJP.Though it may appear like a regular ministry swap which happens between allies, the significance of deputy CM Samrat Choudhary being given charge of home was lost on few as the department is considered politically crucial due to its control of police, intelligence and general law & order, a reason why CMs in most states keep the portfolio to themselves. This is also a big boost for Choudhary and puts him in a higher weight category vis-a-vis his party colleague and the other deputy CM, Vijay Sinha, who has got revenue & land reforms and mines & geology departments, a notification said.Sources said that the new arrangement would also see political inputs accommodated into the functioning of the crucial department, which had lately been perceived to be run by bureaucrats.JDU's Bijendra Prasad Yadav has been vested with finance and commercial tax department, held by Choudhary in the last govt. The rising Kushwaha figure of BJP is now in charge of the state's law & order, and has no other department.As Nitish distributed portfolios among his 26 ministers - 14 from BJP, eight from JDU, two from LJP(RV) and one each from HAM(S) and RLM, the two main parties seemed to be keeping most of the key departments they earlier had, save for the exchange of home and finance.The finance ministry in states has lost some of its sheen as levers of revenue generation are limited for them after GST rollout, more so in Bihar where liquor is not a source of filling coffers due to prohibition since 2016.The decision of Nitish, whose 'sushasan babu' image owed much to his handling of law and order as he ensured minimal political interference in policing, to part with the ministry hints at the growing recognition in JDU circles about the need to relieve him of a part of his responsibilities as well as BJP's growing heft in the alliance after the party's national brass led by PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah played a central role in shepherding the NDA's campaign that decimated the opposition.CMs in most states, including Yogi Adityanath in UP, M K Stalin in Tamil Nadu, Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra and N Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh, are in charge of home, or law & order, as it is referred in some places. In Congress-governed Karnataka, the home ministry has been given to G Parameshwara but CM Siddaramaiah has kept 'intelliegence' with himself.There have been, however, examples of allies getting the home department. In the previous Mahayuti govt headed by Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde, his deputy and BJP's Fadnavis was in charge of the portfolio. In the Maha Vikas Aghadi govt that preceded Shinde's, NCP's Anil Deshmukh was the home minister in the dispensation headed by Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray. Both NCP and Shiv Sena had split and the new factions, which later got the official status, became partners in subsequent Mahayuti govt.Among current state govts, deputy CM Vijay Sharma holds the home ministry in BJP-governed Chhattisgarh.Nitish has kept the portfolios of the general administration department, cabinet secretariat and vigilance with himself. Vijay Chowdhary, a close aide of Nitish, will helm building construction, water resources and parliamentary affairs. The party has not named its choices for six other departments that have come its way, with sources saying that the picks would be finalised later.BJP has continued to keep health, law, industries, road construction, urban development and housing, and agriculture in its quota First-time minister BJP's Shreyasi Singh, a former international shooter, has been given sports, and information and technology. Deepak Prakash of RLM and HAM(S)'s Santosh Suman have been given the portfolios of panchayati raj department and minor water resources department, respectively.LJP (RV) MLAs Sanjay Kumar and Sanjay Kumar Singh are in charge of sugarcane and public health engineering department, respectively.","Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has ceded the home portfolio to BJP for the first time in his two decades at the helm.

IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-pilot-dies-as-tejas-fighter-crashes-at-dubai-air-show/articleshow/125496211.cms,"Also read |

Tejas Crashes In Dubai Air Show Display As Massive Fireball Sparks Panic, Pilot Succumbs To Injuries

Since its 1st squadron was raised in 2016, Tejas has had an excellent safety record

.

In a major blow to India's much-delayed project for indigenous fighters as well as their export potential, a single-engine Tejas jet crashed during a demonstration at the Dubai Airshow on Friday afternoon. The IAF pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, died in the accident.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter was on a low-altitude aerobatic demonstration sortie when it couldn't recover from a ""negative G-turn"" and plummeted to the ground, exploding in a ball of fire in front of a large audience at the Al Maktoum International Airport at 2.10 pm, local time.Wing Commander Syal was from Kangra in Himachal Pradesh and was posted at TN's Sulur IAF station. His wife is a retired wing commander. The couple has a daughter, who is seven years old.This is the second crash of the lightweight multi-role Tejas, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics and powered by American GE-F404 turbofan engine, since it was inducted into the IAF 10 years ago.In the first crash near Jaisalmer on March 12 last year, the pilot had managed to eject safely. The jet was returning from the Bharat Shakti military exercise at Pokhran.Wing Commander Syal, an experienced fighter pilot, was not so lucky. He could not eject in time before the jet slammed into the ground.The pilot sustained fatal injuries,"" an officer said. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry (CoI) to ascertain the exact reason behind the crash after coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the ""black box"" of the ill-fated fighter. ""It's very difficult to say what led to the crash at this moment. It could be a sudden loss of power or control malfunction at a critical juncture,"" said a veteran fighter pilot, who did not want to be named.""Pilots can also suffer spatial disorientation during negative G-turns when they push the controls forward to make their planes dive, though they are trained to manage and mitigate negative G forces,"" he added.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said he was ""deeply anguished at the loss of a brave and courageous IAF pilot"", adding the nation stands firmly with the bereaved family in this tragic hour. Military aviation is inherently dangerous, with fighters being pushed to their limits through extensive combat manoeuvres and low-level flying and diving missions.The 13.5-tonne Tejas so far has had an excellent safety track-record since its first squadron '45 Flying Daggers' was raised with only two jets at Sulur in July 2016 despite its torturous development saga and excruciating delays. Over the last few years, India has been deploying the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1 jets for airshows in Dubai, Singapore and other places to showcase its ""superior handling characteristics and manoeuvrability"" through low-level aerobatics to an international audience in a bid to win export orders.IAF, however, has inducted only 38 Tejas Mark-1 fighters, with the second squadron '18 Flying Bullets' deployed at Naliya, of the 40 ordered for Rs 8,802 crore in the 2006-10 timeframe. ""Three Tejas jets were sent for the Dubai air show for the No 45 and 18 squadrons,"" another officer said. IAF has also ordered 180 'improved' Tejas Mark-1A jets for over Rs 1.1 lakh crore, with the latest Rs 66,500 crore deal for 97 jets being inked in Sept this year. The force, however, is yet to begin getting Tejas Mark- 1A deliveries due to huge delays in supply of engines from the US as well as pending weapons trials.The trials involve Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs and their integration with Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system.","IAF pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, died in the accident.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 jolts Pakistan; more tremors recorded this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/earthquake-of-magnitude-5-2-jolts-pakistan-more-tremors-recorded-this-week/articleshow/125477827.cms,"Representative image





An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres.

5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast

KOLKATA: An earthquake of magnitude 5.7 struck near Dhaka capital of Bangladesh on Friday. The tremors were reported in Kolkata and several parts of Northeast India, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).The quake struck 13 km south-southwest of Narsingdi in the Bangladesh at 10.08am, and at a depth of 10 km, it said. Several people in Kolkata and other districts were seen coming out on the streets as a precautionary measure.Residents in Kolkata reported brief tremors around 10:10 am, describing them as lasting only a few seconds. Within minutes, videos of the moment began circulating widely on social media.Similar mild tremors were also felt in Guwahati, Agartala and Shillong, according to early reports.There was no immediate report of any injury or damage.In October, Bangladesh experienced a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Shallow quakes like this produce stronger shaking as seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface. Globally, earthquakes occur roughly every 30 seconds, though most are too minor to be noticed.Bangladesh sits at the junction of three tectonic plates—the Indian, Eurasian, and Burma plates.The Indian plate moves northeast at about 6 cm per year, while the Eurasian plate shifts north at roughly 2 cm annually.The country is crisscrossed by several major fault lines, including the Bogura, Tripura, Dauki, and Assam faults, as well as the Shillong Plateau, placing it within 13 earthquake-prone zones.High-risk areas include Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts, and Jaintiapur in Sylhet.Dhaka, with a population density exceeding 30,000 people per square kilometre, is among the world’s densest cities and ranks as one of the 20 most earthquake-vulnerable cities globally, according to The Daily Star.","5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast India.

Order against ‘bulldozer justice’ was my most important: CJI Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/order-against-bulldozer-justice-was-my-most-important-cji-gavai/articleshow/125495363.cms,"'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

Equality does not mean equal treatment: Gavai

NEW DELHI: Judges traditionally avoid commenting publicly on their own judgments, but on Friday CJI B R Gavai departed from that norm to pick his verdict against “bulldozer justice” as his most important one, followed by the ruling allowing states to sub-classify SCs and STs for job reservations.At the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) farewell function, CJI Gavai said he could do so as he has completed his judgments and doesn’t have any judicial work as he is retiring on Sunday. He said if he was asked to pick the most important judgment authored by him, it would undoubtedly be the one against bulldozer justice.“Bulldozer justice is against the grain of rule of law. How can a house be demolished just because a person is accused of a crime or convicted for it? What is the fault of his family and parents? Right to shelter is a fundamental right,"" he said.The Chief Justice of India B R Gavai had mentioned bulldozer justice judgment even in his speeches in foreign countries to highlight how the judiciary protects rule of law in India.He said the judgment allowing sub-classification of SCs and STs for availing reservation in jobs was needed as it would be difficult to imagine how a chief secretary’s children could be equated in status with the children of an agricultural labourer who have no access to education or resources.Quoting Ambedkar , he said equality does not mean equal treatment to all as “it would lead to further inequality.” CJI Gavai said he had a law clerk, who is the son of a top bureaucrat in Maharashtra belonging to a SC community.After I delivered the judgment, the law clerk said he would not avail benefit of reservation as he had the best of facilities despite belonging to SC community, the Chief Justice of India said on Friday.The CJI said he veered away from the traditional notion of the Supreme Court being a CJI-centric court and always consulted all his colleagues before taking decisions relating to the institution.He said during his short tenure, 107 judges were appointed to the HCs and thanked his collegium colleagues for the congenial atmosphere in the meetings. Not all meetings were congenial though, as Justice B V Nagarathna had shot off a long letter protesting the collegium’s choice to recommend Justice Vipul M Pancholi as a judge of the SC.In the morning, the courtroom farewell unprecedentedly extended beyond one and half hours as senior advocates and lawyers kept highligting the humble, compassionate and to-the-point demeanour and approach of the CJI.Chief Justice of India B R Gavai said he has been heading the green bench in Supreme Court for the last three years and his first judgment as CJI was protecting a forest land in Pune and the last judgment was to protect Aravali Hills and range.CJI B R Gavai said his 40-year-long career in the legal field, 18 years as an advocate and 22 years as a judge of constitutional court, was driven by Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's philosophy of justice, equality and liberty.",Chief Justice of India B R Gavai said he veered away from the traditional notion of the Supreme Court being a CJI-centric court.

An open letter from Gen Z: Are we really the problem or just the mirror no one wants to look into?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-open-letter-from-a-gen-z-are-we-really-the-problem-or-just-the-mirror-no-one-wants-to-look-into/articleshow/125484214.cms,".

We didn’t create the world we’re growing up in







A moment of honesty from the other side

The office gap



Too sensitive? No. Emotional intelligence



Gen Z protests: Dancing, reels, but still historic



All we really want is to be heard



A final thought



To the generations that raised us, taught us, and now often critique us—consider this an open letter. Not a fight, not a manifesto, but a Gen Z’er trying to bridge a widening gap. Because for a group often labeled “chronically online,” “entitled,” or “too sensitive,” it’s ironic how rarely we’re truly heard.We’re told we don’t understand “how the world works.” But we’re living in it too—just on a timeline shaped by decisions made long before we arrived. So here’s a little context from our side.One of the biggest misconceptions about us—call it confusion or plain bias—is that older generations still mistake what they see as a “trend,” an “aesthetic,” or a set of quirks for the entirety of who we are. To many, Gen Z becomes oversized hoodies, matcha cravings, curly hair, performative identities, and Instagram slang. But we are a generation, as real as Millennials, Gen X, or Baby Boomers—the difference is how quickly we’re reduced to stereotype.What’s interesting is how many Gen Zers feel pressured to distance themselves from the label. As Yash Sonkar, a fellow Gen Z, puts it:“We’re into old Bollywood,”“We don’t use that killer grammar,”or “We’re not that online,”as if listening to Kishore Kumar somehow erases the year you were born.The truth is, we’ll hype Travis Scott and Hanumankind and just as easily switch to old classics. That duality is exactly what defines us. But it also raises a bigger question: while we’re open enough to understand and accept others’ choices and identities, is the other side equally willing to understand ours—without prejudice or preconceived notions?Your childhoods may have been slower and clearer. Ours began with constant comparisons, nonstop information, and pressure from day one.The world felt simpler then because it was smaller. Ours is loud, global, fast, and demanding—rarely pausing long enough for us to breathe. Natasha Singh , a millennial colleague, puts it this way, “Gen Z has an over-dependency on ChatGPT. Their constant need to label everything—including themselves—is frustrating for a generation that worked hard to break these labels.”But for us, labels aren’t cages—they’re clarity. They help us articulate identities in a world that often tries to overwrite them. And our use of tools like ChatGPT isn’t dependency; it’s adaptation.Another stereotype is that Gen Z is glued to screens, incapable of real connection. But ours was the first childhood lived online. Social media wasn’t a distraction—it was infrastructure. Community-building simply took a new shape.And here’s the part often ignored: older generations are on their phones just as much. The difference is that we grew up with these tools; you adopted them later. If smartphones existed when you were teens, you’d have been immersed too.Despite assumptions, many Gen Zers crave real-world connection deeply. We’re the ones reviving community gardens, co-working spaces, bookstores, and mutual aid networks. We’re not avoiding connection—we’re redefining it.A senior journalist from Generation X shared something with me that genuinely stayed with me. He said: “My daughter was born in 2004, so what makes me envious of Gen Z is the confidence with which they carry themselves. I see in my daughter many things I wanted to do—dreamed of—but never dared to when I was her age.”He sees in Gen Z a kind of fearlessness—an evolved, headstrong energy that earlier generations often had to suppress in the name of “discipline” or “fitting in.”He then added, almost reluctantly, “What worries me is when they act without thinking of the consequences. It’s good many times, but it can be dangerous on some occasions.”For him, these traits are undeniable strengths—but like all strengths, they can become risky when they aren’t guided by direction or awareness.If there’s one place where the generational rift is loudest, it’s the workplace.Many of us are seen as impatient, but the world we enter is nothing like the one you did. Entry-level salaries don’t match living costs, and traditional hierarchies often feel outdated. When we ask questions, we’re not being disrespectful—we’re trying to understand systems that no longer make sense.What’s ironic is hearing “I hate Gen Z” from people who spend all day copying Gen Z slang and trends—sometimes even Gen Z themselves.At the same time, not everyone sees us through a negative lens. Aashish Saxena, also a millennial, offers a refreshing perspective “Gen Z’s focus on work-life balance and mental health is wrongly , seen as laziness. I’ve found them to be highly efficient—they work smarter, and with the right motivation, are extremely enthusiastic. Their work ethic is simply different from the traditional hustle mindset.”Yet more worrying is how often HR professionals now say they “don’t want to hire Gen Z.” Not because of competence, but because of stereotypes. It sends a damaging message: an entire generation dismissed before they even step in.Some older workers see exhaustion as dedication. We see it as a red flag. We’ve watched generations burn out chasing stability that never came. So yes—we talk about mental health and set boundaries. It’s not rebellion; it’s survival.A recent video of Ananya Pandey went viral when a host claimed Gen Z is “traumatised by everything.” She responded instantly, “No, they’re not. They’re the first generation that’s actually talking about their feelings.”We’re often told we “can’t take criticism,” that we’re fragile or overly emotional. But what some call sensitivity is simply our refusal to swallow pain silently. Many of you grew up in homes where emotional expression was discouraged. We’ve seen how that legacy plays out—intergenerational trauma, unresolved anger, families that love deeply but communicate poorly.Across the world—including in Nepal—Gen Z has led protests demanding change on issues from corruption to climate. Some dismissed these movements as “unserious” because participants danced or made reels, but the impact was undeniable. These protests challenged laws, pushed policies, and sparked conversations that would have otherwise stayed stagnant.We know you’ve lived through things we can’t fully imagine—economic instability, political restrictions, fewer choices. We respect the resilience that shaped you. We admire the strength it took to build the foundation we stand on.But our battles aren’t smaller. They’re just different.We don’t want blind agreement—we want empathetic listening. We want guidance that respects individuality. We want space to evolve without feeling like we’re disappointing you. And we want understanding to flow both ways—not just from age to youth, but from experience to perspective.Older generations often say, “You’ll understand when you’re older.” Maybe we will. But understanding can’t be a one-way street. If age brings wisdom, youth brings perspective—and society needs both.So here we are, extending a hand. Because the truth is, we admire you more than you think. We’re shaped by your stories, your lessons, your resilience. But we also need you to acknowledge ours.","Gen Z is a generation often labeled “chronically online,” “entitled,’ or “too sensitive.” To many, Gen Z becomes oversized hoodies, matcha cravings, curly hair, performative identities, and Instagram slang.

‘We Made No Crime’ Prashant Kishor Admits Failure, Takes Full Responsibility for Bihar Verdict

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor on Friday announced that he will donate 90 per cent of his income over the next five years to fund his party’s campaign. The declaration comes just days after the newly launched party suffered a major setback in its debut Bihar assembly elections , failing to win a single seat despite an energetic start to its campaign.Jan Suraaj drew a blank in the polls, unable to open its account amid a sweeping victory for the NDA.Addressing reporters after a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Ashram in West Champaran, Kishor also accused the newly formed Nitish Kumar cabinet of being packed with tainted leaders. “The new cabinet of Nitish Kumar, which took oath on Thursday, is full of corrupts and criminals. I must say that this council of ministers is a slap in the face of the people of Bihar. It's like rubbing salt on the wound as several corrupt leaders were inducted,” he alleged.Kishor further claimed the appointments show that “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and CM Kumar are least concerned about Bihar.” He also accused the ruling alliance of buying votes through cash transfers. “They have purchased votes by transferring Rs 10,000 into the bank account of more than 1 crore women.Now, they have no concern for the state or the people,” he said, adding, “If I am saying anything wrong, the state government can put me behind bars. ”According to him, funds meant for the state’s contingency reserve and a World Bank grant were diverted for the cash transfer scheme. Kishor vowed that his party would ensure women receive the Rs 2 lakh promised by the NDA. “Now, we will ensure that women get Rs 2 lakh as promised by the NDA ahead of the polls,” he said.Kishor also announced the launch of the ‘Bihar Navnirman Sankalp Yatra’ beginning January 15, during which Jan Suraaj workers will visit every household across the state. “We will visit all houses in the state over 15-18 months and create awareness among the people about the misdeeds of this government. The organisation of the Jan Suraaj Party will be strengthened before the campaign starts,” he said.Reiterating his personal commitment, Kishor said, “Besides, whatever assets I have acquired in the last 20 years, except my Delhi house, I will donate those for the party.” He appealed to supporters to contribute as well, saying, “Now, I request the people of Bihar to donate just Rs 1,000 to the party on a yearly basis. I will not meet anyone who doesn't donate this amount to the party.”Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Kishor said he remains determined. “We will change the government. They tried to break our morale in this election. We will fight and win,” he said.","Jan Suraaj drew a blank in the polls, unable to open its account amid a sweeping victory for the NDA.

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan will offer a five-year tax exemption for new domestic industries and a 1% import duty on raw materials and machinery, Afghan commerce minister Nooruddin Azizi said on Friday, while vowing to deepen economic ties with India.He identified cement, rice, textiles, pharmaceuticals, mining, and energy as priority sectors for a country that has been in the griup of strife for years.""To support domestic industry, we are giving a preferential 1% tariff on raw materials and machinery and a five-year tax exemption for new industries that are set up in Afghanistan,"" Azizi said at a PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) event in Delhi and stated that Afghanistan created a ""flexible and enabling"" business environment and wanted Indian companies to invest in large numbers across sectors.On production incentives, he said ""We have economic oriented policies...So if the production increases by 20% we increase govt support, which would keep on increasing as production increases.""At the event as well, joint secretary in the ministry of external affaris M Prakash Anand said that both sides agreed to post trade attaches in their embassies to boost trade and revive the joint working groups on trade, commerce, and investment.He also mentioned that air corridors on the Kabul to Delhi and Kabul to Amritsar routes were activated and cargo flights on these sectors would start soon.Azizi also spoke on several logistical hurdles Afghanistan faces, including the border closures with Pakistan, blocked transit routes via Chabahar, and frozen foreign reserves worth $9.3 billion which were blocked by the US after Taliban took over Afghanistan.

"Minimum wage to social security, labour reforms set for rollout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minimum-wage-to-social-security-labour-reforms-set-for-rollout/articleshow/125495028.cms,"Codes cap share of allowances in overall package

NEW DELHI: In one of the biggest reform initiatives, the Centre on Friday announced the implementation of the four labour codes, enacted five years ago, to replace 29 laws. The rollout, which will require notification of rules, comes within a week of a resounding electoral mandate in Bihar for the governing NDA after similar successes in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Delhi.The biggest workforce regulation recast in decades is aimed at increasing the employability of women and ensuring safety, ensuring that gig workers are eligible for social security benefits, salaries are paid on time, and minimum wage is guaranteed.At the same time, the laws provide more flexibility and certainty to businesses at a time when the economy is dealing with global headwinds. Investors have often cited India's archaic labour laws as one of the stumbling blocks while deciding on setting up factories in India and have flocked to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh amid diversification of production bases.PM Modi called it the ""most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence"".Officials said the rules for these four codes - on wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety and health - will be notified within 45 days for enforcement of the provisions.While the Centre had enacted the laws as part of the response to the Covid crisis, reluctance in opposition-led states had prompted it to go slow.But with more than two dozen states showing willingness to move ahead with amendments in laws, the Modi govt decided to press ahead after extensive consultations.All states, except West Bengal, have published draft rules on the provisions of the four codes, officials said.In any case, states that fail to notify the rules will have to follow those finalised by the Centre since labour is a subject under the concurrent list.The codes cap share of allowances in overall compensation paid to salaried employee to ensure companies don't structure pays in a way that it results in lower social-security contribution by employers. For workers, there's a national floor wage, and states can notify higher payment.ILO director-general Gilbert F Houngbo said, ""Following with interest developments of India's new labour codes announced today...""Under the new regime, fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after one year and social security coverage is expanded to all. All workers will get PF, ESIC, insurance, and other social security benefits. In addition, several sectors will now have mandatory annual health check-ups for their employees who are more than 40 years old.","The rollout comes within a week of a resounding electoral mandate in Bihar for the governing NDA.

"Battle lines drawn for fresh standoff, government leans on unorganised workers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/battle-lines-drawn-for-fresh-standoff-government-leans-on-unorganised-workers/articleshow/125494633.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre's decision to implement the four labour codes is the second ""big bang"" reform measure since the unsuccessful bid to overhaul agricultural markets, and signifies the confidence that it has drawn from the Bihar landslide as well as the recognition to prepare industry and business for global uncertainty.The announcement drew protests from trade unions, most of them aligned to opposition parties and appears to have set the stage for another confrontation.RSS-affiliate Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, the largest of the trade unions, has not joined the chorus. But that is not the only reason for govt to feel confident that the long-promised labour reforms did not meet the fate that befell the farm sector laws.The farm reforms had to be aborted because govt failed to convince farmers that the proposed schemes were meant to help them. Going by the drift of the deliberations in govt over the past several months, the Centre seems to be confident that it will be able to persuade the intended beneficiaries; essentially a sprawling mass of workers who are not part of the organised sector.The proposal to extend social protection to a large and rapidly growing mass of contractual and unorganised workers will be welcomed by millions like those engaged by online platforms.The established trade unions have failed to acquire a following among them.The codes mandate timely wage-payment guarantees by seventh of every month, and allow women to work night shifts across sectors with consent and safety arrangements.This seems to be a combination of multiple factors - their obsession and the resultant dependence on organised labour, difficulty in bringing together those who are not working under one roof and the perception of unionisation as an anti-business pursuit whose worst victims have been workers themselves. But the net result is the presence of a large mass who have not been cared for and who should welcome any effort to improve the deal for them.Denial of minimum wages in large parts of the country and absence of safety norms also give govt an opening to win the support of these sections for its larger agenda, which includes preparing the country to the challenges of an uncertain global milieu.The uncertainty wrought by the Covid pandemic has been compounded by US President Donald Trump's aggressive mercantilism. The risks can be offset by opportunities, but the country does not seem fully prepared to grasp them. For all the talk of China-plus-one and the need to diversify the global supply chain, India has not benefited significantly from the concern about dependence on a ruthless China.The codes seem to make an effort to remedy the situation by introducing flexibility in a labour market which discourages entry of new players and capacity expansion while deterring foreign investors. While the codes address the need to shake up things a bit, govt will have to contend with an opposition, licking its wounds after successive electoral defeats, using them to amplify their ""pro-rich"" charge.","The Centre's decision to implement the four labour codes is the second ""big bang"" reform measure since the unsuccessful bid to overhaul agricultural markets.

God forbid that anyone gets caught up in a narrative; if someone gets trapped in this labyrinth, it becomes very difficult to get out

NEW DELHI: Former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday delivered his first public speech since stepping down from office. Addressing a gathering in Bhopal, he highlighted the importance of fulfilling one’s duties and responsibilities, even in the face of personal constraints citing his recent past as proof.Speaking at the launch of Hum Aur Yeh Vishwa, a book by RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya, Dhankhar remarked, “In today's time, people are drifting away from morality and spirituality. 'Main flight pakadne ki chinta se apne kartavya ko nahin chhod sakta'. My recent past is proof of it…”Dhankhar also warned against getting caught in a narrative, saying that once you’re stuck, it becomes very difficult to get out, adding that ""I am not giving my example.""“‘Bhagwan kare ki koi narrative ke chakkar mein na fas jaye, iss chakravyuh mein koi fass gaya toh nikalna bada mushkil hain ()’. I am not giving my example,” he said.Both his remarks were met with laughter by the audience.Dhankhar resigned abruptly on July 21, citing health reasons, and had remained out of public view except for a quiet appearance at the swearing-in of his successor CP Radhakrishnan on September 12.His absence from public life had fuelled questions from the Opposition, which repeatedly argued he deserved a formal farewell like his predecessors. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that Dhankhar was “forced out” because, after years of “harassing” the Opposition, he “suddenly decided to move by the book”. He claimed the government was angered when Dhankhar admitted notices to remove Justice Shekhar Yadav and Justice Yashwant Varma, saying the prime minister gave him a choice to “withdraw his order or face action”. Kharge argued that Dhankhar chose to resign, recalling how he had suspended a record number of MPs and remarking, “this is their democracy”. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and Independent MP Kapil Sibal demanded clarity on Dhankhar’s whereabouts, with Sibal saying he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa vice president’”.Friday’s event was also notable for the absence of government representatives. No one from the Mohan Yadav administration or the state BJP arrived at the airport to receive him, prompting sharp criticism from former chief minister Digvijaya Singh.He accused the ruling party of disregarding protocol, saying the BJP values only those who are “useful” to it and describing its approach as “use and throw”. He added that he would not extend that criticism to the RSS, given Dhankhar had come at the Sangh’s invitation.Organisers said the former vice-president had been scheduled as the keynote speaker for some time, marking his first major engagement since leaving office. Dhankhar, who took charge in August 2022 and was due to serve until 2027, had an eventful tenure that included frequent clashes with the Opposition and an unprecedented impeachment motion that was later dismissed.","Former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar delivers his first public speech since stepping down from office.

Government says codes modernise labour framework

Key provisions under the codes

Universal minimum wages and mandatory timely wage payments

and mandatory timely wage payments Extension of social security to gig and platform workers

Women allowed to work in all sectors including night shifts, with mandatory safety measures

Free annual health check-ups for workers above 40 years

Single registration, single licence and single return to ease compliance

Fixed-term employees eligible for gratuity after one year

Expanded ESIC coverage, including units with even one hazardous-process worker

Gender-neutral pay and mandated appointment letters for all employees

Trade unions call move ‘undemocratic’, cite ignored consultations

Unions submit charter in pre-budget consultations

NEW DELHI: A joint platform of ten central trade unions on Friday criticised the government’s notification of the four labour codes, calling the move “a deceptive fraud committed against the working people of the nation” and announcing a nationwide day of protest on November 26.The unions allege that the implementation, effective from November 21, is unilateral and “anti-worker, pro-employer” and undermines the welfare-state framework. The statement was issued jointly by INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC.The notification operationalises the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Social Security Code (2020) and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (2020), replacing 29 central labour laws.PM Narendra Modi hailed the implementation, calling it “one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence” and said the move strengthens workers’ rights and simplifies compliance.“These Codes will serve as a strong foundation for universal social security, minimum and timely payment of wages, safe workplaces and remunerative opportunities for our people, especially Nari Shakti and Yuva Shakti,” PM Modi said on X.""It will build a future-ready ecosystem that protects the rights of workers and strengthens India’s economic growth. These reforms will boost job creation, drive productivity and accelerate our journey towards a Viksit Bharat."" PM Modi added.The government said that the overhaul is intended to expand formalisation, reduce compliance burden and enhance worker protections across sectors, including gig and platform labour, MSMEs, women workers and contract employees.According to the government’s announcement, major changes include:The trade unions called the rollout arbitrary, alleging the decision caters to “employers’ representatives and fringe supporters of the Govt”. They claimed multiple protests and strikes since 2019—including the January 2020 general strike, the November 26 protest with Samyukt Kisan Morcha, and a July 9, 2025 strike claimed to involve “more than 25 crores workers”—were ignored.They said appeals to convene the Indian Labour Conference and repeal the codes, including during pre-budget meetings on November 13 and November 20, received no response.“This Union government has made effective the labour codes to cater to the demands of employers’ representatives… The most undemocratic, most regressive—anti-worker and pro-employer move,” the statement said.“Implementing the codes amid deepening unemployment crisis and rising inflation is nothing short of declaration of war on the working masses,” the platform said, alleging the government acted “in cahoots with capitalist cronies” to return to an “exploitative era of master-servant relationship”.""The working people of India will put up a formidable fight till the labour codes are withdrawn."" the labour unions added.Earlier, the Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions presented its 20-Point Workers Charter at the 2026-27 pre-budget consultation on November 20.The charter sought measures to boost domestic demand amid tariff concerns, stronger auditing of government schemes, and steps to reverse declining audit reports placed before Parliament. The unions demanded wider EPF/ESI coverage, higher statutory thresholds, increased minimum pension and scheme-worker honorariums, and sectoral cesses to fund welfare.They also sought reversal of decriminalisation under the Jan Vishwas Act and demanded job-creation measures in place of public funding through PLI, Capex Incentive and ELI schemes, citing declining employment growth, stagnant real wages and weak manufacturing performance.","Trade unions call move ‘undemocratic’, cite ignored consultations.

Today, our govt has given effect to the Four Labo-ur Codes. It is one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence. It greatly empowers our workers. It also significantly simplifies compliance and promotes 'Ease of Doing Business'.""He said the changes would provide ""universal social security, minimum and timely payment of wages, safe workplaces and remunerative opportunities... especially Nari Shakti and Yuva Shakti"" and help ""accelerate our journey towards a Viksit Bharat"".Opposition parties and trade unions issued strong criticism. CPI(ML) Liberation in a statement said the four codes ""though presented in the name of 'labour reform,' are essentially tools that codify modern slavery and exploitation for the benefit and profiteering of big businesses and corporate interests.""Demanding their immediate withdrawal, the Left party said the codes ""drastically dilute industrial safety compliance, wage and welfare requirements"" and raise thresholds in ways that reduce protections for a large section of workers.It called for public support for the Day of Resistance and Defiance on Nov 26, announced by central trade unions and Samyukt Kisan Morcha.A joint platform of 10 central trade unions, including INTUC, AITUC, HMS and CITU and SEWA, called the codes ""deceptive fraud"" on the working people and gave a call for a nationwide ""combative resistance and defiance"" on Nov 26. RSS-affiliate Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, however, termed the reforms ""historical and revolutionary"".Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the codes ensure ""the guarantee of minimum wages on time... guarantee of social security for 40 crore workers... guarantee of gratuity for fixed-term employees after one year... and 100% health security for workers in hazardous sectors.""External affairs minister S Jaishankar said on social media that ""implementation of the four Labour Codes will empower India's workers by providing them with better wages, social security, safe working conditions and equal opportunities...

Eleven founders were shortlisted for the final pitch in London, where Cognitii was named one of six winners.Founded by Jhillika Trisal from Gurugram, Falguni Shrivastava from Raipur, and Souvik Ghosh from Kolkata, Cognitii is building what it calls India’s first AI plus human infrastructure layer for special education.The founders, who have lived experience of autism and ADHD, began the company to address gaps they had seen in India’s systems. The team points to a critical national challenge: more than 80% of children with disabilities remain unidentified before age eight, limiting access to education, rehabilitation, and employment.Cognitii’s platform combines early screening tools, a mobile-first learning system, an educator co-pilot, and policy-grade dashboards for state agencies. The tools integrate with public data systems such as UDISE+ and Samagra Shiksha, allowing govts to track disability prevalence, inclusion outcomes, and the use of budgets.The company says it is designed for low-resource classrooms, with offline capability and multilingual support.The startup’s pilots are ongoing in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and other school systems. With the award, Cognitii plans wider govt deployments, deeper rural outreach, and the creation of what it calls India’s first disability data layer. The team says this will help shape policy and guide hiring and budget decisions in the coming years.“This win is a turning point, not just for Cognitii, but for millions of children who remain invisible in our systems. The Unlock Her Future Prize gives us the platform and resources to scale our work with governments and low-income schools, and to build the national infrastructure India needs for early screening, support, and inclusion,” the founders said in a joint statement, shared with TOI.The Unlock Her Future Prize supports women entrepreneurs working on solutions for people and the planet. Winners receive funding, leadership development, mentorship, and access to networks of investors and policymakers. Cognitii aims to use this support to strengthen India’s special education ecosystem and expand its work across the Global South.","Cognitii, an Indian startup developing an AI-led system for public special education, has won the $100,000 Unlock Her Future Prize 2025.

‘Speak Freely’: Ladakh probe panel warns against threats to witnesses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/speak-freely-ladakh-probe-panel-warns-against-threats-to-witnesses/articleshow/125492994.cms,"Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: A judicial commission set up by the Union home ministry (MHA) to probe the Sept 24 violence in Leh warned Friday that anyone threatening eyewitnesses against deposing would be strictly dealt with.The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, had revealed last month that it was not getting good response and information on the violence that saw security forces in Leh allegedly open fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the Union territory. Four people died and over 90 were injured.“There are several instances where people are being threatened and told not to depose. If anyone has been threatened, they should write to the commission. If someone is afraid to come forward, we will keep their identity confidential,” Rigzin Spalgon, joint secretary of the commission, said on Friday. He urged eyewitnesses to come forward and “speak freely” before the commission.Spalgon’s statements followed a notice on Thursday in which the commission warned of legal action against anyone “interfering, deterring, obstructing or hindering” witnesses.Evidence can be submitted till Nov 28, after which the commission will start hearings.The MHA had announced the commission after demands from Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), Ladakh’s two major political organisations. Both had made the panel’s formation a precondition for resuming dialogue with the Centre. Climate activist and LAB member Sonam Wangchuk was among the over 70 people arrested over the violence, which was followed by a clampdown that included curfew-like restrictions and internet blocks.Other than Chauhan, the commission has retired district judge Mohan Singh Parihar as judicial secretary and IAS Tushar Anand as administrative secretary. The ministry later expanded the panel by including Spalgon, a Ladakhi, on demands from LAB.After the probe commission was announced, the Centre resumed talks with LAB and KDA on Oct 22 in New Delhi. The talks, earlier held with a committee headed by junior Union home minister Nityanand Rai, had been called off by the Ladakh groups following the violence.","The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, had revealed last month that it was not getting good response and information on the violence that saw security forces in Leh allegedly open fire on protesters.

Govt unveils tougher car safety test norms under BNCAP 2.0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-unveils-tougher-car-safety-test-norms-under-bncap-2-0/articleshow/125491420.cms,"NEW DELHI: For car manufacturers, obtaining a five-star safety rating will become tougher under the next phase of Bharat NCAP, which will be rolled out from October 2027. Under BNCAP 2.0, cars will need to undergo five crash tests, compared with the current three. The new regime will add full frontal and rear crash tests to the existing offset (frontal), side, and side-pole impact tests.Cars will be evaluated on five broad parameters — safe driving, accident avoidance, crash protection, vulnerable road-user protection, and post-crash safety of occupants. This means vehicles equipped with advanced safety features such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and electronic stability control (ESC), which help reduce the chances of a crash, will receive higher ratings. The assessment will also factor in features such as drowsiness detection, lane-departure warning, and forward-collision alerts.The road transport ministry published the draft protocol for star ratings — Automotive Industry Standard (AIS) Code 197 — on Thursday and has invited feedback from stakeholders. “This will bring a paradigm shift in car-safety ratings and will be superior to many global standards. The main focus of NCAPs worldwide is to ensure that cars do not become death traps for occupants,” said a private-sector expert involved in preparing the new protocol.The first phase of BNCAP is valid until September 2027.The new assessment protocol will also evaluate female occupant safety, going beyond regulatory requirements, and the safety of belted minor occupants, specifically assessing 6- and 10-year-old children. It proposes the use of advanced crash-test dummies during side-impact and pole-impact tests for better analysis of occupant protection.The proposed standard also includes post-crash safety requirements for both conventional and electric vehicles, which are crucial for safe evacuation of occupants. These include mandatory assessments of energy management for fire and electrical hazards and occupant extrication. Optional assessments will include multi-collision braking (MCB), SOS or e-call systems, and hazard-warning light functions.The test protocol will also assess features aimed at minimising the impact on pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in the event of a crash.","Under BNCAP 2.0, cars will need to undergo five crash tests, compared with the current three.

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed that he was ready to engage in discussions with US President-elect Donald Trump on the issue of Ukraine, signalling a potential shift in relations between Moscow and Washington.Speaking at his annual year-end news conference, Putin said he was ready to meet Trump ""at any time"" to explore a compromise on the contentious issue.""I don't know when I'm going to see him. He isn't saying anything about it. I haven't talked to him in more than four years. I am ready for it, of course. Any time,"" Putin said, as reported by Al Jazeera.The Russian leader also touted the 'invincibility' of Russia’s ""Oreshnik"" hypersonic missile, which he claimed to have test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory. Putin proposed a provocative challenge to Western defence systems, offering to conduct another missile launch targeting Ukraine to test the effectiveness of Western air and missile defense systems.""Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defense and missile defense forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens,"" Putin said. ""We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?""Earlier, Putin congratulated Trump on his victory in the US presidential elections, expressing optimism about Moscow's future prospects with Washington.""I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his victory in the US presidential election. I have already said that we will work with any head of state who is trusted by the American people,"" he said.In a personal note, Putin also praised Trump’s response during an alleged assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 14.

'Conspiring to murder me': BJP leader CT Ravi claims after arrest over 'derogatory' remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conspiring-to-murder-me-bjp-leader-ct-ravi-claims-after-arrest-over-derogatory-remarks/articleshow/116486418.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Karnataka minister and BJP MLC CT Ravi, who was arrested Thursday on charges of making 'derogatory' remarks against minister Laxmi Hebbalkar, alleged a conspiracy to murder him through a false complaint. The BJP leader also alleged negligence by the police, who he said had not yet registered a complaint or a zero FIR yet.""Police brought me to Khanapura police station around 8 pm. They didn't tell me in which case they brought me. They're not registering my complaint, they're not even filing zero FIR,"" CT Ravi said in a video released by news agency ANI.The BJP leader further claimed that there was a conspiracy hatched to murder him and said the ruling Congress government in Karnataka will be responsible. ""If something happens to me, Congress government must take responsibility. By registering a false case, they're conspiring to murder me,"" he said.The incident followed the arrest of former minister Ravi on Thursday from the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha premises. He was charged with making derogatory remarks against Karnataka’s women and child development minister, Laxmi Hebbalkar. Initially detained at the premises, Ravi was transported in a police van to a nearby station and later moved to Khanapur station, located 25 kilometers away.""It's been 3 hours since I was brought to the police station, and I haven't been told why I have been brought to the police station. If something happens to me police, DK Shivakumar, Lakshmi Hebbalkar and their team will be responsible,"" he added.Accusing the Congress government of resorting to 'Emergency -like' tactics, the BJP leader said ""they're treating me like a criminal and it's creating doubt in me.

On Thursday, Ravi denied the allegations, dismissing them as ""false.""The controversy erupted on Thursday after a heated argument between ruling and opposition parties in Karnataka over alleged remarks by Union home minister Amit Shah, perceived as insulting to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Amid the tensions, Ravi was accused of making a sexually abusive remark directed at Congress member Hebbalkar.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka Assembly and BJP senior leader R Ashoka has accused the Belagavi City Police Commissioner of torturing BJP MLC CT Ravi. “The police station has turned into a Congress party office. As elected representatives, we have been waiting here for over 4-5 hours, but the Police Commissioner refuses to acknowledge our concerns. Ravi was tortured and suffered head injuries while in custody. Karnataka is witnessing a 'goondaraj' under this government.BJP's Karnataka handle said, There is suspicion that the state government had hatched a plan to illegally take the arrested MLAs from one police station to another and have them face-off on the way. It is condemnable that the state Congress government has tried to murder the Legislative Council member and former minister Ravi"".","Former Karnataka minister and BJP MLC CT Ravi was arrested Thursday on charges of making 'derogatory' remarks against minister Laxmi Hebbalkar.

PUNE: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat lashed out Thursday against what he said was an ""unacceptable"" trend of wannabe Hindu leaders raking up ""Ram temple-like"" disputes at various sites.""India should set an example of how different faiths and ideologies can live together in harmony,"" Bhagwat said against the backdrop of new controversies surrounding the origins of places of worship, including Shahi Jama Masjid in UP's Sambhal and Ajmer Sharif in Rajasthan. The RSS chief was speaking in Pune as part of a lecture series on the theme ""Vishwaguru Bharat"".RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who was speaking in Pune as part of a lecture series on the theme “Vishwaguru Bharat”, said Indians should learn from past mistakes and strive to make their country a role model for the world, showing how inclusivity could be practised by avoiding contentious issues. “The Ram temple was a matter of faith, and Hindus felt that it should be built... Raising issues about some new sites out of hate and enmity is unacceptable.”He said the solution to reducing friction in society was to hark back to ancient culture. “Extremism, aggressiveness, forcefulness, and insulting others’ gods is not our culture,” he declared. “There is no majority or minority here; we all are one. Everyone should be able to practise their way of worshipping in this country,” Bhagwat said.","Mohan Bhagwat: India should set an example of how different faiths and ideologies can live together in harmony.

"Is teacher recruitment 'scam' all pervasive, SC asks Bengal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-teacher-recruitment-scam-all-pervasive-sc-asks-bengal/articleshow/116485095.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday posed discomfiting questions to Bengal govt and its SSC on the 'scam' relating to recruitment of 25,000 teachers and non-teaching staff, and said there are too many flaws in the selection of candidates.Commencing final hearing on the issue, pending for over a year in SC, which had stayed Calcutta HC order cancelling appointment of teachers and non-teaching staff, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar pointed out reasons why HC cancelled the selection process on grounds that tainted and untainted candidates cannot be segregated.The bench said tainted candidates can be divided into different categories - ineligible, those whose ranks were manipulated to bring them into the selection list, those whose marks were manipulated to make them leapfrog over meritorious candidates, manipulation of OMR (some of which were blank), and those not on the merit list getting appointed.While enumerating the alleged flaws in the recruitment process, which was advertised in 2016 while appointments made in Jan 2019, CJI Khanna in a lighter vein asked,""Dal mein kuch kala hai ya sab kuch kala hai?""More than a dozen senior advocates argued for tainted candidates seeking to question the evidence based on which HC quashed appointment of 25,000 candidates, and said this evidence can be tested only through a trial.The bench said the 'scam' in recruitment was detected by the Justice Ranjit Kumar Bag commission and confirmed by CBI. Even SSC admitted to irregularities, and based on all these findings, HC had set aside the appointments, it said and asked what was so fundamentally wrong with the HC order. As many as 22 lakh candidates had competed for 25,000 posts. But their answer sheets were destroyed by SSC in 2020.For SSC, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta said tainted candidates have been identified by CBI and the figure more or less matches with those identified by SSC. Those appointments can be cancelled, and the rest can be saved, he argued. When certain advocates argued that setting aside the appointments of thousands of teachers would tell upon studies of students from Classes 9 to 12, the bench rejected it point blank, saying, ""We will not accept such arguments.""However, the bench said it would sympathetically consider those departmental candidates who are untainted and had worked for long years before being appointed teachers through this recruitment process. ""We will consider allowing their reversion to earlier cadres,"" it said while adjourning further hearing to Jan 7. Calcutta HC's Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay, who has since resigned and become an MP on a BJP ticket, had noticed the 'scam' and sought inquiry through the Justice Bag commission.","Supreme Court on Thursday posed discomfiting questions to Bengal govt and its SSC on the'scam' relating to recruitment of 25,000 teachers and non-teaching staff.

PRAYAGRAJ: Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri , the head of Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara, lauded chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday for his exemplary leadership, calling him the ‘Sun of Sanatan'.He emphasised that under Yogi's guidance, remarkable standards are being set, advancing the cause of Sanatan Dharma as never before.Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership. He also lauded PM Narendra Modi's vision of making Maha Kumbh a ""Mahayagya of Unity."" He called for collective efforts to make the event clean, healthy, green, digital, and plastic-free.He emphasized the need for participation from every village across the country, alongside local administration, voluntary organisations, and pilgrims, to ensure the success of Maha Kumbh through cleanliness drives and charitable activities.Highlighting the identity Maha Kumbh gained in 2019, he expressed confidence that the 2025 edition would set new benchmarks. He said Kumbh has historically served as a centre for the exchange of ideas, a confluence of scholars, and a unifying force for Sanatani powers, playing a pivotal role in shaping the country's condition and direction alongside its religious authority.He also emphasised that Kumbh has been organised even during challenging eras, including the Mughal and British rule and under govts indifferent to Sanatan values.However, the 2019 Kumbh was a turning point, as it showcased the true and eternal essence of Sanatan to the world for the first time. Maha Kumbh 2025 would surpass past achievements and set new benchmarks of success.Praising India's balanced ""India First"" foreign policy in crises like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Palestine conflict, he said this approach solidified India's position as a global power and a beacon of Sanatan and humanity.","Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership.

NEW DELHI: Hours after invoking GRAP-III in Delhi-NCR as the capital’s AQI deteriorated to higher end of ‘very poor’, the Commission for Air Quality Management enforced the highest level of curbs ( GRAP-IV ) in the region soon after air quality had crossed into the ‘severe’ zone at 10pm.Previous implementations of GRAP Stage-I and modified Stage-II continue to remain active. Earlier, GRAP Stage-III was operational from November 15 to December 4, while Stage-IV was enforced from November 18 to December 4.Under the revised GRAP, stricter measures have been introduced to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Schools and colleges in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad , and Gautam Budh Nagar will shift to hybrid classes for students up to Class V, allowing parents and students to opt for online learning where available.This winter, it is the second time when GRAP IV was enforced. Stage III and IV restrictions were enforced on Nov 15 and 18, respectively.These restrictions were revoked on Dec 5 with immediate effect, following Supreme Court’s permission.However, the Supreme Court had said GRAP Stage-III should be imposed next time when the AQI crosses 350, as against the earlier threshold of 400.It had similarly asked Stage IV to be imposed when the AQI touches 400, as opposed to the earlier threshold of 450.","Under the revised GRAP, stricter measures have been introduced to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR.

26/11 accused to be extradited to India? US government asks Supreme Court to dismiss Tahawwur Rana's plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-accused-to-be-extradited-to-india-us-asks-supreme-court-to-dismiss-tahawwur-ranas-plea/articleshow/116469774.cms,"Tahawwur Rana (File photo)

The US government supported India's request to extradite Tahawwur Rana, a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks . The government called upon the top US court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, recently petitioned the Supreme Court to block his extradition. The US Solicitor General, Elizabeth B. Prelogar , filed a response on December 16 urging the court to deny the petition.Rana had previously appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful. ""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled in August.He then filed a ""petition for a writ of certiorari"" with the Supreme Court on November 13. This petition represents Rana’s final legal attempt to avoid extradition.A writ of certiorari is a request to a higher court to review a lower court's ruling. The term ""certiorari"" comes from Law Latin, meaning ""to be more fully informed.""Rana's ""petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"" contends that he was previously tried and cleared in the federal court of Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) regarding the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. His petition states, ""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case.""However, Prelogar argued that Rana is not exempt from extradition. She contends that the Indian charges against Rana are not fully identical to the charges he faced in a US federal court in Chicago. ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case. For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the United States: petitioner's use of false information in an application to formally open a branch office of the Immigration Law Centre submitted to the Reserve Bank of India,"" she said as quoted by news agency PTI.She further explained that the prior US case against Rana, which resulted in an acquittal on some charges, does not cover all the conduct India intends to prosecute. ""It is not clear that the jury's verdict in this case - which involves conspiracy charges and was somewhat difficult to parse - means that he has been 'convicted or acquitted' on all of the specific conduct that India has charged.""","Tahawwur Rana is a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

"Flagging farm loan waivers, cash transfers & other sops, RBI says rationalise subsidies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flagging-farm-loan-waivers-cash-transfers-other-sops-rbi-says-rationalise-subsidies/articleshow/116482663.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reserve Bank of India on Thursday flagged its concern over several states announcing farm loan waivers , free power to agriculture and households, free transport and cash transfers to women and youth, cautioning that these spends will lower the funds available to undertake expenditure on building social and physical infrastructure as well as research and development.RBI's red flag comes amid a series of schemes being announced targeting women and unemployed youth, with each state going to poll seeking to outdo the other. ""High debt-GDP ratio, outstanding guarantees and the increasing subsidy burden require states to persevere with fiscal consolidation while laying greater emphasis on developmental and capital spending,"" the report on state finances based on the budget announcements for the current fiscal year said.Since 2018-19, subsidies given by the states have grown 2.5 times to over Rs 4.7 lakh crore, the budgeted level for the current fiscal year.While lauding the overall effort towards fiscal consolidation, it pointed to the high revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO) ratio in several states. A large part of the revenue expenditure is seen to be going towards non-asset creating spending and is difficult to reduce given that it includes interest payments, salary and pension bills and the politically sensitive issue of subsidies. Punjab has the highest RECO of 17.1 this fiscal - which is more than three times the national average - followed by Puducherry (14.1), Kerala (10.6) and Delhi (10.3), RBI concluded.Post-Covid the Centre has been seeking to focus on increasing capital outlays to ensure job creation and generation of demand for inputs and reducing the proportion of revenue expenditure. Between 2021-22 and 2024-25, RECO is estimated to have declined from 6.3 to 5.2 with Manipur having the best ration (2.4), followed by Gujarat (2.9) and Sikkim & Arunachal Pradesh (3.1), a report on state budgets released by RBI said. For all the states, since 2020-21, expenditure has increased 68% to Rs 57.6 lakh crore (budgeted for this year), while capital outlay has more than doubled from Rs 4.1 lakh crore to Rs 9.2 lakh crore.The report said that for the states, a large chunk of the capital outlays have gone towards transport, irrigation and water supply.While capital expenditure was estimated at 2.5% of GDP during the last fiscal year, the Centre's long-term loan for capex too has played a part as it accounted for 14.4% of the states' capital outlays. In some cases, such as Andhra Pradesh, these loans accounted for over half the outlays in FY23 and FY24, while in Bihar it was around a quarter of the outlays of the state. While states have been sticking to fiscal responsibility legislations, RBI said the need is to focus on capital expenditure.","RBI's red flag comes amid a series of schemes being announced targeting women and unemployed youth.

At present, only Siddheshwar Mahadev temple is evident in Devnathpura, and the water body mentioned is not visible. According to Dwivedi, it's possible that the water body is covered with a platform and the temples went under the houses built there in past decades.""The oldest maps are being searched to find where those water bodies and temples were likely to be found. We are collecting all evidence as, in case the matter went to litigation, we will have to produce them before the court. We will proceed further once everything is clear and confirmed,"" he added.""We are stepping forward very cautiously to ensure everything is in accordance with the scriptures. Cooperation of administration is being sought to collect necessary information,"" he said, adding, ""SKVP is of the view that if all Shiva temples mentioned in scriptures are found, we will consider ways for their restoration and renovation. If it is found that those temples exist in any building, which has been sold to any individual, we will find ways to purchase those buildings.""SKVP said Akhara Parishad, Mahamandaleshwars, and seers had contacted them to take care of the temple.

The controversy began after the Congress alleged that Union home minister Amit Shah had insulted Ambedkar during his speech in the Rajya Sabha.Congress was leading the attack with a clip from Amit Shah's Rajya Sabha speech, in which on Tuesday he had said, ""Abhi ek fashion ho gaya hai - Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar. Itna naam agar bhagwan ka lete to saat janmon tak swarg mil jata (It has become a fashion to say Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar'. If they had taken God's name so many times, they would have got a place in heaven).""As the two political fronts held simultaneous protests, a scuffle broke out outside the Parliament complex. The BJP cornered the Congress after its two MPs Pratap Sarangi and Mukesh Rajput were injured and admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital for head injuries.Pratap Sarangi (69) from Odisha and Mukesh Rajput from Uttar Pradesh were brought to the hospital from Parliament with head injuries, the hospital's Medical Superintendent Dr Ajay Shukla said.""Sarangi was bleeding profusely. He had a deep cut on his forehead and it had to be stitched. His blood pressure and anxiety level were high when he was brought in,"" the doctor said.""Rajput also had a head injury immediately after which he lost consciousness. However, the MP was in his senses when he was brought to the hospital. His blood pressure levels had also shot up,"" Dr Shukla said.The medical superintendent of the RML Hospital said both the MPs were administered medicines to manage their blood pressure, pain and anxiety.The BJP accused Rahul Gandhi of pushing the senior member after which its MPs were injured.A video showed BJP's Nishikant Dubey accusing Rahul of resorting to rowdy behaviour ('gundagardi').""He pushed me,"" Gandhi countered Dubey, walking off after having a cursory look at Sarangi, who was being attended to by fellow BJP members.""I was trying to enter Parliament and the BJP MPs were stopping me, pushing me and threatening me,"" Gandhi told reporters in Parliament premises.Meanwhile, Congress said BJP MPs had sticks in their hands and leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge was threatened and pushed.Kharge also wrote to Birla, claiming he was physically pushed by BJP MPs in Parliament premises following which he lost his balance.""I was physically pushed by BJP MPs; lost my balance and was forced to sit down on ground in front of Makar Dwar... This inflicted injuries on my knees which have already undergone surgery,"" Kharge said.Kharge asked the speaker to order an inquiry into the BJP MPs ""pushing"" him, and said it was an assault not just on him but on the Rajya Sabha LoP and the Congress president.In their letter to Birla, some senior Congress MPs said they were writing to express their ""deep anguish"" over the incident that happened when members of the INDIA bloc were peacefully protesting and marching from the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar statue to Makar Dwar.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also dismissed the allegations against bother Rahul by terming it a conspiracy by BJP to protect Amit Shah.""Rahul (Gandhi) was peacefully going inside the Parliament while holding BR Ambedkar's photograph and chanting the 'Jai Bhim' slogan. Who stopped him from going to the Parliament? We have been protesting for so many days and there is always space left for those who are going inside and outside,"" the Wayanad MP said.""Today, they protested for the first time and stopped everyone while resorting to pushing, shoving and hooliganism. This is a conspiracy hatched to save Amit Shah's skin. They pushed Kharge as he fell on the floor before my eyes. After that, a CPI (M) MP was also pushed around and he fell on Kharge. We could see that he has been injured,"" Vadra said.Meanwhile, a BJP MP from Nagaland, Phangnon Konyak, filed a complaint with Rajya Sabha Chairman against Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of misbehaving with her by standing too close and causing discomfort.""I was standing just below the staircase of Makar Dwaar with a placard in my hand. The Security Personnel had cordoned and created a passage to the entrance right for the moment of Hon'ble MP's of other parties. Suddenly, the Leader of the Opposition, Shri Rahul Gandhi Ji along-with other party members came in front of me despite there being a passage created for them,"" her letter stated.""He misbehaved with me in a loud voice and his physical proximity to me was so close that I, being a lady member, felt extremely uncomfortable,"" the MP said.As the row over the scuffle intensified, Congress and BJP delegations reached police station to file FIR and counter FIR.A delegation of Congress MPs including women MPs reached the Parliament Street Police station to complain against the BJP.On the other side, three NDA MPs, including Anurag Thakur and Bansuri Swaraj, reached the same police station to file a complaint against Rahul Gandhi.""We have filed a complaint with Delhi Police against Rahul Gandhi for assault and incitement. We have mentioned in detail the incident that happened today outside Makar Dwar, where NDA MPs were protesting peacefully... We have given a complaint under Sections 109, 115, 117, 125, 131 and 351. Section 109 is attempt to murder, Section 117 is voluntary causing grievous hurt,"" BJP MP Anurag Thakur said after meeting police officials.Delhi Police later registered an FIR against Rahul Gandhi.Later in the day the two parties also held press conferences in which the Congress accused the BJP of orchestrating the scuffle to divert from Adani row and Amit Shah's anti-Ambedkar remark.""A few days before the Parliament session, the Adani case came up in America and the BJP tried to stop the discussion on it. The basic strategy of the BJP was that there should be no discussion on the Adani case, it should be suppressed... After that Amit Shah's statement came and we have been saying from the beginning that the thinking of the BJP and the RSS is anti-Constitution, anti-Ambedkar,"" Rahul Gandhi said during a press brief on Thursday.Meanwhile, BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan claimed that Rahul indulged in ""goondaism"" and ""purposely and in planned way scuffled with BJP MPs and resorted to violence"". ""Congress and other MPs have been staging protests at Makar Dwar almost daily and we also enter Parliament without disturbing them. However, Rahul Gandhi purposely and in a planned way scuffled with BJP MPs and resorted to violence,"" Shivraj Chouhan said. The BJP, in its press conference also said Rahul Gandhi's ""behaviour was unimaginable in a civilised society"" and that he was ""not fit to hold the leader of opposition post in Lok Sabha"".","BJP and Congress embroiled into protest vs counterprotest, scuffle and FIR vs FIR by the two parties.

"Can’t legitimise illegal buildings, raze them: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-legitimise-illegal-buildings-raze-them-sc/articleshow/116481113.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant decision giving the executive unfettered right to demolish unauthorised and illegal constructions and encroachments, the Supreme Court has ruled that properties falling foul of law cannot be legitimised on the ground that people have been staying in them for decades and that authorities had blinked at the illegalities.Upholding demolition action taken by the UP govt against certain illegal properties, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said, ""Illegality of unauthorised construction cannot be perpetuated. If the construction is made in contravention of the Acts/Rules, it would be construed as illegal and unauthorised construction, which has to be necessarily demolished.""Authoring the 36-page judgment, Justice Mahadevan said no unauthorised or illegal structure can be legitimised under the ruse of passage of time, long inaction of authorities, or that a substantial amount of money has been spent on the construction.Justice Mahadevan said, "" Unauthorised constructions , apart from posing a threat to the life of the occupants and the citizens living nearby, also have an effect on resources like electricity, ground water and access to roads, which are primarily designed to be made available in orderly development.""Referring to instances where unauthorised constructions are registered due to collusion of registration authorities with land mafia, the bench said the power to remove unauthorised constructions is independent of the Registration Act and said, ""In any way, registration of a property would not amount to regularising the unauthorised construction.""Tackling the issue of prolonged litigations involving unauthorised constructions, the SC said, ""In the event of any violation being brought to the notice of the courts, it must be curtailed with iron hands and any lenience afforded to them would amount to showing misplaced sympathy.""The court also asked state govts not to mindlessly regularise illegal colonies, except only in exceptional circumstances. ""State govts often seek to enrich themselves through the process of regularisation by condoning/ratifying the violations and illegalities. The State is unmindful that this gain is insignificant compared to the long-term damage it causes to the orderly urban development and irreversible adverse impact on the environment,"" the bench said.It said, ""Hence, regularisation schemes must be brought out only in exceptional circumstances and as a one time measure for residential houses after a detailed survey and considering the nature of land, fertility, usage, impact on the environment, availability and distribution of resources, proximity to water bodies/rivers and larger public interest.""It issued a slew of directions to authorities not to allow builders to allot flats without obtaining completion/occupancy certificate concerning all aspects of building bylaws.

NEW DELHI: A three-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday solved a 20-year-old riddle that plagued levying of excise duty - whether pure coconut oil is to be classified as an edible oil or under cosmetics as hair oil?This question had got a split verdict from the bench of the then CJI and Justice R Banumathi. While Justice Gogoi, who retired as CJI in Nov 2019, was of the view coconut oil in small packaging was appropriately classified as edible oil, Justice Banumathi opined that coconut oil packed in small containers are to be classified as hair oil.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, and Justices Sanjay Kumar and R Mahadevan, aware of the dual use of coconut oil in different parts of the country, said the classification would depend on the branding of the oil as edible to meet the criteria under food safety regulations, and conform to a different criterion under Drugs and Cosmetics Act to be classified as hair oil.Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar rejected argument of revenue dept that pure coconut oil should invariably be classified as hair oil and said, ""We are of the opinion that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as 'edible oil' would be classifiable as edible oil"". Revenue dept had said the bunch of appeals involved Rs 160 crore in terms of excise duty, penalties, redemption fine and interest.SC said, ""The fact that such edible coconut oil was sold in smaller containers would not, by itself, be indicative of it being packaging of a kind fit for use as 'hair oil'.""""One may choose to buy one's cooking oil in small quantities, be it for economic or for health reasons or due to inclination to use fresh oil in food preparation, and the smaller size of the packaging of such oil cannot be taken to mean that it is to be used as 'hair oil' without any pointer to that effect, be it by way of a label or literature or by any other indication that it is to be used as 'hair oil',"" it said.""Small-sized containers are common to both 'edible oils' and 'hair oils'. Therefore, there must be something more to distinguish between them for classification of such oil, other than size of the packaging,"" the bench said.","A three-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday solved a 20-year-old riddle that plagued levying of excise duty.

In an unusual step, police are conducting a DNA test to confirm ownership of the buffalo.The fight is between Kunibelakere and Kulagatte villages, which are 40km apart. With the jury still out, the buffalo is currently under police custody at a Shivamogga goshala.This is a re-run of a similar incident in the district in 2021, when a buffalo's ownership was established through DNA test.Eight years ago, a buffalo was dedicated to Kunibelakere's village deity, Kariyamma Devi. In neighbouring Belakere village, a buffalo was recently found, coinciding with reports of a bovine missing from Kulagatte village of Honnali taluk. Kulagatte residents transported the buffalo to their village, claiming its ownership. Madappa Rangannavar from the village claimed it had been missing for two months.However, this prompted Kunibelakere villagers to assert their rights over the animal, leading to a confrontation that required police intervention.There was a disagreement over the buffalo's age, too. Kunibelakere claimed the animal was eight years old, while Kulagatte put its age at three. An examination by veterinarians suggested the animal was over six years old, supporting Kunibelakere's claim. However, Kulagatte villagers contested this.Subsequently, Kunibelakere residents filed a theft case against seven persons from Kulagatte and sought a DNA test, citing the presence of the buffalo's offspring in their village as evidence. Dander Tippesh from Kunibelakere said the case has reached the Davanagere SP's office.Additional SP Vijaykumar Santosh confirmed DNA samples had been collected, and the matter would be resolved upon receiving the test results.","The fight is between Kunibelakere and Kulagatte villages, which are 40km apart.

The joint call for the protest has also come from dalit leaders Nitin Raut, Rajendra Pal Gautam and Jignesh Mewani.Maharashtra has had a protest on Thursday, other states are catching on and there will be small gatherings from Friday. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, Haryana and Punjab have already responded, said Bharti. There will be gatherings at bloc headquarter and district headquarter level and then in towns and cities.The primary demand of the protestors is that the government (home minister) has to publicly apologise and also apologise on the floor of the House in Parliament, since the remarks have been made during a debate on the Constitution, to celebrate its 75year of adoption.The anchor theme for the Dalit groups is, “Dr Ambedkar is not a fashion he is the nation. Whoever insults the nation is a rashtradrohi (traitor), and traitors have no right to run the country,” said Bharti, soon after a meeting with Dalit groups. The theme is a counter to Shah saying, “Yeh fashion ho gaya hai, Ambedkar, Ambedkar... itna naam agar Bhagwan ka lete toh saat janmo tak swarg mil jata.” (It has become a fashion… Ambedkar, Ambedkar… if God’s name was taken so many times it would have taken you to the heavens), during his speech in the House.“Having NACDOR has also sought support of all sections of society for this mobilisation so that the sanctity of the Constitution and its makers is restored. OBC groups are also joining the protests,” Bharti said. The Dalit groups have also invited like minded political parties to support the protests.“When Chhatrapati Shivaji’s statue was damaged, Prime Minister himself had apologised for it, but the home minister who has publicly insulted Dr Ambedkar in Parliament, cannot apologise? Is his stature larger than that of the PM,” Bharti said. Afterall, “he was speaking from written notes in the House, so was this also part of his written text… to hurt sentiments of Ambedkar’s followers, he added.","Dalit organisations have called for nationwide protest on December 28, to register their anger over home minister Amit Shah’s remarks on B R Ambedkar in Parliament.

Govt estimates show that India needs to generate 7.9 million jobs annually until 2030 to sustain its economic growth trajectory. A significant portion of these jobs will come from the manufacturing sector, which is increasingly characterised by large-scale mega factories. These facilities require a centralised workforce, often composed of migrant workers, to maintain competitiveness and achieve economies of scale, the report said.It said inadequate housing near industrial hubs is a major bottleneck. Poor housing conditions lead to high attrition rates, reduced productivity, & workforce instability. Moreover, lack of suitable accommodations restricts migration of workers, particularly women, thereby limiting the sector's growth potential.","India's ambition to become a $10 trillion economy by 2035 relies on growth of its manufacturing sector.

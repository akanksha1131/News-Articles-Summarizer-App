NEW DELHI: An Air India aircraft en route from Chicago to Delhi had to return to Chicago after flying for more than ten hours on Thursday due to technical issues.However, according to PTI sources, the flight had to return because numerous toilets were non-functional.According to flightradar24.com, the Boeing 777-337 ER aircraft returned to Chicago's ORD airport after being airborne for over ten hours.The Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft, which accommodates more than 340 passengers across first, business and economy classes, is equipped with 10 toilets, including two designated for first-class travellers, according to PTI sources.The source further revealed that only one toilet remained operational.""Upon landing at Chicago, all passengers and crew disembarked normally and have been provided with accommodation to minimise inconvenience.

A FasTag for scholarships? Jhunjhunu pilot shows way in easing student pain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-fastag-for-scholarships-jhunjhunu-pilot-shows-way-in-easing-student-pain/articleshow/118827398.cms,"GRANT A WISH: (From left) Piramal Foundation’s Shraddha Mishra with MNREGA worker Suman, her daughter Ronak and batchmate Kajal (in school uniform)

How it works

That cold morning on December 6, there was a quiet buzz at Hameeri Kalan Senior Secondary School in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. For the students, teachers, and parents gathered there, it wasn’t an ordinary day. It felt like a festival — a scholarship festival.Class 9 student Kajal, clutching her notebook, ran toward her mother, who had taken the morning off from her job as a daily wage worker. “Maa, mobile de na,” she asked, eager and out of breath. “Kai karegi?” her mother said, handing over the phone. Kajal tapped the screen, and suddenly, her face lit up. “Ho gaya! Paisa aa gaya!” she yelled. Other students looked up and quickly ran to their parents, grabbing phones, dialing numbers, and checking messages. “Mujhe bhi SMS aaya!” (Even I got a money transfer SMS), one of them shouted. Yet another student said Rs 3,600 had been credited to their account. For the teachers, and staff of nonprofit Piramal Foundation who stood watching, it was a proud moment. “It felt like a lottery. Very often, students don’t receive their scholarships even after passing out from school,” says Hameeri Kalan school vice-principal Rajkamal Kataria.In a scholarship system riddled with delays and mistrust, Digi Vritti , a small digital pilot in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan is using real-time technology to help students get their scholarships within days, not months. Just as a FASTag gets rid of toll queues and Digi Yatra speeds up airport boarding.For Piramal Group chairman Ajay Piramal, the Digi Vritti pilot is not just about fixing delays and inefficiencies. It’s about reimagining how India delivers opportunities to its most deserving students. “The existing scholarship system faces numerous challenges. From manual verification and delays in disbursement to trust deficits among beneficiaries, deserving students are often left without timely support,” he says. Digi Vritti aims to reduce benefit delivery times from 40 weeks to under a week, using digital wallets and verifiable credentials to simplify processes and ensure transparency.Sher Singh Rajput and Shraddha Mishra of the Piramal Foundation say two schools were chosen for the pilot, Hameeri Kalan and Bajawa Suron Ka, as both had high numbers of SC/ST and marginalised students, with less than 20% of those eligible receiving scholarships over the years. The platform — powered by the Open Network for Employment and Skilling Transformation (ONEST), part of the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) framework — connects students needing scholarships with bhamashahs (donors). “It’s like Flipkart,” Rajput explains. “Buyers are matched with sellers — it’s as simple as that.” This system could scale up to include govt scholarships in the future.Every year, India sets aside over Rs 50,000 crore for scholarships and benefits to support marginalised communities — nearly a quarter of the population. Yet, much of this money goes unspent. A study by the Piramal Foundation highlights how endless paperwork and fragmented systems discourage students from even applying.Most students in India must navigate multiple portals, often without reliable internet access to apply for scholarships. Aadhaar cards or caste certificates are frequently mismatched, forcing families to make repeated trips to govt offices. Besides, for every application, one must dish out between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. “It’s disheartening to get them to fill the forms as we never know when and whether at all the kids will receive the scholarship amount. Most of them have stopped applying altogether,” says Kisturi, a teacher at the school who manages the process.For MNREGA labourer Suman, every minute lost chasing paperwork for daughter Ronak’s scholarship means lost wages. “I’ve been waiting for her scholarship since she was in Class 6. She’s in Class 9 now. Last time, I spent almost Rs 1,000 on photocopies, bank visits, running from one office to another. That’s what I earn in 10 days of hard work,” Suman says.Digi Vritti eliminates these pain points by making the process easy (see box). It also makes scholarships easier to understand, ensuring even small grants like exam fees or skilling courses reach the right students quickly. Verification of all documents happens directly at the school, cutting through the usual layers of bureaucracy. District block education officer Manish Kumar Chahar says the best part is that students won’t have to apply repeatedly. “They’ll simply get notifications about scholarships that match their eligibility and profiles,” he says. Piramal sees this project as a model for broader reforms. “Philanthropy and technology are increasingly converging to address deep systemic challenges,” he explains. “Digi Vritti exemplifies this synergy.”","Digi Vritti aims to reduce benefit delivery times from 40 weeks to under a week.

"NMC overrules SC’s and its own decision, rejects patient’s appeal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-overrules-scs-and-its-own-decision-rejects-patients-appeal/articleshow/118827380.cms,"Representative photo

NMC is in a shambles, such a casual approach is shocking: Activist

Despite the National Medical Commission (NMC) deciding in September last year that not only doctors, but patients too can appeal to the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) against decisions of state medical councils , on February 21 the EMRB rejected the appeal of a patient from Punjab.Incidentally, the EMRB is totally vacant since the tenure of all members came to an end last year, raising the question of who rejected the appeal.From Sept 2020, when the NMC was constituted, hundreds of patient appeals were rejected saying that NMC Act allowed only doctors to appeal. This is despite the patients’ right to appeal being upheld by a Supreme Court order in 2002.However, the minutes of the 16th meeting of NMC held on Sept 29 last year, obtained through RTI in Jan stated: “NMC had agreed that all appeals received by EMRB will be entertained.” The minutes were approved by Dec.Further, as regards action not being taken by state medical councils on complaints filed by non-medicos even after issuance of reminders by the boards. It was decided to send a communication by EMRB to state medical councils to complete the process in a time bound manner. In case of failure by the concerned SMC to act upon, EMRB may take over the complaint matter from SMC and dispose the same. This is noted by EMRB, and board will proceed further accordingly.”Gokul Chand Aneja from Punjab’s Amritsar filed an appeal dated Jan 30 against the decision of Punjab Medical Council, in a case of alleged medical negligence which led to his wife’s death. He received a letter from NMC dated Feb 21 rejecting his appeal stating that EMRB had decided in Oct 2021, that in keeping with NMC Act 2019 , “only medical practitioners or professionals should be allowed as (sic) appeals before EMRB”.In March 2022, NMC had rejected the appeal of a patient from Haryana’s Faridabad. The letter from EMRB rejecting the appeal of Aneja appears to be a copy-paste of the letter issued in March 2022 with just a change in dates, name of recipient etc.“NMC appears to be in shambles. Who took the decision to reject an appeal when EMRB is vacant? It looks like Aneja’s appeal was rejected by some functionary in the EMRB division who just copied an earlier letter. Such a casual approach is shocking,” said Dr KV Babu, ophthalmologist and RTI activist who has been fighting since 2022 to get the right of patients to appeal restored.","National Medical Commission (NMC) decided in September last year that not only doctors, but patients too can appeal to the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) On February 21 the EMRB rejected the appeal of a patient from Punjab.Incidentally, the E MRB is totally vacant since the tenure of all members came to an end last year.

Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin.

MUMBAI: Four migrant workers from West Bengal died of asphyxiation on Sunday after stepping into a basement water tank at an under-construction 40-plus-storey building in Nagpada. One worker was injured while attempting a rescue. The tank had been shut for two years, leading to accumulation of sludge and toxic gases due to past chemical treatments.Workers at the site said it was common practice to step into water tanks without safety gear, but none of them was aware of the hazardous conditions inside this particular tank. “No safety kit was provided. They should have left the tank open for a while to let the gases escape,” said Bhutan Sheikh, who was injured.At the time of going to press, police were in the process of registering four accidental death cases. An FIR may be lodged if police find negligence on the part of the builder. “We are questioning the labour contractor.

FM to table Manipur budget today, Shah to seek Prez rule nod

NEW DELHI: The budget session of Parliament resumes on Monday in the shadow of a spate of controversies along the ‘ opposition vs government ’ battleline, ranging from Trump’s comments on tariffs, duplicate voter identity card numbers, three-language policy and delimitation, amid indications that the non-budget issues may set off fireworks.Adding to the clutch of issues being debated in public are the renewed violence in Manipur and the Waqf amendment bill . The government is scheduled to bring a resolution to seek Parliament’s approval for proclamation of President’s rule in Manipur , and the opposition will use the discussion to raise the two years of continuing ethnic strife in the northeastern state. The state’s budget too will come up for discussion.The Centre last month placed Manipur under President’s rule after the resignation of beleaguered CM N Biren Singh. Also, the Centre is expected to bring the controversial Waqf bill for passage, which is being opposed by the entire opposition. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju has indicated that govt was in favour of early passage of the Waqf bill on which NDA allies have pledged support.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is to table the budget for Manipur on Monday, which has been under President’s rule since Feb 13. Home minister Amit Shah is expected to move a resolution seeking Parliament’s approval for proclamation of President’s rule in the state. The three-language policy and delimitation have become contentious in the south, with states banding together to question the Centre.Trump’s disparaging statements about India’s tariffs, and his recent announcement that India has agreed to lower tariffs, have elicited strong statements from Congress about the interests of India’s farmers and manufacturers. The party has demanded that the prime minister take Parliament into confidence on the discussions with the US about the proposed trade deal.At the same time, the opposition will corner government over the issue of duplicate EPIC numbers, which has become controversial after the claims by Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is to table the budget for Manipur on Monday.

In rape case,

prosecutrix testimony

enough to convict: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In an over 40-year-old incident of sexual assault of a schoolgirl by her tuition teacher, Supreme Court has confirmed his guilt and sentence while ruling that courts can record conviction even in absence of injury to the prosecutrix’s private parts, when other evidence corroborates rape.The accused had argued that rape charges could not be proved as there was no injury to the private parts of the girl and alleging that the girl’s mother, a “women of easy virtue”, was making false allegations against him.Rejecting both the arguments, a bench of Justices Sandeep Mehta and Prasanna B Varale said, “Merely because in the medical evidence, there are no major injury marks, this cannot be a reason to discard the otherwise reliable evidence of the prosecutrix.”Writing the judgment, Justice Varale said, “It is not necessary that in each and every case in which rape is alleged there has to be an injury to the private parts of the victim and it depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case. We reiterate that absence of injuries on the private parts of the victim is not always fatal to the case of the prosecution.”The bench also said that it is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the evidence of a prosecutrix in a case of rape carries the same value as that of an injured witness and conviction can be made on the basis of the sole testimony of the prosecutrix.Turning to the accused’s allegation about the character of prosecutrix’s mother, the bench said the court need not go into its veracity as it has no bearing on the case. “We find no reason to accept the contention that the alleged immoral character of the mother of the prosecutrix has any bearing on the accused being falsely roped in on the basis of a concocted story.”“The question of conviction of the accused for rape of the prosecutrix is independent and distinct. It has absolutely no connection with the character of the mother of the prosecutrix and seems to be a dire attempt at using it as a license to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix. We find no merit in these contentions,” the bench said.The case also reflects a sad state of affairs of the three-tier judiciary system where trial courts are far more prompt in rendering decisions in criminal cases compared to constitutional courts. The incident of sexual assault by a tuition teacher is of March 1984. The trial court convicted the man in 1986. However, Allahabad high court took 26 years to uphold the trial court verdict and SC another 15 years to do the same.When the girl went for tuition on March 19, 1984, the teacher sent out the two other girls for different works and sexually assaulted the girl after gagging her and locking the room from inside. The other two girls knocked on the door, but it was not opened. Eventually, the grandmother of the girls came and rescued the girl. When the girl’s family attempted to lodge an FIR, the inhabitants of the mohalla and family members of the accused threatened them. Despite the threats, the FIR was lodged after some delay.","The incident of sexual assault by a tuition teacher is of March 1984. The trial court convicted the man in 1986.

NEW DELHI: India are set to face New Zealand in a bid to win the Champions Trophy after a 12-year hiatus, confronting their historical difficulty in overcoming the resilient Kiwis in ICC tournaments, where New Zealand leads with a 10-6 record and a 3-1 advantage in knockout matches.Despite criticisms regarding India's extended preparation time in Dubai, such arguments are diminished as New Zealand is also well-acquainted with the conditions. India's strategy likely involves leveraging their spin quartet, which has proven effective on the Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitch, against New Zealand's batting lineup.Spinners Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been key in India's bowling success, potentially challenging New Zealand's top batters, including Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra.New Zealand's spinners, however, have previously succeeded against India and aim to replicate that performance. The match also carries emotional weight for India, with veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma potentially playing in one of their final ICC tournaments.Kohli's recent form includes a century and two fifties, while Sharma aims to contribute more significantly. India hopes for impactful performances from the rest of the team, including vice-captain Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, and Hardik Pandya, to secure a collective victory.This final presents an opportunity for both teams to claim the ICC ODI title, with India looking to add to their trophy cabinet and New Zealand seeking their first since 2000.The match will be live-streamed on JioHotstar and broadcast on Star Sports Network.The match is scheduled to begin at 2:30 pm IST, while the toss will take place at 2 pm on March 9, Sunday.Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh PantWill Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham(w), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner(c), Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, William ORourke, Nathan Smith, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy","India are set to face New Zealand in a bid to win the Champions Trophy after a 12-year hiatus.

'Rohit Sharma-led Team India will clinch the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title': Astrologer Greenstone Lobo's huge prediction

New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit when the two teams meet in Dubai on Sunday for the ICC Champions Trophy final , and the Kiwi plans have been laid bare by a net bowler.India started using a four-pronged spin attack from the third game onwards in the group stage of the tournament. Incidentally, that match was against New Zealand, who could only score 205 in response to India's 249 and succumbed to the pressure exerted by the spinners.To prepare for that eventuality once again, the Kiwi batters are training specifically to counter spin, which was revealed to ANI by net bowler Shashwat Tiwari.According to the report, Tiwari said the New Zealanders are probably wary of the threat by Indian spinners, who played a key role in beating New Zealand in the group fixture as well as Australia in the semi-finals.Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy took seven wickets in those two matches, including a five-for (5 for 42) against the Kiwis.""They are preparing for left-armers,"" Tiwari told ANI. ""I won't say they are struggling. Of course, our Indian team has top-class spinners, but I don't think they will be able to cope with them.""India have the old war horse Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav as their three left-arm spinners. Chakravarthy and Washington Sundar are the other two spinners in the squad.""Today, I fortunately got to bowl (in the nets),"" Tiwari said further.""At one point in time, he (name not revealed in the ANI report) asked me to bowl from 18 yards just to prepare for Ravindra Jadeja. It is because of the kind of pace he (Jadeja) has. He was expecting that kind of speed. We (net bowlers) bowled from that point, and we did it nicely. But when he realised the ball was coming too quickly, he asked me to bowl from 22 yards,"" Tiwari added.India topped Group A by winning all three matches and went on to beat Australia by four wickets in the semifinal. New Zealand, meanwhile, defeated South Africa by 50 runs in the other semifinal.",Net bowler Shashwat Tiwari says New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit.

NEW DELHI: After Rahul Gandhi called out Congress insiders for supporting the BJP in Gujarat, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh asked when Gandhi would take action against those inside enemies. ""When will Rahul Gandhi expel BJP supporters from Congress?"" posted the former CM of Madhya Pradesh on X.Rahul Gandhi, while addressing party workers in Ahmedabad on Saturday, suggested that some were ""cut off"" from the people and half of them were ""in cahoots"" with the BJP. ""The leadership of Gujarat, the workers of Gujarat, the district presidents (Congress) of Gujarat, the block presidents, there are two types of people in them, there are divisions.

The other is the one who is cut off from the people, sits far away, does not respect the people and half of them are in cahoots with the BJP. Until we do not separate these two, the people of Gujarat cannot believe in us,"" Gandhi said.Recalling his own experience in Gujarat, Digvijaya Singh said when he was campaigning as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, he was instructed to not speak against RSS. He was told Hindus would get angry if he said anything against the RSS. ""The Sangh does not represent the Hindus. It only misleads and exploits the Hindus in the name of religion,"" Digvijaya said adding that the Hindus have Shankaracharyas as their leaders. ""The tradition of Shankaracharyas, the Hindu spiritual leaders, has been established for thousands of years and continues to this day. Which of these Shankaracharyas support @BJP4India and @RSSorg today?"" said the Congress MP.The BJP dismissed Rahul Gandhi's statement and said he should first understand that he is responsible for the party's defeat.

Officials confirmed on Saturday that the agency is working closely with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to dismantle these operations, PTI reported.The move comes after the recent arrest of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who was caught carrying 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport . Two CBI teams have been dispatched to Mumbai and Bengaluru airports to collect further information.Ranya Rao, known for her roles in Kannada films like Maanikya and Pataki, was detained by the DRI upon her arrival from Dubai on March 3. Authorities allege that she was attempting to smuggle 17 gold bars, weighing 14.8 kg, into the country. She was produced before a special court for financial offences on March 4 and has been remanded in judicial custody until March 18. The court has permitted her to meet her lawyer for half an hour each day and has instructed officials to ensure she is provided with basic necessities.Following her arrest, an image of Ranya with swollen eyes and bruises circulated on social media, sparking speculation of possible assault during custody, as per news agency PTI. Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Chaudhary addressed the concerns but stated that the commission could not investigate unless a formal complaint was filed. She condemned any potential mistreatment, adding that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.The case has also brought renewed scrutiny to the misuse of airport protocol services. Reports suggest that certain privileges meant for high-ranking officials were exploited to facilitate gold smuggling. In response, the Karnataka government has decided to revise standard operating procedures, restricting protocol services strictly to officials themselves, rather than their family members or associates. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Umashankar SR confirmed the decision, stating that security measures would no longer extend to relatives of senior bureaucrats.Meanwhile, sources indicate that a protocol staffer at Kempegowda International Airport was briefly detained by the DRI after Ranya’s arrest. However, he was later released after stating that he had been instructed to receive a senior officer’s daughter and was unaware of the smuggling attempt.In a voluntary statement to the DRI, Ranya admitted to possession of the gold, acknowledging that 17 gold bars were recovered from her. She described herself as an artist, wildlife photographer, and real estate freelancer in Dubai. Her case remains under investigation as authorities expand their probe into the smuggling network.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case against gangs involved in smuggling gold into India through various airports.

How 'variability in data' affected the water quality report?



What did the previous report say?



How UP government reacted to the report?



NEW DELHI: The Central Pollution Control Board in its new report has said that water quality in the recently concluded Maha Kumbh was ""fit for bathing"". This comes after the board had termed water in Prayagraj at several locations during Kumbh unfit for bathing due to high faecal bacteria levels.In the new report dated February 28, the pollution control board said that a statistical analysis was required due to inconsistencies in the data, as water samples taken from the same locations on different dates—and from different spots on the same day—varied significantly. As a result, the findings did not accurately represent the overall water quality across the entire river stretch.""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.The report clarified that an expert committee analyzed the issue of data variability and concluded that the findings represent only a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time.It highlighted that water quality can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, including human activities upstream, flow rate, sampling depth, time of collection, river currents, mixing of currents, and the exact sampling location, among other influences.""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.The previous report, submitted on February 17, said that water quality at several locations in Prayagraj during Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels.""A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report had said, adding ""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform at all the monitored locations on various occasions.""The UP CM Yogi Adityanath had rejected the faecal bacteria in Sangam waters claim and had said that the Kumbh was fit for bathing. He had also called it an attempt to defame the religious gathering.""Questions are being raised about the quality of the water (at Triveni). All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification. The UP Pollution Control Board is continuously monitoring the water to maintain its quality,"" he had said.""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is, as per the standards, less than 2,500 MPN per 100 ml. This means that the false campaign is only to defame the Maha Kumbh. The NGT has also said that the faecal waste was less than 2000 MPN per 100 ml,"" he added.","The Central Pollution Control Board in its new report has said that water quality in the recently concluded Maha Kumbh was ""fit for bathing"" This comes after the board had termed water in Prayagraj at several locations duringKumbh unfit for bathing due to high faecal bacteria levels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118817742,imgsize-200990,width-400,resizemode-4/118817742.jpg"

How Manipur spiraled back to violence?

NEW DELHI: Day-to-day life came to a standstill in the Kuki-dominated areas in Manipur on Sunday after a retaliatory indefinite strike was enforced against the ""crackdown by security forces."" Although no fresh violence has been reported, the situation in the state's Kangpokpi district remained calm but tense.This comes a day after at least one person died while 40 were injured in clashes between Kuki demonstrators and security forces protesting free movement along all roads in the ethnic strife-torn state.In Manipur's Kuki-dominated areas in Churachandpur and Tengnoupal, protestors burnt tyres and blocked roads with boulders. The roads were, however, cleared later by the security forces.Meanwhile, shops and other business establishments remained closed and few vehicles were seen plying the roads in Kuki-dominated areas in the state. Protestors also asked locals to remain indoors.Additional security forces have been deployed in Gamghiphai and other parts of the district along the NH-2 (Imphal-Dimapur Road) and vehicular patrolling was being conducted to ensure law and order, a district official said.The state police recovered weapons, ammunition, explosives, and various military-grade equipment during security force operations on March 7.Manipur Police in a press release shared the details, ""Search operations and area domination were conducted by security forces in the fringe and vulnerable areas of hill and valley Districts.""""One SMG Carbine with one empty Magazine, One Single Bolt Action Rifle, One .303 modified Rifle, One local made Single Barrel, One .22 Rifle, two Revolver cartridge box containing 12 live round each, five of .36 HE grenade Indian made, One Walkie Talkie wireless set, one Chinese grenade, one MK 2 Grenade, One Tube Launching IA, 14 Tear Smoke Shell , One 38 mm cartridge Anti-Riot with Rubber bullet, One Smoke Shell (Chilli), one Stun Shell (Normal), One Bullet Proof Helmet, two Rice bags, one Cotton cloth mix colour (red and white), four black polythene from Sekmaijin Hangul under Hiyanglam-PS, Kakching District on March 07,"" Manipur police said in a statement.""Two 81mm country made Pumpi motor, two 51 mm country made Pumpi Gun, two country made motor bomb, nine INSAS empty case, seven SLR-empty case, two SBBL-empty case, Cortex wire -8m, one Baofeng set (unserviceable), Telescopic sight with cover from general area of Thawai Kuki village under Litan-PS, Ukhrul District,"" it added.On Saturday, the Kuki Zo council imposed a shutdown and called upon the Centre to ""reconsider its stance to avoid further escalation of tension"".""It is crucial for the central government to address the underlying issues to prevent further unrest and protect public safety. The Kuki-Zo Council urges the government to reconsider its stance to avoid further escalation of tension and violent confrontation,"" it said.""We cannot guarantee free movement of Meiteis across buffer zones and cannot take responsibility for any untoward incidents,"" it added.The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF), a Kuki-Zo body, extended support to the indefinite shutdown called by Kuki Zo Council (KZC) in all areas inhabited by the community in Manipur to protest the crackdown of security forces on demonstrators protesting free movement along all roads in the ethnic strife-torn state.In a statement, ITLF said, ""Yesterday, the Government of India's decision to allow the movement of Meiteis through Kuki-Zo areas led to agitation and protest in Kangpokpi... the security forces used excessive force on the protesters.""Endorsing the indefinite shutdown called in all Kuki-Zo areas, ITLF asked everyone to ""adhere to the shutdown in solidarity"".""We respect everyone who came out to protest yesterday,"" the ITLF said.Manipur Police, in a statement, said 27 security personnel were injured in the attacks by the Kuki protesters who pelted them with stones, and barricaded roads by putting up huge boulders, setting tyres on fire and felling trees.""Amid the protests, there were incidents of firing from amongst the protesters towards the security forces, to which the security forces retaliated,"" the statement said.""Due to heavy pelting of stones, use of catapults and random firing by armed miscreants from amongst the protesters, 27 security forces personnel suffered injuries, including two critical injuries,"" it said.""The security forces showed tremendous restraint while trying to control the unruly and violent mob and used minimum force to control and counter the anti-social elements. During the skirmish, 16 protesters were reportedly injured and one protester succumbed to injuries,"" it said.Security forces clashed with the protestors opposing Amit Shah's ""free movement"" directive and march by the Federation of Civil Society (FOCS), a Meitei body. The demonstrators set fire to several private vehicles while attempting to block a state transport bus traveling from Imphal to Senapati district. They also burned tyres along NH-2 (Imphal-Dimapur highway) and gathered on the roads to obstruct the movement of state government vehicles.""We are just following orders. We have been told to stop the march. If they want to go, they can go in the state buses arranged by the government,"" a policeman said.Police arrested seven members of four banned outfits in separate operations, officials informed. This comes a day after two cadres of the proscribed Kangleipak Communist Party (PWG) were apprehended in Lamphel, Imphal West district, while another member of the same outfit was caught near the gate of Bir Tikendrajit international airport, a senior officer reported.The arrested individuals were identified as Moirangthem Jiban Singh (27), Laishram Tiken Singh (40), and Thoudam Premkumar Singh (38). Authorities also recovered Rs 50,000 from those held in Lamphel. ""These members of the militant group have been identified as Keisham Naocha alias Ningsingba (38) and Ningthoujam Sanjoy (18) and handed over to the local police for necessary legal actions,"" an officer said. Additionally, on Thursday, security forces arrested two members of the banned Kanglei Yaol Kanna Lup (KYKL) near the Lokchao River along the India-Myanmar border in Tengnoupal district.According to the police, fra esh spell of violence began when a Manipur State Transport bus, traveling along the Imphal-Kangpokpi-Senapati route, was targeted by a mob at Gamgiphai in Kangpokpi district. The crowd started pelting the vehicle with stones, prompting security forces to deploy tear gas and use minimal force to disperse the protesters.The protest was also directed against a peace march organized by the Federation of Civil Society (FOCS), a Meitei organization. The procession, which involved over 10 vehicles, was stopped by security forces at Sekmai before it could reach Kangpokpi district. Police stated that the procession was halted because the organizers did not have the necessary permission.On March 1, Union home minister Amit Shah had instructed security forces to ensure free movement of people across all routes in Manipur starting from March 8. He also emphasized that strict action should be taken against those obstructing this movement.This directive was particularly significant, as uninterrupted travel throughout the state had been severely impacted since ethnic violence erupted between two communities in May 2023. The violence resulted in the deaths of over 250 people and displaced thousands.On February 13, the Centre imposed President's rule in Manipur following the resignation of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, which led to political instability in the northeastern state.The Manipur Assembly, which is set to serve until 2027, has been put under suspended animation, as confirmed by a notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs.On February 20, Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla urged the people of the state to voluntarily surrender looted and illegally held weapons within seven days, assuring that no punitive action would be taken against those who returned arms during this period. The deadline was later extended until 4 p.m. on March 6, in response to demands from people in both hill and valley areas for more time.","The state police recovered weapons, ammunition, explosives, and various military-grade equipment during security force operations on March 7.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), ANI reported on Saturday citing sources. The development comes on the same day when foreign secretary Vikram Misri hinted that New Delhi might be considering liberalising tariffs.This mutually beneficial agreement, finalised in February 2025, aims to boost market access, reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and enhance supply chain integration.To achieve the goals of the agreement, both leaders have decided to appoint senior representatives to accelerate negotiations, enhance trade relations and foster economic cooperation, the sources revealed.The BTA is expected to impact various sectors, including goods and services. By increasing market access and reducing barriers, the agreement will facilitate smoother trade flows and create new opportunities for businesses on both sides.A day after Trump claimed that India had agreed to bring down tariffs, foreign secretary Vikram Misri refused to comment on the US president's remark. He, however, added that India in recent years had signed several trade pacts with partners based on tariff liberalisation.""There’s a lot of interest in statements coming out of the United States. I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions… But I would only point you towards the fact that we have in recent times entered into bilateral trade agreements which are based on tariff liberalisation with several partners,"" he said.""There are ongoing discussions with several other partners on these issues now. I think the ongoing discussions should be seen in that context. That is our general approach and it applies to any such engagement we have,” he added.Sources indicate that India is optimistic about resolving the tariff issue with the US in the coming weeks, ideally before the April 2 deadline.This was reflected in the MEA's response on the same, which said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India has already lowered its average applied tariffs for major developed nations, including Australia, UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recently concluded trade agreements.A delegation, led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , had visited Washington from March 3 to 6, for discussions with the US counterpart on the trade agreement. The talks were part of a broader initiative to expand bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, with a focus on key sectors such as energy, defense, and technology.""Commerce and industry minister (Piyush Goyal) was in US and met his counterparts.

According to a report in Dawn, Mir was immediately shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.Mir, a human and arms trafficker, operated under the cover of a mufti (scholar) and was a member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, an Islamic fundamentalist political party.Sources said he was an important conduit linked with ISI-led death squads and played a significant role in the abduction and extrajudicial killing of numerous Baloch youths. He was also instrumental in spreading religious extremism in Balochistan.In March 2016, Jadhav was abducted by a group led by Mullah Omar Irani of Jaish al-Adl from the Iran-Pakistan border and handed over to the Pakistan army through several intermediaries, including Mir. Irani was also killed, along with his two sons, in the same area (Turbat) in Nov 2020, allegedly by ISI.Mir is also suspected to have been gunned down by ISI operatives in what is believed to be an internal conflict that has been brewing for some time. Last week, two others of JUI-F -- Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah -- were shot dead by bike-borne assailants in what the local police described as targeted killings. The security guard of one also sustained bullet injuries. Mir had also survived two attempts on his life last year and had recently restricted his movements. ""He was providing intelligence about Baloch fighters to the Pak army. In 2023, a teacher named Abdul Rauf was murdered over alleged blasphemy in Turbat.

He was intercepted in the Chaman area of Balochistan on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on March 3, 2016. In April 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced Jadhav to death, charging him with involvement in espionage and sabotage activities. India condemned the verdict as a premeditated murder.

The yoga guru accused Trump of threatening poorer nations and attempting to dominate global trade through unfair policies.""There is a new era of intellectual colonisation. Ever since Donald Trump rose to power, he created a new world record of 'tariff terrorism'.

In such a case, India needs to develop... All Indians should unite to build a strong nation and answer all these destructive powers.""His remarks come as India and the US engage in negotiations over a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), aimed at reducing trade barriers and strengthening economic ties. Trump had claimed that India had agreed to significantly cut tariffs on American products, saying, ""India charges us massive tariffs, you can't even sell anything in India, it's almost restrictive... By the way, they have agreed to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.""Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri refrained from commenting on Trump's statements, saying, ""I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions, so it would not be right to get into it.""Commerce minister Piyush Goyal recently visited the US for trade talks, meeting with his American counterparts to discuss the agreement. India has been gradually reducing tariffs for several nations, including Australia, the UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recent trade pacts. Similar negotiations are ongoing with the European Union and the UK.Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs from April 2 has raised concerns about a potential global trade war, with other countries already considering countermeasures. India, while maintaining a cautious approach, has expressed its willingness to deepen trade ties with the US. External affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India's recent decision to lower tariffs on certain products, including bourbon whiskey, wines, and electric vehicles, was viewed as a gesture to ease trade tensions.

Traffic suspended

Traffic between Manipur hills & valley remains suspended

GUWAHTI: Manipur’s restive hills resonated with disquiet on Sunday amid the silence of an indefinite shutdown called by the Kuki-Zo Council in Kangpokpi, Churachandpur, Tengnoupal, Pherzawl and other tribal-dominant areas after weekend clashes with security personnel left a Kuki protester dead and over 20 injured.The shutdown since Saturday night, supported by the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF), was called in protest against the crackdown on Kuki tribals opposed to the resumption of civilian traffic between the hills and the valley after more than 18 months. The Kuki-Zo Council and ITLF are also sticking to their demand for a separate administration for the hill districts.The clashes occurred in Kangpokpi when protesters tried to block vehicular movement between the valley and hills, defying home minister Amit Shah 's recent directive to restore free movement.While no violence was reported on Sunday, traffic between the hills and valley remained suspended. Protesters burned tyres and blocked roads with boulders and makeshift barricades, all of which were cleared by security forces.“The Centre’s decision to allow free movement of Meiteis through the Kuki-Zo area led to the agitation in Kangpokpi. Security forces used excessive force on the protesters… ITLF extends its deepest respects to Lalgouthang Singsit, who sacrificed his life, as well as to everyone who suffered injuries. We respect everyone who came out to protest for the cause of our people yesterday,"" ITLF said. “Govt may take our lives, but they can never take away our freedom and rights,” the forum said, urging the Kuki-Zo community to remain united.Protesters allowed only emergency traffic through the hill districts. Additional security forces were deployed at Gamgiphai, the gateway to Kangpokpi, and other locations in the district where clashes broke out Saturday. Forces also patrolled NH-2 to ensure unrestricted vehicle movement. Manipur Police wrote on X that 27 security personnel were injured in Saturday’s clashes, with two of them in a critical condition.“Security forces showed tremendous restraint while trying to control the unruly and violent mob and used minimum force to control and counter the anti-social elements, including firing by armed miscreants from among the protestors,” the post said.“Further, it is to clarify that claims made in press releases of Kuki-Zo Council and Kuki Students’ Organisation dated March 8, 2025, that security forces were escorting local protesters are totally baseless.”A Manipur State Transport Corporation bus, four LPG containers and three oil tankers were escorted through the Imphal-Bishnupur-Churachandpur and Churachandpur-Bishnupur-Imphal routes. On Saturday, a mob in Kangpokpi district pelted a bus with stones.","Kuki-Zo Council calls indefinite shutdown in Kangpokpi, Churachandpur, Tengnoupal, Pherzawl and other tribal-dominant areas.

CUTTAK: Orissa high court has acquitted a 42-year-old murder convict, out on bail after 14 years in jail, due to insufficient evidence .A bench of justices Sangam Kumar Sahoo and Chittaranjan Dash in its March 7 judgment set aside a 2008 life sentence given to Madan Kanhar by a sessions judge in Phulbani district for the murder of a 20-year-old woman in 2005. In 2008, Kanhar had appealed in HC, which granted him bail in 2019.The woman had gone to collect firewood in a jungle near her village in Phulbani but did not return. Her mother found her dead in the jungle on April 12, 2005, with injuries on the head and other parts of the body. Kanhar, a resident of the same village, was held primarily as the deceased had picked up a quarrel with him a few days ago.“Discrepancies in eyewitness testimony, inconsistencies in discovery of evidence, and the inconclusive forensic findings collectively fail to establish an unbroken chain of circumstances leading solely to the appellant’s guilt,” HC said. According to the bench, “while the postmortem report confirmed the homicidal nature of death, it does not conclusively link the appellant (Kanhar) to the crime”. “The testimony of the supposed eyewitness lacks the sterling quality required for unassailable reliance,” the HC said. The judges said “in the absence of unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence, the benefit of doubt must necessarily go to the appellant, as no conviction can be sustained on mere suspicion or weak circumstantial evidence”.“The administration of justice demands nothing less than proof beyond reasonable doubt, and in its absence, the appellant’s culpability remains unproven,” the bench observed.Kanhar’s advocate Jambeswar Pati said his client had been making a living as an agricultural labourer since being released on bail six years ago.","Madan Kanhar was given a life sentence in 2008 for the murder of a 20-year-old woman.

NEW DELHI: Amid US president Donald Trump’s tariff war against Beijing, the call for duty protection against Chinese dumping is getting louder from domestic producers of polysilicon , ingot and wafers — making up the solar industry ’s upstream segment that provides the building blocks for solar cells and panels.At a meeting with renewable energy ministry officials on March 1, industry representatives pressed for safeguard duty (SGD) on Chinese supplies of these basic inputs, pointing out how such a levy and other incentives had helped India become self-sufficient in module and panel manufacturing.A presentation made by the Indian Solar Manufaturers Association underlined the urgency of steps to boost upstream manufacturing as Chinese dumping could undercut investments being made to expand capacity in line with the government’s solar ambitions. China customs data pegs wafer exports alone to India at $318 million in 2023, marking a surge of 91% over the previous year.Cells and modules from China, Taiwan and Malaysia currently attract 20% SGD, which was first imposed at 25% in July 2018. In July 2019, it was reduced to 20% and further to 15% from January 2020 to July 2020, only to be reinstated at 20% in July 2024.The upstream players also sought protection similar to ALMMS (approved list of models and manufacturers) scheme for cell and module manufacturers mandating locally produced panels in public projects but left polysilicon, ingot and wafer makers at the mercy of Chinese imports.The presentation called for reorientation of government focus towards the capital and energy intensive upstream manufacturing with Import duty exemption on capital goods and raw material for producing polysilicon, ingot and wafers.The wishlist for fiscal incentives included a fresh capital subsidy programme, priority lending and interest subvention and creation of dedicated funds. In addition, other accelerated depreciation on plant and machinery was also suggested.","The call for duty protection against Chinese dumping is getting louder from domestic producers of polysilicon, ingot and wafers.

VIZIANAGARAM : A TDP Lok Sabha member from Andhra Pradesh has pledged to dole out Rs 50,000 for every third child who turns out to be a baby girl in his constituency.Vizianagaram MP K Appala Naidu said he will deposit the money in favour of the newborn girl child in the form of a fixed deposit, which could compound up to Rs 10 lakh by the time she is of marriagable age. “If the third child is a boy, we will give a cow and a calf. Will make a fixed deposit of Rs 50,000 if the third child is a baby girl. The Indian population has to rise,” Appala Naidu said on Sunday.The parliamentarian said he was inspired by the calls given by CM N Chandrababu Naidu to raise the country’s population. During his visit to Delhi in March, Naidu had voiced concerns over the declining population in south India, saying its ageing population poses challenges, whereas states like UP and Bihar have a younger demography. Naidu announced on Saturday that maternity leave will be granted for all women employees irrespective of the number of children they have.Promising to extend this offer to every woman in his constituency, Appala Naidu recalled he was encouraged by several women in politics and life, including his mother, wife, sisters and daughter. Further, he said encouraging women is also the need of the hour as they go through discrimination. According to the MP, he announced this offer during Women's Day celebrations in his constituency.","Vizianagaram MP K Appala Naidu said he will deposit the money in favour of the newborn girl child in the form of a fixed deposit.

KOLLAM: CPM’s state conference on Sunday unanimously re-elected M V Govindan as the party’s secretary of the Kerala unit. Unlike a decade ago, there was no factional dissent in the conference, with all members in the official panels getting elected unopposed.Only those in the good books of CM Pinarayi Vijayan , the de-facto leader of both the govt and the party in Kerala, figured in the panels.Addressing a meeting at the end of the four-day state conference, Vijayan rejected as “far-fetched and unfounded” the criticism against the new pathways suggested by him towards a new Kerala. He said CPM decided to accept string-free private capital long ago. However, the party could pursue the same only now due to lack of a supporting mechanism to attract such large-scale investment in the past.Justifying the proposals he made in the document, Navakeralathinte Puthuvazhikal (New Pathways to a Renewed Kerala), which the state conference adopted without much resistance, Vijayan said the nearly nine years of continuous LDF governance significantly improved the facilities and environment, pivoting on which Kerala can achieve new heights in the coming days. The measures suggested in the document include public-private participation for revival of loss-making PSUs , cess, and differential fees for govt services.“BJP govt at Centre wants to block development activities in Kerala.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin Sunday decided to send senior DMK functionaries to meet chief ministers and senior politicians from seven states, including BJP-governed Odisha, to rally support for his campaign against Centre’s proposed delimitation exercise.At a meeting with DMK MPs, Stalin assigned responsibility for each of the seven states. Tamal Nadu IT minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan will engage with Kerala politicians, while DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi will head a delegation to West Bengal. State PWD minister E V Velu has been tasked with meeting politicians of Andhra Pradesh while industries minister TRB Rajaa will head for Odisha.Similar delegations will be sent to AAP-governed Punjab and Congress-run Telangana and Karnataka.Stalin had last week written to the CMs and other key politicians of these seven states, explaining TN govt’s position against population-based delimitation. Calling it “an unfair exercise”, Stalin had said the Centre’s plan was a “blatant assault on federalism , punishing states that ensured population control and good governance by stripping away our rightful voice in Parliament”.With the Parliament session set to begin on Monday, Stalin has also instructed DMK MPs to raise in the two Houses key issues, including opposition to Hindi imposition, objections to the National Education Policy, and the demand for pending funds for Tamil Nadu.Three resolutions were passed at the DMK meeting at Anna Arivalayam: to safeguard Tamil Nadu’s parliamentary representation by raising the delimitation issue in Parliament, unite all the states that successfully implemented population control measures which were likely to be affected by the delimitation exercise and work with other MPs from the INDIA bloc and other democratic forces to uphold states’ rights in the delimitation process.","Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin has decided to send senior DMK functionaries to meet chief ministers and senior politicians from seven states.

MUMBAI: As the Mahayuti government faces its first budget after the assembly polls, it will have to walk the tightrope between controlling its massive debt and fiscal deficit while continuing its welfare schemes, with polls to local bodies including municipal corporations and gram panchayats due this year.Government could focus on keeping its welfare schemes going while scrutinising and trimming beneficiaries as it has done with its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana . It is already apparent that chances of hiking the Ladki Bahin stipend from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month as promised in the Mahayuti poll manifesto will be unlikely in this budget.With CM Devendra Fadnavis announcing a rise in outlay under Namo Shetkari Samman Nidhi for farmers from Rs 6,000 to Rs 9,000 per year, the budget may account for this. The state’s debt projection for 2024-25 was already Rs 7.8 lakh crore. Before the polls, it had introduced welfare schemes worth a steep Rs 96,000 crore, including the Ladki Bahin Yojana which helped drive its electoral victory.Since then, the state has introduced supplementary budgetary demands for additional expenses outside the budget worth Rs 1.37 lakh crore, the highest ever in Maharashtra.At Rs 1.1 lakh crore by July, the state’s fiscal deficit had spiralled upwards. By Oct 2024, the finance department had warned that the fiscal deficit was estimated at Rs 2 lakh crore and will be impossible to fill.Officials say the state will try and bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of the GSDP, which is required by budgetary management norms. Fadnavis told TOI in the past that the state will not cut welfare or infrastructure spending but will focus on increasing revenue.However, the global slowdown will be a challenge to revenue generation. Fadnavis had said the state would focus on raising finances, including through borrowings, monetisation schemes and annuity schemes or build-operate-transfer schemes for infrastructure projects.","Government could focus on keeping its welfare schemes going while scrutinising and trimming beneficiaries.

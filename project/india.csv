The United States of America has announced the return of over 1,400 looted artifacts worth nearly $10 million to India, according to a press statement by Manhattan district attorney’s office.The stolen antiquities which are being returned include a sandstone sculpture of a Celestial Dancer, stolen from a temple in Madhya Pradesh, in the early 1980s. It was looted and divided in two to make it easier to smuggle and sell.Professionally reassembled, the sculpture was later donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by one of Kapoor’s clients. The Celestial Dancer remained on display at the Met until it was finally seized by the Art Theft Unit (ATU) in 2023.“Today’s repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multi-year, international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of history’s most prolific offenders. HSI New York and our colleagues at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have worked tirelessly with our partners in India and beyond to disrupt and dismantle the smuggling networks and in turn recover these invaluable pieces,” said HSI New York special agent in charge William S Walker in the statement.The recovered pieces were part of multiple ongoing investigations into criminal trafficking networks, including those tied to alleged antiquities trafficker Subhash Kapoor and convicted trafficker Nancy Wiener. The probe has found five individuals guilty.","The United States of America has announced the return of over 1,400 looted artifacts worth nearly $10 million to India.

Supreme Court had later ruled that though ED is free to challenge the withdrawal of the FIR, in absence of a predicate offence, the PMLA probe cannot be continued against the accused.ED then moved Madras high court, which on October 28 ruled that the withdrawal of the corruption case, ""predicate offence"" in ED's parlance, was illegal, and validated ED's case under PMLA while also asking state authorities to revive the corruption case.","Santiago Martin is India's biggest political donor having contributed Rs 1,368 crore through electoral bonds to all parties including DMK.

For a few hours on Friday morning, a cluster of villages in Maoist-hit Dantewada thought it was a miracle.

When they drew up buckets of water, what they got was petrol.News spread like wildlife. Gleeful villagers gathered the oil by the bucketful. The 'happy news' reached the administration as well. Officials were alarmed at the potential of a fire disaster and rushed teams to the villages. Officials of a petroleum PSU also arrived. They found that wells were indeed swimming with petrol.A quick check revealed that owner of a nearby fuel pump was bewildered at losing 14,000-litre petrol and had filed a police complaint, suspecting it was stolen. Officials believe the petrol leaked out of an underground 16,000-litre reservoir.Police have sealed off the wells to ensure there is no accident. Fire tenders have been positioned.

People have been asked not to use inflammable items until an all-clear is given.Dantewada collector in-charge Jayant Nahata said one well was affected but villagers say petrol was found in multiple wells. After preliminary probe, police say the reservoir was cracked and the petrol found its way to the groundwater channels, ending up in wells.

Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers as smog reduces visibility

Despite Delhi's air quality index (AQI) hitting a severe level of 428, Delhi Airport assures passengers that flight operations remain normal. Low visibility procedures are in effect, and travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight updates. The India Meteorological Department predicts stronger winds will improve air quality to a 'very poor' level.

Watch: Ghazipur landfill vanishes! Season's first fog deepens smog in Delhi, lowering visibility

Delhi woke to its first thick fog of the season, reducing visibility to zero in some areas and shrouding landmarks like the Ghazipur landfill. This severely impacted air travel, with flights diverted from Delhi Airport due to near-zero visibility. The fog also aggravated respiratory issues for residents already grappling with 'severe' air quality, as reported by the IMD and CPCB.

BATHINDA: There was little respite in air quality in Punjab on Friday as compared to the previous day — amid visibility at the lowest ebb — even as smog and fog remained comparatively for less time in the morning.The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for fog on Saturday.Though it was less hazy than Thursday, the sun was not visible throughout the day.For most part of the day, the AQI stayed under the ‘poor’ category and ‘moderate’ at times.Zero visibility was recorded at Amritsar and Chandigarh airports till 8.30 am.The visibility was recorded at 10 metres in Patiala, 50 metres in Halwara and Faridkot, 100 metres in Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Ludhiana.The worsening air quality is forcing people to remain indoors which is also impacting the election campaigning in Barnala and Gidderbaha.A number of functionaries, belonging to different political parties, said they had to reach out to people at their doorsteps or business establishments with very few people attending public meetings amid worsening air quality.The activity time in the day has shortened as the day starts after 9am and thick smog or fog starts descending early in the evening especially in the rural and outer areas.Advisories have been issued asking older people to avoid venturing out.Commuters have been asked to travel during the day and reach their destinations early in the evening.","Air quality index (AQI) hits a severe level of 428 in Delhi.

Netflix’s growing sports entertainment strategy



Netflix expands sports partnerships with WWE



As Jake Paul and Mike Tyson face off this Friday, Netflix has its own stakes to consider. This marks the streaming giant’s biggest live sports event yet, with potential impact on future NFL and WWE deals.Streaming live from AT&T Stadium, it will be available to Netflix’s 280 million subscribers at no extra cost. Delayed due to Tyson’s medical emergency, Netflix has kept expectations under wraps, what does this mean for their future in live sports? Keep reading to find out.JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth stands firm in his belief that the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could set a new record as the most-watched boxing match in history. While surpassing Muhammad Ali's iconic bouts, which drew an estimated one billion viewers globally, may be a lofty goal, the 4.6 million viewers from the 2015 Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight might be within reach.Anmuth explains “We believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX’s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,"" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. He also notes that Netflix’s increasing focus on sports entertainment and live events, especially with NFLX’s growing negotiating leverage, will only enhance its reach. (via: Independent)Netflix has already begun utilizing live sports as complementary programming to its popular documentaries and series. A prime example is the three-part documentary series Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson, which has quickly climbed the ranks, securing the second spot among Netflix's most-viewed shows.In addition, the platform’s recent ventures, such as last November’s Netflix Cup pairing Formula 1 drivers with PGA golfers demonstrate its expanding sports portfolio. Their March exhibition match featuring Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz was tied into promotional content for upcoming documentaries. This continued push into live sports is evident, with the NFL even partnering with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader, thanks to the global success of series like Quarterback and Receiver.Also Read: Patriots provide major update on DT Christian Barmore after blood clot diagnosis before Rams matchup Netflix’s sports strategy isn’t stopping with boxing and football. Starting January 5, Netflix will become the home of WWE’s Raw series in select regions, marking a significant milestone in the platform’s sports expansion. The platform will carry WWE events globally, excluding the U.S., including major live events like WrestleMania and SummerSlam.According to media consultant Patrick Crakes, Netflix’s push into live sports is a smart ""dry run"" for handling larger volumes of live events, adding,“It could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.” As Netflix continues to grow its sports entertainment presence, the stakes are high and so are the expectations.","Streaming live from AT&T Stadium, it will be available to Netflix’s 280 million subscribers at no extra cost.

'Batenge to katenge': Has Yogi Adityanath's slogan divided Maharashtra's Mahayuti?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/batenge-to-katenge-has-yogi-adityanaths-slogan-divided-maharashtras-mahayuti/articleshow/115337838.cms,"Left to Right: Devendra Fadnavis, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and Ajit Pawar

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday strongly endorsed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath 's war cry for unity ""batenge ko katenge"" and countered his ally NCP's Ajit Pawar , who has opposed the slogan, while sending out a clear message to some state BJP leaders who have spoken against the UP CM's poll pitch. Interestingly, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refrained from using Yogi's slogan in his election rallies and has instead preferred the pitch ""Ek hain to safe hain"" to drive home the importance of unity.Fadnavis on Friday reacted sharply to Ajit Pawar's remarks and referred to his counterpart's past political association to brush aside his objections. ""For decades, Ajit Pawar has stayed with such ideologies which are anti-Hindu. There is no real secularism amongst those who call themselves as secularists. He has stayed with people for whom opposing Hindutva is secularism. There is no real secularism among those who call themselves secular,"" Fadnavis said in a hard-hitting counter to his ally.""It will take some time for him to understand the mood of the public. These people either did not understand the sentiments of the public or did not understand the statement or they probably wanted to say something else,"" he said.""I don't see anything wrong in Yogi ji's slogan. Look at the history of this country. Jab jab bate hai tab gulam bane hai. Whenever this country was divided into castes, into states, divided into communities society, we became slaves. The country was also divided, and so were the people. That's why if we divide, we will cut. This is the history of this country,"" Fadnavis added.Ajit Pawar had called Yogi's ""batenge to katenge"" slogan inappropriate even as the NCP leader supported PM Modi's unity pitch.""The remark 'batenge to katenge' is inappropriate. People's thinking in UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh is different, but such statements don't work here. Using such words holds no significance in Maharashtra, in my opinion. Maharashtra is the state of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Shivaji Maharaj. People of Maharashtra are different, and they think differently. If anyone leaves the ideology of Shahu, Shivaji, Phule and Ambedkar, then Maharashtra will not spare them,"" the NCP leader had said.""There is nothing wrong with 'ek hain to safe hain' slogan. I don't see any issue here. If we stay together, everyone will prosper,"" he had added.It was not just Ajit Pawar who objected to Yogi's war cry. At least two BJP leaders of Maharashtra - Pankaja Munde and Ashok Chavan - also did not endorse the UP CM's poll pitch. Munde had earlier this week said there was no need for a slogan such as ""batenge to katenge"" in Maharashtra.""Frankly speaking, my politics is different. I won't support it just because I belong to the BJP. My belief is we should work on development. There is no need for such an issue in Maharashtra,"" Pankaja had told reporters on Wednesday.BJP MP and former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan has called the slogan ""batenge to katenge"" not in good taste and irrelevant.""There is no relevance of this (slogan). Slogans are given at election time. This particular slogan is not in good taste and I don't think people will appreciate it. Personally speaking, I am not in favour of such slogans,"" Chavan had said.""Every political functionary has to take a decision after a lot of thinking. We also have to see that nobody's sentiments are hurt,"" the BJP leader added.Adityanath had used the slogan 'batenge to katenge, ek rahenge to nek rahenge' for the first time in August to call for unity as Hindus were targeted in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina-led government.“Nothing can be above the nation. And the nation will be empowered only when we are united. 'Batenge to Katenge'. You are seeing what is happening in Bangladesh. Those mistakes should not be repeated here... 'Batenge to Katenge, Ek Rahenge to Nek Rahenge,” the UP chief minister had said at a public meeting.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister and several other BJP leaders have repeated the slogan frequently during their campaign trail in both Maharashtra and Jharkhand. ""If we are divided, then Ganapati pooja would be attacked, lands would be grabbed under Land Jihad, safety of daughters would be in danger... There is no Love Jihad or Land Jihad in UP today. It was already announced that if anyone hampers the security of our daughters, grabbed the land of government and the poor, then 'Yamraj' would be ready to cut their ticket,"" Adityanath said at a poll rally in Amravati.The strong retort by Fadnavis today targets not just the opposition but also sends a clear message to NCP, which has had an uneasy existence in the Mahayuti after its failure in the Lok Sabha elections. In the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, the Mahayuti could win only 17 out of 48 seats. Ajit Pawar's NCP was the worst performer winning only 1 out of the 4 seats it contested.After the results, the RSS had openly criticised the BJP for joining hands with Ajit Pawar and had attributed this one ""wrong move"" for NDA's drubbing in Lok Sabha elections. An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, had slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda had said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.It is in this light that the rather strong response of Fadnavis against Ajit Pawar on the issue of Yogi's slogan may worry the NCP leadership. In politics, there are no permanent friends or foes. But it is generally unusual for leaders to remind allies of their past to target them when they are on the same side of the divide. More so, Fadnavis reaction could well be a planned warning to the ally or maybe the two leaders are just playing to their galleries and consolidating their supporters.","Devendra Fadnavis on Friday strongly endorsed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's war cry for unity ""batenge ko katenge"" He countered his ally NCP's Ajit Pawar, who has opposed the slogan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refrained from using Yogi's slogan in his election rallies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115340145,imgsize-67532,width-400,resizemode-4/115340145.jpg"

According to reports, a youth had joined the ""pangat (guests sitting and dining on the ground in a row)"". He grew suspicious after he was served too much gravy in his bowl. He dipped a finger into his bowl and couldn't find a single mutton piece. As tempers flew, he asked the person serving the food about it and, on not receiving a satisfactory response, hurled abuse at him and slapped him.This led to a clash between the youth's companions and the caterer, forcing other guests to leave the feast. Some senior cadres and locals intervened to pacify both parties.Later, when reporters contacted the MP at a public meeting of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the district's Majhawan area on Friday to enquire about the party being held despite the model code of conduct being in place, Bind refused to comment. Umashankar Bind, who looks after the MP's office, said, ""As maximum invitees had consumed food, preparations were being made to wind up the feast after 8.30pm. In the meantime, some youths who had been consuming liquor at a country liquor shop entered the venue, which was restricted to limited invitees.""The same youth caused disturbance and fled the scene, he added. According to him, the whereabouts of those youths could not be ascertained from people present at the office.Bind, who won Majhwan assembly seat in the 2022 assembly elections on a Nishad Party ticket, made it to the Lok Sabha by winning Bhadohi as a BJP candidate in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, necessitating a bypoll.BJP has fielded Suchismita Maurya, who had won the 2017 assembly election from there, in the bypoll.","A feast hosted by BJP's Bhadohi MP Vinod Kumar Bind turned into a battleground.

BJP condemns Kanhaiya's remarks

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis , and his wife, Amruta. The remarks, made during a rally in Nagpur on Wednesday, have drawn sharp condemnation from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Kanhaiya, while addressing the crowd, took aim at Fadnavis' recent comments referring to the upcoming elections as a ""Dharamyudh"", suggesting that the protection of religion should be a collective effort. He said that the job of ""saving religion"" should not be reduced to political rhetoric while the Deputy CM’s wife engages in ""making Instagram reels.""""Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that this is a 'Dharamyudh'. This is a good thing. It is our Dharam to protect the democracy and the constitution for which I am standing and giving a speech today. Whichever leader talks about saving religion, you have to ask only one thing to that leader who is giving you speech about saving religion that will your son or daughter join us in this fight to save religion?"" he questioned.""Will this happen that the responsibility of saving the religion will be ours and your children will study in Oxford Cambridge universities. If we want to save religion, let us save it together. It can't be like we save religion and the deputy chief minister's wife makes reels on Instagram. It can't be like that. Everyone will save the religion together,"" Kanhaiya added.The remarks were a direct response to Fadnavis' recent statement during his campaign for Mahayuti candidates, where he had called for a ""Dharma-Yuddha"" to counter what he described as ""vote-jihad"" in the state.The BJP was quick to condemn Kanhaiya Kumar’s comments, with party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla leading the charge. Poonawalla labelled Kanhaiya as a ""Naxali Afzal Guru supporter"" and accused him of disrespecting Marathi women by targeting""How dare you insult a daughter of Maharashtra, Kanhaiya Kumar? Your words are an insult to every Marathi woman,"" Poonawalla wrote on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). ""Amruta Fadnavis is a proud daughter of Maharashtra, and those who use such derogatory language will face the consequences from the people of Maharashtra.""Poonawalla's statement referred to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant's statement who in late October faced backlash for calling Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC ""imported maal"" during the Maharashtra Assembly election campaign. In his defence, Sawant denied mentioning Shaina’s name, clarifying, ""I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here."" He emphasised respect for Shaina, calling her a friend.The Maharashtra assembly elections are set for November 20, with the counting of votes scheduled for November 23. In the 2019 state elections, the BJP secured 105 seats, while the Shiv Sena won 56, and Congress claimed 44 seats, out of 288. However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the MVA coalition saw a strong showing, winning 30 of the 48 available seats, while the Mahayuti could only secure 17.","Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis.

5.6 lakh Indians migrated to rich OECD countries in 2022,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-6-lakh-indians-migrated-to-rich-oecd-countries-in-2022/articleshow/115315069.cms,"Representative photo

Citizenship Trends:

MUMBAI: Each year, Indians continue their journey overseas, with many drawn to rich nations like the US, UK, and Canada — countries within the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that have historically opened doors to them. Whether as new immigrants, international students, or those acquiring citizenship, Indians dominate the charts in immigration flows to OECD nations. However, recent protectionist policies hint that the open path may be narrowing.2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries — a substantial 35% jump over the previous year. India maintained its lead as the top source of new migrants, with China following at 3.2 lakh. Indians made up 6.4% of all new immigrants to OECD countries, while China contributed 3.8%.A notable shift was Russia’s rise in the migration ranks. With 2.6 lakh Russians migrating to OECD nations in 2022, Russia surged from 18th place to displace Romania.The International Migration Outlook 2024, released on Thursday in Paris, detailed these shifts. In 2022, the UK welcomed 1.12 lakh Indians, nearly double the figure from 2021, while 1.25 lakh Indians migrated to the US, marking a 35% increase. Canada, however, saw a dip with 1.18 lakh Indians, an 8% decline from the previous year. In these countries, Indians predominantly migrated through labour pathways, often as principal applicants or as accompanied family members.China, too, resumed significant migration following two years of Covid-related restrictions. In 2022, over three lakh Chinese immigrants to OECD member countries, up 13% from the previous year. Particularly in the US, migration flows from China jumped by 37%, returning to pre-pandemic levels with 68,000 new arrivals.Russia and Romania, which contributed 2.7 lakh new immigrants each, were the next top origin countries. Meanwhile, Türkiye, Israel, and Germany emerged as the primary OECD destinations for Russian migrants. Romanians, on the other hand, largely headed to Germany, Spain, and Italy.Yet, the welcome for new immigrants is visibly less enthusiastic. Under the incoming Trump administration, immigration to the US may face tighter scrutiny, including on work visas. Canada, too, recently announced a planned cut in immigration targets for the next three years, and the UK has introduced protectionist policies, such as raising wage thresholds and reducing the list of shortage occupations.In 2022, over 1.9 lakh Indians took the nationality of an OECD country, marking a 40% increase and securing India’s place as the top origin country for new OECD citizens. This record was largely driven by a threefold increase in Indians acquiring Canadian citizenship, totalling 60,000. The report anticipates a further rise in 2023.Syria ranked second in 2022, with 1.34 lakh nationals gaining OECD citizenship—a 28% increase from 2021—followed by Morocco, with 1.21 lakh Moroccan nationals becoming citizens in Spain, Italy, and France. Mexicans largely acquired American citizenship, in 2022 their numbers dipped slightly.","2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries.

NEW DELHI: Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress government of Himachal Pradesh has rushed to Supreme Court seeking to validate appointment of six parliamentary secretaries based on a 2006 state law that was quashed by high court two days ago for being illegal and unconstitutional.The Sukhu government, facing internal dissension for some time which was reflected in the loss of Congress candidate A M Singhvi after a tie with the BJP candidate in Rajya Sabha election in February, revealed its real apprehension.""The legal consequence would be that six parliamentary secretaries, who are also MLAs, are likely to face disqualification under Article 192 of the Constitution as the protection granted to them from the office of profit norms has been taken away, without adjudication, causing political instability,"" the state government said.It questioned the correctness of HC's November 13 judgment and sought a stay.

Earlier, G77 plus China group, representing over 130 developing countries, had given a similar pitch in the submission, making it clear that anything less than $1.3 trillion annual finance flow from developed to developing countries for climate action may not be acceptable to the Global South.Making the intervention, Naresh Pal Gangwar, environment ministry's additional secretary and India's lead negotiator at C0, also reiterated developing countries' consistent stand on negotiation process and climate finance, indicating that dilution of principles of UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement will not be acceptable to the Global South keeping in view the historical responsibilities of rich nations.","India has asked developed countries to commit to provide and mobilise at least $1.3 trillion every year till 2030 through grants, concessional finance and non- debt-inducing support.

The prosecution submitted that Padheria is a habitual offender and cited a criminal case registered against him in 2017.Padheria, who was arrested by the crime branch from Punjab, was brought to Ahmedabad and produced before a magistrate at a rural court. The investigator sought 14-day custodial interrogation of Padheria, arguing that he is a habitual offender.The remand application mentioned the 2017 FIR registered against him with Bavla police, accusing him of cheating, criminal conspiracy and violation of various sections of the Information Technology Act.It was submitted that because Padheria had worked with the police department for 15 years, he had knowledge of departmental procedures and did not cooperate with the investigation.The prosecutor submitted that the murder weapon and the clothes he was wearing during the crime need to be recovered. Padheria has admitted to possessing one knife, but he is silent about the other, and therefore custodial interrogation is required, the court was told. They also aim to trace his movements by collecting CCTV footage and identify anyone who helped him while he was on the run.Opposing the remand plea, Padheria's counsel argued that the accused was in police custody for two days and the investigators had enough time to interrogate him. The crime took place in a fit of rage and was not a pre-planned act. However, the prosecutor clarified that Padheria had been in custody for only 24 hours after his arrest as he was handed over to Bhopal police by the crime branch on Thursday.","Head constable Virendrasinh Padheria sent to 10-day police remand in connection with the killing of a second-year MICA student, Priyanshu Jain, on November 10.

While waiting lists for organs such as heart, liver and kidney are available centrally, on website of National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), no such list was available for cornea till date.Recently, NOTTO director Dr Anil Kumar has written to all the states/UTs to issue a directive to registered hospitals and eye banks to share the data related to list of patients waiting for cornea transplant, number of cornea donation and transplantation, and number of cornea stored and utilised.Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye. It allows light to enter and performs two-thirds of the focusing tasks. For people suffering from vision loss due to irreparable damage of the tissue, transplant is the only option. It involves replacing a diseased or scarred cornea with cornea donated by a deceased person.Dr Namrata Sharma, a professor of ophthalmology at AIIMS, who is also associated with Eye Bank Association of India, said India needs nearly two lakh corneas per year to treat patients suffering from blindness caused irreparable damage to the tissue.""In 2023-24, only 49,315 corneas were collected of which 27,394 could be used for transplant,"" Dr Sharma said, adding that availability of information related to cornea collection and utilisation would help policymakers to ensure optimum utilisation of tissues collected and equitable distribution as well.The NOTTO has said that eye banks operating across the country should have a minimum 100 collections in a year or they could risk losing the licence to operate.India has about 726 registered eye banks but, govt sources said, only about 200 are operational. ""Many eye banks are opened for govt aid or as a prerequisite to start post-graduate courses in ophthalmology. But they aren't maintained optimally,"" said a source.The latest directive by NOTTO, the nodal agency for allocation and distribution of organs and tissues in the country, states that state authorities should examine the data on eye/cornea collection annually by the registered eye banks and in case of less performance, they can consider issuing a warning notice to the eye bank for augmenting their eye donation activities. ""... otherwise in case of under-performance their renewal may not be considered for the next term,"" the order says.","Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye.

NEW DELHI: In a major shift in policy to regulate manufacture and sale of health supplements in the country, an inter-ministerial committee has suggested that supplements claiming to cure or mitigate any specific disease should be considered a drug and, therefore, come under the purview of Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO).Currently, all such products come under the purview of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The committee, headed by former health secretary Apurva Chandra, has suggested they should be brought under the purview of CDSCO. This would mean more scrutiny of such products before licencing and increased penalty on making false claims about disease-risk reduction.Main reason why many companies transfer some products from medicine or drug category to dietary supplements category is to escape price regulation. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) regulates pricing of drugs and ensures availability of medicines at affordable prices.While NPPA has the authority to monitor and fix prices of drugs, it cannot take any action if the same drug is re-launched as a food supplement. The recommendation to categorise many health supplements as drugs will, therefore, have an impact on pricing of these products as well, officials said.Other steps suggested include a separate provision of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), establishing a dedicated cell for monitoring of advertisements for such products.","An inter-ministerial committee has suggested that supplements claiming to cure or mitigate any specific disease should be considered a drug.

They spoke of uniting the country and its people, but Modiji, BJP, and RSS do just the opposite,"" Rahul said in Mahagama constituency's Mehrama in Godda district of Santhal Parganas.Posing questions to the PM and BJP, Rahul said, ""They won't talk about jobs, unemployment, farmers' unrest, or the plight of Dalits, OBCs, tribals, and other underprivileged communities."" ""Their only agenda is to create divisions among communities, castes, and religions because it's convenient for them to keep people distracted while they work for their billionaire friends like Adani and Ambani,"" Rahul said in his oft-repeated claims.Rahul then went on to cite promises made in Congress's Jharkhand manifesto, including a caste census and removal of the 50% ceiling on reservations. ""We are committed to a caste census in Jharkhand as it will be a game changer for the country, providing a true understanding of its realities. While Modiji will never do it, we will. Additionally, we will increase OBC, ST, and SC reservations, which the BJP government has curtailed in the past. In Jharkhand, the BJP reduced OBC reservation from 27% to 14%, which we will restore. Similarly, ST reservation will be increased from 26% to 28%, and SC reservation from 10% to 12%,"" Rahul added.",Rahul was speaking at his maiden rally in tribal heartland Santhal Pargana for the second phase of the assembly polls on Nov 20.

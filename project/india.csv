Besides being the largest ‘akhara’ in sheer numbers, it is also perhaps the most diverse and is known to have a rich tradition of ‘astra’ (weapons) and ‘shaastra’ (scriptures). It is home to highest number of Naga Sanyasis, Hatha Yogis and Sanyasins. It also embraced newly formed Kinnar Akhara. Many popular spiritual leaders having centres across the world affiliate themselves with it.Daraganj, Prayagraj, UP904 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Kailashanandji MaharajKartikeya SwamiIt is the second largest. Focuses on education besides religion and is known for its educated seersIt is known for having educated seers and is committed to protection of Sanatan Dharma.

Known for extreme discipline.This ‘akhara’ works to promote ethical and religious virtues among people. They visualise a ‘sanyasi’ as one holding ‘mala’ (rosary) in one hand and ‘bhaala’ (spear) in the other. They have taken on several Muslim invaders as well. They do not believe in caste system or Brahminical order and do not appoint Mahamandaleshwars for thisDaraganj, Prayagraj, UP749 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Vishokananda MaharajSage Kapilmuni (believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu)Pioneered the concept of Mandaleshwar. Upholds ecofriendly livingCommitted to spreading the tenets of Sanatan Dharma, this ‘akhara’ propounded the concept of Mahamandaleshwar or spiritual head. The idea was to form ‘mandali’ (or group) to attract the masses and apprise them about the importance and greatness of religion. Their ‘naga sayasis’ also undertake ‘mimansa’ (religious investigation and interpretation). The head of this ‘mandali’ was called ‘mandalishwar’ which eventually came to be known as ‘mandaleshwar’. Head of several ‘mandaleshwars’ was called ‘mahamandaleshwar’. The akhara was the first to appoint a woman ‘mahamandaleshwar’.Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Maharashtra1856 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Balkanand GiriSuryaFosters freedom, promotes discipline and nationalist causeUnlike other ‘akharas’, this one doesn’t follow a protocol. A ‘sanyasi’ on the lowest level of ladder can speak his mind freely. It also doesn’t follow certain fixed practices like Nagar Pravesh. It also picks learned persons committed to Vedic education and promotion of Indian culture from society and academia to appoint them as Mahamandaleshwar.Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi, UP547 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Arun Giri MaharajSuryaPioneers of Naga Sanyasis, first ones to establish their camp in KumbhAawahan Akhara is touted to be the pioneer of Naga Sanyasis. Mahant Gopal Giri said that once Sanyasis entered a war. At that time, Adi Shankaracharya called upon sanyasis of the Atal and Maha Nirvani Akharas to conduct ‘pind-daan’ (a kind of funeral ritual) and stand up for the cause of religion. After the ritual, the sanyasis disrobed themselves (as if they shunned the last layer of consciousness towards the material world). Thereafter they smeared their body with ashes from a funeral pyre, picked a spear and plunged into the battle and won.Girinagar, Bhavanath, Junagadh (Gujarat)1192 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Shri Mat Ram KrishnanandGayatri MataAkhara without Naga Sanyasis, takes up social causes like free education, forestation, and serving cowsThis ‘akhara’ comprises Naishtika Brahmachari or someone who vows to remain celibate and live with their guru until death. Adi Shankaracharya appointed four types of dedicated celibates named Ananda, Chaitanya, Swaroopa, and Prakashaka in the four monasteries he established. Their duties included the study and contemplation of scriptures like the Vedas, Puranas, and Upanishads, as well as performing rituals such as worship and sacrifices. Over time, the main purpose of this tradition became the primary aim of Agni Akhada. Their key objectives include promoting religion, protecting and advancing culture, serving schools, cow shelters, and serve wandering saintsShamlaji Kakchowk Temple, Sambhar Kantha (Gujarat)1784 ADPosition vacantLord HanumanTheir nagas wear only whiteThe ‘akhara’ is known for having maximum number of 850 ‘Khalsas’ (equivalent to Mahamandaleshwars). The naga sadhus of this akhara wear only white but remain prepared to fight for the religion both through ‘shastra’ and ‘shaastra’.

Had contributed to development of constitutionThe seers of this ‘akhara’ stand out because of their unique ‘tilak’’. But besides serving its deity and his devotees, this ‘akhara’ fosters a culture of wrestling and raises professionals. Many of these seers have participated in national-level wrestling competitions and won medals. Shri Mahant Gyan Das Maharaj, who became the president of the Akhara Parishad in 2004, was also a champion in Uttar Pradesh and held several titles.

The ‘akhara’ was founded by Acharya Ramanandacharya. People, including women, of all castes can be a part of this ‘akhara’ and can achieve important positions. Women can rise to become ‘Mahamandaleshwars’ but are not involved in administrative work. Over six lakh seers are associated with this sect across India.1825 ADKrishnanagar, Prayagraj, UPShri Mukhiya Mahant Durgadas (and three other Mukhiyas who head the four directions)Guru ChandradevDoesn’t believe in caste segregation; contributed to freedom movementThis ‘akhara’ follows the core principles of devotion, knowledge, and renunciation and remains committed to study of the Vedas, Vedangas, and Ashtanga Yoga. They run more than 100 ‘ashrams’ across India. One of the ‘ashrams’ of this sect, based in Sultanpur, actively participated in the Indian freedom movement. It is claimed that in Kumbh held in 1920s and 30s, they trained revolutionaries as well.Kankhal, Haridwar, Uttarakhand1846 ADMahant Jagtar MuniGuru ChandracharyaCommitted to serving humanityCommitted to promotion of Sanatan Dharma by serving society, they remain committed to establishing Sanskrit schools, hospitals, temples, and inns for public welfare. Besides major pilgrimage sites, during the Ardh Kumbh or Purna Kumbh festivals, the ‘akhara’ provides free food and accommodation to pilgrims while promoting religious teachings. In times of natural disasters and national crises, the ‘akhara’ actively contributes to maintaining the country’s unity and integrity.

Management of Akharas:

A vibrant kaleidoscope ofwill come alive during Prayagraj Maha Kumbh . This pristine celebration of life & faith will also lay out a Sangam of ‘akharas’. Though this Sanskrit word means a wrestling arena, in its deeper layers, it carries many microcosms.takes a peep into the fascinating world.It was the curse of Durwasa that paved the way for Samudra Manthan and Kumbh traditions. “Once eminent but short-tempered Maharishi Durwasa cursed the Gods and deprived them of their powers. Demons capitalised the opportunity to establish their reign over heaven. Aggrieved gods urged Lord Vishnu to help who said that lost fortunes were lying in deep layers of the ocean and advised for Samudra Manthan to regain them,” says Prof Madan Mohan Pathak, faculty in astrology at Central Sanskrit University, Lucknow citing references from Bhagwat and Vishnu Puranas . “Amrit Kumbh (vessel containing elixir of immortality) was among the 14 gems that surfaced. Desirous gods and demons entered into a tug-of-war over it. Vishnu -- disguised as the enchantress Mohini -- intervened and whisked the Kumbh away. As he took it heavenwards, few drops of Amrit fell in rivers of Haridwar, Ujjain, Nashik and Prayag. Over time, belief that those who bathe in these rivers in a cosmic moment will embrace purity, auspiciousness, and immortality gave birth to Kumbh rituals,” adds Pathak.In Sanskrit, ‘akhara’ means a wrestling arena, but on a closer look – they are an entire microcosm existing inside the protected walls of Mathas that become visible during Maha Kumbh. “Akharas speak for a kind of social order within the ecosystem of a ‘matha’ or ‘ashram’ (an educational premises for seers) that shouldered the responsibility of protecting the traditions of Sanatan Dharma,” explains Rana PB Singh, retired professor in cultural geography at Banaras Hindu University (BHU). Vedic scholar and author Mahant Mithlesh Nandini Sharan of Ayodhya notes that ‘it is tough to trace the exact origin of ‘akharas’ and calls them ‘a living proof of Sanatan tradition’. “Tradition of ‘akharas’ is as old as religion itself. When seers established ‘mathas’, they often faced challenges from demons who disrupted their religious practices and rituals. Therefore, many seers raised a martial wing for protection of Sanatan Dharma. Naturally, those guarding the seers had to be physically fit, and the place where they practised their skill was described as akhara ,” Mahant Mithlesh says adding, “Without Akharas, Kumbh would just be a religious fair.”Virtuous seer Adi Shankaracharya – who anchored consolidation of Sanatan traditions in the 8century when it had been divided into various warring sects – is described as the father of the present form of Kumbh rituals.In ‘A History of Dasnami Naga Sanyasi’, author Jadunath Sarkar notes ten seer groups present in the 8century – namely Giri, Puri, Bharti, Ban, Aranya, Parbat, Sagar, Tirtha, Ashram, and Saraswati – were aligned to four ‘Mathas’ established by Adi ShankaracharyaWhile ‘Puri’, ‘Bharti’ and ‘Saraswati’ branches were attached to Sringeri Matha (South), ‘Ban’ and 'Aranya' orders were lined up with Govardhan Matha in Jagannath Puri (East). The ‘Giri’, ‘Parbat’ and ‘Sagar’ were sent to Joshi Matha (North) while ‘Tirtha’ and ‘Ashram’ branches were assigned to Sarada Math at Dwarka (West). He also marked the jurisdiction and character of each ‘matha’ and connected them in a ritualistic protocol, way of life and even titles.In present times, the seven Shaivite Akharas namely Mahanirvana, Atal, Niranjani, Anand, Juna, Avahan, and Agni belong to the Dasnami order.The 14century saw the birth and rise of Ramanandacharya. Born in Kanyakubja Brahmin family of Varanasi, Ramanda walked the Vaishnava path. An early and key proponent of the Bhakti movement, he is also seen as a social reformer who accepted disciples without discriminating on lines of gender, class or caste. Doyens like Kabir, Ravidas, Bhagat Pipa and so on are dubbed as his disciples who are known to be belonging to the Ramanandi order. Three main akharas of the Kumbh align themselves with Ramanandacharya. In his paper titled, ‘Akhara System in Kumbh Mela: An Epitome of Hindu Mythology’, published in the International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research, HS Bhakuni, a faculty member in the department of history at MB Govt PG College Uttarakhand notes that the Vaishnava sect is grouped into Digambara, Nirmohi and Nirvani. The unique identity of these ‘akharas’ is visible in their flags, rituals and way of dressing. Their naga sanyasis wear white.The remaining three akharas – grouped as Udasin – are linked to Sikhism. The word udasin means neutral or unbiased. Scholars noted that the followers of the udasin order keep Guru or teacher as the supreme being on the thought that one cannot achieve God without the guidance of guru. They also picked ‘service’ as the means of salvation while ditching the elaborate and complex rituals. They came up in the 18century and members associated with them remain committed to service. Within the akharas, they follow religious rituals only to get close to their Guru who would eventually help them sail through.On Mauni Amavasya Snan of independent India’s first Kumbh, held in 1954, an unprecedented crowd of pilgrims reached the Sangam. The religious euphoria lost its bounds, failed the crowd control measures and led to a stampede claiming around 800 lives and leaving over 2,000 people injured. An official probe into the incident led to the formation of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP). Since then, it has been playing an important role in organising Kumbh Melas. Presently, ABAP includes representatives of all 13 akharas and serves as the apex body of monastic orders. It takes important decisions on Kumbh Mela, and addresses matters related to monastic orders. It also solves disputes (if any) between them.Within the larger structure of Juna Akhara, a Maai Baara was created at the turn of the century. Many women ascetics who completed their 12 years penance were ordained in 2013 Kumbh. At that time, women ascetics urged their leaders to replace ‘baara’ with ‘akhara’ as the former meant an enclosure. Thus, Sanyasin Akhara was born.Kinnar Akhara – the sect of transgender community – also came up in the Ujjain Kumbh of 2016. In Kumbh Mela of 2019, some 2,000 transgender monastics and seers participated under the banner of Kinnar Akhara.Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, said that she founded the ‘akhara’ to unite transgenders, sort out their issues, eliminate misconceptions, inform people about their rights besides spreading a message among masses about the position the transgenders hold in Sanatan Dharma. In 2019, they were accepted as part of Juna Akhara.Jadunath Sarkar noted that the four great ‘mathas’ of Dasnami orders have adopted certain rules of affiliation and organisation. Akharas don’t take sanyasis directly. They must first enrol in a ‘Marhi’ (initiation centre). Many marhis combine to form an akhara.Within each order, monks are graded according to their spiritual progress into –Kutichak, Bahudak, Hansa and Paramhansa.A Kutichali ascetic renounces the world to live in a forest. He cannot travel or beg and must survive on unasked donations. Bahudah is the wandering mendicant who cannot stay in a place for more than three days. He collects alms in kind and cannot accept cash.Renunciant Bhakuni must have followed the above for at least 12 years of practice.There is no minimum age to become a sanyasi.With penance relating to control over speech, thoughts and action, sanyasis earn titles like Hansa and Paramhansa and the right to hold the Dand (seen as an embodiment of God) who also have rules and regulations. For instance, an ekdandi seer cannot bow only before their mother and no one else including God.All ‘akharas’ have their own Naga Sadhus and Hatha Yogis as well.A small act of indiscipline may lead to compulsory fast or chanting while a moderate may mean withdrawal of ration supplies. Grievous ones may invite expulsion for a limited time and extreme ones may mean expulsion for life.Versions of the Sannyas Upnishad are used to manage the akharas through spiritual leaders and an administrative unit.The spiritual chief is called ‘Mahamandaleshwar’ who can have a council consisting of ‘Mandaleshwar’ and ‘Mahant’.When Akharas grew in strength, the need for many mahamandaleshwars was felt which paved the way for the overarching Acharya Mahamandaleshwar.The administrative body managing the ‘akhara’ is called ‘panch’ (also linked to Adi Shankaracharya’s Panchyatan Padhyati in which five gods – namely Ganesh, Vishnu, Shiva, Durga and Surya are invoked).The panch comprises five persons running the show with ‘Sabhapati’ as president and mahants as members. Ranks below ‘Mahant’ include ‘Karbaris’, ‘Thanapati’, ‘Sachvis’, ‘Pujaris’, ‘Kotwals’ and ‘Kotharis’ who are elected in Kumbh Mela.","In Sanskrit, ‘akhara’ means a wrestling arena, but on a closer look – they are an entire microcosm existing inside the protected walls of Mathas. ‘Akharas speak for a kind of social order within the ecosystem of a ‘matha’ or ‘ashram’ (an educational premises for seers) that shouldered the responsibility of protecting the traditions of Sanatan Dharma.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117160967,imgsize-2124747,width-400,resizemode-4/117160967.jpg"
Extension in service setback to those in line: Vice president Dhankhar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extension-in-service-setback-to-those-in-line-vice-president-dhankhar/articleshow/117160579.cms,"Photo/ANI

BENGALURU: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday flagged concerns over hiring of retired persons and the trend of govt officials getting extensions in service or a particular post, remarking they are a setback to others in line.Delivering the inaugural address at the 25th National Conference of Chairpersons of State Public Service Commission in Bengaluru, the VP said it defies expectations of many in the queue and is against the doctrine of expectation. He said people devote decades to be in a ""particular groove"" and extensions indicate that some individual is indispensable, though indispensability is a myth. ""Therefore, it lies in the domain of public service commissions at the state and the central levels that when they have a role in such situations, they must be firm,"" the VP said.Dhankhar added that in public service commissions, the appointment cannot be driven by patronage or by favoritism. The public service commission chairman or a member can't be wedded to a particular ideology or an individual as that will be undoing the essence and spirit of the framework of the Constitution, Dhankhar said while speaking at the national conference of chairpersons of state public service commissions in Bengaluru.Terming the trend of post retirement recruitment ""a problem"", he said in some states it has come to be that employees never retire. ""Particularly those in the premium services, they get a number of nomenclatures, this is not good... Any largesse of this kind is antithetical to what was visualised by framers of the Constitution,"" he said.On the issue of paper leaks , Dhankhar said the public service commissions need to curb ""this menace"", which has become an industry. He added that now young applicants have two fears - one is fear of examination and the second, fear of leakage of question papers.Dhankhar also raised concerns over the divisive and polarised political climate calling it far more ""dangerous than climate change"". He added that if bureaucracy gets ingratiated with a particular dispensation, or emasculated, the nation pays a huge price.",Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar flagged concerns over hiring of retired persons and the trend of govt officials getting extensions in service or a particular post.

NEW DELHI: Government will increase the reward amount for Good Samaritans who rush road accident victims to hospitals for immediate medical care to Rs 25,000, five times more than the present reward of Rs 5,000, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday.In a televised conversation with actor Anupam Kher on road safety, Gadkari said he has instructed his road transport ministry to increase the reward amount considering that the current reward is too little for a person who rushes road accident victim/s to a hospital or trauma care centre within the first hour (or golden hour), often crucial in saving someone's life.Though government introduced the provision of reward to encourage people to help road accident victims from Oct 2021, road transport ministry's website defines a Good Samaritan as ""a person who, in good faith, without expectation of payment or reward and without any duty of care or special relationship, voluntarily comes forward to administer immediate assistance or emergency care to a person injured in an accident, or crash, or emergency medical condition, or emergency situation.""The present scheme specifies the procedure for giving reward and a certificate of recognition to ensure that genuine persons get them. There are different levels of verification and endorsements for anyone to get the reward. Moreover, the policy specifies that those who come to the help of victims in a fatal crash are eligible to get these incentives.No data is available in the public domain of how many Good Samaritans have helped save lives and been awarded so far.","Government will increase the reward amount for Good Samaritans who rush road accident victims to hospitals for immediate medical care to Rs 25,000.

Metro Derailment in Chennai: Detailed Report Ordered; Ultrasonic Tests Planned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/detailed-report-ordered-after-metro-derailment/articleshow/117096282.cms,"Chennai: Two weeks after a train derailment in the Washermenpet-Tondiarpet stretch , the commissioner of metro railway safety has sought a detailed report from Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). Additionally, an ultrasonic pulse velocity test is planned across the entire underground network to detect damp or weak spots and prevent future accidents.Preliminary findings suggest that a water pipeline running above the underground metro line may have burst, creating a damp spot on the top of the tunnel and weakening the diaphragm wall, a reinforced concrete barrier to prevent water from seeping in.On Dec 23, concrete on the spot gave in, allowing water mixed with sand to gush into the tunnel. Slush accumulated on the tracks, and the train driver noticed something amiss only after the wheels hit the slush. The driver applied emergency brakes, causing a minor derailment. While no injuries were reported, services on phase I extension line were disrupted for a few hours.An internal team later sealed the breach with grouting and chemicals. This marks the second such incident on the line in two months.Deputy commissioner of railway safety Nitish Kumar Ranjan, based in Bengaluru, said the incident was reported to their office on Jan 6. ""We have sought a report from CMRL and may inspect the site, if necessary, based on their response,"" he said.A CMRL official said that while minimal water seepage could occur, it was rare for sand and water to mix and flow onto tracks, especially in the absence of heavy rainfall. ""Changes in the water table around the tunnel could cause minor water drips, but not a steady flow of slush,"" the official added.To prevent such incidents, CMRL plans to engage an external agency to conduct a comprehensive pulse velocity test, said T Archunan, director (projects), CMRL. This will help identify damp or weak spots that are difficult to detect during routine inspections.","On Dec 23, concrete on the spot gave in, allowing water mixed with sand to gush into the tunnel.

NEW DELHI: Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is unlikely to travel straight to Pakistan after participating in Republic Day celebrations, official sources said Saturday following hectic diplomatic efforts by India to convince Jakarta to not club his India visit with his proposed official travel to Islamabad.India had last year invited Subianto as chief guest for the Republic Day parade but a formal announcement about his visit is still awaited. Amid this delay by India in announcing the name of the chief guest for the Jan 26 celebrations, reports emerged in Pakistan media this week that Subianto will arrive in Islamabad the same day for a three-day visit.TOI first reported Friday that Indian government had raised the issue diplomatically with Jakarta as it found the President's reported plan to fly straight to Islamabad after being honoured by India unacceptable. While R-Day is a special occasion, Indian govt has urged foreign leaders for years now to not mix their travel plans to India with Pakistan even for bilateral visits, maintaining it goes against the grain of dehyphenation that India seeks from them in their ties with the two countries.Official sources said the Indonesian President won't travel to Pakistan from India. Reports emerged Saturday that he might fly to Malaysia from India late on Jan 26 but there was no official confirmation. There has been no official word from Jakarta yet on Subianto's itinerary.It's not clear if the President, in case he does indeed travel to Malaysia, will fly in the opposite direction again to visit Islamabad or shelve his Pakistan visit plans for now. Pakistan's ministers were quoted as saying last week that the ""landmark"" visit would allow Indonesia and Pakistan to take steps to ramp up their economic ties.The proposal for Subianto's visit to Pakistan seems to have emerged from his meeting with Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif on the sidelines of a multilateral event last month.","Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is unlikely to travel straight to Pakistan after participating in Republic Day celebrations, official sources said.

aNEW DELHI: Kerala Police have arrested fifteen people, including a minor, for the alleged rape of a Dalit teenager. Nine of the arrests were made Saturday, following an initial six on Friday. The victim, now 18 and an athlete, told police she was repeatedly assaulted since she was 16. Over 60 individuals are involved, according to her statement.The arrests followed the filing of five FIRs in two Pathanamthitta district police stations. Meanwhile, Police anticipate further arrests. The accused face charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) , the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).According to Pathanamthitta Police quoted by ANI, accused Subin (24), VK Vineeth (30), K Anandu (21), S Sandeep (30), and Sreeni alias S Sudhi (24) are named in a case registered at the Ilavumthitta station. In a separate Pocso case, Achu Anand (21) is also accused. Sudhi, the fifth accused in the first case, is presently in jail in connection with another Pocso case filed by the Pathanamthitta police earlier.The girl reported being abused by sports trainers, fellow athletes, and classmates. A police officer stated, “Preliminary investigation suggested that the girl, who takes part in school level athletic training, was abused by sports trainers, fellow athletes and others.” The assaults reportedly occurred in various locations, including Achankottumala, Chuttippara, and her school.The victim's statement indicates the abuse began when she was 13, initiated by a neighbor. Police are investigating whether she was subjected to gang rape. They are also examining her father's mobile phone records and a diary to identify suspects. Forty individuals have been identified so far.The Pathanamthitta Child Welfare Committee (CWC) revealed the case surfaced during counseling after the victim's teachers reported behavioral changes. The CWC chairman noted the girl has been exploited since the age of 13 and is undergoing psychological counseling. The CWC also discovered potential suspects' phone numbers saved on her father's phone. They believe individuals outside the district may be involved.A special investigation team led by the Pathanamthitta Deputy Superintendent of Police is investigating. Activists and political figures are demanding the arrest of all those involved. CPI(M) politburo member Subhashini Ali posted on X: “The LDF GOVT and its Child Welfare Council have done well in giving the survivor confidence and help. Severe punishment to the guilty.”Meanwhile, the National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the sexual abuse case. NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar directed the commission to support the victim and ensure a thorough investigation. The NCW has demanded an action taken within three days and condemned the crime, urging immediate arrests of all accused. They also called for a fair investigation and necessary medical and psychological support for the victim.","Nine of the arrests were made Saturday, following an initial six on Friday.

IMPHAL: A temporary camp of Assam Rifles was set ablaze in Hongbei village of Manipur's Kamjong district Saturday during protests over what residents described as ""continuous frisking"" and harassment along Imphal-Myanmar road. The paramilitary force conducts counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast and guards the India-Myanmar border .The situation escalated when AR personnel allegedly stopped the transport of timber meant for house construction in a nearby village. Local MLA Leishiyo Keishing, who was present after attending a wedding, intervened. He requested AR to allow the timber transportation. His plea was dismissed. Sources said the residents, including women, gathered in large numbers to demand an end to the frisking operations and the removal of AR personnel from the area inhabited by the Tangkhul Naga community.The protest turned violent when the paramilitary troopers allegedly fired air shots and tear gas shells to disperse the crowd, further enraging the locals. The protesters then destroyed the temporary camp, insisting on the immediate withdrawal of the forces. Kamjong SP Ningsem Vashum confirmed the heightened tensions, saying residents from neighbouring villages had blocked roads to prevent reinforcements from reaching the area.","Assam Rifles camp set ablaze in Manipur's Kamjong district.

The catch? It was all a scam. Instead of a payout, victims found themselves trapped in a web of lies, with nothing to show for their ""fertile"" efforts but a lighter wallet.The suspects, identified as Prince Raj, Bhola Kumar, and Rahul Kumar, are believed to be part of a larger criminal gang. Police recovered six mobile phones from their possession.According to Nawada DSP (Headquarters) Imran Parwej, the arrest followed a complaint filed with the Cyber police station. The suspects had been luring young men with the promise of hefty payments for impregnating women, running the scam from Kauara village under the jurisdiction of Nadriganj police station. The suspects allegedly operated through social media advertisements, offering between Rs 5 to 10 lakh for making childless women pregnant.

CAG: Recommendations of expert panel ignored

NEW DELHI: A CAG report, evaluating performance of Delhi government's regulation and supply of liquor in the national capital between 2017-18 and 2020-21, has observed several irregularities in excise policy and its implementation, similar to the findings of probe carried out by CBI and ED. CAG has thus estimated a loss of Rs 2,027 crore to the exchequer.The report was signed by former CAG GC Murmu in March 2024 and sent to LG and Delhi government. But, it has not been tabled by state government. Sources have confirmed the report's authenticity. CAG pointed out many violations, from award of licenses to wholesalers to appointing retailers and lack of monitoring and distribution of liquors.The report talks about pricing of liquor left at the discretion of manufacturer and wholesalers instead of government. ""This discretion allowed L1 licensee (manufacturer and wholesaler) to manipulate prices of liquor to its own advantage,"" the CAG has said. This led to decline in sales and loss to exchequer. There was no quality control monitoring either in the liquor sold in Delhi.Instead of end-to-end tracking for liquor sale through bar code scanning, the excise department went for post-sale stock reconciliation, undermining inventory tracking and data accuracy. ED and CBI had alleged payoffs of Rs 1,000 crore.The auditor has blamed AAP government and party's top functionaries in ignoring the Cabinet in formulating the new excise policy. ""In violation of Cabinet decision, necessary permissions from the Cabinet/opinion of Lieutenant Governor were not obtained before giving important exemptions/relaxations having revenue implications (in new excise policy for 2021-22),"" CAG has said.CAG further pointed out that the ""recommendations of the expert committee, formed for suggesting changes for formation of new excise policy, were ignored. These changes included grant of wholesale license to private entities instead of state owned wholesale entity, upfront charging of excise duty in the license fees in place of excise duty to be charged per bottle, applicant being allowed to get a maximum of 54 retail vends in place of an individual being allotted a maximum of two vends.""It dramatically surfaced in political circles on Saturday, leading BJP to launch a ferocious attack on AAP. Approached by TOI, sources in the government confirmed its authenticity.The report talks about the pricing of liquor left at the discretion of the manufacturer and wholesalers instead of the government, something which was the focus of CBI's investigation. “This discretion allowed L1 licencee (manufacturer and wholesaler) to manipulate prices of liquor to its own advantage,” CAG has said. This led to a decline in sales and loss to exchequer, the report says, adding that there was no monitoring of quality control either of the liquor sold in the capital.Instead of end-to-end tracking for liquor sale through bar code scanning, the excise department went for post-sale stock reconciliation, undermining inventory tracking and data accuracy, according to the report.The audit also looked into the records of the new excise policy for 2021-22. While ED and CBI in their probe had alleged payoffs of Rs 1,000 crore, CAG in its findings, after evaluation of excise department documents, has claimed the irregularities resulted in a total loss of Rs 2,027 crore.“There was revenue loss of Rs 890 crore to the government as it did not re-tender the surrendered retail licences,” the report has said, in addition to the loss of Rs 941 crore due to exemptions given to zonal licencees.The federal auditor has said that the AAP government overruled the excise department to give waiver of licence fees of Rs 144 crore to zonal licencees on the basis of Covid restrictions (28 Dec 2021 to 27 Jan 2022). A further Rs 27 crore loss was on account of incorrect collection of security deposit from zonal licencees, it said. “These implementation issues of the new policy led to a loss of revenue of approximately Rs 2,002 crore,” the auditor said.The auditor has blamed the AAP government and its top functionaries in ignoring the cabinet in formulating the new excise policy. “In violation of the cabinet decision, necessary permissions from the cabinet/opinion of the lieutenant governor were not obtained before giving important exemptions/relaxations having revenue implications (in the new excise policy for 2021-22),” the auditor has said.The CAG further pointed out that the “recommendations of the expert committee, formed for suggesting changes for formation of new excise policy, were ignored.","The report was signed by former CAG GC Murmu in March 2024.

IMPHAL: An airy classroom bathed in soft daylight, filtered through large windows. The wooden desks and red plastic chairs, neatly arranged in rows, await the lively whispers of curiosity. The image captures the heart of learning, hope and coexistence at Needy Home Academy , undisturbed by the outside world's tumult.Located in Mapao Zingtun village, about 25km north of Imphal, the academy is home to 632 students and 42 teachers from various ethnic backgrounds. The sprawling 30-acre campus — with a four-storey building daubed in mauve at its centrepiece — is an oasis where Meiteis and Kukis, who are otherwise locked in conflict, play, sing, and live together.This residential school is a living embodiment of unity and harmony in Manipur, where the deepening ethnic crisis between Meiteis and Kukis has claimed more than 250 lives and displaced nearly 60,000 people since May 2023.Students and teachers from different communities coexist peacefully. ""Though the number of students drastically dropped after the violence erupted, those who choose to remain live in harmony without any untoward feelings against each other,"" said school principal Themshang Sasa.Chemistry teacher Maikado Moirangthem recalled the initial fear of conflict spilling into the school. ""When the violence broke out, I thought of leaving the school, fearing that we might even fight among ourselves. But our uncle Dr Chance Raman convinced us to stay. Here we are today, living as a big family,"" he said.Founded in 2004 by Tangkhul Naga couple Raman and R Angam, the school aimed to provide modern education infused with moral principles to rural children. The couple, both professors at DM University in Imphal, started the school with 50 students and five teachers, eventually expanding it to offer classes up to class 12 in both arts and science streams.Over the years, the school has grown in reputation, attracting students from surrounding Kuki and Meitei villages. ""We have literally invested 100% of our salary to come up to this level. But the Covid pandemic hit hard, and then the ethnic violence,"" Raman said.Mapao Zingtun, a Tangkhul village with 80 houses, has also distinguished itself by being declared ""intoxicant-free"" following the establishment of the school. ""This place is like a beautiful garden where all kinds of flowers grow amidst the turmoil around us,"" said Moirangthem.His Kuki colleague Ngamkhogin, who has been a warden for 11 years, smiled in agreement. ""We are all here for the cause of imparting education to the students. Why should we fight each other for a cause that does not concern us?"" Moirangthem added, with his colleague Ksh Oken nodding silently.","Needy Home Academy is home to 632 students and 42 teachers from various ethnic backgrounds.

Remember, the Aam Aadmi Party promised to build schools, but instead, liquor shops were opened.

RAIPUR: Two labourers died and six were grievously injured when a high-rise iron-casting structure collapsed at a construction site in Raipur Saturday. Two of the injured were in critical condition.The accident came just two days after a silo collapsed at a smelting plant in Mungeli district. The bodies of an engineer and two more workers were recovered on Saturday from the debris of the silo after a 40-hour rescue operation, taking the death toll in the tragedy to four.Raipur collector Gaurav Singh said the accident occurred at the construction site for a residential complex on VIP Road. Ten labourers had climbed the iron scaffolding around noon to complete the eighth floor's casting and shuttering work. A few labourers were standing at the bottom of the structure when it suddenly came crashing down around 2.30pm.Other workers immediately launched a rescue operation. Police and emergency services also joined in. Raipur collector, SP Lal Umed Singh, municipal commissioner and additional SP also rushed to the spot.Eight injured labourers were rescued and rushed to hospital, where one was declared dead on arrival and another died during treatment. One of the deceased was identified as Rehmat Khan.Around 400-500 labourers - most of them migrants - have been working and living at the site.Witnesses said they heard a loud rumbling noise, 'like an earthquake', and looked up to see the iron structure collapsing.Workers standing on it tumbled down, and the whole structure slammed into those standing underneath.Two labourers atop the structure had a narrow escape as they grabbed the building and clung to it.There was little chance of anyone else being buried, but the debris was being cleared on a war footing, collector Singh said.",Two labourers died and six were grievously injured when a high-rise iron-casting structure collapsed at a construction site in Raipur Saturday.

""When strict measures are taken against traditional drugs, a natural diversion towards chemical drugs occurs. At least 50 illegal labs have been caught across the country. We need to stop this diversion immediately,"" he added.Shah that the Modi govt had changed its approach against drugs since 2019.

Gujarat village shuns kites to let painted storks soar safely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-village-shuns-kites-to-let-painted-storks-soar-safely/articleshow/117159067.cms,"Photo/BCCL

VADODARA: For 16-year-old Mayur Chauhan, Uttarayan is more than just a celebration - it is a tradition inalienable with kite flying. He and his friends used to begin preparations at least 10 days before Jan 14, and by the festival's peak, the skies above his native village Luna, 20 km from Vadodara, would be a battlefield of soaring kites and playful rivalries.Four years ago, however, everything changed when painted storks , which frequented the village in winters, found Luna as their haven. Now, kites no longer clash in the skies here, and jubilant screams of 'kaipo che' (I've cut your kite) have fallen silent. Not just Mayur and his friends, but the majority of villagers have grounded their kites lest the sharp strings slice the delicate necks of painted storks.For Luna, the painted storks are not just feathered visitors - they are family whom the residents fiercely protect. This village with a 2,000-strong population hosts over 300 painted storks every winter. ""I'm passionate about flying kites, but for the last two years, I haven't flown one. I do climb the terrace during Uttarayan, but just to keep an eye on the storks and see to it that the kites don't disturb them,"" said Mayur.Few villagers who can't resist flying kites do so at noon, when the birds usually rest in their nests. The storks have been staying on the trees around a pond in the village for decades, but earlier the residents were not aware of this bird. ""About 10 years ago, we started organising awareness programmes about painted storks in the village and explained to people how we should conserve these birds,"" said Pravin Arya, who runs Society for Jeevrakshak for Animals with his son Rupesh.The villagers soon developed a close bond with the storks, and started looking after them.""About three years ago, a group of men used to sneak into the village at night and hunt the storks for meat. When the villagers got a whiff of it, they formed teams and started night patrolling in areas where the storks nest. Eventually, the hunting stopped,"" said Arya.","The skies above Luna, 20 km from Vadodara, used to be a battlefield of soaring kites and playful rivalries.

'Ayodhya Ram temple a blend of heritage and cutting-edge tech',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayodhya-ram-temple-a-blend-of-heritage-and-cutting-edge-tech/articleshow/117159066.cms,"File photo

(The writer is chairman of the Ayodhya Ram temple construction committee)

The Shri Ram Temple is more than a physical structure, it is a beacon of India's cultural and spiritual heritage . Every element of its construction reflects the dedication, precision, vision and expectation of millions of devotees in the country and abroad. From the careful selection of materials to the integration of advanced engineering techniques, every decision has been guided by the temple's structural stability: to serve as a place of devotion and inspiration for generations to come.The temple's design incorporates features that enhance its cultural and spiritual significance. Intricate carvings on sandstone pillars and walls, traditional motifs, and alignment with celestial principles add profound meaning to its architecture. Construction of Shri Ram Temple in Ayodhya is not just an architectural feat, it is a confluence of faith, history, and modern engineering .This iconic structure, nearing completion by March 2025, symbolises India's spiritual heritage, brought to life by innovative engineering practices and timeless traditions, ensuring its endurance for 1,000 years.The temple's foundation incorporates advanced techniques while respecting the principles of traditional Indian temple construction. At the heart of it lies a 1.5m-thick plain cement concrete (PCC) raft, supported by a roller compacted concrete (RCC) base extending 12-15m deep. This design ensures that temple's weight is evenly distributed, safeguarding stability.Experts from IIT Madras, alongside other leading professionals, meticulously designed the PCC mix to achieve an unprecedented 1,000-year design life. The use of M35-grade concrete, tested for 56-day strength, ensures durability, structural integrity, and resistance to environmental factors.The construction of the massive PCC raft presented unique challenges. The pouring process required careful planning to prevent thermal stress, which could cause cracks. Advance thermal simulations were conducted to predict heat generation during curing - a critical phase when the chemical reaction between cement and water releases heat.Despite these precautions, minor surface cracks of 1mm appeared during the early stages of curing. Experts from IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, CBRI Roorkee, Larsen &Toubro and Tata Consulting Engineers, with guidance from Prof V S Raju and the temple trust construction committee, identified thermal strain as the primary cause. The initial large pour size (27m x 9m x 1.5m) and the heat of hydration were contributing factors.The pour size was reduced to 9m x 9m x 1.5m to limit thermal stress. Optimised curing techniques, including controlled hydration rates and temperature monitoring via embedded sensors, were introduced. Additionally, the PCC raft surface was treated with a special chemical compound to enhance durability and address minor surface irregularities. These interventions resolved the cracking issue and reinforced the engineering rigour behind the project.One of the most distinctive features of the temple is the conscious exclusion of steel and iron from its construction. While steel is commonly used in modern construction, its susceptibility to corrosion posed a challenge for a structure designed for such longevity.Instead, traditional stone interlocking techniques inspired by ancient Indian temple architecture were employed. Massive sandstone blocks were precision-cut and interlocked without metal fasteners. This method, used in heritage structures like the Konark Sun Temple and Brihadeeswara Temple, has stood the test of time. While the foundation and structure draw heavily from traditional methods, the construction process leverages state-of-the-art technology. Advanced tools like 3D modelling and finite element analysis ensured precision and quality. Automated monitoring systems provided real-time data.The construction of the Ayodhya Ram Temple offers valuable lessons for future projects aiming to preserve heritage while embracing technological advancements, sustainability, and engineering innovation. It reminds us of India's ability to blend its rich heritage with cutting-edge technology, creating landmarks that inspire awe and reverence.This temple is not just a place of worship, it is a legacy-a structure that will narrate the story of India's spiritual and engineering achievements for generations to come. It is a tribute to the vision, dedication, and skill of everyone involved in its construction, from architects and engineers to artisans and labourers. When the first rays of sun illuminate temple's intricately carved walls, they will shine upon a structure that embodies the soul of India - a confluence of devotion, tradition, and progress.","Construction of Shri Ram Temple in Ayodhya is not just an architectural feat, it is a confluence of faith, history, and modern engineering.

NEW DELHI: India is now working to finalise a $450 million deal for the export of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to Indonesia, which would make it the second Asean country after the Philippines to buy the precision strike missile with a 290-km range. The proposed deal has been in the works for a long time, with Indonesian defence minister discussing the deal with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh during a visit to New Delhi in July 2020. ""There are some budgetary constraints, but discussions have moved forward towards conclusion of the BrahMos deal now,"" a source said.India has stepped-up discussions on export of BrahMos to other Asean countries after inking a $375 million contract to supply anti-ship coastal missile batteries to Philippines in Jan 2022, with an eye on China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific. Apart from the Brahmos missiles , which have been developed jointly with Russia, India also plans to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25-km, to countries like Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.","India is working to finalise a $450 million deal for the export of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to Indonesia.

"What’s ailing urban India? High cholesterol, low Vitamin D & diabetes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-ailing-urban-india-high-cholesterol-low-vitd-diabetes/articleshow/117156016.cms,"Representative imge

Mumbai: Every fourth urban Indian has elevated levels of cholesterol, every second one has insufficient vitamin D levels, and 8% are anaemic. This unhealthy snapshot of urban Indians emerged from a study analysing test results of 1.5 lakh people who underwent wellness checkups in various metro cities in 2024.These results underline the fact that non-communicable diseases (NCD), which are chronic, have emerged as a public health challenge in India. Previous research studies established that one in every four Indians is at risk of dying from an NCD—be it cancer, stroke, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases. Around 60% of deaths in the country can be attributed to NCDs, according to World Health Organisation.The new findings, which are a part of the Agilus Diagnostics' 2024 Wellness Study, also show that 27% of those studied had high readings of HbA1C — a blood test that measures amount of glucose attached to haemoglobin in red blood cells. Due to high sugar intake and increased consumption of processed food, Indians are at greater risk of NCDs if they also have low physical activity level.According to Dr Deepak Sanghavi from Agilus Diagnostics, ""The wellness study's findings are a stark reminder of how urban lifestyles are impacting health. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can weaken immunity and cognitive function, while thyroid and lipid abnormalities often go unnoticed until they lead to more severe complications like metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular issues.""Senior endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi from Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, concurred, stating that it's now established that one in three Indians has diabetes and an equal number have dyslipidemia or elevated levels of cholesterol.The medical thought on vitamin D has, however, changed, he said. ""It's now not advisable for all to take vitamin D supplements every year. Only those with a vitamin D of less than 10 nanograms per milliliter need to take it,"" said Dr Joshi. Diet improvement should be adequate for those with a vitamin D count above 20, while corrective action is needed for those with a count between 10 and 20 if they have some symptoms of poor bone health or low immunity.""Vitamin D levels among Indians are hit by a 3-tier effect: There is too much smog to allow sun rays to reach the ground, cities are concrete jungles that don't allow sunshine indoors, Indians have higher levels of melanin which absorbs UV rays needed to synthesise vitamin D,"" he said.The way to beat NCDs, he said, is to maintain an appropriate diet, exercise, and sleep of seven hours a day.","Every second urban Indian has insufficient vitamin D levels, and 8% are anaemic.

AGRA: Juna akhara , the largest Hindu monastic order in India, has expelled mahant Kaushal Giri for seven years after he accepted a 13-year-old girl as ""donation"" from her family and initiated her as a sadhvi (monk) before the Kumbh Mela 's first bathing ritual. The akhara's senior office bearers said the girl was returned to her family in Agra on Friday evening and they have now set a minimum age limit of 22 years for initiating women as sanyasins.Giri, however, claimed that the girl's father willingly offered his daughter to the Akhara, citing her desire to renounce worldly life. ""Her parents had no objections. After completing the Dharmadhwaja and Pindadaana rituals, she would formally embrace sainthood,"" Giri said.The incident sparked objections from top saints and a meeting of senior Akhara officials, including patron saint Srimahant Giri, spokesperson Narayan Giri, fair in-charge Mohan Bharti, and others, was convened to address the issue. They unanimously decided to expel Giri for violating ""ethical and legal"" norms.""The girl is a minor, and this was unacceptable. We decided that she should be sent back home. While we will adopt an abandoned infant if found, we will not induct women under 22 years of age under normal circumstances. The age limit ensures that a girl seeking sainthood is mature enough to make an informed decision. Children cannot be housed in our camps, and we have requested the authorities concerned to intervene and ensure such incidents do not happen again,"" spokesperson Narayan Giri said.An Akhada official said that according to the rules, a minor's parents must first provide an initial consent document for her to become a sanyasin. After six months, a final consent document is required, along with the minor's consent, to ensure that the decision is not made impulsively or in anger.The girl's father, who owns a sweets shop in Agra, brought her and her sister to Prayagraj on Dec 26, where they assisted in camp services under Giri's guidance at the Juna Akhara camp in Sector 20. Their relatives said their devotion to Giri began over three years ago, and they trusted him completely.The girl's mother, a housemaker, said their association with Giri started when he conducted religious discourses at the Kali Maa temple in their village. ""His narration of the Bhagavad Gita influenced us deeply, and we decided to attend the Maha Kumbh because of our devotion to him,"" she said.However, the girl's grandfather, 65-year-old Rohtan Singh Dhakre, opposed the decision. ""She is not of appropriate age for this. We were unaware of her joining the Akhara and only found out when the media came to our home,"" he said. Her grandmother, Radha Devi, added, ""She does not live with us, so we were not informed.""Child rights activist Naresh Paras also condemned the incident, labelling a violation of the Juvenile Justice Act . ""A child is not a commodity to be donated. Every child aged six to 14 is entitled to free and compulsory education under the Right to Education Act. This action breaches her fundamental rights,"" Paras said.Paras has written to the chief justice of the Allahabad high court and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), urging immediate intervention. He added that no Akhara is authorised to accept minors, as they are neither registered educational institutions nor compliant with child protection laws. ""If a child is left by their parents, they must be produced before the child welfare committee. The consent of a minor is legally invalid,"" he said."," mahant Kaushal Giri accepted 13-year-old girl as ""donation"" from her family.

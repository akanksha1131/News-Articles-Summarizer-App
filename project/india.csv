NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday offered new insights into Operation Sindoor , describing how India successfully thwarted Pakistan’s use of drones and loitering munitions without sustaining any damage.Speaking at a defence workshop in Delhi, Chauhan said, “During Operation Sindoor, on 10th May, Pakistan used unarmed drones and loitering munitions. None of them inflicted any damage to the Indian military or civil infrastructure. Most were neutralised through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means, and some were even recovered in almost intact condition.”Operation Sindoor was India’s military response to the Pahalgam terror attack and involved airstrikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). India also repelled subsequent aggression and targeted Pakistani airbases.Chauhan also addressed the strategic use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the need to develop indigenous counter-drone technologies.“When we talk about drones, what do you think these are — are they bringing an evolutionary change or a revolutionary change in warfare?” he said. “I think their development is evolutionary and their employment has been very revolutionary in warfare.As the realisation of their deployment and scope increased, the Army started using drones in a revolutionary manner — you have seen this in a number of wars fought by us. ”""Can't rely on imported niche tech crucial for our missions; dependence on foreign tech weakens preparedness,"" the CDS said.Chauhan was speaking at a workshop and exhibition titled ‘Indigenisation of critical components currently being imported from foreign OEMs in the areas of UAV & C-UAS’, organised by the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff and the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies.Highlighting the broader historical shift in warfare, Chauhan added, “Evolutionary changes have made weapons and war fighting equipment smaller, faster, lighter, more efficient, more affordable… We had large, weighty rifles; now they are shorter, lighter, with longer ranges. The same applies to tanks and aircraft — they are now lighter, faster, and offer greater protection.”A defence ministry statement had said the event aims to align with India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision and is expected to produce a strategic policy document focused on indigenisation. Chauhan’s remarks reinforced the urgent need to build indigenous systems suited to Indian terrain.""Recognising the importance of reducing the dependency on OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for critical UAV and C-UAS components, the upcoming workshop-cum-exhibition aims to bring together all relevant stakeholders, including defence experts, policymakers, military leaders, scientists, and private industry, to develop a strategic roadmap for indigenisation,"" the ministry said.",Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan offered new insights into Operation Sindoor.

Varun Mohan education qualifications: How an Indian-origin MIT engineer secured Google’s $2.4 billion AI investment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/varun-mohan-education-qualifications-how-an-indian-origin-mit-engineer-secured-googles-2-4-billion-ai-investment/articleshow/122405531.cms,"A strong academic foundation in Sunnyvale



MIT years: A dual degree and deeper specialisation

Real-world experience across leading tech firms

Founding Windsurf: Where AI meets developer workflows

The $2.4 billion deal with Google

In July 2025, Google signed a $2.4 billion deal for a nonexclusive licence to the technologies developed by Windsurf, a cutting-edge AI startup co-founded by Varun Mohan. Along with the deal, Mohan and several core members of his team joined Google DeepMind, marking one of the most high-profile movements in the AI talent landscape this year. The agreement not only represents a major financial milestone, but also signals Google’s strategic push to integrate advanced AI development tools into its global software ecosystem.A landmark agreement has validated Windsurf's AI-powered software development and brought global recognition to Mohan's achievements in the technology sector. Mohan's journey began as a mathematics Olympiad participant during his high school years, leading to his education at MIT as an engineer. He later established himself as an AI entrepreneur, combining his technical expertise with innovative business leadership.Born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, Mohan is the son of Indian-origin parents who instilled in him the value of rigorous learning from an early age. He attended The Harker School in San Jose, a school known for nurturing bright minds in science and technology. Here, he developed a reputation as a math and computing Olympiad achiever, excelling in competitions that tested both analytical depth and speed.These early achievements laid the groundwork for his future academic and entrepreneurial success.Mohan was not just performing well academically. He was exploring the boundaries of computational thinking, often creating solutions to problems that went well beyond classroom material.Mohan’s academic promise led him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he enrolled in the prestigious Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) program. Between 2014 and 2017, he completed both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in EECS, a challenging combination that only a few students pursue.At MIT, Mohan chose to specialise in operating systems, distributed computing, machine learning, performance engineering, and algorithms. His graduate work was marked by a strong blend of theory and hands-on experimentation, especially in building systems that could operate at scale. Collaborating with leading faculty and research labs, he also gained early exposure to emerging AI frameworks.This academic foundation was instrumental in shaping his long-term vision: a world where artificial intelligence could assist humans in coding, debugging, and designing software—making development faster, smarter, and more accessible.Following his graduation from MIT, Mohan took a thoughtful approach to building experience. He worked at some of the top technology companies in the world, including LinkedIn, Quora, Nuro, Samsung, and Databricks. Across these roles, he gained practical insights into backend systems, machine learning infrastructure, robotics, and big data platforms.Each job added a new layer to his expertise and deepened his understanding of the challenges developers face when working with large-scale systems. It also reinforced his belief that existing development tools needed a fundamental overhaul—something only AI could deliver. His experience across both startups and tech giants gave him a rare, well-rounded industry perspective.In 2021, Varun Mohan co-founded Codeium, later rebranded as Windsurf, with his MIT classmate and close friend Douglas Chen. Initially focused on GPU virtualisation, the company soon pivoted to its breakthrough idea: an AI-native IDE (Integrated Development Environment) capable of helping developers write, refactor, and understand code using large language models.Under Mohan’s leadership, Windsurf gained enormous traction in a short time. It onboarded over a million developers within four months, raised $243 million in funding, and reached a valuation of $1.25 billion. The platform’s core innovation lay in its use of agentic workflows, where AI tools like Cascade could automate routine development tasks while keeping engineers focused on architecture and strategy. Its open-source contributions and rapid deployment capabilities also made it a favorite among enterprise teams.In one of the biggest AI deals of 2025, Google entered into a $2.4 billion agreement to license Windsurf’s technologies. Though it did not acquire the company outright, Google welcomed Varun Mohan and key members of his team into Google DeepMind. The move positions Mohan at the heart of Google’s efforts to lead the future of AI-assisted software development.The structure of the deal also means Windsurf can continue to operate independently, licensing its tools to other enterprise clients. This hybrid model of licensing plus talent integration is seen as a blueprint for future collaboration between startups and tech giants. Analysts believe this model may become more common as companies seek agility without losing access to top innovation.At the core of Varun Mohan’s success lies a consistent thread: education as a launchpad. Whether it was the competitive environment of Harker School, the academic intensity of MIT, or the deep technical exposure across companies like Databricks and Quora, every stage built upon the last.Mohan’s story shows that deep learning—of the academic kind—is still one of the most powerful tools for shaping the future of technology. While AI may now assist in writing code, it was a strong human foundation in mathematics, systems thinking, and research that enabled Mohan to imagine that future in the first place.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon. Witnesses said the girl briefly walked away from the protest site, doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. CCTV footage showed the student setting herself ablaze, then running toward the principal's office, and later through the campus before being rescued by some students.Panic ensued as students rushed to douse the flames. A male student sustained injuries while trying to save her.The two injured were initially taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital. Given that the girl had sustained over 90% burns, she was shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for advanced treatment.The incident triggered widespread outrage across the campus. Students accused the college administration of gross negligence, alleging that their classmate's earlier complaints were ignored or poorly handled. Although an internal committee was reportedly formed to probe the allegations, students claimed it was biased and lacked transparency.The college principal said the girl had approached him with complaints some days back.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Iran issued a fresh advisory on late Tuesday, urging Indian nationals to avoid non-essential travel to the country, citing recent security-related developments.The advisory, posted late evening on the embassy's official handle on X, also asked those already in Iran to remain vigilant and consider returning using available commercial and ferry services.“In view of the security-related developments over the past several weeks, Indian nationals are advised to carefully consider the evolving situation before undertaking non-essential travel to Iran,” the embassy wrote.“They are also advised to continue to monitor the latest regional developments and follow updated advisories issued by the Indian authorities. Indian nationals already in Iran, and interested in leaving, may avail the commercial flight and ferry options which are available right now.”The warning comes amid heightened tensions in the region following a series of military escalations involving Israel, Iran, and the United States.Last month, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites including Natanz and Fordow. That was followed by Operation Midnight Hammer on June 22, when the US struck multiple Iranian facilities.Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Israel and a US base in Qatar. Later, US President Trump announced a ceasefire, ending the 12-day-long conflict.During the days of conflict, the Indian Embassy had cautioned Indian nationals in Iran to avoid unnecessary movement and follow safety protocols following the regional flare-up. That advisory had come in the wake of multiple explosions and reports of casualties at strategic Iranian locations.Adding to the concerns, the US state department last week launched a public awareness campaign warning Americans, especially those with Iranian heritage, against travel to Iran.US spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the Iranian regime routinely denies consular access to dual nationals and stressed that “it is not safe to travel to Iran,” despite the cessation of bombing.Meanwhile, Indian authorities are continuing to monitor the situation closely. The embassy has urged Indian citizens in Iran to stay connected via its social media platforms and to remain updated through official advisories.","The Indian Embassy in Iran issued a fresh advisory on late Tuesday, urging Indian nationals to avoid non-essential travel to the country.

In the interest of the safety of all passengers and crew, the captain decided to return the aircraft to the bay, and the passengers were offloaded. They were subsequently handed over to the CISF,” said a SpiceJet spokesperson.Also Read: WestJet Emergency Evacuation: Engine fire on plane at Vancouver Airport; 50 passengers use slides","SpiceJet handed over two unruly passengers from a Mumbai-bound flight at Delhi airport on Monday.

BENGALURU: For the first time, India’s astronaut training protocols are being tested and validated in real space conditions, said Air Vice Marshal Anupam Agarwal, former Commandant of the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), which is responsible for selecting and preparing Gaganyaan astronaut-designates.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Agarwal, who was an air commodore when he helmed IAM, described Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ’s (Shux) current mission to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Axiom-4 mission as a critical milestone for India’s human spaceflight efforts.“The entire aerospace medicine process, physiological and psychological selection, is being validated. Not only was he selected well, but also the test standards we developed, the procedures we followed, the psychological selection methods, everything is now being put through a real microgravity test,” Agarwal said.“It is a fulfilling feeling,” he added. IAM’s involvement in astronaut screening goes beyond selection. It collects extensive baseline medical and physiological data before a mission. According to Agarwal, this data is now central to studying how microgravity affects Indian astronauts.“Changes, if any, will be compared with the kind of changes we expect in microgravity. We will study those extensively and try to determine whether our methods for collecting and interpreting baseline data were correct.This will bolster the entire process.”Agarwal said India’s limited past exposure to human spaceflight made missions like Shukla’s especially important. “This is extremely complicated and many developed nations have attempted it and were unable to achieve it. For us, international exposure is the best thing that could happen to this programme.”He added that knowledge about human spaceflight is often not openly shared in literature and can only be gained through experience. “If we want success, we must learn fast, learn accurately and learn what’s relevant.”Looking ahead to Gaganyaan and future Indian space missions, Agarwal said IAM’s role will be critical. “The aerospace medicine specialists are to the human what the engineers are to the spacecraft. They help design the human-use products, the man-machine interface, the safety of crew, acoustic, visual, vibration and acceleration standards, clothing, hygiene products and so on.”Reflecting on his personal experience of selecting India’s first set of astronaut-designates, Agarwal said shortlisting Shukla was a memorable moment for him and his team.“We agreed that we have been extremely lucky in life. The selection process allowed us to meet some of the brightest, most intelligent and professionally sound humans in the country. Shux is one of them. How many people have this opportunity? It was, is and will remain an excellent experience to meet Shux.”","For the first time, India’s astronaut training protocols are being tested and validated in real space conditions.

I-T department tapped many databases to identify likely offenders

NEW DELHI: The income tax department Monday launched a nationwide verification operation targeting individuals and entities facilitating fraudulent claims of deductions and exemptions in I-T returns.The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities but also those related to health insurance and medical expenses (Sec 80D and 80DDB of I-T Act), HRA (Sec 10(13A), interest on education and home loans and for purchase of vehicles (Sec 80E, 80EE and 80EEB), CBDT said.Those under lens are MNC staff, public sector companies, government bodies, academic institutions and entrepreneurs who have claimed deductions without valid justification, it said.The I-T department is now poised to take stern action against continued fraudulent claims, including penalties and prosecution wherever applicable. The ongoing verification exercise across 150 premises is expected to yield crucial evidence, including digital records, that will aid in dismantling networks behind these schemes and ensure accountability,"" the I-T dept said.This action follows a detailed analysis of ""misuse of tax benefits under I-T Act, 1961, often in collusion with professional intermediaries"", it said. It said that investigations have uncovered ""organised rackets"" operated by certain ITR preparers and intermediaries, who have been filing returns claiming fictitious deductions and exemptions. The move is a signal to individuals who take shortcuts and make claims without having evidence of deductions or expenses shown in returns.Tax authorities tapped multiple databases to identify likely offenders. It conducted search and seizures in several states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, and MP, where it found evidence of fraudulent claims.CBDT said the actions follow an outreach conducted programme, asking taxpayers to revise their returns in case discrepancies were noticed. ""As a result, around 40,000 taxpayers have updated their returns in last four months, voluntarily withdrawing false claims amounting to Rs 1,045 crore. However, many remain non-compliant, possibly under influence of masterminds behind these evasion rackets,"" it said.","The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities.

Will bring Pahalgam attackers to justice: External affairs minister S Jaishankar at SCO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-bring-pahalgam-attackers-to-justice-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-at-sco/articleshow/122534936.cms,"EAM Jaishankar with Chinese President Xi Jinping

NEW DELHI: The Pahalgam terrorist attack was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of J&K and sow a religious divide, said external affairs minister S Jaishankar at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting in Tianjin, as his Pakistan counterpart Ishaq Dar looked on.The minister also said that while India will continue to approach new ideas and proposals by the SCO positively for “collective good”, such cooperation must be based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and in accordance with territorial integrity and sovereignty of member states.Recalling the strong condemnation of the April 22 attack by the UN Security Council (UNSC) – where China is a permanent and Pakistan non-permanent member – the minister called upon the Eurasian bloc to take an uncompromising position on terrorism and stressed India will continue to work to bring the perpetrators of the attack to justice.Jaishankar did not name Pakistan as the SCO Charter prohibits member-states from raising hostilities in bilateral relations but, like in his address at the same meeting in Islamabad last year, reminded his counterparts that the Organisation was founded to combat the 3 evils of terrorism, separatism and extremism.“Not surprisingly, they often occur together. Recently, we in India witnessed a graphic example in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025.It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide,’’ said Jaishankar.The foreign ministers’ meeting looked to finalise the agenda, including the final declaration, for the SCO summit that will be hosted by President Xi Jinping in September and in which PM Narendra Modi is expected to participate too. India is pressing for a strong condemnation of terrorism in the declaration, including the Pahalgam attack.“The UNSC, of which some of us are currently members, issued a statement that condemned it in the strongest terms and ‘underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice’. We have since done exactly that and will continue doing so. It is imperative that the SCO, to remain true to its founding objectives, take an uncompromising position on this challenge,’’ added the minister.In a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Monday, Jaishankar had described terrorism as a shared concern, expressing hope that SCO will strongly uphold zero tolerance against terrorism. Combating terrorism and ensuring a terror-free Afghanistan tops India’s priority list in the security-oriented group that is looking to expand cooperation in areas like trade, investment, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.On Afghanistan, Jaishankar said it had been long on the SCO agenda and the compulsions of regional stability were buttressed by India’s longstanding concern for the well-being of the Afghan people. “The international community, particularly SCO members, must therefore step up with development assistance. India, for its part, will certainly do so,” he said.The minister also lamented the lack of assured transit within the SCO space, saying its absence undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas. This again was a dig at Pakistan which continues to block land access to Afghanistan and Central Asia for India.While talking about a world besieged by conflicts, competition and coercion, Jaishankar said that the challenge before SCO is to stabilize the global order, de-risk various dimensions and “through it all, address longstanding challenges that threaten our collective interests”.“The world is today moving towards greater multi-polarity. This is not just in terms of redistribution of national capacities, but also the emergence of effective groupings like SCO. Our ability to contribute to the shaping of world affairs will naturally depend on how well we come together on a shared agenda. That means taking everybody on board,” said Jaishankar.","The Pahalgam terrorist attack was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of J&K and sow a religious divide, said external affairs minister S Jaishankar.

Pak drones fly at higher altitudes near border to avoid detection

AMRITSAR: Operation Sindoor put brakes on drone intrusions for a while but Pakistani smugglers have returned with upgraded tactics and are pushing drones deeper into Indian territory with alarming accuracy.""Post Op Sindoor, there was a temporary lull in cross-border drone intrusions. However, these activities have now resumed with greater precision as Pakistani smugglers are deploying drones that penetrate deeper into Indian territory to drop drugs, arms and ammunition,"" said BSF DIG AK Vidyarthi.According to sources, airdropping earlier was often close to the international border - around a kilometre in - but now Pakistani drones have been observed as far as 2km to 2.5km or even more inside Indian territory.A source said, “During Op Sindoor, priorities were broader — it wasn’t just about curbing cross-border smuggling but more about preventing drone and missile attacks. Smuggling activity from across the border significantly decreased since Pakistani smugglers lacked local operatives on the Indian side to retrieve dropped consignments.”But then, why have cross-border drone intrusions increased after Op Sindoor? As per sources, Pakistani smugglers have equipped themselves with more advanced Chinese drones, while the anti-drone technology deployed on the Indian border has not been as effective as it should be.Currently, drones are often detected only by their sound or spotted visually, after which information is relayed to the anti-drone team. The system is then activated to jam the drone or sever its connection with the operator in Pakistan. Such interceptors should ideally be placed every few kilometres along the international border in Punjab to instantly detect an incoming drone — its direction, speed, altitude and other details — so that it can be jammed and forced into the ground, said sources.Asked why Pakistani smugglers were trying to push drones deeper into Indian territory, sources pointed out BSF had intensified patrolling and tightened security and surveillance after Op Sindoor. By sending consignments deeper into Indian territory, smugglers seek to ensure receivers (collectors) are further away from the international border, minimising the chance of being detected by BSF patrols.Nowadays, Pakistani drone pilots tend to fly drones at higher altitudes near the border to avoid detection. Once the drones cross into Indian territory, they drop to a lower altitude and follow zigzag routes to dodge surveillance. Drones are also intentionally crashed once they reach the drop zone.","Pakistani smugglers are deploying drones that penetrate deeper into Indian territory to drop drugs, arms and ammunition.

NEW DELHI: A house in Bangladesh linked to three generations of Bengal’s most respected literary and cultural figures is being demolished, drawing sharp concern from the Indian government.The building in question is the ancestral home of renowned children’s author and publisher Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, located in Mymensingh city. Upendrakishore was also the father of poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray . The property currently owned by the government of Bangladesh.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) expressed regret over the demolition, noting that the house is a landmark tied closely to the Bangla cultural renaissance. It said the building could instead be restored and converted into a literature museum celebrating shared heritage. The ministry also said that the Government of India would be ready to offer support if such a plan is considered.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also raised concern, saying the demolition of such a memory-filled place was “heartbreaking”. She called upon both the governments of Bangladesh and India to take steps to preserve the historic site, describing the Ray family as “torchbearers” of Bengal’s cultural legacy.“I learnt from media reports that the memory-entwined ancestral house of renowned writer-editor Upendrakishore Roychowdhury in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh city is being demolished.

NEW DELHI: Indicating that an offence cannot be said to be a terror act only if an accused is convicted under an anti-terror law, Supreme Court on Tuesday said creating an atmosphere of fear to prevent people from taking the side of law by killing an army informer is also a terrorist act despite anti-terror law not being invoked in the case.A bench comprising Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti did not agree that the killing of three civilians, including the army informer, in J&K with an AK-47 was not a terror act because the conviction was not secured under an anti-terror law, and expressed its reservation in entertaining a remission plea of a convict who has spent 27 years in jail in the case.Prisoner Ghulam Mohammad Bhat took the stand that he was not convicted under an anti-terror law, but only under the Indian Penal Code for murder, and therefore, his act cannot be termed a terrorist act. The J&K government told SC that a convict undergoing life imprisonment for a terror act was not entitled for remission under state policy.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the prisoner, said Bhat was convicted only under IPC section 302 (murder) and the Arms Act, and not under the then anti-terror legislation TADA. ""Nothing was proved in court to attract TADA provisions. The trial court or the HC never found it to be a terrorist act,"" he said.Additional solicitor general K M Natraj, appearing for the J&K government, submitted that explosive devices, including a weapon to launch grenades, were also reportedly recovered from the scene of incident and it was an act of terror, it was not a simple murder.Agreeing with Gonsalves, the bench said, ""If you want to create fear among people to ensure that no one approaches authorities against the illegal act then it is a terror act and we cannot close our eyes. ""This was done to create havoc to ensure that no one dares to side with the law, then it certainly carries the characteristics of a terrorist act and remission cannot be granted under the policy. You have to challenge the remission policy. ""SC, however, allowed Gonsalves's plea to be allowed to challenge the J&K remission policy within the ongoing proceedings.","Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti did not agree that the killing of three civilians, including the army informer, in J&K with an AK-47 was not a terror act.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up a petitioner who claimed he was being harassed for feeding street dogs in Noida. A bench of justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked him why he couldn’t feed the animals at home.“Why don’t you feed them in your own house? Nobody is stopping you,” the bench said, adding, “Should every lane and every road be kept open just for large-hearted people? There’s space for animals, but no space for humans.”The petitioner’s lawyer argued that his client was following the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023. Under Rule 20, the local residents' body or municipality is responsible for designating feeding spots for community animals. The lawyer said Noida authorities weren’t doing so, unlike Greater Noida.In response, the court suggested opening a shelter at home to feed the dogs. It also raised safety concerns, saying morning walkers and two-wheeler riders were often at risk due to street dogs. “Try going cycling in the morning and see what happens,” the court said.The plea pertains to a March 2025 Allahabad High Court order, in which the petitioner requested the proper implementation of the rules and protection from harassment.The high court had noted the need to protect both animals and people, saying that while stray dogs should be safeguarded under the law, public safety must also be considered. It cited recent attacks by dogs that led to serious injuries and even deaths.The high court had asked authorities to be sensitive to both the petitioner’s concerns and those of the general public. It directed them to ensure proper measures were taken to protect both street dogs and pedestrians.","A bench of justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked him why he couldn’t feed the animals at home.

In July 2023, the court had stayed similar directives by the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which required food sellers and hawkers to publicly display the names of owners and staff.“We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives,” the court had said in that earlier order, adding that vendors may only be asked to disclose the kind of food being served, not the identity of those running the establishments.The current petition alleges that the QR code measure is a “wilful disobedience” of the court's previous ruling. “These steps effectively serve the same unconstitutional end through digital means,” it said, citing media reports confirming that the codes allow customers to access ownership details.It further warns of the “grave and imminent risk” of harm to the rights of affected vendors, particularly those from minority communities. “Vague and overbroad directives deliberately mix up licensing requirements with the unlawful demand to display religious identity, and leave scope for violent enforcement… by vigilante groups and authorities,” the plea added.The petitioners have urged the court to immediately restrain the Uttar Pradesh government from continuing what they call an indirect implementation of a previously blocked policy.",Supreme Court issues notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on a batch of petitions.

HYDERABAD: Sixty-five in-flight engine shutdowns in five years. Eleven ""Mayday"" distress calls from aircraft cockpits in 17 months, excluding the London-bound AI-171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 and a diverted domestic IndiGo flight.These numbers, obtained by TOI through a Right to Information (RTI) query to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), suggest a scary reality: engine malfunctions plague airlines operating in India at the rate of nearly one incident a month.Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's report mentioning fuel cut-off to engines of the crashed AI Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fits the broader pattern of technical failures being handled by experienced pilots, until one crops up that is unmanageable.DGCA data covers all engine shutdowns, including failures during take-off and mid-air. ""A total of 65 incidents related to in-flight shutdown of engines from 2020 to 2025 (till date) were reported across India,"" states the aviation regulator's RTI reply.In all 65 of these instances, pilots were able to safely manoeuvre aircraft to the nearest airport with a single, unaffected engine. Experts attribute engine shutdowns to technical issues ranging from low fuel to turbine malfunction and faulty electronic components.""Primary causes of engine shutdowns include blocked fuel filters, fuel contamination with water, interrupted fuel supply to engines, and foreign objects entering engine stack, all of which can halt flight operations,"" Capt C S Randhawa, president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told TOI.The RTI data shows that between Jan 1, 2024, and May 31, 2025, there were Mayday calls from 11 flights, reporting various technical glitches and seeking emergency landing. Besides AI-171, the list doesn't include a June 19 IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai that had to be redirected to Bengaluru due to congestion at the destination, only for the aircraft to report low fuel around 35km before landing.RTI data reveals that four of the 11 flights issued distress calls due to technical glitches and landed at Hyderabad.Airline Pilots' Association of India states that Mayday signals are exclusively used in life-threatening situations, distinguishing them from ""Pan Pan"" urgency alerts.""Flight crew initiate MAYDAY calls when confronted with critical emergencies such as aircraft fires, engine failures or situations posing imminent danger, necessitating immediate landing or grounding as continued flight becomes unsafe,"" said Anil Rao, secretary of ALPA India.AX Joseph, director of air safety at DGCA, said the aviation regulator was responsible for promulgating ""civil aviation requirements, circulars, aeronautical information circulars and public notices for compliance by the stakeholders to ensure safe operations"".While experts say that in-flight engine shutdowns and Mayday calls aren't uncommon across the world, India's position in global aviation safety standards may not be confidence-inspiring.

An exception was made for influencer Sonali Thakkar, also known as Sonali Aditya Desai, who was permitted to appear virtually due to a physical condition.The bench, according to news agency PTI, observed the matter raised serious concerns and said that any absence by the influencers during the next hearing would be “viewed seriously.” The conduct of the influencers, the court said, was “damaging” and “demoralising,” and called for serious remedial and punitive action to ensure such incidents are not repeated.On the larger issue of social media content and accountability, the court asked Attorney General R Venkataramani to assist in framing guidelines that balance freedom of speech with the rights and dignity of others.Venkataramani sought time to deliberate, noting that enforceability would require detailed consideration.Justice Surya Kant remarked, “There are many free advisors in the market. Ignore them. The guidelines should be in conformity with constitutional principles balancing freedom and the rights and duties of a person. Then we will examine it. We will have open debate on such guidelines. Let all members of the bar and stakeholders including the so-called stakeholders also come and give their viewpoints.”Stressing the importance of dignity, Justice Kant added, “We need to understand that the right to dignity also emanates from the right which someone else is claiming. Article 19 of the Constitution,” he said, “can't overpower Article 21. Suppose a race takes place between Article 19 and 21, Article 21 has to trump Article 19.”He also underlined the need to frame guidelines with utmost caution. Speaking to senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who appeared for the NGO, Justice Kant said, “What we are doing is for posterity. You have to ensure that not a single word is misused by anyone. You have to ensure balance. We have to protect citizens' rights. A framework must be there that the dignity of anyone is not violated.”The top court had issued notices to Raina, Vipul Goyal, Balraj Paramjeet Singh Ghai, Sonali Thakkar, and Nishant Jagdish Tanwar, following a plea filed by NGO Cure SMA Foundation of India, which alleged that the influencers mocked persons with disabilities on a YouTube show.The Supreme Court had earlier, on May 5, warned the five influencers to appear before it or face coercive action. It had also directed the Mumbai Police Commissioner to serve notices to the individuals to ensure their attendance.Raina, along with podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, had been booked by police in Maharashtra and Assam over their comments made on the YouTube show India’s Got Latent. On February 18, the apex court granted interim protection to Allahbadia, but not before making scathing remarks on his conduct.The court had said his comments were “vulgar” and that he had a “dirty mind” which “put society to shame.”Others named in the case in Assam include comedians Ashish Chanchlani, Jaspreet Singh, and Apoorva Makhija. The court is also contemplating whether individual misconduct of this nature should be scrutinised more seriously under constitutional provisions, especially in light of the rights of people with rare disorders and disabilities.“No one,” the court said, “can be allowed to demean anybody under the garb of the right"".","India’s Got Latent host Samay Raina, and four other social media influencers, appeared before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Observing that incarceration does not suspend the right of prisoners to live with human dignity, the Supreme Court has expressed deep concern over the plight of jailed individuals with disabilities and ordered that prisons be made disabled friendly with accessible toilets, ramps and a sensory-safe environment to ensure universal accessibility.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said basic facilities needed for prisoners with disabilities are not being provided and passed a slew of directions to ensure these are made available to them.

Yemen has stayed the execution of nurse

Nimisha Priya

in a murder case, with hope resting on the kin of the deceased agreeing to settle for indemnity

What is Sharia?

What is Blood Money?

Do the guilty walk free after payment of Blood Money?

How many countries follow Sharia Law?

The Centre has told the Supreme Court that payment of blood money is the only option left for saving Kerala-origin nurse Nimisha Priya from the death row in Yemen. Such payments are permitted under Sharia law, the system of jurisprudence practised in many Islamic countries. Here's how it works:Sharia is an Arabic term meaning ""the way"" or ""the correct path"". It embodies rules and principles derived from the Quran, the Islamic holy book that is regarded as the direct word of God, and the Hadith, which represent the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. Sharia, thus, is taken to lay down how Muslims should conduct themselves in their personal lives, social and commercial dealings, and spiritual pursuits.The legal dimension of Sharia is based on interpretations by Islamic jurists through a process known as 'fiqh'. These interpretations ensure the adaptability of precepts of the Sharia to evolving practical realities. So, while Sharia is not synonymous with Islamic law, the latter is derived from the Sharia based on fiqh. Given that interpretations stretch across time and geographies, there can be varying reckoning of Islamic laws based on the Sharia.The concept of retaliation is recognised in Sharia law based on 'qisas', or the principle of 'an eye for an eye'. In the case of murder, it means that the kin of the victim can demand death as punishment for the culprit. However, Sharia also allows for payment of 'diya', that is, compensation or indemnity, to the kin of the victim.Diya is permitted in cases where the kin of the victim waive their right to qisas and agree to settle for blood money. It is a right reserved for the victim's kin and can't be exercised by the state or govt on their behalf. That's why the campaign to save Nimisha Priya is appealing to the kin of the man she has been convicted of killing in Yemen. Their reported insistence on death for her is the hurdle to her being spared the death penalty. Different countries and jurisdictions can prescribe varying quanta of diya depending on the case and the victim.While it spares a culprit death as punishment for taking a life, it is debatable whether acceptance of diya by the victim's family amounts to an official pardon. Some experts say that Islamic jurisprudence has not clearly addressed this point. However, there are instances where a culprit has been taken off death row but kept in prison after the payment of diya. A notable example is the case of Abdul Rahim of Kerala.Convicted in Saudi Arabia for causing the death of his employer's son, Rahim obtained a pardon from the victim's family following the payment of a hefty ransom raised through a massive fundraising effort. However, the case was not closed after this and he was sentenced to 20 years in jail. The verdict took into account time spent in jail. So, while the crime occurred in 2006, and the pardon received in 2018, he is expected to be released only next year.There are about 50 Muslim-majority countries in the world and most are deemed to incorporate elements of Sharia law in their legal systems. Even when such a country has opted for a secular jurisprudence, there can be aspects - like family or personal laws - that are based on the Sharia.But the degree to which Sharia informs legal principles can vary widely. Further, not all Muslim-majority countries may carry out the form of extreme punishments, known as hudud, handed down for crimes such as adultery, rape, homosexuality, theft and murder.","The Centre has told the Supreme Court that payment of blood money is the only option left for saving Kerala-origin nurse Nimisha Priya from the death row in Yemen.

DHAKA: In yet another development showcasing growing social intolerance in Bangladesh, the ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure, the local media reported Tuesday.Located on Horikishore Ray Chowdhury Road in the city, the century-old house was home to Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Upendrakishore, a prominent 19th-century litterateur in his own right besides being a painter and publisher, was the father of celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of filmmaker Satyajit Ray.A semi-concrete structure with several rooms will be built to house a Shishu Academy at the historically-significant building, the country's leading media outlet 'Daily Star' reported. According to reports, the property - which was built by Upendrakishore more than a century ago and previously housed the Mymensingh Shishu Academy - fell into a state of disrepair after years of neglect by the authorities.The newspaper said that local residents have expressed their concerns over the decision, citing that the demolition will wipe out the legacy of the Ray dynasty in Mymensingh city. However, the authorities insist that the demolition is being carried out in accordance with proper procedures and ""necessary approvals"".Officials from Dhaka's Department of Archeology, while agreeing that the property remains an archeological heritage, admitted that their repeated requests to protect the building have gone unheard.Expressing her anguish, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee posted on X: ""The Ray family is one of the most prominent torchbearers of Bengal's culture. Upendrakishore was among the pillars of the Bengal Renaissance. I feel this house is inextricably linked to Bengal's cultural history. I appeal to the Bangladeshi government and to all right-thinking people of that country to preserve this edifice of rich tradition. The Indian government should also intervene.""In New Delhi, MEA expressed deep regret that the property was being demolished. ""Given the building's landmark status symbolising Bangla cultural renaissance, it would be preferable to reconsider the demolition and examine options for its repair and reconstruction as a museum of literature and a symbol of the shared culture of India and Bangladesh,"" said ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, adding that the Indian govt was willing to extend assistance for the purpose.","The ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai and Delhi have posted impressive gains in QS Best Student Cities 2026 rankings, reinforcing India's growing profile in global higher education. Mumbai has re-entered the coveted global top 100, climbing 15 places to secure the 98th position, while Delhi advanced seven spots to 104th.Delhi stood out in the affordability category, being ranked as most affordable student city in the world. Mumbai and Bengaluru also performed strongly on this parameter, being placed within the global top 15.The QS ranking report noted that this is an indication of National Education Policy-2020's (NEP) focus on global engagement and student-centric learning. These gains reflect a strengthening momentum in India's education ecosystem, with its metropolises emerging as increasingly attractive destinations for both domestic and international students.Four Indian metro cities - Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai - featured in the rankings and have improved their positions this year. Bengaluru saw the most dramatic leap, soaring 22 places to rank 108th, while Chennai moved up 12 spots to 128th.In the employer activity indicator, Delhi and Mumbai broke into the world's top 50, underscoring the strong employment prospects for graduates from these cities. Bengaluru made a remarkable 41-place leap in this category to 59th, and Chennai advanced 29 spots, reflecting a growing global recognition of Indian graduates' skill set.CEO of QS Jessica Turner said India's ascent in the rankings was ""more than a statistical bump"" and pointed to a deeper transformation. ""As we approach the fifth anniversary of NEP-2020, its focus on global engagement, quality enhancement and student-centric learning is starting to bear fruit on the international stage,"" she said. ""If this momentum continues, backed by reform and rising global visibility, we're likely to witness an even sharper upward trajectory before the decade is out,"" Turner said.The QS Best Student Cities 2026 ranking assessed 150 cities worldwide. This year's edition highlights a notable shift in the global education landscape - Seoul displaced London to claim the top spot for the first time, while Tokyo held its second position. London, which had dominated the rankings for six consecutive years, slipped to third, largely due to a steep decline in affordability, where it dropped 11 places to rank 137th globally.Where Indian cities scored low was in student mix indicator (number of international students, and how inclusive the city and country is), with Mumbai at the bottom (150), Bengaluru at 148, Chennai at 146 and Delhi at 147.Asia's rise is equally striking in this edition. Alongside Seoul's triumph, Kuala Lumpur entered the global top 15 for the first time at 12th, while Beijing 13th and Taipei 14th achieved their highest-ever positions. Hong Kong also climbed five places to 17th.Over the past decade, India has recorded a 390% increase in number of universities featured in QS World University Rankings. That upward trajectory is now mirrored at the city level, with Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai establishing themselves as globally connected and opportunity-rich destinations for students.","Mumbai and Delhi have posted impressive gains in QS Best Student Cities 2026 rankings.

‘AIMIM’s constitution against

’

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court expressed concern on Tuesday over the encouragement given to regionalism by political parties to seek votes and said this poses as much danger to the unity and integrity of India as the promotion of communal divide in society.""Regional parties openly promote regionalism and seek votes during elections. Is this not against the unity and integrity of the country?"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked while declining to entertain a petition seeking cancellation of the registration of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. It said it would not single out any one political party when many were indulging in communalism.""No doubt the petition raises an important issue. But this can only be gone into when a neutral petition is filed without accusing a single party,"" the bench said and gave liberty to the petitioner to file a neutral petition raising the larger issues relating to electoral reforms.However, it said a conjoint reading of the clauses of the AIMIM's constitution does not show there is anything which runs contrary to the Constitution of India.""If a religious law is protected by the Constitution, then a political party has the right to propagate that,"" the court said.It said if a candidate of a party, which conforms to the standards set by the Constitution and Representation of the People Act, seeks votes in the name of religion, then s/he is liable for disqualification.For petitioner Tirupati Narasimha Murari, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said AIMIM’s constitution advocates the cause of the Muslim community alone and has the objective of promotion of Islamic education, commitment to Sharia law, formation of Majlis Shura and prioritisation of employment, education and economic welfare of the Muslim community.“This is against secularism, the basic tenet of the Indian Constitution,” he said.As against this, he argued, the Election Commission would refuse to register a political party with a Hindu name and a constitution that espouses the cause of Hindus and promotes Vedic education.The bench disagreed and said, “If the EC refuses to register such a party, then there are forums to challenge the EC decision.”",Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi declined to entertain a petition seeking cancellation of the registration of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday extended a hearty welcome to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla on his return to Earth after a successful 18-day stay at the International Space Station (ISS), saying “as India’s first astronaut to have visited ISS, Shukla has inspired a billion dreams with his dedication, courage and pioneering spirit”.“I join the nation in welcoming Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla as he returns to Earth from his historic mission to Space. It marks another milestone towards our own Human Space Flight Mission -- Gaganyaan,” the PM posted on X.When Shukla had talked to Modi from ISS some days back, the PM advised him to learn as much as possible during the Axiom-4 mission, so that the experience could be used for the Gagayaan mission. Shukla had conducted seven Isro-specific microgravity experiments and several others with the Axiom-4 mission crew members.It was Modi who laid the foundation for India’s first trip to ISS, after he met then US President Joe Biden in the White House during a state visit in 2024, with the two countries subsequently collaborating to send an Indian astronaut to the orbital station as part of Axiom-4 mission. During that visit, India also signed the Artemis Accords, an initiative undertaken by Nasa to return humans to the Moon.Earlier, it was PM Modi who gave the astronaut wings to Group Captain Shukla and three other IAF pilots — Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan, Group Captain Ajith Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap — and revealed Gaganyaan mission astronauts to the world.On Shukla’s successful return, defence minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Shambhu Dayal Shukla, the father of the astronaut, following his successful return to Earth. ""Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's successful return from the historic Axiom-4 mission is a proud moment for every Indian. He has not just touched space, he has lifted India's aspirations to new heights,"" Singh said on X.As soon as Shukla made a successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean aboard SpaceX 's Crew Dragon, thousands of miles away, his hometown of Lucknow erupted with chants of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" and applause.Shukla's father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, mother Asha Devi and sister Suchi Misra were charged with emotions as the Dragon splashed in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast. “He has been to space and back and we are all over the moon because this mission has its own importance for the country's Gaganyaan programme,"" Shambhu Dayal Shukla said.Shux’s mom Asha Shukla said, ""We are very excited...We are waiting for our son... We are proud that our son wrote his name in history... We will give him a grand welcome...”.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath called the achievement of Shukla, who hails from Lucknow, ""a glorious symbol of courage, dedication and commitment to science"". ""Every Indian, especially the people of Uttar Pradesh, is proud today. India awaits your return with great excitement,"" he added.","PM Narendra Modi extended a hearty welcome to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla on his return to Earth after a successful 18-day stay at the International Space Station.

"In UK, tributes pour in for Fauja Singh after his death in Punjab",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-uk-tributes-pour-in-for-fauja-singh-after-his-death-in-punjab/articleshow/122544141.cms,"File photo: Fauja Singh (Picture credit: Sikhs in the city)

LONDON: Tributes are pouring in from across the UK for Fauja Singh, the oldest marathon runner in the world, who died on Monday after being hit by a car in his Punjab village at the age of 114.Writer and filmmaker Captain Jay Singh-Sohal told TOI: “I met him many times. He was a very inspiring figure who took great pride in doing what he was doing and in maintaining his Sikh identity with a turban and uncut beard, and in turn, he inspired many others. Not only did he inspire people of all ages to be physically active, but he also promoted the Sikh identity and took pride in doing so and showing young Sikhs, in particular, that their religious adherence was not a barrier to achieving great things. ”Fauja Singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older. He quickly became a celebrity.“He was very down-to-earth and humble regardless of his fame. He ate very simply — just daal and rice. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me,” said MP Preet Kaur Gill.MP Tanmanjeet Singh said he would be “sorely missed.”“Despite his extraordinary and record-breaking achievements, he was completely down to earth and incredibly generous with his time,” recalled Hardeep Singh, deputy-director, Network of Sikh Organisations.Nick Bitel, London Marathon Group CEO, said: “Fauja Singh was an incredible, inspirational human being who epitomised the Spirit of the London Marathon. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”Fauja Singh, now British, had been living back in Beas Pind, his birth village near Jalandhar, for the past five years, ever since the pandemic, when the accident happened.He was born in 1911 and had six children. One daughter died during childbirth in the 1980s and soon after that, his wife, Gian Kaur, died, and then his son, Kuldeep, died in an accident in front of him. That led to depression and so he came to the UK to stay with his son, Sukhjinder, and lived in Ilford. “He was a bit bored in an alien country where, at that time, there was not much Punjabi media. He went back to India to his family and then they sent him back to the UK. Then he started doing things for charity, like a 20km walk, and then he saw people running on TV and decided to do a marathon,” explained his British coach Harmander Singh, who met him in November 1999. Harmander trained him in just 11 weeks to run his first marathon, the London Marathon, in 2000, aged 89. Fauja Singh did nine marathons in total, his last one aged 101 in 2012 in London, which he completed in seven hours, 49 minutes.“He raised the profiles of charities and he always said it was the blessings of the beneficiaries of those charities that kept him going,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh liked his celebrity status as he got lots of attention, which kept him going, as many elderly people feel neglected.“He enjoyed the free socialising that came with his status and when he was invited by the former president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, to run the Lahore Marathon, he couldn’t believe that a poor illiterate farmer who had never gone to school was rubbing shoulders with a head of state,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh walked or jogged for 10 miles a day and ate a minimal diet, and was very light in weight. “Some medical students did bone density tests on him and found his left leg had the bone density of a 30-year-old and his right leg had one of a 20-year-old, and his response was, ‘I always knew my left leg was weak’,” Harmander added.His running group “Sikhs In The City”, is raising money for a clubhouse for the route he used to run along which will be named after him. The group is also appealing for anyone whose life he touched to send messages for a memorial book.","Fauja Singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older.

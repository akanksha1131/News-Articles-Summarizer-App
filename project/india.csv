India releases first national lung cancer care guidelines ahead of World Cancer Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-releases-first-national-lung-cancer-care-guidelines-ahead-of-world-cancer-day/articleshow/127900266.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major step towards standardising cancer care, the Centre on Tuesday released India’s first nationally developed, evidence-based guidelines for lung cancer treatment and palliation, aimed at improving early diagnosis, reducing treatment gaps and ensuring patient-centric care across the country.Union health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda released the Lung Cancer Treatment and Palliation: Evidence-Based Guidelines at Kartavya Bhavan on the eve of World Cancer Day. The document outlines 15 evidence-based recommendations covering diagnosis, treatment pathways and palliative care, applicable to both public and private healthcare systems.Officials said the guidelines address wide variations in lung cancer care in India, where late diagnosis remains a major challenge and treatment practices differ sharply across regions. By providing a common clinical framework, the guidelines aim to strengthen decision-making, improve outcomes and ensure consistent standards of care.Nadda said India must develop its own context-specific healthcare solutions rather than rely solely on Western clinical models. He stressed that early detection is one of the biggest hurdles in lung cancer management and called for stronger prevention and screening strategies, particularly among high-risk populations.Developed by experts under the Department of Health Research and the Directorate General of Health Services, the guidelines use internationally accepted scientific methods but are tailored to India’s disease burden and healthcare realities. They place equal emphasis on treatment and palliation, focusing on both survival and quality of life.The guidelines are expected to help standardise care across states, improve access to palliative services and reduce disparities between public and private hospitals. A plain-language summary will also be issued to help patients and caregivers better understand treatment options.Senior health officials and experts involved in drafting the guidelines were present at the release.","The document outlines 15 evidence-based recommendations covering diagnosis, treatment pathways and palliative care.

14 Naxals Neutralized In Sukma And Bijapur As Security Forces Launch Anti-Maoist Operation

NEW DELHI: The year gone by witnessed the neutralisation of 364 Naxals by the security forces, even as 1,022 Maoists were arrested and 2,337 opted for surrender, the home ministry informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.Replying to separate questions on the status of Left-wing extremism (LWE) in the country, junior home minister Nityanand Rai shared that the total districts that reported incidents of Maoist violence fell to 32 in 2025 from 61 in 2019, while the total number of police stations witnessing such incidents declined to 119 from 245 over the same period.He said LWE incidents showed 88% dip from a high of 1,936 in 2010 to 234 in 2025, while civilians and security personnel's deaths in LWE incidents nosedived to 100 in 2025, which is one-tenth of those recorded in 2010.As per records accessed by TOI, the past one year saw the neutralisation of a dozen Maoists, including their No. 1 Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju. Apart from Basavaraju, who was a politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) member, 11 other CC members were killed in 2025 and early 2026. Another five CC members, including Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu who was also in PB, surrendered and joined the mainstream last year.As of now, only 1 PB/CC member and three CC members are alive/active -- Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji, the current No. 1; Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathi; Misir Besra; and Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram. Sources told TOI that Ganpathi and Sangram, both in their late Seventies, have not been active in the recent past.Since 2019, thanks to the upgraded incentives for surrenders by Maoists, as many as 5,880 Maoists, of which 40% (2,337) were in 2025 alone, have eschewed the path of violence and laid down arms. Another 7,409 Maoists have been arrested since 2019. In fact, between Jan 1 and 15 this year, 18 Naxals were arrested and 139 had surrendered.Currently, only 8 districts across three states are categorised as LWE-hit, down from 126 in 2018.The Centre, which has declared a March 31, 2026 deadline to uproot Naxalism from the country, informed the LS that it has released Rs 3,682 crore to LWE-hit states for operational expenditure and training needs of counter-Naxal security personnel, rehabilitation of surrendered LWE cadres and ex-gratia to families of forces and civilians killed in LWE violence. Another Rs 1,761 was sanctioned to LWE states for strengthening their special forces, intelligence units and police stations. Central agencies have been provided Rs 1,224 crore since 2014-15 for setting up security camps in Maoist-infested areas and provisioning helicopters for counter-LWE operations, said Rai.","The year gone by witnessed the neutralisation of 364 Naxals by the security forces. 1,022 Maoists were arrested and 2,337 opted for surrender.

MHA: Reverse migration seen in Arunachal’s ‘vibrant villages’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-reverse-migration-seen-in-arunachals-vibrant-villages/articleshow/127899119.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Indicating a positive outcome of its vibrant villages programme (VVP), which in is first phase unveiled development projects in villages abutting the Indo-China border across five states, the home ministry told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that at least three villages in Arunachal Pradesh have reported reverse migration by their people.""No impact assessment has been carried out (of VVP). However, the state govt of Arunachal Pradesh has informed of people returning to villages in border districts of Kurung Kumey, Dibang Valley and Shi-Yomi,"" junior home minister Nityanand Rai shared with the House.The objective of VVP is to create better living conditions and adequate livelihood opportunities to ensure prosperous and safe borders, control trans-border crime and assimilate the border population with the nation and inculcate them ‘as eyes and ears of the border guarding forces’, crucial for internal security. The development and connectivity boost is essentially aimed at preventing outmigration by the residents of border villages.Rai said that projects or works with an outlay of Rs 3,431 crore were sanctioned by MHA under VVP-I, of which villages of Arunachal Pradesh received the lion's share of Rs 2750 crore for a total 2,082 projects. More than 8,500 activities like awareness drives, service delivery camps, training and capacity building initiatives, health and veterinary camps, fairs and festivals and tourism promotion activities, etc, were undertaken, of which 2,966 were in Arunachal Pradesh, 2,221 in Ladakh, 1,836 in Uttarakhand, 1,016 in Himachal Pradesh and 530 in Sikkim.NEW DELHIRai further shared that VVP-II too was approved on Apr 2, 2025 for the comprehensive development of 1,954 identified villages abutting international borders of 15 states and 2 Union territories. An outlay of Rs 6,839 crore has been okayed till 2028-29 for VVP-II, covering villages in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, J&K, Ladakh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.",Three villages in Arunachal Pradesh have reported reverse migration by their people.

Argument For Lightness

So, your doctor is a man?” he asks, eyes on the road.“Yes,” she shrugs, head wrapped in a scarf.“The oncologist is a man. He was referred to me by my gynaecologist.”“Okay. She must be sure of his credentials then.”“He. My gynaecologist is a man.”“What? You mean he touches you?”₹Questionable questions, awkward puns, well-timed expletives and several unreciprocated high-fives animate ‘Breast of Luck’, a play whose protagonists choose to sing, dance and laugh their way through the grimness of cancer.Co-written and staged by Tannishtha Chatterjee — who was diagnosed with stage IV oligometastatic cancer last year — and Sharib Hashmi , whose wife has beaten mouth cancer four times, the musical comedy, directed by Leena Yadav, opened at the G5A in Mumbai recently to a packed house. The room included Naseeruddin Shah, Dia Mirza, Tanvi Azmi and Divya Dutta, apart from Chatterjee’s doctors and cancer survivors. At the end of the first show, Chatterjee turned to the room and said, “Honestly, I don’t know how I am doing except that I have stopped chasing certainty. ” Shah reassured her: “This is the most cathartic and best thing you could have done for yourself.”To be staged at the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival on Feb 4 to mark World Cancer Day, the script sees opposites distract before they attract.Sheila Roy is a cool, composed classical singer, while Arun Mohan is a goofy divorced stockbroker who punctuates dad jokes with high-fives. When she launches into her riyaaz every morning at 5, he winces and rings her up on the intercom, begging her to stop. Their heated exchanges morph into real-world meetings on a dating app. Just as Roy begins to enjoy Mohan’s company, the story swerves: she is diagnosed with stage IV oligometastatic breast cancer.She pushes Mohan away, convinced love will only expose her vulnerability. He refuses to leave, insisting on staying, his caregiving peppered with relentless puns. That refusal to surrender humour, intimacy or companionship to illness anchors the play’s emotional centre. Often reduced to a serious trope in movies, the Big C finds its funny bone in the drama. “Exactly. That is the USP,” Hashmi says. “Otherwise, it could easily have become a sad story. We chose to see it from a lighter side — with songs, jokes, laughter.”The play draws from a deep personal well. Interspersed through the second half are real hospital visuals — insurance IVRs (interactive voice responses), chemotherapy rooms, and injections. At one point, you watch Chatterjee singing through an injection. “The targeted medicine was extremely painful. But when I sing, those 10 minutes used to pass more quickly,” says Chatterjee, who had invited her friend, a documentary cinematographer, to shoot on the last day of her chemo.Music, laughter and community sustained Chatterjee through the medical journey. Incidentally, Chatterjee — best known for her performances in ‘Dekh Indian Circus’ (2011), ‘Gulaab Gang’ (2013), and ‘Angry Indian Goddesses’ (2015) — was supposed to meet Hashmi of ‘Family Man’ and ‘Filmistaan’ fame on the day her biopsy report arrived. Hashmi had been shooting for her film ‘Full Plate’ and had casually discussed a collaboration.“The day I got my report, I was supposed to meet Sharib for coffee. I almost cancelled,” she recalls. “I was devastated. But I thought if I go home, I’ll have to tell my mother and I’ll feel worse. So I went.”A year before Chatterjee was diagnosed, she had lost her father to cancer. “He died in my arms in the hospital ICU. He was so full of life. When I was diagnosed, my main concern was my mom, who’s 70plus. How would I give this news to her? Because it wasn’t stage one, or stage two, or even stage three — it was stage four.”When she confided in Hashmi, he called his wife Nasreen, who has lived with cancer since 2018. “She gave me a lot of strength,” Chatterjee says. “She said, ‘Look at me. I’ve relapsed four times. I’m here. I’m doing everything.’ After that call, I looked at Sharib and said, let’s write a play for her.”The script took shape during chemotherapy. Rehearsals were scheduled between hospital visits. Improvisations were shaped as much by pain as by laughter. “I was writing while going through treatment. I wanted to laugh constantly. I didn’t want to pull myself down,” says Chatterjee, who found humour in the mundane — doctors clinically debating silicone implants, nurses scolding her and her friends for laughing too loudly in hospital rooms.The rehearsals weren’t easy. “I had, and still have, terrible nerve damage in my shoulder and left arm. Everyone had to be careful while hugging me or touching me because it’s excruciating if it goes beyond a certain range of mobility.”Hashmi relates to Arun Mohan not only as a performer but as a caregiver. “After my wife’s diagnosis, our lives changed completely,” he says. “But she treated cancer like a fever — with courage, humour, incredible strength. We tried to bring that spirit into the play.”Medical professionals echo that sentiment carefully. Breast oncoplastic surgeon Dr Vani Parmar notes that a cancer diagnosis often arrives as a shock, particularly for younger women. “The treatments — radical surgeries, long chemotherapy sessions, hair loss, weakness — lead to immense physical, emotional, social and financial strain, along with a constant fear of recurrence and death,” she says. Changes to appearance, she adds, often trigger anxiety and depression. “‘Chemo brain’, or brain fog, is also part of the territory.”Chatterjee recalls days when she told her doctor she couldn’t do another chemo cycle. “He understood. He knew that in three days, I’d feel differently.” That reassurance — from doctors and fellow survivors — mattered enormously.While psychological counselling is not routinely integrated into many hospitals, it is increasingly being recognised as an essential part of cancer care. Priyadarshini Deo, counsellor at the Centre for Cancer and Palliative Care at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, points to studies showing that humour and movement-based activities can significantly enhance emotional health. “Humour and lightness reduce stress, ease anxiety, improve communication and strengthen relationships, especially with caregivers,” she says.A case for lightness arrives in actor Lisa Ray’s memoir Close to the Bone, in which she recalls the day she was diagnosed with cancer by a “jittery, rabbit-faced doctor”. “He spoke very slowly, pausing for a long time between each word, as if to gauge my reaction. You. Have. Multiple. Myeloma.” The doctor, Ray writes, reminded her of the rabbit in ‘Alice in Wonderland’. “As he kicked me down the hole, he never said the word ‘cancer’. ”“Oh,” Ray replied. “Do you want me to get you some water?”Her response, she writes, might seem strange. “But he did look parched. Also, it never occurred to me that I wouldn’t get better… I was framing it as just another adventure.”Apart from music, what sustained Chatterjee after her diagnosis was community. “I cried alone in my car with my reports,” she says. “My sister told me — you can’t save yourself alone.” Friends video-called her and joked about everything from Trump’s antics to local absurdities. “It helped me sleep. It made me feel light.”Why, we ask her, is cancer so often portrayed in popular culture only through despair and solemnity? “Because it usually comes from an external perspective, not lived experience,” Chatterjee says. “I think there’s a fear — how can I be sensitive (towards the topic)? I was fearless because it’s me.”The play does not trivialise her struggles, including her prolonged insurance battles. Her arguments with an automated voice convey her frustration. “The day my insurance refused me, I was at my lowest. The treatment is excruciatingly expensive. I’m not a commercial actor. I’m an alternative, arthouse actor. I’m not rolling in money. And I have a mother and a daughter to take care of,” says Chatterjee. Her daughter lived with the actor’s sister in the US during treatment.Care for the caregiver, too, is crucial, Dr Parmar reminds us. “There is emotional burnout, financial strain and disrupted routines. Clear communication, shared decision-making and emotional support make the biggest difference.” She urges the integration of psychological and financial support into standard cancer care. “Good healthcare at an affordable cost is a right.”“My doctors told me this isn’t just about cancer,” Chatterjee says. “In any illness, people should watch it — to see how art, music, laughter and community are therapeutic.”The audience response suggests the message has landed. Survivors have cried and laughed in equal measure. Caregivers have recognised themselves. Those who have lost loved ones have found something gentler than grief alone. Hashmi’s wife has seen the play three times. “She loved it,” he says.","‘Breast of Luck’ is a play whose protagonists choose to sing, dance and laugh their way through the grimness of cancer.

HYDERABAD: Telangana police have arrested a man from Maharashtra for murdering one of his three children so that he would be eligible to contest the gram panchayat election. Those with more than two children are barred from contesting local body elections in Maharashtra.Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, who was arrested on Monday, has been accused of drowning his six-year-old daughter, Prachi, in the Nizamsagar canal in Nizamabad on Jan 29. ""Pandurang first had twin daughters, including Prachi,"" a police officer told TOI. ""Later, he had a son too. He decided to kill Prachi to realise his political ambitions.""Officials also arrested the present sarpanch of Kerur, Ganesh Shinde, for allegedly helping Pandurang plan the murder.The killing came to light after police officers from Nizamabad's Bodhan rural police station started investigating the suspicious death of an unknown girl, whose body was found in the Nizamsagar canal. To identify the girl, a constable uploaded a photograph of the body as his status message on WhatsApp and asked people to share leads. The image was also shared with other police stations.Within a few hours police officers from Mukhed taluk in Maharashtra contacted their counterparts in Bodhan and identified the girl as Prachi, barber Pandurang's daughter, who had been missing for a few days.Bodhan police officials then got in touch with Pandurang and found that he was giving inconsistent replies to many of their queries.Suspecting that Pandurang had killed his daughter, police officials tracked his mobile phone's tower locations and found out that he had brought Prachi to Telangana. During interrogation, he allegedly cracked and confessed to killing Prachi.Officials alleged that Ganesh encouraged Pandurang to contest the panchayat elections, due in about six months. However, both realised that Pandurang would be ineligible as a candidate as he had three children.Nizamabad police commissioner P Sai Chaitanya said the duo initially tried to give the girl up for adoption to couples wanting children. ""When the attempt failed, they allegedly conspired to kill Prachi. On Jan 29, Pandurang came to Nizamsagar canal with Prachi and pushed her into the water before returning to his village,"" Sai Chaitanya said.","Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, has been accused of drowning his six-year-old daughter, Prachi, in the Nizamsagar canal in Nizamabad.

Noida: Techies Held for Harassment, Postman in Fake Passport Racket, Power Upgrades Ahead and More





NOIDA: Two software engineers were arrested for allegedly pulling up alongside a family's car in a moving SUV and harassing a woman with lewd gestures, remarks and blown kisses.Police said the incident occurred on Saturday night as the Greater Noida West family — a man, his wife and child — drove towards Sector 18.Trouble began near Parthala roundabout, where a red MG Hector started following their vehicle.As the SUV drew level, its occupants allegedly rolled down a window and began making obscene gestures and inappropriate signals at the man's wife, who was seated in the rear seat.The two accused, police said, tried to force the woman's attention by waving, shouting and blowing kisses in their direction.Sensing the seriousness of what was happening, the man recorded a video from inside his car. Soon after, the SUV sped away, he alleged.On Sunday, the man posted the clip of the incident on X, tagging UP Police and the chief minister, and demanding strict action.Police said that the vehicle number visible in the video became the key lead.A case was subsequently registered against unknown persons, and police teams began scanning CCTV footage from nearby areas to track the SUV's route.A team from Phase-3 police station later traced the two accused to Sector 135 and arrested them on Sunday evening.They were identified as Amit Kumar of Azamgarh and Abhishek of Mainpuri. Both of the accused live in a rented accommodation at JVS Society in Sector 135 and work as engineers at a Noida-based IT company.The MG Hector, bearing registration number UP 75 AH 3565, was seized.During interrogation, police said, the men admitted they had too much to drink at a party earlier that evening and were roaming the city when they harassed the family.""Further legal proceedings are underway,"" police officials said.According to police sources, the two showed cops a video in which they appeared to blow kisses towards the child in the car.","Two software engineers were arrested for allegedly pulling up alongside a family's car in a moving SUV and harassing a woman with lewd gestures, remarks and blown kisses.

Adani Defence & Aerospace and Leonardo Helicopters sign an MoU in the presence of director of Adani Defence and Aerospace Jeet Adani, defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, Italy ambassador Antonio Enrico Bartoli, senior VP of Leonardo Helicopters, Stefano Villanti, and CEO of Adani Defence & Aerospace, Ashish Rajvanshi, during the event 'Strategic Collaboration on Helicopter Ecosystem in India' in New Delhi on Tuesday

NEW DELHI: Just days after the Indo-EU trade and defence deal, Italian defence major Leonardo, which offers helicopter products and services globally, and Adani Defence and Aerospace on Tuesday announced a strategic partnership by signing an MoU to establish an integrated helicopter manufacturing ecosystem in India.The manufacturing ecosystem will seek to address the demands of Indian armed forces as well as the civilian sector, boosting India’s self-reliance in helicopter production.“The collaboration will deliver phased indigenisation, robust maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capabilities and comprehensive pilot training,” a release said.The MoU was signed in the presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh and A Anbarasu, DG (acquisition) in the department of defence (MoD), who called the collaboration a “strategic marriage”. It comes just a week after the Adani company and Brazilian aerospace major Embraer announced a strategic collaboration for setting up a fixed-wing aircraft manufacturing facility in India.Defence secretary Singh said, “This MoU is an important event. It marks the coming together of two respected industrial entities”. But on being Atmanirbhar in defence technology, he said, “You can probably never have 100% self-reliance; what you can do is to take steps towards doing more and more of ‘Make in India’ and ensure that the import dependence is minimised.”Italian ambassador Antonio Enrico Bartoli said, “Two global champions of the defence industry are opening a new chapter today.... In the field of defence, India is a reliable and long-term partner of Italy. In the helicopter sector, Leonardo is building cutting-edge technology. We hope for more Indian investment in Italy.”Adani Defence & Aerospace director Jeet Adani, Gautam Adani’s son, said, “This alliance with Leonardo is a pivotal stride towards a resilient, future-proof helicopter ecosystem in India. Merging global excellence with our industrial momentum, we will drive enduring value, high-skill employment and alignment with Aatmanirbhar Bharat to position India as a global aerospace powerhouse.”Company CEO Ashish Rajvanshi said that with the Indian armed forces projecting demand for over 1,000 helicopters in the coming decade, the partnership will help realise the vision of sovereign manufacturing.Leonardo (formerly AgustaWestland) helicopters MD Gian Piero Cutillo said India is a big market and that the country's armed forces have a growing requirement for helicopters.Across Army, IAF, Navy and Coast Guard, there are requirements for helicopters with diverse and advanced capabilities — 300+ light utility helicopters, 300+ medium lift helicopters, 100+ intermediate helicopters and 90+ maritime multi-role helicopters.","Italian defence major Leonardo, which offers helicopter products and services globally, and Adani Defence and Aerospace on Tuesday announced a strategic partnership.

NEW DELHI: As the united opposition raised an alarm over the US trade deal “selling away the blood and sweat” of Indian farmers, Congress neta Rahul Gandhi Tuesday said PM Narendra Modi is “compromised” because of the court case against Adani in the US and the Epstein files. He said the PM suddenly signed off on the trade deal because he is under “pressure”.Rahul said the case against Adani basically targets the PM because the business leader represents the financial structure of Modi and BJP, while the US has not yet released the full material they have on Epstein Files. “These are the two pressure points, and the country should understand that the PM is compromised,” he told reporters.The leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said the issue about General M M Naravane’s purported memoirs that he wanted to speak on in the House is a “sideshow”. “The country has to think hard about why the PM is compromised, and who has compromised him,” he remarked.Sharpening his attack, Rahul said Modi signed the US trade deal after it was stuck for four months, and on which nothing had changed. He said, “Modi is scared. He is under tremendous pressure, and the balloon of his image that has been created by spending crores, can burst.”Rahul added, “Indian farmers must understand that Modi has sold off their hard work and their blood and sweat through this trade deal. And he has done so because he is compromised. And he has not only sold off the farmers but sold off the country.” Samajwadi Party , DMK , Left parties, TMC and others joined hands in raising questions about the Indo-US deal. MP Randeep Surjewala said announcements by the US agriculture secretary and US President Donald Trump have made it clear that “Americal agricultural products will come to India on zero tariffs and flood the Indian markets, to the detriment of Indian farmers.”The opposition demanded that the trade deals with the US and the European Union be tabled in Parliament and debated.AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh underlined that the deal was announced by Trump Monday night, just like he had announced the halting of Operation Sindoor. “From the information President Trump has provided, it is abundantly clear that PM Modi has — like he did on May 10, 2025 — completely surrendered. He has most definitely appeased President Trump. India stands diminished by this unfortunate sequence of events,” Ramesh said.",Congress neta Rahul Gandhi said PM Narendra Modi is “compromised’ because of the court case against Adani in the US and the Epstein files.

NDA MPs Felicitate PM Modi For India-US trade Deal At Parliamentary Party Meeting

NDA known for carving lines in stone, says Modi

NEW DELHI: With a couple of big-ticket trade deals in his bag within a matter of days, PM Modi asserted on Tuesday that the world is recognising India’s strength and according it renewed respect, even as he cautioned governing alliance MPs against any sense of complacency over the govt’s achievements.Addressing the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party meeting where he was felicitated for India’s trade agreements, including with EU and US, Modi said India is at the centre of an uncertain world as past alliances give way to new alignments, emphasising that the new year has been particularly encouraging for India, sources said.In this context, Modi praised the Budget for its farsightedness and strengthening India’s prospects to become developed by 2047, with FM Nirmala Sitharaman briefing MPs on its highlights. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said MPs exuded happiness over the conclusion of nine trade deals covering 39 countries and credited Modi’s leadership.Modi’s early morning post on X quoting a Sanskrit shloka to emphasise the power of self-confidence was seen as a reference to last-night’s announcement of an Indo-US trade agreement by US President Donald Trump and him.“Self-confidence is the strength that makes everything possible. This power is going to be of great help in realising people’s dreams of a Viksit Bharat,” the PM said.An MP said Modi personified confidence at the meeting, which observers pinned on the success of trade negotiations with the US, and recalled the numerous steps India took following the Covid outbreak in 2019 that have since begun bearing fruit. With India being seen as a reliable partner by many leading countries, he said his govt had stuck to its strategy and kept patience.Besides painting a bright future for the economy at the meeting, Modi expressed confidence over NDA’s political prospects, noting its triumph in a series of polls, including in assemblies and local bodies in different parts of the country.At the same time, sources said, he reminded NDA MPs that while it is easy to carve a line in butter, NDA is known for carving a line in stone. The winning streak must be maintained, Modi said, urging the parliamentarians to continue their work for the masses.He spoke of NDA’s expansion in Tamil Nadu and BJP’s win in Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation poll in Kerala to stress the alliance’s increasing acceptability.Modi said some students clear one exam in junior grade and then believe they will face similarly easy tests in senior classes, only to end up failing, remarks which some MPs interpreted as a dig at Rahul Gandhi even though he did not name anyone.Emphasising the need for MPs to remain dutiful, he praised the contribution of Rajya Sabha member C Sadanandan Master, who wears prosthetic legs after losing his limbs in a brutal attack, allegedly by Left members, to BJP.","PM Modi was felicitated for India’s trade agreements, including with EU and US.

JAMMU: Peoples Conference MLA Sajad Lone’s amendments for restoration of Article 370 , Article 35-A and J&K’s statehood in lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha’s address to the assembly’s budget session were rejected on Tuesday amid bedlam over several issues, mainly BJP’s demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu.Sinha’s address at the start of the session on Monday did not mention the two matters. Rejecting the amendments, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather of the governing National Conference (NC) told Lone the House had already passed a resolution on special status in its first session in Nov 2024 and rules do not permit further discussions on an issue already debated.The Speaker further pointed out that granting statehood falls within the domain of the Centre and advised Lone to raise only those issues on which J&K govt is competent to respond or take a decision.Outside the assembly, Lone said four of his other amendments were, however, accepted, including those concerning daily wagers, NLU and condemnation of attacks on Kashmiris outside J&K.Lone dismissed as “theatrics” protests outside the assembly by NC MLAs for statehood and special status. “History will read what was said and decided inside the House,” Lone said. NCP MLA Mubarak Gul asserted the demands will be raised in the House during this session.The NLU row continued to polarise the House, with Lone citing chief minister Omar Abdullah’s assurance. J&K has no NLU at present but the demand for it to be located in Jammu gained traction after Omar said last year that it would come up in Kashmir’s Budgam. Omar has rejected BJP’s demands on NLU, calling them “politically motivated” and pointing out that there were no protests in the Valley when Jammu was given both an IIT and an IIM.As House proceedings started on Tuesday, BJP MLAs renewed the NLU demand, while NC and PDP legislators took up the issue of alleged harassment of Kashmiri Muslims outside J&K.BJP’s Surjit Singh Slathia pointed out that students are demonstrating on streets for the NLU to be based in Jammu and his party stands with them. Another BJP MLA, Balwant Singh Mankotia, argued that Jammu would be a better location for NLU in terms of security, weather and road connectivity.NC MLAs highlighted the alleged harassment of Kashmiris in various parts of the country and were joined by some lawmakers of opposition PDP. “I support the cause, not NC,” PDP MLA Muntazir Mehdi clarified.PDP’s Waheed-ur-Rehman Para moved an adjournment motion to discuss alleged attacks on Kashmiris, arguing they were “hate crimes”. Speaker Rather rejected the move. He said the Omar-led govt has taken up the issue with various states and is thankful to Pushkar Singh Dhami, CM of BJP-governed Uttrakhand, for taking action recently in one such case.",Sinha’s address at the start of the session on Monday did not mention the two matters.

Attempt to prevent me from speaking on issues of national security: Rahul

NEW DELHI: Eight opposition MPs of the Congress and the CPI-M were suspended from the Lok Sabha for the rest of the Budget Session on Tuesday for “unruly behaviour”. MPs mounted the table and hurled papers at the Chair after Rahul Gandhi was disallowed for the second day from speaking on former Army chief General Naravane’s purported revelations on Chinese aggression in his unpublished book.In a protest letter to Speaker Om Birla, Rahul said it was the first time the LOP was not allowed to speak on the President’s joint address, and it is a blot on democracy.The suspensions and bedlam have put a question mark on proceedings for Wednesday, when PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address. Govt sources said the PM’s reply will go on as planned.The suspended members are Congress’ Manickam Tagore, Gurjeet Aujla, Amarinder Raja Warring, Hibi Eden, Prashant Padole, C Kiran Kumar Reddy, Dean Kuriakose, and CPI-M’s S Venkatesan.After the Tuesday morning session was adjourned owing to the opposition’s demand that the govt discuss the Indo-US trade deal, Rahul Gandhi picked up from Monday when his insistence on speaking on Naravane’s unpublished book elicited a red flag from the govt.Speaker Om Birla ruled that the LOP could not cite the book and should speak on motion of thanks.On Tuesday, Rahul said he was authenticating the press article he was referring to for Naravane’s book, as was asked by the Chair, but parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said the Chair had ruled that he could not speak on the issue.As Rahul again started his speech with the contentious subject, Presiding Officer Krishna Prasad Tenneti overruled him and called the next speaker from SP Uttam Patel to speak, who refused.He moved to Shatabdi Roy of TMC who too did not speak. When BJP ally TDP’s Harish Balayogi started his speech, the angry opposition members trooped into the well. While they raised slogans, Prashant Padole climbed on the secretary general’s table, even as some members threw papers at the Chair, which forced the house to be adjourned. On resumption, Presiding Officer Dilip Saikia suspended the eight MPs. It led to bedlam and the house was adjourned for the day.In a protest letter to the Speaker, Rahul Gandhi said a member can refer to a document in his speech after authenticating it, and the refusal to let him speak suggests “there is a deliberate attempt to prevent me as LOP from speaking on matters of national security”.During the fracas, presiding officer Tenneti objected to Congress MP K C Venugopal’s use of “yaar” (pal) in his angry interventions to back Rahul Gandhi.",Eight opposition MPs of the Congress and the CPI-M were suspended from the Lok Sabha for “unruly behaviour” MPs mounted the table and hurled papers at the Chair after Rahul Gandhi was disallowed for the second day from speaking on General Naravane’s purported revelations on Chinese aggression.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127896613,width-400,resizemode-4/new-delhi-feb-03-ani-lok-sabha-lop-rahul-gandhi-congress-mp-priyanka-gandhi.jpg"

JAMMU: Parties across the political divide in J&K have welcomed the announcement on Tuesday by railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw that three proposed railway projects in the state have been put on hold for now following opposition from the state govt and MPs, who have argued that the track alignments could damage apple orchards.Vaishnaw said there was a demand for three additional railway projects in the region, but these had been kept on hold for now due to the objections raised.He did not specify the names of the projects.The governing National Conference said the halted proposals include the Bijbehara-Pahalgam railway link and the Pulwama-Shopian railway project. The issue was earlier raised by local farmers, legislators, including Anantnag-Poonch MP Mian Altaf and the opposition PDP leaders.Pahalgam legislator Altaf Kaloo and the NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq thanked CM Omar Abdullah and MP Mian Altaf for what they described as their “timely and critical intervention” in stopping the proposed railway tracks between Bijbehara-Pahalgam and Anantnag-Shopian.“This is a vital step towards protecting people’s livelihoods, apple orchards and the fragile ecology of the region,” Kaloo said.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti said, “The decision to put the Pahalgam and Shopian railway lines on hold brings much-needed relief to Kashmir’s agrarian economy.These projects threatened to destroy scarce fertile land and push over a million rural families into uncertainty. In any future plan, farmers and local communities must be taken on board to protect Kashmir’s economy and social fabric.”CPI(M) legislator M Y Tarigami said connectivity to areas like Pahalgam and Shopian and other areas of J&K already exists through road networks and more roads are coming up. “Development is meaningless if it destroys livelihoods,” he said, hailing the railway minister for the decision to halt the projects.","Three proposed railway projects in J&K have been put on hold for now.

JAMMU: A fierce encounter broke out between a joint team of security forces and a group of terrorists holed up in a remote, forested area in Basantgarh, in J&K’s Udhampur district, on Tuesday. The Army’s White Knight Corps, in a statement on X, said a cordon had been set up and “Operation Kiya” was in progress.Officials said at least two to three Pakistani terrorists were believed to be trapped within the cordon. The White Knight Corps post stated that a joint team of Counter Insurgency Force Delta, police, and CRPF established contact with the terrorists around 4pm.Earlier, security forces had launched a search operation in Jopher area in Udhampur’s Ramnagar late Sunday. Combing was also carried out in the surrounding Marta, Kulthian, Sohan, Kheal, and Chour Mottu areas on Monday. Counter-terrorism actions continued in Ramgarh’s forests and Kalas top in Rajouri district, and the upper reaches of Poonch, Kathua, Doda and Reasi districts to track and kill fleeing terrorists.Meanwhile, Operation Trashi-I — launched in the forested Chatroo belt of Kishtwar district on Jan 18 — entered its 17th day on Tuesday as troops continued trudging through knee-deep snow to trace hiding terrorists.White Knight Corps Commander had visited the district Monday to review the counter-terrorism grid and assess the operational preparedness of units deployed in the region.Under Operation Trashi-I, security forces have engaged in four encounters with terrorists in the past fortnight. Initial contact was established in Sonnar forest near Mandral-Singhpora, Chatroo, on Jan 18, in which eight security personnel were injured, one of whom eventually succumbed. On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead. A brief gun battle occurred in Dolgam on Jan 31.Mobile internet services (all bandwidths) have remained temporarily suspended within a 6km-radius covering Singhpora, Chingam, and Chatroo since Jan 30 as a security measure.","Officials said at least two to three Pakistani terrorists were believed to be trapped within the cordon.

"Govt collects health cess, but spends less than it did earlier",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-collects-health-cess-but-spends-less-than-it-did-earlier/articleshow/127894852.cms,"Representative image

0.5 percentage point fall in 10 years

Despite collecting a cess specifically for health, the Centre’s spending on health is now lower than it was before the cess was imposed, both as a share of the total budget and as a proportion of the GDP.Before the health cess was introduced in 2018, the allocation for health was 2.4% of total govt expenditure in 2017-18. In the Budget Estimates for 2026-27, that is down to 1.9%. As a proportion of the GDP, the decline is from 0.28% to 0.26%. Money collected as health cess amounts to over 30% of the allocation for health and family welfare in 2026-27. Without the cess component, health would have accounted for just 1.3% of the total Budget, barely over half of the figure in 2017-18.When the health cess was introduced, the understanding was that it would boost health expenditure by topping up what the govt was already allocating. Clearly, that has not happened. Instead, cess is masking what would otherwise be a steep cut in the share of health in total Budget and in GDP.From 0.32% of the GDP in 2019, the year before Covid struck, the share has fallen to 0.27% even with the cess component. Remove the cess component and the share of health in the GDP is 0.18%.The target of the National Health Policy was 2.5% of the GDP by 2025 of which 35% was supposed to be the share of central govt, which works out to 0.9% of the GDP or Rs 3.5 lakh, over three times the current allocation.If we were to strip the cess money off the revised Budget allocation for 2025-26 which was Rs 92,926 crore, it would be Rs 78,279 crore. Do the same for the 2026-27 allocation and it falls to Rs 70,984 crore, which is 9.3% lower than the 2025-26 revised allocation without cess.We could look at it differently. If govt were to allocate the same share (2.4%) of the total Budget as it did in 2017, the allocation this year would have been Rs 1.2 lakh crore without the cess. Instead, even with cess the allocation has been just Rs 1 lakh crore.“The health and education cess flatters the health allocation without increasing allocation from the consolidated fund. Cess money flows from a reserve fund outside the regular Budget process, with no outcome monitoring requirements. Moreover, cess requires no parliamentary accountability. You create the impression of increased Budget allocation but in reality, states have no claim on cess. It is entirely the discretion of the central govt,” said economist Dr Varna Sri Raman.In 2018, then finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced the health cess, saying the 3% education cess was being increased to 4% health and education cess “in order to take care of the needs of education and health of BPL and rural families”.“Though it is assumed the additional 1% is for health, the Finance Act doesn’t prescribe how the 4% is to be divided between health and education. Central govt decides each year how much goes into Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Nidhi (PMSSN) which is a fund created to hold the health component of the cess,” said Sri Raman. PMSSN was only created in 2021, two years after the cess was introduced.“The health cess collected from 2018-19 and 2019-20 went into the general revenues. That’s roughly Rs 20,600 crore collected in the name of health that went into general revenues with no earmarking,” she added.","Before the health cess was introduced in 2018, the allocation for health was 2.4% of total govt expenditure in 2017-18.

LUCKNOW: Gold buys food. In eastern Uttar Pradesj, food brought gold. For a 12-year-old schoolboy, an offer of unlimited free momos was worth more than the metal locked in a family cupboard. For two roadside vendors, the boy’s craving turned into a gold mine.Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers near Dumari Chauraha in Deoria — about 350km east of Lucknow — trading ornaments for what he was promised would be a lifetime supply of free dumplings. The trail surfaced when jewellery vanished from the cupboard. The boy’s mother and aunt went looking. The cupboard was empty. Questions followed. The child broke down and told his father he had traded the valuables for “unlimited free food for a lifetime”.According to a complaint filed by the boy’s father, a temple priest, the child had grown fond of momo sold at the roadside stall.The vendors allegedly began feeding him free of cost, winning trust bite by bite. Soon came bigger offers — food, small sums of money, loyalty.Then persuasion. Unaware of the stakes, the boy began removing jewellery from home and handing it over, police said.Gold necklaces. Rings. Bangles. Mangtika. Nose pins. Earrings. Silver toe rings. Family heirlooms, one snack at a time. The vendors vanished soon enough.The priest approached police on Feb 1, alleging the momo sellers threatened the child with dire consequences to keep him silent. Police teams are now searching for the two fugitives and tracing the jewellery trail, SHO Devendra Kumar Singh said, adding legal action will follow. Other suspects are also being questioned.",Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

What happened at Heathrow?

UK incident challenges claim AI fuel switch movement was manual: Expert

MUMBAI: In a development with direct implications for the investigation into the June 12 fatal Air India Boeing 787 Ahmedabad crash, another Air India Dreamliner saw a fuel control switch move from “run” to “cut-off” after a crew member pressed it to check whether it was locked.The switch moved without the required lift action, suggesting the safeguard meant to prevent fuel supply cut off and inadvertent engine shutdown did not function as designed, sources said. The London incident challenges the controversial narrative that the Ahmedabad crash resulted from a deliberate pilot act, pointing instead to a possible and critical technical flaw in the aircraft’s fuel switch design.The incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT-ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru. The fuel control switches on the 787 require a two-step action: they must be lifted before they can be moved between “run” and “cut-off”. The safety feature is intended to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown.“The pilot lightly pushed the left fuel control switch to check if its lock feature was working and found it was not because the switch moved though it was not lifted first,” the source said. It again failed to lock the second time.But the third time the switch stayed locked and did not move without lifting. The aircraft departed at 9.40pm for Bengaluru, where it is currently grounded.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report released last July, said that both fuel control switches on the ill-fated aircraft had moved from “run” to “cut off” seconds after takeoff. The report said one pilot asked the other why did he cut off the fuel, to which the other responded that he did not do so.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report, added that no technical or design flaw was found with the aircraft so far, implying pilot action. Therafter, the DGCA mandated an inspection of the fuel switch locking system. Air India later announced that it completed these inspections and found no faults. But the London incident brings back to fore the unresolved question around switch design, its locking integrity and the possibility of inadvertent activation, said sources.A senior commander said: “The London incident directly challenges the assumption that fuel switch movement in the Air India crash was manual. Until now, the cut-off transition was treated as near-conclusive evidence of pilot action. The London event shows that uncommanded switch behaviour, through mechanical detent failure, signal corruption or other causes, is a credible failure mode. That places the DGCA’s earlier claim of fleet clearance under sharp scrutiny, as a defect appearing months later suggests inspections may have been visual, non-diagnostic, or incomplete. For the AAIB, the implication is clear: fuel cutoff can no longer be equated with intent, the investigation must widen to fleet-level and component analysis, and attribution of deliberate pilot action without fully eliminating system anomalies is no longer defensible.”Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh said: “The London incident is particularly concerning because in 2018 the US aviation regulator cautioned that fuel control switches on Boeing 787s could malfunction and lead to inadvertent engine shutdown. Occurring after Air India said its fleet’s fuel control switches have been checked, and amid the ongoing June 12 B787 crash investigation, it raises serious questions about inspection adequacy and demands the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. ”Air India, in a statement, said: “We are aware that one of our pilots has reported a possible defect on the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft. After receiving this initial information, we have grounded the said aircraft and are involving the OEM to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis. The matter has been communicated to the aviation regulator, DGCA. Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA, and had found no issues. ” Boeing said: “We are in contact with Air India and are supporting their review of this matter”.",Incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT- ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: A study comparing homeopathic treatment with conventional primary care for infants has been retracted by European Journal of Pediatrics, citing serious flaws in the study design.In a retraction note, the journal’s editor said concerns were raised after publication about the methodology of the randomised controlled trial, particularly the absence of blinding and placebo controls. A post-publication review found that these shortcomings could introduce “significant bias” in the interpretation of the data and conclusions.The editor said the flaws were fundamental and could not be corrected through an erratum, adding that there was no longer confidence in the reliability of the article.The study, published in 2024, examined homeopathic treatment versus standard primary care for kids during the first 24 months of life, a period requiring high ethical and scientific safeguards.According to the journal, the authors have been invited to submit a revised manuscript addressing the concerns. However, the retraction note states that the authors do not agree with the decision, a position conveyed by lead author Menachem Oberbaum.The paper involved authors from multiple institutions, including India, and had drawn attention because it compared an alternative system of medicine with conventional care in a vulnerable age group.Although the article remains available as an open-access publication, it is now clearly labelled as retracted.",Study comparing homeopathic treatment with conventional primary care for infants has been retracted.

"India, US press ahead with deal but challenges remain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-press-ahead-with-deal-but-challenges-remain/articleshow/127897451.cms,"Transactional Model Of Relationship

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

NEW DELHI: The India-US trade deal allows both sides to get the relationship back on to an even keel, but whether it can lead to long-term stability in ties remains open to question.The importance of the agreement, even if conditional, cannot be overstated as it allows India and the US to avert an immediate crisis. India just managed to rid itself of an albatross around its neck that was threatening to smother cooperation with its most important strategic partner even in other areas. However, the estrangement with the US since Donald Trump’s return to the White House has not been about trade alone. There are several other friction points.The first is the India-Pakistan re-hyphenation Trump has brought upon India through his courting of Rawalpindi. It is here US ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who seems to have found a way out of the trade impasse within weeks of arrival, may have an important role to play. Suspense still looms over his dual role as Trump’s special envoy for south Asia and any false move bracketing India with Pakistan, let alone playing sheriff, will be met with resistance.Bilateralism has been the leitmotif of India’s Pakistan policy and, as far as India is concerned, there’s no Nobel Peace Prize for any third party to win.The second concern is related to the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific under Trump, who wants to engage his counterpart Xi Jinping for a “stable peace, fair trade and respectful relations”. Trade differences between India and the US were seen as blocking any forward movement by Quad and a US-India reset must surely clear the ground for a summit meeting. While the US 2026 National Defence Strategy underlines the goal of a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific , it makes no mention of Quad or India.Thirdly, India’s strategic autonomy will likely continue to act as a limiting factor. India will continue to use the same to navigate geopolitical complexities, especially in its relations with the US, Russia and China. India may have, according to Trump, promised to stop buying Russian oil but it will continue to work closely with Moscow in defence and in forums like the SCO and BRICS. India would like Russia to see its energy pivot as a blip caused by market conditions, not as an ebbing of its strategic autonomy.For India, the structural shift in how the US handles the H-1B visa programme remains a major irritant that it hopes Washington will address.Finally, India will also be concerned about the transactional relationship that the US under Trump seeks with India. Many claims made by Trump in his announcement India saying no to Russian oil, agreeing to buy energy and other products worth $500 billion from the US, zero tariff on US products have not yet been confirmed by Indian govt, suggesting there might be a devil in the details. India will hope that some of Trump’s claims are just political signalling, not an ultimatum.",The India-US trade deal allows both sides to get the relationship back on to an even keel.

BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court has imposed Rs 50,000 in costs on Wipro Enterprises Private Limited, terming its stand in an ex gratia payment dispute an abuse of the process of law. The cost is payable to a former staff who was the plaintiff before the civil court.The dispute concerned the non-payment of an ex gratia amount promised to Ratnesh Pandey, a resident of Haryana, who resigned from the company in Sept 2017 after working for nearly 12 years in various posts. Pandey tendered his resignation on Aug 6, 2017, and it was accepted on Sept 18, 2017.In recognition of his contribution, he was offered an ex gratia lump sum amount of Rs 6,32,000, payable after 18 months from the date of cessation of employment, subject to the condition that from the date of cessation he would not join competing companies, namely Philips India Limited or Bajaj Electricals Ltd. As the ex gratia amount was not paid even after 18 months and repeated correspondence, Pandey approached the civil court seeking payment of the amount along with 18% interest.Wipro disputed the claim, contending that Pandey had not accepted the terms and conditions of the cessation letter and therefore was not entitled to payment of the ex gratia amount. On July 23, 2024, the 20th additional city civil judge, Bengaluru, ruled in favour of Pandey.Wipro appealed, arguing the cessation letter dated Sept 18, 2017, for want of acceptance from Pandey, stood revoked under Section 6(2) of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and that belated acceptance after 18 months was unacceptable. Pandey said Wipro never alleged breach of contract conditions before the civil court.In his ruling, Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted that Aug 19, 2017, was Pandey’s last working day and rejected Wipro’s claim that signing and returning the letter was a mandatory condition, holding that the phrase “return to us for records” could not be treated as a condition precedent. HC held Wipro had acted upon the cessation letter and, having failed to prove any breach by Pandey, could not deny payment on hyper-technical grounds.","The Karnataka high court has imposed Rs 50,000 in costs on Wipro Enterprises Private Limited.

BENGALURU: In a cheque bounce case, the Karnataka high court has ruled that trial courts cannot levy fines exceeding twice the dishonoured cheque amount.Justice V Srishananda made the observation while partly allowing an appeal filed by Mahadevi, an agriculturist from Banahatti in Bagalkot district. In Nov 2007, Mahadevi bought two trailers for Rs 3.8 lakh after she was allowed a Rs 5,000 discount.She issued a cheque for the trailers, but the cheque was dishonoured. Following this, the seller registered a cheque bounce case. On May 8, 2017, the magistrate’s court at Banahatti convicted her, directing her to pay Rs 7.6 lakh as compensation to the seller and Rs 5,000 as defraying expenses to state govt.Mahadevi’s appeal against the order was dismissed by the district court, and she moved the HC. She said the trailers had not been delivered to her, but Justice Srishananda noted Mahadevi had failed to establish her claim. The judge directed Mahadevi to pay Rs 7.6 lakh as compensation to the complainant, but set aside the order regarding Rs 5,000 to be paid towards defraying expenses, ruling that no state machinery was involved in the transaction.","The Karnataka high court has ruled that trial courts cannot levy fines exceeding twice the dishonoured cheque amount.

LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court on Tuesday said that under the current law, no person or political party can be completely barred from contesting elections merely on the ground that it is influencing voters on the basis of caste or religion.The court said that it is the subject of the legislature to make laws in this regard, and the Election Commission cannot cancel the registration of any political party on this ground.A division bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice AK Chaudhary passed the verdict on a PIL filed by Motilal Yadav in 2013, seeking direction against holding of caste-based rallies by political parties. In an interim order in July 2013 itself, a bench of Justice Uma Nath Singh and Justice Mahendra Dayal had stayed caste-based rallies “with immediate effect” throughout UP.In its final order on Tuesday, the court said that Section 8A of the Representation of the People Act is the only provision under which disqualification is permitted in cases of electoral malpractice. The high court clarified that the power to impose a pre-emptive ban on a political party or individual is not currently available in the law and that this matter falls entirely within the jurisdiction of the legislature.Citing previous Supreme Court decisions, the court stated that even the Election Commission does not have the power to deregister a political party except under limited circumstances prescribed by the apex court.The high court also clarified that the recognition of a recognized political party can be suspended or withdrawn under Paragraph 16A of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

(With inputs from Anurag Bende in Pune)

MUMBAI: After assuming the role of Maharashtra’s deputy CM, Sunetra Pawar is set to become NCP national chief, replacing husband Ajit Pawar who was killed in an air crash last week. Amid speculation about whether he would take up the role, party working president Praful Patel ruled himself out of the race and said the party wanted her to accept the post.Meanwhile, Maharashtra govt appointed her guardian minister for Pune and Beed, posts earlier held by Ajit.“We would all like her to accept the post of party chief and support her in taking the party forward. This would be the real homage to Ajit Pawar,” Patel said, adding, “We will have to call a party meeting and take a decision in keeping with the sentiments of the party and public. I am not in the race.” He said the issue of a merger between NCP and Sharad Pawar’s NCP (SP) was not before them at this point.“We are focusing on settling party affairs,” Patel said. Dismissing talk of a merger, he said Ajit had clarified at least twice to TV channels that there was no such proposal and the coordination was only for local body polls. “We allied with BJP in Ahilyanagar and Shiv Sena in Nasik too,” he said.“He (Ajit) did say some people expressed the sentiment that the parties should work together, but there was no serious discussion,” Patel said. He dismissed videos of a meeting between NCP and NCP (SP) netas, saying, “We do meet... We were once part of the same family.”","Sunetra Pawar is set to become NCP national chief, replacing husband Ajit Pawar. Party working president Praful Patel ruled himself out of the race.

Litigant has right to know judgment on their plea: CJI

NEW DELHI: A Jharkhand HC judge kept his verdict reserved in a writ petition for two years and orally pronounced it on Dec 4 after SC found the delay “shocking”, but even after two months, there is no sign of a written judgment, which has been neither uploaded to HC website nor made available to parties.When senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi brought this to the notice of the court and said such incidents discredit the judicial system, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi admitted this is a problem with some HC judges, which needs urgent rectification. The CJI said, “It is an identified ailment of the justice delivery system. It must be cured and not allowed to infect the system.”A litigant who approaches the court must get to know what judgment is given on his plea,” the CJI said. The same HC judge, Justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay, was found to have kept several judgments pending for years, even in cases where the convicts had appealed against their capital and life sentences. The judge had delivered the verdicts in those cases only after SC took judicial notice of the same.Amicus curiae Fauzia Shakeel said Rohatgi’s client can afford to approach SC for the inordinate delay in pronouncement of verdict and complain about subsequent non-availability of the written judgment.“But how many from the states and rural areas can afford to bear the cost of coming to Delhi and engaging a lawyer to apprise the court of such delays by HCs?” she asked. The CJI candidly said certain HC judges have devised innovations to step around the timeline fixed for pronouncement of judgments by reserving their verdicts and listing such cases again, purportedly to seek certain clarifications.When Rohatgi said that SC must administratively ask the chief justices of HCs to monitor whether reserved verdicts are pronounced within three months, CJI said a conference of HC chief justices is being organised on Feb 7 where he would raise this issue along with those pertaining to other reforms in judiciary he has proposed.The bench asked the Jharkhand HC judge to make available the written judgment within two weeks by uploading it to the HC website and directed the Registry to provide its certified copies to the parties. The CJI said, “Judges should not reserve decisions in a large number of cases when it is beyond them to pen judgments expeditiously. They must use the vacations to complete their pending work.”","A Jharkhand HC judge kept his verdict reserved in a writ petition for two years and orally pronounced it on Dec 4 after SC found the delay ‘shocking’ The CJI said, “It is an identified ailment of the justice delivery system. It must be cured and not allowed to infect the system’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127897247,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

Yumnam Khemchand Singh: Two-term MLA

Violence in Manipur has declinedbut situation is still far from ideal

NEW DELHI: Yumnam Khemchand Singh, a former Manipur assembly speaker, second-term MLA and a taekwondo master, is set to be the new CM of the state after BJP MLAs elected him as their leader on Tuesday, paving the way for the installation of a popular govt to replace President’s Rule imposed on Feb 13 last year.Keen to project a message of ethnic reconciliation in the north-eastern state, which was rocked by Meitei versus Kuki violence, BJP is considering appointing two deputy CMs — one each from the Kuki and Naga communities, with Singh being a Meitei. Nemcha Kipgen, a Kuki figure and former minister, is likely to be one of the deputy CMs. Singh (62), a second-term MLA from Singjamei in Imphal, is seen as the most acceptable choice in the state.Though the violence in Manipur has declined, the situation is far from ideal as both the communities are largely confined to regions of their dominance in the state.Singh was elected as the leader at a meeting of 35 of 37 BJP MLAs — two were absent due to illness — at the party headquarters in presence of central observer Tarun Chugh and the party’s in-charge for northeast region Sambit Patra.His visit to relief camps housing Kukis on Dec 8 made him the only Meitei MLA to do so. While he was the speaker between 2017 to 2022, Singh — who was last year awarded a fifth-dan black — served as a minister in the second Biren Singh govt, holding several key portfolios.While a big majority of BJP MLAs is from the Meitei community, the party also has Kuki and Naga MLAs, and enjoys support of several MLAs from different communities and parties. BJP allies were also called to Delhi.","Yumnam Khemchand Singh, a former Manipur assembly speaker, second-term MLA and a taekwondo master, is set to be the new CM of the state.

NEW DELHI: You can loosen your purse strings a little more abroad. Travellers flying into India will now have enhanced duty-free limit, which for resident Indians has been hiked from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. What’s more, duty-free import of one laptop for passengers above 18 years has now been allowed under Baggage Rules, 2026, which came into effect from Feb 2. No general duty-free allowance is available for passengers entering India through land borders, regardless of nationality.Jewellery allowance has also been simplified. “Special allowances for jewellery have been prescribed solely on weight basis by removing outdated value caps, under which eligible returning residents/tourists of Indian origin (after stay abroad for more than one year), are allowed duty-free jewellery purely on a weight basis,” a govt statement said. Men are allowed to import jewellery up to 20 gram duty-free while female passengers can import up to 40 gram.The transfer of residence benefits has also been simplified and modernised by having only a single rationalised list of duty-free articles, with an overall value cap as per eligibility.Duty-free allowance for resident Indians, tourists of Indian origin and foreigners with an Indian visa (other th-an tourist) is now Rs 75,000.For tourists of foreign orig-in, it’s Rs 25,000. For crew me-mbers, the same is Rs 2,500.“The facility of issuance of temporary baggage import certificate or export certificate for temporary carriage of goods brought in or taken out, respectively, have been envisioned for hassle-free clearance,” the govt statement added.Used personal effects like clothes and travel souvenirs are duty-free. New goods like gifts purchases abroad qualify according to new limits. Goods above the duty-free limit are dutiable under normal customs provisions unless specifically exempted by the law. These allowances apply only to goods carried on the passenger’s person or in bona fide baggage.Some items are not part of duty-free allowances and have separate conditions or limits. These include alcohol and spirits beyond specified volumes, tobacco products beyond allowance threshold, gold or silver in forms other than jewellery, and large electronic goods like televisions.","Duty-free allowance for resident Indians, tourists of Indian origin and foreigners with an Indian visa (other th-an tourist) is now Rs 75,000.

DGCA Rules Out Fault in AI’s Boeing 787

MUMBAI: Checks carried out on the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner grounded in Bengaluru found its fuel control switch lock to be satisfactory, said the ministry of civil aviation on Tuesday, even as another AI Dreamliner was grounded over technical reasons, this time in Dubai.The latest grounding involved B787 (VT-ANN) scheduled to operate an 8.40pm departure from Dubai to Delhi, flight AIC 916, on Feb 2. The aircraft took off on Feb 3 at 5.30pm. It was grounded due to what has been described as a “technical reason”. It is not yet known whether the issue involves a fuel switch lock-related problem. Air India did not comment.The first grounding occurred on Feb 1 after a malfunction was registered by the crew of B787 (VT-ANX) during engine start to operate flight AI-132 from London to Bengaluru. The incident was critical as the fuel control switch locking mechanism has been at the centre of the investigation into the June 12 Air India Ahmedabad crash.Referring to the London incident, the ministry said the crew observed on two occasions that the left engine fuel control switch did not remain positively latched in the “RUN” position when light vertical pressure was applied. On a subsequent attempt, the switch latched correctly and remained stable and the crew went on to operate the flight in Bengaluru.In Bengaluru, during the check, “both left and right switches were checked and found satisfactory, with the locking tooth fully seated and not slipping from RUN to CUTOFF,” the ministry said. “When full force was applied parallel to the base plate, the switch remained secure. However, applying external force in an incorrect direction caused the switch to move easily from RUN to CUTOFF, due to the angular base plate allowing slip when pressed improperly with finger or thumb,” it added. AI as been advised to circulate Boeing’s recommended procedures for the operation of the fuel cut-off switch to its flight crew, it said.Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh pointed out that even if force is applied in the incorrect direction, the switch should not move unless it is lifted.The ministry statement also said based on Boeing’s communication, the pull-to-unlock force was checked on the fuel control switch using the recommended procedure on the involved fuel cut off switch, the fuel control unit to be installed and fuel cut off switch of another aircraft. In all cases the pull-to-unlock force was found within limits.","The latest grounding involved B787 (VT-ANN) scheduled to operate an 8.40pm departure from Dubai to Delhi, flight AIC 916, on Feb 2.

Sustained PM2.5 exposure ups depression risk: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sustained-pm2-5-exposure-ups-depression-risk-study/articleshow/127897069.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: As the Union Budget steps up focus on strengthening mental health infrastructure, a nationwide study has flagged a rise in depression and anxiety linked to long-term exposure to toxic fine particles in the air, underlining how environmental risks are adding to India’s mental health burden.The study was led by researchers from IIT-Delhi, in collaboration with AIIMS New Delhi, NIMHANS and St John’s Medical College, and published in international journal iScience.Analysing data from 34,802 adults across 12 states, including Punjab, UP, Rajasthan and Assam, researchers found sustained exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an 8% higher odds of depression and a 2% increase in anxiety.The analysis is based on clinically diagnosed cases from National Mental Health Survey (2015–16) and is cross-sectional, meaning it establishes association rather than causation. One of the authors, Dr Anand Krishna from the community medicine department at AIIMS, said this distinction was important. However, he noted even modest associations assumed significance because a very large segment of the population was exposed to polluted air.The burden was highest among urban metro residents, people aged 40-49 years, and those from lower-income groups. Regionally, pollution-linked depression showed stronger associations in eastern India, while anxiety was more prominent in the western region.Risks also peaked during the post-monsoon season, when pollution levels typically rise.The study went beyond overall PM2.5 levels to examine individual chemical constituents of air pollution. It found components largely generated by traffic, industry and agricultural activity — including sulphates, nitrates and ammonium — had stronger links with depression. Elemental carbon, a marker of diesel and fossil-fuel combustion, was most strongly associated with anxiety.By identifying pollution components, the researchers said the study helped prioritise emission sources for targeted action, with clear policy relevance at a time when air quality has worsened across many regions.The analysis also covered participants from Gujarat, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, using advanced satellite data and atmospheric modelling.","A nationwide study has flagged a rise in depression and anxiety linked to long- term exposure to toxic fine particles in the air.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: Centre on Tuesday told Supreme Court that all procedural safeguards were followed while ordering detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and action against him was taken for instigating people in the sensitive border area of Ladakh.Continuing with his earlier submission on Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale that Wangchuk’s speech was intended to provoke people to indulge in violence against govt and justified his detention under National Security Act.“This court is dealing with a person who is instigating people in a border area, adjacent to Pakistan and China, where regional sensitivity is involved,” he said.Referring to the activist’s speech, the solicitor general said he had stated that Ladakhis could not choose their own representatives while China and Tibet etc have autonomous rights which is highly objectionable.“This is a preventive action so that he doesn’t keep repeating the things he (Wangchuk) said. The detention strikes at the very purpose for which the NSA was enacted. It will have a contextual meaning. Every state has region specific sensitivities,” Mehta said.SC was hearing the plea moved by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali Angmo against his preventive detention.Wangchuk has been detained under the NSA following protests in Leh in Sept 2025 over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the UT of Ladakh.",Wangchuk has been detained under the NSA following protests in Leh in Sept 2025 over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the UT of Ladakh.

KULLU: A pair of peacocks were spotted in a snow-covered forest of Jagatsukh village at an altitude of over 6000ft (approx 1,800m) near Himachal Pradesh’s Manali — the rare sighting triggering concerns about the impact of climate change on this fragile ecosystem.Commonly found in warmer regions, the peacocks have sparked a sensation in Jagatsukh.Balak Ram Sharma, 52, of Jagatsukh, said some villagers told him the pair moved into the forest last summer but were rarely spotted. “We checked one of the peacocks and found it was not injured and its flight was normal,” Kullu deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) Rajesh Sharma told TOI. According to Sharma, the rise in average temperature could be one of the reasons for this rare sighting at such an altitude.“There were no ceiling fans in homes in Kullu and Manali even 10-15 years ago. But the climate has got warmer at most places and the high hills are not as cold as they once were, so peacocks may be finding the upper regions of Kullu habitable and have started acclimatising,” said Sharma.Peacocks in Himachal Pradesh are generally found at altitudes of 1,000m but some thrive in areas up to 1,500m. Himachal Pradesh has become significantly warmer in the last 124 years. According to meteorological department, the state has recorded a rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius in average mean temperature since 1901.","A pair of peacocks were spotted in a snow-covered forest of Jagatsukh village at an altitude of over 6000ft (approx 1,800m) near Himachal Pradesh’s Manali.

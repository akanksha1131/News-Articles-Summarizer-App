Why BJP-Shiv Sena alliance talks fell apart in 2014? Devendra Fadnavis reveals what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-bjp-shiv-sena-alliance-talks-fell-apart-in-2014-devendra-fadnavis-reveals-what-happened/articleshow/119451321.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis explained why the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena decided to part ways in 2014 state assembly elections. The saffron party leader revealed that seat-sharing disagreements were the primary reason behind the failure of alliance talks with Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.""When the talks of alliance started, the Shiv Sena of that time had decided in its mind that it had to contest only 151 seats. Whereas our proposal was that we would contest on 127 seats and Shiv Sena would contest on 147 seats, we would give the remaining seats to our smaller alliance partners,"" he said speaking at an event in Mumbai.Fadnavis later revealed that the BJP had proposed a power-sharing arrangement where Shiv Sena would retain the chief minister's post. However, according to him, Shiv Sena was unwilling to compromise, leading to a deadlock in the negotiations.""Due to this reason, the matter could not move forward even though we explained to them a lot that we would contest on 127, and you contest on 147, you would have the chief minister, and we would have the deputy chief minister... They were not ready to have a settlement...,"" he added.In the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections, both the BJP and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena contested separately.The BJP secured 122 seats, paving the way for Devendra Fadnavis to become the state's chief minister. Although the BJP and Shiv Sena had contested separately, they later joined forces post-election, with Shiv Sena becoming a key ally in the government.Thackeray's move to break ties with the BJP and form alliance with the Congress and NCP sparked internal dissent within Shiv Sena, ultimately fueling a rebellion led by Eknath Shinde.With the backing of BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis, Shinde orchestrated a split within the Shiv Sena in 2022 and aligned with the BJP to establish an NDA government.","Devendra Fadnavis says seat-sharing disagreements were the primary reason behind the failure of alliance talks with Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.

How is this acceptable?"" asked Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram.Initiating the debate on the Finance Bill in Lok Sabha, Tharoor claimed that the bill was yet another move by the Centre to hoard revenue at the states' expense by slashing basic customs duty on several items which are shared with states and shifting the difference to the Agricultural Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC), which the Centre keeps entirely.The Thiruvananthapuram MP demanded the constitution of an independent fiscal council to serve as a redressal body, ensuring that the States have a say in how their hard-earned revenue is allocated.DMK MP Kalanidhi Veeraswamy alleged BJP-led Centre presented the Finance Bill for announcing tax exemption for those earning up to Rs 12 lakh in view of the Delhi elections. ""They have achieved their aim and won in the Delhi assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra on Monday responded to the controversy sparked by his show at Mumbai's Habitat Studio . ""I will not apologise,"" Kamra asserted in his first reaction, taking aim at the ""mob and politicians"" over the backlash to his joke.The uproar stemmed from a segment where he parodied a popular Hindi song from Dil Toh Pagal Hai, referring to Eknath Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor).The incident led to chaotic protests and vandalism by Shinde-led Sena party workers.Taking to X, Kamra posted a series of statements addressing people involved in it. Targeting ""mob"" for studio's vandalism, Kamra said, ""An entertainment venue is merely a platform. A space for all sorts of shows. Habitat (or any other venue) is not responsible for my comedy, nor does it have any power or control over what I say or do.

But will the law be fairly and equally deployed against those who have decided that vandalism is the appropriate response to being offended by a joke? And against the unelected members of the BMC, who have arrived today at Habitat, without prior notice, and tore the place down with hammers?

December 2023: India imported approximately 191,600 barrels per day (bpd). Reliance Industries received around 127,000 bpd, while Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and HPCL-Mittal Energy received approximately 37,000 bpd and 28,000 bpd, respectively.

January 2024: India's imports rose to over 254,000 bpd, which was nearly half of Venezuela's total oil exports of almost 557,000 bpd for the month.

President Donald Trump said on Monday he would levy a 25 percent tariff across the board on any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela, as he escalated trade wars with a number of US foes and allies.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse,"" he wrote on his Truth Social network. ""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country.""In December 2023 and January 2024, India became the top buyer of Venezuelan crude oil. In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.Announcing the new tarrif, Trump said on his Truth Social platform: ""President Donald J. Trump announced today that the United States of America will be putting what is known as a Secondary Tariff on the Country of Venezuela, for numerous reasons, including the fact that Venezuela has purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals, many of whom are murderers and people of a very violent nature. Among the gangs they sent to the United States, is Tren de Aragua, which has been given the designation of “Foreign Terrorist Organization.” We are in the process of returning them to Venezuela — It is a big task!

MP salary over the years

Constituency allowance, office expenses of MPs also up

NEW DELHI: The govt on Monday notified a 24% increase in salaries of members of Parliament (MPs), with effect from April 1, 2023, on the basis of the cost inflation index, taking their monthly remuneration to Rs 1.24 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier.In a notification, the parliamentary affairs ministry said the daily allowance for sitting members, and pension and additional pension for every year of service in excess of five years for former members, have also been increased.While the daily allowance has been increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500, pension for former MPs has been increased from Rs 25,000 per month to Rs 31,000 per month, it said. Daily allowance can be drawn by MPs while attending Parliament sessions and parliamentary committee meetings.The additional pension for every year of service in excess of five years has been increased from Rs 2,000 per month to Rs 2,500 per month.Now, an MP will get Rs 1.24 lakh per month as salary, Rs 87,000 per month as constituency allowance as against Rs 70,000 earlier, and Rs 75,000 towards office expenses as against Rs 60,000 earlier. In the last revision in 2018, MPs’ salary was increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh.Govt had put in place a sys- tem for automatic revision of salaries and allowances every five years by indexing it to in- flation — doing away with the practice of MPs making recom- mendations for fixing salaries.During the Covid pandemic in 2020, govt slashed salaries of MPs and ministers by 30% for one year. Congress MP Harish Meena questioned the real gain that salary hike will bring to parliamentarians.He argued the pre-hike salary of Rs 12 lakh was within the IT exemption brack- et while the increase of Rs 24,000 has brought the salary in the tax slab.Bharat Adivasi Party MP Rajkumar Roat said he was happy with the increase in salary but govt should increase MPLADS fund to Rs 5 crore, as is available to MLAs in Rajasthan. He said MPs have to spend a lot of money in travel and catering to various emergencies in their constituencies, and the salary hike would provide some relief in view of price rise.","Daily allowance for sitting members, and pension and additional pension for every year of service in excess of five years for former members, have also been increased.

'Step in the right direction': Dhankhar praises CJI



'Not a trash bin'



NEW DELHI: The Allahabad HC Bar association has strongly opposed the Supreme Court's decision to transfer Justice Yashwant Varma from Delhi high court to Allahabad high court, amid the recovery of a substantial amount of cash from his official residence after a fire incident on March 14.After a general house meeting in Prayagraj on Monday, Anil Tiwari, Allahabad HC Bar president, condemned the move and demanded further action. ""We have passed 11 proposals. First, we will not tolerate his (Justice Yashwant Varma) transfer here under any circumstances; it did not happen today, nor should it happen in the future,"" he said.He further urged the CJI to allow investigating agencies to take action. ""We request the Chief Justice of India to permit the CBI and ED to file an FIR against him and conduct a trial, as is done for any political leader or bureaucrat, since the incident is not part of any judicial function.""Tiwari also called for impeachment proceedings against Justice Varma. ""We have requested the government to initiate the impeachment process, which should proceed as soon as possible to prevent any attempts to destroy evidence. We have also questioned the appointment system, stating that it is unfair. The collegium system only provides opportunities to well-connected individuals.""The Supreme Court Collegium, led by the CJI Sanjiv Khanna along with four senior-most judges, issued a resolution recommending Justice Varma’s transfer back to his parent court, the Allahabad high court.The Collegium reviewed the transfer proposal on March 20. The top court has clarified that the transfer is unrelated to the in-house inquiry initiated by the Chief Justice of the Delhi high court regarding the cash recovery.Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar praised CJI Khanna for upholding judicial transparency amid the ongoing controversy.Dhankhar mentioned that, for the first time since Independence, a Chief Justice has publicly disclosed all relevant material without withholding any information.""This is a step in the right direction. The formation of a committee by the Chief Justice and his vigilance are also noteworthy. Institutions like the judiciary and legislature function best when their internal mechanisms are efficient, prompt, and uphold public trust,"" he added.This is not the first time the Allahabad HC Bar association has opposed the transfer. Last week, it wrote to Chief Justice Arun Bhansali, stating that the Allahabad HC is ""not a trash bin."" The association linked the decision to broader concerns about the judicial appointment and transfer system, arguing that it had weakened public faith in the rule of law.Justice Yashwant Varma, in his response to the inquiry panel, has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations an attempt to malign him. In a letter to the Chief Justice of the Delhi HC, he stated that neither he nor his family had any connection to the cash allegedly discovered at the site.","The Allahabad HC Bar association has strongly opposed the Supreme Court's decision to transfer Justice Yashwant Varma.

NEW DELHI: Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates in a case of Rs 50 crore fraudulent withdrawal of death compensations, ED on Friday attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.This was not the first time the agency had acted against a judge accused of alleged bribery or association with fraudsters engaged in fixing benches and cultivating judges for favourable judgments. Apart from the known instances, the agency is also learned to be keeping a close surveillance on conflicts of interest of judges and alleged efforts to bribe them.On Aug 10 in 2023, ED arrested Panchkula's former special court judge Sudhir Parmar in connection with alleged bribery and for favouring accused in a money laundering case against real estate developer IREO and its promoter Lalit Goyal.Goyal was arrested by the agency just a month before it took Parmar into custody. Panchkula's special CBI court judge was suspended by Punjab and Haryana high court in April that year after agencies produced ""incriminating evidence"" against him for allegedly favouring the IREO promoters accused in a money laundering investigation .ED later arrested Goyal's associates and promoters of M3M, Basant Bansal and Pankaj Bansal, in a separate case. ED in its remand note had claimed that ""Sudhir Parmar (the Panchkula judge) was showing favouritism to the accused Roop Bansal, his brother Basant Bansal, the owners of M3M, and Lalit Goyal, the owner of IREO Group, in lieu of undue advantages"".In yet another case, while probing the Chhattisgarh PDS scam pertaining to the period of the previous Congress-led govt of Bhupesh Baghel, ED came across evidence of alleged liaisoning between two senior IAS officers who were accused in the case and a judge of the Chhattisgarh high court influencing the trial.ED brought the issue to the notice of Supreme Court, which transferred the judge in question to Patna high court, an action similar to what the SC collegium had proposed in case of a judge of Delhi high court after alleged recovery of a huge pile of cash from his residence.In the case of Chhattisgarh HC judge, as reported by TOI, ED had told SC that two IAS officers, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla, ""were in touch with the high court judge who granted bail to Shukla"". The agency further alleged that the then advocate general of the state had been liaising between the two accused and the judge, indirectly alleging quid pro quo in relief granted to the babus under investigation in the PDS scam.","Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates, ED attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.

NEW DELHI: India will now for the first time conduct a major naval exercise called `Aikeyme’ with 10 African countries, as part of the continuing military outreach to the continent where China has made major strategic inroads, even as it keeps a close watch on the threats posed by Somali pirates and Houthi rebels in the region.The Navy will next month also launch another maiden initiative called `Indian Ocean ship (IOS) Sagar’, under which a combined crew of Indian sailors and 44 personnel from nine friendly foreign countries will man offshore patrol vessel INS Sunayna during her deployment to the south-west Indian Ocean Region (IOR) from April m5 to May 8.“Over the past 10 years, the Indian Navy has deepened its partnerships with navies and agencies of IOR countries to enhance maritime security in consonance with the govt’s vision of `Sagar’ (security and growth for all in the region),” Navy deputy chief Vice Admiral Tarun Sobti on Monday.“With the announcement of `Mahasagar’ (mutual and holistic advancement for security across the regions) by the PM during his visit to Mauritius in March, Aikeyme and IOS Sagar -- first of their kind initiatives -- are aimed at consolidating India’s stature as the ‘preferred security partner’ and `first responder in the IOR,” he said.While attacks by Somali pirates and Houthi rebels in the region have receded since Dec, an Indian warship is permanently deployed in the Gulf of Aden and adjoining seas, and more will be sent if piracy gains “ascendancy” again, the deputy chief added.The multi-nation Aikeyme exercise, or the `Africa-India key maritime engagement’, will be conducted off Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania from April 13 to 18. “We are looking to make the exercise a biennial endeavour. This time it includes east African countries. In the next edition, we will invite west African countries as well to make it a larger African exercise,” Vice Admiral Sobti said.The countries taking part in Aikeyme, which will be inaugurated by defence minister Rajnath Singh, include Tanzania (which is co-hosting it), the Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles and South Africa.The exercise will focus on VBSS (visit board search and seizure) drills, arms firings, helicopter operations, seamanship evolutions, search and rescue missions, among others. “There will also be table-top and command post exercises on anti-piracy operations and information-sharing,” Vice Admiral Sobti said.India and Africa give immense importance to maritime security and have reiterated their commitment to increase cooperation in tackling threats such as piracy, drugs smuggling, trafficking and other illegal activities through sharing of information and surveillance, he added.The IOS Sagar, in turn, will see 44 personnel -- already undergoing training at Kochi -- from Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Seychelles and South Africa on board INS Sunayna, which will set sail from Karwar on April 5.The warship will undertake port calls at Dar-es-Salaam, Nacala, Port Louis, Port Victoria and Male as well as undertake joint surveillance of EEZs of Tanzania, Mozambique, Mauritius and Seychelles.",India will now for the first time conduct a major naval exercise with 10 African countries.

NEW DELHI: A CCTV video from the office of controversial preacher Bajinder Singh has surfaced online, showing him physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.The footage was reportedly recorded in February 2025 and has triggered massive outrage, with critics calling for strict action against the self-styled Christian prophet .In the viral video, Singh is first seen throwing a mobile phone at an employee before approaching and slapping him. Moments later, he is seen attacking a woman who had come to his office with her child.As seen in the footage, he first threw a pile of papers at her before pushing her during an altercation. The incident quickly escalated into a heated argument, with others in the office intervening to separate them.The footage comes at a time when Bajinder Singh is already under investigation in a sexual harassment case.As per PTI, a 22-year-old woman accused the pastor of harassment, stating that he took her mobile number and began sending her messages.From 2022, Singh allegedly made her sit alone in a church cabin, where he hugged her and touched her inappropriately. She further claimed that he threatened to have her and her family eliminated if she reported him. The Punjab Police registered a case against Singh on February 28, booking him under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Following the complaint, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed, led by Superintendent of Police Rupinder Kaur, to probe the allegations. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the matter and demanded swift action against Singh.Singh, however, has dismissed the allegations, calling them ""baseless.""Speaking to the media earlier, he said, ""Fake chats can be easily created these days. They should provide proof against me. Everyone in the church knows that she [the complainant] suffered from fits and was troubled by evil spirits. People come here for prayers, and our job is to pray. She is like our daughter"".Singh has a history of controversy. In 2018, he was arrested at Delhi airport over a sexual harassment case filed by a woman from Zirakpur. More recently, a Mohali court issued warrants against him in that case. In 2022, he was accused of taking money from a Delhi-based family for treating their daughter, who later died.The preacher has also been on the radar of tax authorities, with income tax raids conducted at his premises in 2023.Despite these allegations, Singh remains a well-known figure with a massive social media following. His YouTube channel, ""Prophet Bajinder Singh,"" has over 3.74 million subscribers, and his sermons often attract large crowds, both in India and abroad.Celebrities such as actors Chunky Pandey and Aditya Pancholi have previously endorsed him.","CCTV video shows self-styled Christian prophet Bajinder Singh physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.

The state has also been told that a SC caste can only be given affirmative action benefits like reservation in its own name and not under any other group, even if it is part of the same sub-social bloc.The negative order is in response to Haryana's recent request to Centre that it should drop the names of 'Chura', 'Bhangi' and 'Mochi' from the list of SC communities for the state. As reported by TOI, the state has argued that the three names are ""objectionable and irrelevant"", in a move designed to end the usage of caste names that are widely deployed as pejoratives.To buttress its claim, Haryana had in its letter attached a 2013 state govt order in which it had announced that 'Chura, Bhangi' and 'Mochi' have been deleted from the local SC list, and the communities will be issued caste certificates in the name of 'Balmiki' and 'Chamar', respectively. The more than a decade old state govt order was addressed to all senior authorities of Haryana, especially the field administrators whose domain includes the process of issuing caste certificates.The proposal and the argument, however, have not found favour with Centre. Union social justice and empowerment ministry is learnt to have recently replied to Haryana that its 2013 order is ""impermissible"", and urged it to bring the circular in consonance with the Article 341 of the Constitution - which says that the power of inclusion in, and exclusion from, the SC list lies with the Parliament.","Haryana had asked Centre to drop the names of 'Chura', 'Bhangi' and 'Mochi' from the list of SC communities for the state.

Supreme Court Monday set up a 10-member national task force under Justice (retd) Ravindra Bhat to analyse causes for student suicides and suggest measures to prevent such deaths on campuses. The team will include doctors and mental health experts.The directive came as the court pulled up police for not lodging a case into the suicide of two IIT-Delhi students in 2023 despite their parents alleging casteist harassment. SC asked police to lodge an FIR and investigate the allegations. It said police could not take a shortcut ""just because something happened in the hostel of an...institution like IIT Delhi"".Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine the issue of mental health problems on campuses and set up a 10-member National Task Force under a former apex court judge.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan was hearing a petition by parents of two IIT-Delhi students who had taken the extreme step in 2023. Holding that lodging of FIRs was mandatory in cognisable offences, the court pulled up Delhi Police for not lodging a case despite the parents' complaint that the two students died by suicide after facing caste-based harassment from hostel inmates and faculty members.It directed Delhi Police to lodge an FIR and initiate a probe by an officer not below rank of assistant commissioner of police into allegations of caste discrimination in IIT-D.Noting that 98 students had died by suicide in top premier educational institutes since 2018 - 39 at IITs, 25 at NITs, 25 at central universities, four at IIMs, three at IISERs and two at IIITs - the bench expanded the litigation initiated by the aggrieved parents and set up a task force headed by retired SC Justice Ravindra Bhat to analyse and suggest measures to prevent such suicides. It will also comprise psychiatrist Alok Sarin, professors of clinical psychology Mary E John and Seema Mehrotra, and senior advocate Aparna Bhat.""Recurring instances of student suicides in higher educational institutions, including at private educational institutions, serve as a grim reminder of the inadequacy and ineffectiveness of the existing legal and institutional framework in addressing mental health concerns of students on campuses and to prevent students from taking the extreme step,"" it said.The court asked the panel to prepare a comprehensive report on predominant causes which led to such suicides, including but not limited to ragging, caste-based discrimination, gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, academic pressure, financial burden, mental health-related stigma, discrimination based on ethnicity, tribal identity, disability, sexual orientation, political views, religious belief or any other ground.Pulling up Delhi Police for not lodging a case in the IIT-Delhi suicides, the bench said, ""Even if police were of the view that there was no element of truth in what had been alleged by the appellants (students' parents), it could have said so only after registering an FIR and conducting an investigation.

The bench stated Bhushan’s client can approach police, which, if it finds substance in the complaint about the alleged attempt to influence the witness, will take steps to investigate. Kant asked prosecution to streamline the trial proceedings by pruning the list of witnesses for early examination of crucial and eyewitnesses.Ashish’s counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Dave protested and said Bhushan’s client had the habit of bringing new charges every time SC hears the matter. He said Ashish has been living in Delhi and scrupulously adhered to the bail conditions and pleaded that he may be permitted to visit his hometown Lakhimpur Kheri to celebrate Ram Navami with his family.Violence at Lakhimpur Kheri had erupted in Oct 2021 when an SUV mowed down four among farmers protesting the visit of UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. Angered by the deaths, the farmers lynched a driver and two BJP workers. A journalist, too, died in the violence.",Ashish Mishra is an accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident of Oct 2021 which claimed eight lives. He is the son of former Union minister Ajay Mishra 'Teni' Ashish's counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Dave protested and said Bhushan's client had the habit of bringing new charges every time SC hears the matter.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119445080,imgsize-968593,width-400,resizemode-4/119445080.jpg"

Bulldozers will target more buildings soon: Nagpur official

‘Remove dog statue at Shivaji memorial’

NAGPUR: Municipal bulldozers rolled into two Nagpur localities Monday morning, flattening two houses linked to suspects behind the riots on the night of March 17, including alleged mastermind Fahim Khan . The action, carried out under a security blanket of more than 150 police personnel and anti-riot squads, came just hours before Bombay high court's Nagpur bench halted demolitions of homes tied to the accused.Hours after the demolition began in the morning, Nagpur bench of HC issued a stay on demolitions and criticising the administration for its ""high-handedness"".The court's intervention followed petitions challenging Nagpur Municipal Corporation's action as unlawful and in violation of an SC ruling against punitive demolitions based on criminal allegations.By the time the Bombay high court's stay order was issued, alleged riot mastermind Fahim Khan's two-storey house near Raza Masjid in Sanjay Bagh Colony was already reduced to rubble. Another targeted property - owned by Abdul Hafiz Sheikh Lal in Johripura slum - had part of its structure demolished for unauthorised extensions. NMC cited violations under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, issuing 24-hour demolition notices on Sunday.Authorities are pushing ahead with their bulldozer policy after CM Devendra Fadnavis warned Saturday that properties of those responsible for the violence would be demolished. The clashes in central Nagpur left one dead, over 40 wounded and more than 50 vehicles damaged. Khan was taken into custody on March 19. A burqa seller and son of a cycle repair shop owner, he had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections against Union minister Nitin Gadkari, securing 1,000 votes.Khan has been charged with two cases of sedition. Police alleged that he spread inflammatory content through viral videos in the hours leading up to the riots, which erupted after demonstrations demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb from Maharashtra's Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.In Sanjay Bagh Colony, NMC's anti-encroachment squad arrived at 8am, backed by a police cordon that locked down the neighbourhood. ""Despite the plot's lease expiring in 2020 and the layout being handed over to NMC, Khan built the multi-storey house without approval from the civic town planning department,"" an official said. By 10.40am, as the 24-hour deadline expired, the demolition began. Within two hours, Khan's home - registered under his 69-year-old mother Mehrunissa Khan - was gone. In the high court, petitioners led by Mehrunissa, said the structures had all necessary approvals dating back to 2003 and had never faced objections from municipal authorities - until now.""The NMC's demolition notice is not only arbitrary but also unconstitutional and amounts to targeted harassment and selective enforcement, which is legally impermissible,"" the petitioners claimed. They pointed to Supreme Court guidelines requiring the civic body to rebuild sanctioned homes if demolished unlawfully. The division bench of Justice Nitin Sambre and Justice Vrushali Joshi sought an explanation from the NMC commissioner for the razing of properties.A senior official said the crackdown followed a list provided by police, identifying 51 suspects in the riots, including eight top-priority targets. However, authorities struggled to directly link properties to the accused, as many were registered under family members. Authorities have issued a demolition notice to Aziza Begum Shaikh Salim, whose property in Yadav Nagar allegedly includes illegal extensions. Police linked the building to a relative accused in the riots. Officials said more properties will be targeted in the coming days as teams work to identifyunauthorised constructions linked to those accused of last week's violence.Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and former BJP RS MP, has called for removal of a dog’s statue near the Maratha king’s Samadhi at Raigad fort in Maharashtra. Sambhajiraje has made the demand asserting there is no historical basis for the existence of the dog, named Waghya, during Shivaji’s time.",Alleged riot mastermind Fahim Khan's two-storey house in Sanjay Bagh Colony razed within 2 hours. Another targeted property in Johripura slum had part of its structure demolished for unauthorised extensions.

MUMBAI: Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray supported comedian Kunal Kamra , saying he had spoken the truth and reflected public sentiment by alluding to deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde as a ""traitor.""""I don't think he said anything wrong by attacking a traitor. A traitor is a traitor,"" Thackeray said on Monday, speaking outside the state assembly. The attack on the Khar hotel, he said, ""has been done by the 'gaddar' Sena. But they do nothing against those who attack Chhatrapati Shivaji."" Thackeray said the attack was an embarrassment for Devendra Fadnavis, who was home minister.""They are saying we can do what we want. The chief minister does not matter,"" he said. Thackeray also said the govt should compensate Kamra or the studio which was attacked.""There has to be equal justice for all. If they are compensating people for the Nagpur riots, why not this?""

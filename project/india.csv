"Maharashtra CM pick: Day after Mahayuti leaders' meet, Eknath Shinde goes to his village, talks on govt pushed back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-cm-pick-day-after-the-mahayuti-leaders-meet-eknath-shinde-goes-to-his-village-talks-on-govt-pushed-back/articleshow/115825022.cms,"Eknath Shinde

Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday

A day after the Mahayuti leaders' meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, caretaker CM Eknath Shinde left for his village Dare Tamb in Mahabaleshwar taluka in Satara district. Sources said the BJP is working on him to get him to accept the deputy CM's post.The swearing-in of the Maharashtra cabinet is unlikely until Dec 5 as the talks could only progress after partners agree on the return of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as CM with nominees of Shiv Sena and NCP as the two deputies.The swearing-in was earlier expected to be held on Monday. However, the negotiations are unlikely to be wrapped up because of the preoccupation of Amit Shah, who has to balance the competing demands of Mahayuti partners with the DGPs' conference until Saturday. Sources now expect the oath-taking to be scheduled on Dec 5 at Azad Maidan both because of the tricky nature of Shah's assignment and the engagements of PM Modi, who is billed to be the star of the show.The deliberations at Shah's residence late Thursday night saw outgoing CM Eknath Shinde signing up on the logic that BJP, with 132 MLAs of its own and having lined up another five, was the natural claimant for the CM's office, sources familiar with the negotiations said.While Shinde did not spell out whether he would serve as deputy CM along with NCP's Ajit Pawar , BJP sources remained hopeful of persuading him to be part of a Fadnavis team, with NCP sharing the optimism. There also appears to be an understanding among the partners over the Speaker, an important figure when it comes to coalitions, being a BJP nominee. Significantly, Shinde dropped hints about Sena's interest in having his nominee as chairperson of the legislative council and BJP, according to sources, did not look averse to acceding to the desire as part of compensation to Shinde.The appreciation of Shinde's contribution in Mahayuti's grand return and the ""sacrifice"" he is likely to make for the sake of the unity of the alliance will not extend to BJP acquiescing in an insistence for the home department. Fadnavis would get to retain home, while Ajit Pawar is seen as a shoe-in for sixth term as finance minister of the richest and the most industrialised state.Both Shiv Sena and NCP have argued that the power-sharing arrangement cannot be worked out merely on the basis of mathematics because doing so would, for all practical purposes, mean installing a BJP regime, given that the party's own numbers are within striking distance of the magic mark of 145. However, unlike a scheme based on numbers where berths are assigned on the basis of who has got how many MLAs, crafting an arrangement expected to be based on abstract considerations like ""fairness"" and ""objectivity"" can be difficult, with each partner having notions which may not gel.In Delhi, Shinde, speaking to the media on Thursday night, said the meeting with Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda, along with his colleagues from the Mahayuti-Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar-was cordial. ""The meeting was to discuss govt formation. Today was the first meeting; tomorrow, a second meeting will be held in Mumbai on CM and portfolio allocation. I have already announced Shiv Sena's support to Mahayuti CM candidate, so that deadlock was resolved,"" he said.When no Mahayuti meeting happened and news came that Shinde would be in the village for the next two days, his colleague Uday Samant told media that Shinde was running a fever the past couple of days and went to his village, to a healthier environment to recuperate.Asked if Shinde would accept dy CM's post, Samant said, ""We want Shinde Saheb to be in Maharashtra politics, and he should be in govt."" Sources said there is Shani Amavasya on Saturday and Sunday, additional reasons for no action happening.BJP sources said its elected MLAs have so far not been called to Mumbai to elect the party's legislative leader. ""This meeting is likely to be held on Monday. Thereafter, the legislative heads of the three parties will meet to decide on the CM, Dy CM posts and portfolio allocation,"" sources said.BJP sources said if Fadnavis, a former CM, could be dy CM, then Shinde too could take up the post, adding it would send out a clear message that it is not just BJP netas who have to compromise.",Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday.

Sambhal survey report

: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday directed the Sambhal district administration to maintain peace and harmony in the communally charged area and ordered the trial court , which had ordered a survey of Shahi Jama Masjid on the Hindu side's suit claiming it to be Harihar temple, not to proceed further till Allahabad high court heard the mosque management committee's plea. Five people had died in violence in the wake of the survey on Nov 24.Importantly, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar refused to accede to senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi's plea on behalf of the mosque committee to halt the survey of the mosque being carried out by an advocate commissioner, who was entrusted with the task on the Nov 19. However, it asked the trial court to put the survey report in sealed cover. It also faulted the mosque committee for bypassing HC to move SC directly.SC requested HC to give priority to the committee's appeal against the trial court order and take it up for hearing within three days of its filing. It clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter.After the bench said it would keep the mosque committee's special leave petition challenging the Nov 19 order pending in Supreme Court while giving liberty to it to move high court for appropriate relief, Ahmadi said the advocate commissioner may file his survey report before the trial judge in the interregnum. ""He should be directed not to file his survey report,"" he pleaded.The CJI Khanna-led bench said, ""That is something different. We will not restrain him from filing the survey report. If the report is submitted by advocate commissioner, it will be kept in sealed cover and will not be opened by the trial court.""Ahmadi said the order of trial court could cause ""great mischief"" across the country, which was witnessing a new trend.""To my knowledge, there are at least 10 similar suits filed across India claiming rights over mosques. In many cases, the modus operandi is to appoint a surveyor on the first day of hearing. Thereafter a narrative is built,"" he added.""No further steps in the suit shall be taken by trial court without further orders from HC,"" the bench ordered.SC posted further hearing on Jan 6 after advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, appearing for one of the plaintiffs, said trial court had fixed the hearing on Jan 8.Laying stress on maintenance of law and order as well as peace and harmony in the area, the bench sternly told additional solicitor general K M Natraj, who appeared for the Sambhal administration, ""We do not want any untoward incident to happen in the meanwhile. The district administration must ensure peace and harmony. We do not want to say anything more at this stage.""CJI Khanna told Natraj, ""Under Section 43 of the new mediation law, the district administration must form peace committees comprising members of all communities.

Can state police arrest central agency staff?

NEW DELHI: In a significant response to growing cases of arrests of officers of central probe agencies by state police, Supreme Court Friday pitched for balance between competing objectives of protecting the Centre's functionaries from vengeful actions which could trigger a constitutional crisis, while not restraining state police from probing allegations of corruption.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan found themselves addressing the conflictual question while hearing a case related to the arrest of an ED officer by Tamil Nadu police for alleged corruption.Hearing a case related to the arrest of an ED officer by Tamil Nadu police for alleged corruption, a Supreme Court bench led by Justice Surya Kant said the moot question was if the officer was from central govt, should he be arrested by state police. If central govt had given permission to proceed against that officer, it was a different scenario altogether, it said.Additional advocate general for Tamil Nadu Amit Anand Tiwari told the bench, also comprising Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, that the ED officer was caught red-handed accepting Rs 20 lakh bribe and that investigation in the case under Prevention of Corruption Act was almost complete. ""State police were ready to file a chargesheet but waited because of ED approaching SC,"" Tiwari said.When the accused officer's counsel attempted to interject, Tiwari objected and said the accused could not have a say in the matter of investigation or which agency should investigate a crime. The bench said, ""The accused can have no say in the matter of investigation, but he has a right tofair investigation .""Referring to the conflicting issues involved in the case, the bench said, ""In a federal structure , each and every component should be allowed to retain its exclusive domains of jurisdiction. Take a hypothetical scenario - if a state police, out of vendetta, arrests central govt officials, it will create a constitutional crisis. So, to say that state will have exclusive power to arrest would be dangerous to the federal structure. But to deny state police its power to investigate a crime within its jurisdiction would be undesirable. We will deliberate and consider arguments from both sides to strike a balance between these two competing aspects of police power.""The bench further said, ""This is a classic case of state vs the Union and we will consider the larger federal structure scheme and determine the mechanism for investigation into such cases."" It extended the interim bail granted to the arrested ED officer till further orders.","A Supreme Court bench led by Justice Surya Kant said the moot question was if the officer was from central govt, should he be arrested by state police.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) arrested a labourer Friday for allegedly sharing sensitive information about movement of Indian Coast Guard (ICG) ships with a Pakistani agent. The accused Dipesh Gohel is a welder-cum-labourer at Okha jetty in coastal Devbhumi Dwarka district. For a daily payment of Rs 200, he allegedly passed on confidential information about ICG ships arriving at the jetty to a Pak-based woman, SP (ATS) K Siddharth said, adding Gohel was charged under BNS Sections 61 and 147 for criminal conspiracy and waging war against govt.ATS had been keeping a close watch on Gohel after receiving a tip-off that he was in touch with an agent of ISI or a Pakistan army officer. Technical surveillance mounted after the tip-off established that phone calls and messages to Gohel emanated from Pakistan, the SP said. “For past three years, Gohel was employed by a contractor who repairs ICG vessels at Okha jetty. He came in contact with a woman named Sahima on Facebook nearly seven months ago. She then started talking to him on WhatsApp,” said the SP.The woman, who told Gohel she worked for Pakistan’s navy, offered to pay him Rs 200 per day if he shared names and numbers of ICG ships and their movement, the SP said. Gohel provided the account details of three of his friends, who received Rs 42,000 in total from the woman through UPI transactions over the past seven months. Gohel would then take cash from them, said the SP.","Dipesh Gohel is a welder-cum-labourer at Okha jetty in coastal Devbhumi Dwarka district.

The city's 24-hour average AQI reached 325 ('very poor') at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) daily national bulletin.This was a deterioration from Wednesday's reading of 303 ('very poor').Weather analysts noted consistent wind speeds of 10-12 km/hr during both days, but predict reduced speeds over the weekend due to an approaching western disturbance. ""The winds will slow down within the next two to three days, going calm. This will impact the air quality negatively,"" said an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).IITM's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS) has predicted: ""The air quality is likely to be in the Very Poor category from November 29, 2024, to December 1, 2024.

(Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

He said that after a new government is formed the matter will be investigated.A government resolution (GR) issued on Thursday allocated Rs 20 crore for the strengthening of the Maharashtra State Waqf Board in 2024-25, with Rs 2 crore already disbursed. The Chief Executive Officer of the Board has been instructed to ensure that the expenditure remains within the prescribed norms.The Maharashtra BJP, clarified that the decision was made by administrative officers and stated that the GR had been scrapped following strong opposition from the BJP. The party reiterated its stance that the Waqf Board has no place in the Constitution.""Fake news that the BJP-Mahayuti government has given funds of 10 crores to the Maharashtra Waqf Board immediately is spreading. This wrong decision was taken mutually by the officials at the administrative level.

Mallikarjun Kharge at CWC meet: 'How long will you depend on national leaders?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lack-of-unity-and-statements-against-each-other-harm-us-a-lot-mallikarjun-kharge-on-congress-election-losses-at-cwc-meet/articleshow/115808847.cms,"Kharge at CWC meet (Image credit: Kharge X handle)

NEW DELHI: After back to back losses in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge addressed the party’s ""below-expectation"" performance during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Friday. He questioned the dependence on the national leaders and issues and called on the party workers to focus on local issues.""Till when will you fight state elections with the help of national leaders and national issues?"" he questioned during the opening remarks of the CWC meet while urging the party to focus on localised concerns and prepare detailed strategies tailored to each state. He also stressed that election preparations should begin at least a year in advance. ""Our teams should be present in the field well in advance. The first task should be to check the voter lists so that the votes of those in our favour remain in the list under all circumstances,"" he added.Further, addressing the Congress' performance in the elections this year, he celebrated the Congress’s resurgence in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections but admitted that the subsequent state assembly elections did not yield the expected results. ""The momentum was in our favour in the elections. But just the momentum being in our favour is not a guarantee of victory. We will have to learn to convert the atmosphere into results. What is the reason that we are not able to take advantage of this momentum?"" Kharge questioned, urging the party to introspect and identify its shortcomings.He pointed out that despite the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) forming governments in two of the four states that went to polls after Lok Sabha, the Congress’s own performance was disappointing. Reflecting on these results, Kharge emphasised the need for urgent corrective measures. ""These results are a message for us. We need to immediately learn from them and address our weaknesses at the organizational level,"" he said.The Congress president then went on to hint at the in-fighting and disunity that proved as a setback for them. ""The most important thing that I keep saying is that lack of unity and statements against each other harm us a lot. Unless we fight elections unitedly and stop making statements against each other, how will we be able to defeat our opponents politically?"" Kharge asked.""Therefore, it is important that we strictly follow discipline. We have to remain united under all circumstances. The party also has the weapon of discipline. But we do not want to put our colleagues in any bondage. Therefore, everyone needs to think that the victory of the Congress party is our victory and the defeat is our defeat. Our strength lies in the strength of the party,"" he added.Then, Kharge moved on to raising doubts about the credibility of the electoral process, Kharge criticised the role of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and the Election Commission. ""I believe that EVM has made the electoral process suspicious. The Election Commission is a constitutional institution, so the less said about it, the better. But it is their constitutional responsibility to ensure free and fair elections in the country,” he remarked.Reflecting on Congress’s historical legacy, Kharge reminded members of the party’s pivotal role in shaping modern India and empowering its citizens. He called on members to focus on issues that resonate with the public, such as unemployment, inflation, economic inequality, and social justice. At the same time, he warned against divisive forces, accusing the ruling BJP of using religious polarization to distract from its failures.Acknowledging the challenges posed by ""propaganda and misinformation"", Kharge urged the party to improve its micro-communication strategies and take timely decisions to counter these tactics effectively. ""We will have to improve the ways of fighting elections in every situation. Because times have changed. The ways of fighting elections have changed. We will have to improve our micro-communication strategy as compared to our opponents. ,"" he said while adding that they'll ""have to take tough decisions with confidence.""Kharge further called for unity, determination, and tough decision-making to bring the Congress back to power. ""We have overcome challenges in the past as well. We will have to move ahead by overcoming the current challenges,"" he said, urging the party to stand united and committed to restoring progress, peace, and harmony in the country.The CWC meet saw Kharge presiding over the session, with several leaders including LoP Rahul Gandhi, alongside AICC general secretaries Priyanka Gandhi Vadra , K C Venugopal and Jairam Ramesh, among others.","Mallikarjun Kharge addressed the party’s ""below-expectation"" performance during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) He questioned the dependence on the national leaders and issues and called on the party workers to focus on local issues.

Internet services restored: Internet services, suspended after the November 24 violence, were restored on Friday afternoon, marking a step towards restoring normalcy in the district. Friday prayers held peacefully: District authorities ensured that prayers at the Shahi Jama Masjid and other mosques passed off peacefully, deploying heavy police presence and installing additional CCTV cameras and drones for surveillance. Tensions since survey order: The controversy began after a civil court ordered a survey of the mosque following claims by a Hindu group that the mosque was built on the ruins of a temple. November 24 violence: On November 24, clashes between protesters and security personnel near the mosque resulted in stone pelting, arson, and the deaths of four people, with several others injured.

The apex court also instructed the Uttar Pradesh government to take measures to maintain peace and harmony in the region.The situation in Sambhal had been tense since November 24, when clashes erupted near the mosque, resulting in stone pelting and arson that led to the deaths of four people. In response, internet services were suspended and prohibitory orders were enforced. However, in a bid to restore normalcy, internet services were restored on Friday afternoon, and the day’s Friday prayers were conducted peacefully, according to officials.The Supreme Court bench, led by Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna, further directed that the survey report prepared by the court-appointed commissioner be kept sealed until the Allahabad high court or an appropriate appellate forum hears the mosque committee’s appeal. The bench also urged the formation of a peace committee comprising members from both communities to foster dialogue and prevent further unrest.","Supreme Court temporarily halted all proceedings related to the mosque survey at the trial court level.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s forest department has initiated an investigation after a study by researchers from University of Cambridge claimed that “digital technologies such as camera traps and drones, deployed for tracking wild animals at Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), are infringing on the privacy and rights of women living in villages and settlements near the forest”.The peer-reviewed research article — ‘Gendered Forests: Digital Surveillance Technologies for Conservation and Gender-environment Relationships’ — by Trishant Simlai and Chris Sandbrook, documents several incidents of privacy violations, including one in which an image of asemi-nude woman relieving herself was “inadvertently” captured by a camera trap.The woman was autistic, came from a marginalised caste group, and was unable to express her experience of being photographed to her family or other women. To make matters worse, young men, who were recently appointed as temporary forest personnel, accessed the photograph and circulated it on local social media groups. In response to this image-based abuse, residents from the woman's village destroyed camera traps in the adjacent forest areas and issued threats to set a forest personnel station ablaze,"" said the research, which was published on Nov 24.It also cited instances where women felt ""watched"" due to camera traps. ""This surveillance has discouraged women from collecting legally permitted forest resources like firewood and grass, as well as non-timber products such as herbs and honey,"" the authors of the research said.The study further said these technologies have curtailed traditional practices such as singing or engaging in loud conversations while navigating forests - behaviours that are not only culturally significant, but also serve as an essential countermeasure to deter attacks by wild animals . ""There is a 'baaghin' (tigress) with cubs in this part of our forest. If we don't sing or talk loudly, there is a chance of her being surprised and attacking us,"" a woman shared during the research conducted by Simlai, who spoke to 270 people in the settlements near Corbett over a period of 14 months in 2019. Incidentally, one woman interviewed during the research has since been killed in a tiger attack.Regarding the wider social implications , Simlai told TOI, ""The forest is a very gendered space where very complex bunch of social interactions happen between women. But camera traps, which are deployed throughout Uttarakhand, not just in CTR, are making women regulate their behaviour in terms of censoring conversations, singing less, or collecting less firewood or timber or forest produce that is around. The absence of consent in deploying these cameras is also a glaring issue that govt must address.""The study examines the dual role of surveillance technologies: while they perpetuate gender-based violence and reinforce patriarchal norms, they can also be repurposed for women's resistance, it noted. ""In one case, a woman led her abusive husband in front of a deployed camera trap with the objective to record domestic violence. She runs to the camera near her house whenever her husband gets drunk and beats her. In this way, she escapes being beaten and can also have proof if things get out of hand. Although such instances of utilising camera traps as tools of reverse surveillance or sousveillance are overshadowed by their role in propagating gendered structural violence, they warrant further investigation,"" the research highlighted.Ranjan Mishra, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, said, ""The director of Corbett will investigate the matter, and we will comment only after the probe is complete.""","Uttarakhand's forest department has initiated an investigation after a study by researchers from University of Cambridge.

This follows recent sanctions imposed by the US Treasury Department on 19 Indian companies and two individuals, citing their alleged role in aiding Russia’s military during the Ukraine conflict. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that India’s export controls comply fully with its international obligations on non-proliferation.Minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh in response to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha reiterated India’s commitment to adhering to global standards, saying, “India actively participates in key multilateral non-proliferation export control regimes (Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime) and contributes to the development and review of their control lists and guidelines.”The Indian government has assured the US that it takes appropriate measures to prevent violations of its export regulations. “The Government sensitizes Indian companies on export controls, including through regular outreach events. We are committed to taking appropriate action against any company that contravenes Indian laws,” the MEA added.Despite the sanctions, affected Indian firms downplayed their impact. Shreegee Impex Private Limited and TSMD Global, two of the sanctioned companies, stated that their operations remain unaffected as they have no trade links with the United States. Shreegee’s director, Praveen Tyagi, expressed confusion over the sanctions but maintained that the measures would not disrupt their business.

She also responded to BJP accusations, which blamed former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the removal of the marshals starting in November 2023.Atishi clarified that Kejriwal had, in fact, opposed the removal, referencing a letter from October 2023, in which the CM instructed that the marshals should remain in service, and called for disciplinary action against officials who had withheld their salaries.She accused the LG of removing the marshals without regard for public safety, a decision she said was politically motivated and harmful to the welfare of the marshals and their families.BJP leaders in the assembly dismissed the AAP’s narrative, insisting that the removal of the marshals was carried out under Kejriwal’s direction, and now the AAP was merely playing politics with the issue of their reinstatement.Gupta sought answers from Atishi saying the AAP government deployed bus marshals and then removed them.BJP MLA Abhay Verma questioned the ruling party’s ability to resolve the issue, asking why the AAP government, in power for nearly a decade, had failed to bring back the marshals.Urban development minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, however, highlighted that the regularization of bus marshals fell under the jurisdiction of the LG, as it involved ""services"" and ""law and order"" matters, areas where the Delhi government has limited authority.","Delhi chief minister Atishi says Aam Aadmi Party would not field a candidate against BJP’s leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta.

NEW DELHI: Dialling up pressure on Bangladesh, govt on Friday said the interim govt in Dhaka must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, instead of dismissing recent incidents of violence against Hindus and other minority communities as 'media exaggeration'.Responding to written questions in Lok Sabha about violence against Hindus in Bangladesh , external affairs minister S Jaishankar said Indian high commission in Dhaka was closely monitoring the situation. He reiterated that primary responsibility for safety of minorities in Bangladesh lies with the interim govt.""Our position on the matter is clear - the interim govt in Dhaka must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities. We are concerned at surge of extremist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation. These developments cannot be dismissed only as media exaggeration,"" ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.While expressing concern over extremist rhetoric, MEA also called for a ""fair, just and transparent legal process"" in case of religious leader Chinmoy Krishna Das who was arrested on sedition charges.Amid calls in Dhaka for a ban on Iskcon, with which Das was associated earlier, Indian govt also threw in its lot with the group as Jaiswal said that the group is a ""globally well regarded organisation with a strong record of social service"".On arrest of Das, MEA said as far as cases against individuals were concerned, India took note of the legal processes that are underway. ""We expect that these processes will deal with the case in a just, fair and transparent manner, ensuring full respect for the legal rights of all concerned.""In Lok Sabha, the EAM said govt has seen several reports of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, their homes and business establishments and of attacks on temples and religious places, including in Aug 2024, across Bangladesh.","Interim govt in Dhaka must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, Indian govt says.

NEW DELHI: Sending a clear message to investigating agencies that court cannot keep waiting for their reply and adjourning the case to grant them more time to respond, Supreme Court (SC) on Friday granted bail to an accused in Rs 6,000 crore ponzi scam as Enforcement Directorate (ED) failed to file a response.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih refused to grant ED more time to file response on the plea of M Muthukumar , an accused in a Rs 6,000 crore ponzi scam.

""Time was sought earlier by the respondent and it was granted. The respondent was given more than sufficient time to file a response. Appeal is allowed and the interim order is made absolute,"" the bench said.Muthukumar had approached the apex court through his lawyer Kiran Kumar Patra after his plea for anticipatory bail was rejected twice by the Madras high court.Granting relief to him, the apex court noted that the accused had been cooperating in the investigation and also providing all documents sought by ED in the case after interim protection was granted to him.In this case, LNS International Financial Services Ltd and its various directors were alleged to have cheated the general public under the guise of investing money in the stock market.

Sex with minor wife even if consensual is rape: Bombay HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sex-with-minor-wife-even-if-consensual-is-rape-bombay-hc/articleshow/115822035.cms,"File photo

NAGPUR: Bombay high court 's Nagpur bench recently ruled that sexual intercourse with a wife under 18 years of age, even if consensual, constitutes rape.The HC upheld the trial court's order sentencing the convict 10 years of rigorous imprisonment, reinforcing Supreme Court's precedent in Independent Thought versus Union of India . Delivering the verdict, Justice Govinda Sanap emphasised that marital rape exceptions under the IPC do not extend to minors. ""Sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 is rape regardless of marital status,"" he said.The case dates to 2019 and involves a minor victim in a three- four-year relationship with the convict. The victim, then a resident of Wardha, consistently rejected the man's advances. Facing financial difficulties, she later moved to another town for work, and the man followed her.Offering rides to and from her workplace, the man gained her trust before coercing her into a sexual relationship under the false promise of marriage. Their relationship eventually led to pregnancy. The accused then hastily arranged a makeshift marriage ceremony in a rented room, attended by a few neighbours.The victim later described the ceremony as a sham, devoid of legal validity or formalities. The man then pressured her to have an abortion, denied responsibility for the child, and accused her of infidelity. Left with no recourse, the victim reported the matter to Wardha police, leading to his prosecution."," Bombay high court's Nagpur bench recently ruled that sexual intercourse with a wife under 18 years of age, even if consensual, constitutes rape.

NEW DELHI: In a move that may help India's high-emission industries navigate the EU's carbon border tax regime by adopting clean manufacturing processes in due course, Niti Aayog, the govt think tank, has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors. This will also contribute to the country achieving its long-term net-zero emission (carbon neutrality) goal for 2070.The EU's carbon border tax -- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) -- is a tool to put a price on high-emission goods such as cement, aluminium, iron & steel and fertilisers that enter the 27 EU nations.If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will continue to attract tariff burden in the form of carbon border tax, impacting the country’s exports.The decarbonisation roadmaps for cement and aluminium, released by Niti Aayog last Wednesday, will also serve as reference manuals for India to decarbonise other sectors, in sync with the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement.The Aayog’s report shows that cement manufacturing, a significant source of carbon emissions, contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e of emissions worldwide in 2023.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions, which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Under the decarbonisation strategy, as suggested by the roadmap, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13tCO₂e per tonne by 2070.To enable deep decarbonisation in this sector, the roadmap proposes to prioritise the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scale-up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme.Similarly, the decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies a three-phase solution: transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC), enhanced grid connectivity in the short term and adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The report reveals that production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023.","Niti Aayog, the govt think tank, has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors.

‘No Internal Democracy’: Ex‑Congress Leader Shakeel Ahmad’s Bombshell Claims On Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Days after calling Rahul Gandhi “darpok” (coward) and “insecure”, former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad on Tuesday claimed that his residence faces a threat of attack. He shared a screenshot of a WhatsApp message which he alleged was circulated by party members, calling on district and assembly-level leaders to burn his effigy in protest over his “inappropriate statements” about Rahul Gandhi.Sharing the chats on X, Ahmad wrote: “Now my information has turned out to be absolutely spot on. Many thanks to the old mates from Congress. There's a saying in our Bihar that old friends are the ones who come in handy. Is this happening without Rahul ji's orders?”The message he posted read: “Former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad has been continuously making inappropriate statements about our respected leader Shri Rahul Gandhi. The top leadership has directed that all District Presidents and Assembly Presidents should, in their respective areas, burn an effigy of Shakeel Ahmad on 27/12/2026 to register strong protest.”Escalating the spat further, in a post late Monday, Ahmad further alleged that the Congress leadership in Bihar has ""ordered"" party workers to attack his residence.“Just now, some colleagues from the Congress have secretly informed me that the Congress national leadership has ordered the Bihar Congress/Youth Congress to attack my residences in Patna and Madhubani tomorrow, January 27, under the pretext of burning an effigy,” he wrote on X.The controversy follows Ahmad’s scathing remarks about Gandhi. “Rahul Gandhi is a coward and an insecure person. He does not get that 'boss feeling' before anyone who is senior to him or has a big public support. He is uncomfortable with any such person and is thus dictatorial and not democratic,” he told PTI.Congress leader Manickam Tagore hit back, calling Ahmad a “betrayer” and “Jaichand”. “I am not shocked. Just saddened, yet again,? by how betrayal becomes loud when courage walks the longest road,” Tagore wrote on X, adding that such attacks were about “TV time, relevance and pleasing new masters”.Ahmad, a former Union minister and ex-Congress general secretary who quit the party after the 2025 Bihar elections, has also accused Gandhi of sidelining senior leaders and influencing the 2022 party presidential poll in favour of Mallikarjun Kharge.",Former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad claims that his residence faces a threat of attack.

Politics erupts over the incident

NEW DELHI: Calling the new University Grants Commission (UGC) rules a ""black law,"" Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri resigned on Monday, saying the new rules meant for higher educational institutions could foment caste-based discontent.Agnihotri alleged that the new UCC law would vitiate the academic environment in colleges and should be withdrawn immediately.Agnihotri, a 2019-batch Provincial Civil Service officer, sent his resignation by e-mail to Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Bareilly District Magistrate Avinash Singh, the officials told news agency PTI.The new rules notified by the UGC on January 13 -- the Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026 -- have sparked widespread criticism from general category students who argue that the framework could lead to discrimination against them.The new regulations, introduced to stop caste-based discrimination in colleges and universities, ask institutions to set up special committees, helplines and monitoring teams to handle complaints, especially from SC, ST and OBC students.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh government ordered disciplinary action against Agnihotri and attached him to the Shamli District Magistrate.In his resignation letter, Agnihotri said it becomes necessary to ""awaken"" the government when it adopts policies that ""divide society and the nation"".Talking to reporters after attending the Republic Day function Monday morning, Agnihotri said that the new UGC rules would lead to atrocities against Brahmins.The provisions were discriminatory and could lead to social unrest and internal discontent, he said.Levelling a serious charge against the Bareilly district magistrate Avinash Singh, Agnihotri, an alumnus of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) where he studied B.Tech and LLB, said he was held hostage and verbally abused, with people at the DM's residence saying: """" (Pandit has gone mad).""I was held hostage at the DM's residence for 45 minutes. A call came to the DM from Lucknow. I was verbally abused, and they said, 'pandit has gone mad (pandit paagal ho gayaa hai). Keep him hostage all night.' I had already informed the media about my situation. I was released at the behest of the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP),"" Agnihotri was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Avinash Singh, however, dismissed the allegations, saying that when Agnihotri came to see him, all the Additional District Magistrates (ADMs), Sub-Divisional Magistrates (SDMs), Circle Officers, Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) officials, and the Senior Superintendent of Police of Bareilly were present at the DM's residence.Political leaders, particularly the ruling BJP's rivals, reacted to the development, saying that the resignation was a serious indicator of administrative pressure.Reacting to the development, state Congress president Ajay Rai called Agnihotri's resignation a serious issue.In an X post in Hindi, Rai wrote, ""The lathi charge on Shankaracharya (Avimukteshwaranand) and his disciples, and the administrative pressure -- all this shows that under the BJP rule, the Constitution, faith and freedom of expression are all under threat. The truth must come out. The state will be governed by the Constitution, not by fear,"" he wrote.Senior Samajwadi Party leader and former Bareilly MP Praveen Singh Aron also responded to the development.""The true strength of governance lies in upholding the principles of righteous rule (Raj Dharma) and constitutional values. This is not a question of politics, but of the very soul of democracy,"" he added.Meanwhile, Brahmin leaders have been gathering at the state guest house in Bareilly since Monday afternoon.A resident of Kanpur Nagar, Agnihotri previously served as a sub-divisional magistrate in key districts, including Unnao, Balrampur, and Lucknow. He is known in administrative circles for his straightforward views and strict working style. He has also worked in the United States.",Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri resigns over new University Grants Commission rules.

Buried Past

.

Walk down the narrow lanes of this small town — located about 45km southwest of Chandigarh — and you’d find it hard to believe that Chinese scholar Hiuen Tsang trod these very paths some 1,300 years ago. Or that north Indian ruler Prithviraj Chauhan had once passed this way at the head of his army.It’s as if history no longer felt welcome here and moved out, mournful and uncared for. But there was a time when history ebbed and flowed through its narrow lanes. Sirhind — or Sar-iHind, the crown of India — was, after all, the last major outpost before invaders reached the Yamuna. Temples of the Hindu Shahis — who made Sirhind their capital, with its grandeur said to be second only to Lahore’s — still stand south of Islamabad, the oldest surviving temples in Pakistan.But monuments and structures that are often eloquent narrators of past glories stand in Sirhind as mute spectators, listlessly dotting farmlands and alleyways. In many cases, they exist — plastered, painted over, forgotten — as bricks that were repurposed as construction material to build nameless walls of homes that have sprung up in recent decades.The town, which forms a twin city with the adjacent Fatehgarh Sahib, has not only shrunk in size and significance, it has also gone missing from Punjab’s mindscape and its cultural discourse.It is where Humayun defeated the Suris to re-establish Mughal rule and where Guru Gobind Singh’s sons were so cruelly bricked up alive. Sirhind is said by some to go back to the time of the Mahabharata, a melting pot of lore and legend. But, then, how did history itself become a victim in historic Sirhind?Dr Daljit Singh, professor of history at Punjabi University, Patiala, toldthat Sirhind is a treasure trove for archaeologists, but it hasn’t got its due. Encroachments are gobbling up what should be protected spaces. The sense one gets on talking to locals is that every brick and old structure here can tell its own history. The only tough part is to actually find and identify them for what they really are.There is little evidence of any sustained effort by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to explore the historical importance of the area. Despite its rich past as a major provincial centre, there has not been a survey in years to identify historical remains that may lie buried beneath the ground.Some sites, like Gurudwara Shri Fatehgarh Sahib, Rauza Sharif Shrine and a Jain Mandir, are well maintained. But many historical places like Jahazi Haveli of Diwan Todar Mal — not to be confused with Raja Todar Mal of Akbar’s Navratna fame — Aam Khas Bagh and Sadna Kasai Masjid have remained neglected for long. Areas like Harbanspura, Mahadian, Bara and Talanian, where one would stumble on relics three decades ago, are yet to be explored. Buildings and monuments lie crumbling in wheat fields.In the 19th century, French traveller V Jacquemont had described Sirhind as “the biggest ruins in India after Delhi”. Yet today, few ever talk of it. As if it had fallen off the map. There is no trace of the Hindu Shahis in any museum in the country.Elderly residents of Sirhind recall instances of when tilling of the land would turn up artefacts. “Every few days, we would hear someone’s plough had dug up something from history. Bricks were very common to find. Even now such articles turn up. The famous Laalan Wala Bazar near Talanian village is all farmland now,” said 77-yearold Sukhdev Singh. “There were at least four tombs in the area, but we know of two, the Ustad and Shagird tombs. We don’t know what happened to the other two,” he added.Shamsher Singh, 75, of Talanian village, said silver coins, Sirhind bricks and artefacts of various shapes were regularly found near tombs and in the fields. “There was a raised structure near the village but it gradually disappeared as people levelled it up. Now, farming is going on in the same ground. Govt should have protected these historical sites,” he said.At Mahadiyan, famed for how often buried history was dug up during farming, former sarpanch Balwant Singh, 75, said one of the mausoleums he saw as a child has vanished and houses have come up there. “Some 30-35 years ago, ‘Tailay’, which was a sort of currency, would be found in the fields every now and then. Who knows what else would have been found had there been a proper dig?” Khalifa Syed Muhammad Sadiq Raza, who manages affairs at the mausoleum (dargah) of the 17th-century Sufi saint Shaikh Ahmad Faruqi Sirhindi (Mujaddid Alf Sani), said Sirhind was an important province for the Mughals as it lay midway between Delhi and Lahore.Punjab Shahi Imam, Maulana Usman Ludhianvi, said, “Sirhind is an important historical area and needs to be explored in the historical context”.Anecdotes and tales of Sirhind’s buried and forgotten history still keep coming up in conversations. But there are not many who want the past to be dug up. Their fear is that history unearthed would before long get overrun by the present. And will Sirhind then remain the land of fables and myth? Asked about excavations in Sirhind, Sanjeev Kumar Tewari, director-tourism, culture and archaeology, said none has been carried out in the recent past. ASI is carrying out excavations at Sanghol in Fatehgarh Sahib and some other places nearby, he said.“As of now, Jahazi Haveli is being restored. Around 80% of the work has been completed,” he said. Asked why other monuments are in such a state of disrepair, he said minor restoration work was done at the Ustad and Shagird tombs and at the Tomb of Bibi Subhan. “We are getting estimates drawn up for restoration of other monuments. Also, the property towards the rear of Aam Khas Bagh is being given out for commercial usage in PPP mode,” he said.Deputy commissioner Sona Thind acknowledged that Aam Khas Bagh and other tombs needed maintenance and said she has written about it to the tourism and cultural affairs department.","There is little evidence of any sustained effort by Archaeological Survey of India to explore the historical importance of the area.

Republic Day Parade Turns High Octane As Bike Daredevils Showcase Skill Discipline And Nerve

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attended Republic Day parade and 'At Home' reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan but the party's criticism of govt for not offering them front row seats in the parade triggered a row, with BJP accusing it of carrying a sense of entitlement. Congress, however, accused BJP of ""petty politicking"".Party MP Vivek Tankha said, ""I was shocked. Opposition used to be treated with respect. BJP leaders of opposition were never treated in this manner. By seating Kharge and Rahul in the back, you are insulting the Constitution. But it is too much to expect grace and respect for opposition from BJP govt. It would be part of a party's behaviour only if it has fought for freedom of the country and for the Constitution.""This is not the first time that seating arrangement at the parade has triggered a controversy. In 2018, Congress objected to seating of Rahul claiming he was given a seat in one of the fourth to sixth row instead of the front row as he was chief of a party. In 2024 I-Day celebrations at Red Fort, controversy again erupted after Rahul was seated in the second-last row with Olympic medalists.Hitting back at Tankha, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Congress and Rahul suffer from a sense of entitlement and they believe VVIP treatment for them is more important than the country.Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal was sitting behind Rahul, he added.""Seating arrangement is decided by a set format, which goes by order of precedence,"" he said. He noted Rahul often skipped important official events, I-Day and swearing-in ceremonies of vice president and CJI.BJP recalled their own LoPs Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley used to be given back row seats when Congress-led UPA was in office. At R-Day function in 2009, a veteran politician like L K Advani was seated in the back row, one of them recalled. Poonawalla accused Rahul of insulting North-East by allegedly refusing to wear a 'patka' offered by President Murmu to guests at the 'At Home' reception.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""From the President and the PM to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the 'patka' with respect and pride. Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards North-East..."" Sarma demanded an apology from Rahul.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attended Republic Day parade and 'At Home' reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

GURGAON: A food vendor abducted a 23-year-old woman from Leopard Trail, a popular picnic spot in the Aravalis, shoved her into a borrowed Scorpio and drove around the city with police in pursuit in the early hours of Sunday.The food seller, Gaurav Bhati (25), abandoned the Scorpio and fled when one of its tyres got stuck in mud at Pandala village, around an hour after he had abducted her. Bhati has been arrested and charged with kidnapping and snatching. Police are waiting for the woman's magisterial statement before adding sexual assault charges, sources said.Late on Saturday, the woman and a colleague had driven to Leopard Trail. They reached around 1.30am and spent an hour and a half there. Bhati allegedly harassed the two when they were sitting in their car.When the duo confronted him, an argument started. Amid a heated exchange, Bhati allegedly snatched her phone and began running towards the Scorpio he was driving. When she chased him, he grabbed her and pushed her into the SUV, locked the door and drove off, sources said. Her colleague tried to intervene, but Bhati pushed him away.As Bhati sped away with her, the colleague informed police and shared details of Bhati's vehicle.Police tracked down the SUV using the woman's phone location. Sources said Bhati drove in random directions, going to Southern Peripheral Road, Subhash Chowk and Sector 74, before taking the woman to a secluded, hilly forested area.However, the Scorpio, which Bhati had borrowed from another food vendor, stalled as he drove through mud paths. When she screamed for help, he got off and fled. Police reached the spot and rescued the woman. The Scorpio's registration details took them to its owner, who told them Bhati had taken his car to buy liquor. Three police teams that were formed to trace Bhati arrested him within a few hours, police said.A forensic team visited the area and collected evidence. Location data is being analysed to reconstruct the sequence of events, police said.""A medical examination confirmed that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the crime. When Bhati was taken back to the hills for a recreation of the crime scene, he attempted to escape. During the bid to flee, he tripped and fell in the rugged terrain, resulting in a fracture to his right leg and injuries to the face. He was hospitalised under custody,"" a police officer said.After being discharged, Bhati was produced before a local court and remanded in judicial custody. An FIR was initially registered against him under BNS sections 137(2) (kidnapping) and 304(2) (snatching).Police later added sections related to custodial escape and obstructing a public servant in the discharge of official duties.","Gaurav Bhati, 25, abducted a 23-year-old woman from Leopard Trail, a popular picnic spot in the Aravalis.

Enforcement: The missing spine

What the regulations ultimately hinge on

On January 13, 2026, the University Grants Commission notified the University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, replacing the earlier 2012 anti-discrimination framework. The new rules aim to curb caste-based discrimination in higher education by turning it into an enforceable governance issue rather than a discretionary grievance. In simple terms, the regulations do three things: They define prohibited conduct, mandate a campus-wide prevention-and-redressal architecture (Equal Opportunity Centres (EOC), equity committees, monitoring mechanisms, reporting), and arm the UGC with the power to treat non-compliance as a regulatory violation with consequences. That ambition is also the risk. In India’s sprawling, uneven higher education system, the question is rarely whether a policy is ethically correct. It is whether it can be made operational predictably, consistently, and without collapsing into paperwork.When the regulations were notified, the immediate debate turned ideological: Inclusion versus exclusion, protection versus overreach. That debate, while inevitable, misses the more consequential question.The real issue is not whether the regulations are morally justified. It is whether they are administratively coherent and institutionally workable in a system that has historically struggled to translate regulation into behaviour.To begin with, the UGC Regulations 2026 framework does several things that earlier policies avoided or softened. It defines discrimination explicitly, moving beyond vague exhortations to fairness. It requires every institution to establish a formal mechanism for prevention and redressal, rather than treating discrimination as a moral lapse to be handled informally. It places responsibility squarely on institutional leadership, rejecting the long-standing practice of diffusing accountability across anonymous committees.This matters. Historically, campus discrimination complaints in India have suffered from three chronic weaknesses: Denial (“this does not happen here”), delay (“let us examine the matter”), and deflection (“this is a misunderstanding”). By introducing timelines and documentation requirements, the regulations attempt to close those escape routes.The regulations also signal a broader policy shift: Equity is no longer framed merely as access (admissions, scholarships) but as experience—how students and staff live and work within institutions. That conceptual shift is significant and overdue.The 2026 UGC framework relies heavily on institutional machinery—Equal Opportunity Centres, equity committees, monitoring cells, grievance pathways, periodic reporting. In theory, this ensures vigilance. In practice, it risks becoming another layer in an already overburdened administrative ecosystem.India’s higher education sector is not homogeneous. A regulation written with well-resourced central universities in mind inevitably lands unevenly across state universities and affiliated colleges where administrative capacity is thin, faculty shortages are routine, and compliance already operates at the edge of exhaustion.In such contexts, complexity does not deepen justice. It often produces procedural compliance without substantive engagement.The UGC regulations 2026 emphasise urgency. Complaints are expected to move fast: Committees convened quickly, reports produced within fixed windows, and action initiated on schedule. The intent is clear: Reduce delay, reduce deflection, reduce the quiet burying of discomfort. But speed, on its own, is not fairness.The document is strong on timelines and comparatively thin on method. It lays outthe Equity Committee must meet andreports must be submitted, but it does not spell out the investigative backbone: What counts as sufficient evidence, what standard of proof should guide findings, how witnesses should be handled, or what a fair inquiry protocol looks like in practice.On confidentiality, the rules do offer a narrow safeguard—protecting the identity of the person reporting through the helpline if confidentiality is requested. But beyond that, the framework does not set out a broader privacy design for proceedings, records, disclosures, or data handling. Nor does it explicitly lay down an anti-retaliation framework: clear protections for complainants or witnesses, interim safeguards, or consequences for retaliation.These are not decorative details. In grievance systems, process design is the product. It decides whether people trust the mechanism—or avoid it.Where the method is unclear, institutions tend to protect themselves. They default to risk minimisation: Close matters quickly, avoid escalation, build paperwork that signals action. That may satisfy the letter of the regulation, while quietly thinning its spirit.Here is the quiet complication the regulations do not solve: The grievance system is, by design, institution-led. The EOC sits inside the university, the head of the institution chairs it ex officio. There is a safeguard for the obvious conflict—when a complaint concerns the head, the meeting shifts to the EOC coordinator and the report is routed to the next higher authority. But the larger architecture remains what it has long been in Indian higher education: the institution is asked to investigate itself.That is not automatically wrong. It is simply a delicate arrangement. Self-regulation works only when an institution already carries internal credibility—when students and staff believe the process will hold even if the conclusion is inconvenient for the powerful. But campuses are not flat organisations. They run on dependence: Grades, appointments, access to hostels, research opportunities, recommendation letters, future prospects. In that ecosystem, independence is not just a rulebook problem; it is a perception problem.And when independence is doubted, behaviour changes quietly. People may not stop approaching the system. They simply stop expecting it to protect them.The most politically sensitive feature of the UGC Regulations, 2026 is not enforcement but definition. The regulations begin with a broad ethical promise. Their objective speaks of eliminating discrimination in higher education across multiple grounds—religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth and disability—and names a wide group of intended beneficiaries.The difficulty emerges when this moral promise is converted into an operational category. In the definitions section, “caste-based discrimination” is specified narrowly as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, on the basis of caste or tribe alone. The framework does not then explain how caste-linked complaints that fallthis group-specific definition are to be classified or handled.The flaw, then, is not in the remedial intent of the regulation. It is in the absence of a clear rule explaining how caste-linked harm is to be recognised when it sits at the margins of the defined category. In a procedural framework, such silence is not neutral. It transfers interpretive power to institutions—and discretion is where unevenness begins.The regulations enumerate consequences for non-compliance. That is a strength. But they are less precise about how monitoring will operate over time. Enforcement in Indian higher education has often been episodic—intense during controversy, relaxed thereafter.If monitoring remains discretionary or reactive, compliance will mirror that pattern. Institutions will mobilise when scrutiny is high and lapse when attention fades. This is not malice; it is organisational behaviour.Without sustained, transparent oversight, strong penalties risk becoming symbolic rather than corrective.The UGC’s 2026 regulations are neither reckless nor trivial. They are serious in intent and substantial in scope. They represent an attempt to force Indian higher education to confront a reality it has often preferred to manage quietly. But seriousness of intent does not absolve seriousness of design.The regulations risk repeating a familiar cycle: Ambitious architecture, uneven capacity, procedural fatigue, and eventual cynicism. This is not because the idea of equity is flawed, but because institutions cannot be reformed by structure alone.What is missing is not morality but operational humility—an acknowledgment that governance systems succeed not when they multiply committees, but when they simplify trust, clarify process, and invest in institutional capability.If the 2026 regulations evolve into a working system—consistent, predictable, fair—they could meaningfully change campus incentives. If they harden into paperwork rituals, they will weaken the very cause they seek to advance.Equity, in higher education, is not achieved by how forcefully rules are written. It is achieved by how quietly and consistently they are implemented, long after the controversy passes.That is the test this regulation has yet to take.","University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, replacing the earlier 2012 anti-discrimination framework.

'Europe Will Retaliate': America's European Allies FIRE BACK At Trump Over Greenland Tariff Attack

US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent, accusing the ally’s legislature of failing to uphold its trade agreement with the United States.Trump added that South Korea’s legislature has not approved the trade deal he and President Lee Je Myung agreed to on July 30, 2025, and reaffirmed during his visit on October 29, 2025, questioning why it has not been ratified.""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters.South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week.","US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent.

Old Vs New Income Tax Regime: How Much More Tax Are You Saving Over Years?

These charts by EY have been prepared on the following assumptions:

Section 80C deduction (maximum Rs 1.5 lakh) considered under the old tax regime. Other deductions/ exemptions such as medical insurance, home loan interest, house rent allowance are not considered. Standard deduction of Rs 50000 under the old regime and standard deduction as notified from time to time (Nil, Rs 50,000, Rs 75,000) under new regime is considered.

Each year the Budget speech is eagerly watched and listened to by the common man and middle class taxpayers, seeking answer to a simple query: will my tax burden reduce this year? Even finance ministers presenting the Budget are aware of the populist impact of their speech, in case tax relief measures are announced.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Sitharaman, who will present her ninth budget, is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020.The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability under each before deciding on which one to opt for.Over the years, the new income tax regime has seen several changes, and the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels, and it has become increasingly more attractive compared to the old regime.In her Budget speech in 2020, FM Nirmala Sitharaman explained the rationale for the introduction of a new income tax regime: the need for simpler compliance.“...The Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals,” she said.Hence, a new and simplified income tax regime was introduced to provide “significant relief” to individual taxpayers. The idea was for a tax regime that offers reduced rates for taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions.The biggest takeaway was that the 30% tax slab under the new regime kicked in at an income above Rs 15 lakh compared to Rs 10 lakh under the old tax regime.At that time individuals under both regimes earning income up to Rs 5 lakh did not have to pay tax with the benefit of Section 87A.FM Sitharaman explained the gains: In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him. For example, a person earning Rs 15 lakh in a year and not availing any deductions etc. will pay only Rs 1,95,000 as compared to Rs 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime. He would still be the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking deduction of Rs 1.5 Lakh under various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.Over the years, the government has introduced substantial changes under the new income tax regime - introduction of standard deduction benefits, higher standard deduction limit of Rs 75,000, evolving tax slabs and tax rates.In the Union Budget 2023, tax slabs under the new regime were further tweaked to:Importantly the following big changes were introduced:In the interim budget of 2024, the standard deduction under the new regime was raised to Rs 75,000.Last year, FM Sitharaman’s Budget brought sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, making it even more attractive for taxpayers. With higher rebate, tax outgo on income up to Rs 12 lakh was reduced to ZERO!Explaining the journey, Sitharaman said, “Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was raised to Rs 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to Rs 5 lakh in 2019 and to Rs 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our government's trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.”Income tax slabs under the new regime saw big changes, with the 30% tax slab now kicking in for incomes above Rs 24 lakh, as against Rs 15 lakh earlier.One noteworthy point is that in all these years since the introduction of the new income tax regime, the old tax regime with higher deductions and exemptions but also higher tax rates continues to function, though without any changes. The intent of the government is clear: with the new tax regime made the default regime, and all changes and benefits of lower taxes, taxpayers are being urged to shift to it.But, how much is the tax benefit under the new tax regime compared to the old regime? The tax outgo has changed in the last 5 years, and at various income levels, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down substantially compared to the old tax regime.For a better understanding, we take a look at how tax outgo has changed over the last five years at various income levels of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 20 lakh, and Rs 40 lakh.If for an income level of Rs 10 lakh, you had to pay Rs 75,400 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 78,000 in FY21 to Rs 54,600 in FY24, Rs 44,200 in FY25 to NIL in FY26! It continues to be Rs 75,400 under the old regime.Similarly, if for an income level of Rs 20 lakh, you had to pay Rs 366,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 351,000 in FY21 to Rs 296,400 in FY24, Rs 278,200 in FY25 to Rs 192,400 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 174,200!The impact is also visible at higher income levels. If for an income level of Rs 40 lakh, you had to pay Rs 990,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 975,000 in FY21 to Rs 920,400 in FY24, Rs 902,200 in FY25 to Rs 787,800 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 202,800!The above charts are broadly indicative, and the tax outgo will depend on your income level, the amount of deductions and exemptions you claim. For an income of over Rs 12 lakh, and above a certain amount of deductions and exemptions, the old regime may be more suitable at various salary levels.Hence, while the above examples offer a clear picture on how the tax benefits have increased over years under the new regime, it is important to calculate the total amount of deductions and exemptions you avail for a better understanding.As an example, at the current tax slabs in the old and new regime, if you have a gross income of more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then the old regime makes sense only if your total deductions and exemptions are over Rs 8 lakh.This level of deductions and exemptions is for the 30% tax slab. It will vary for incomes below Rs 24 lakh.Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India tells TOI, “Over the past few years, the new tax regime has clearly boosted the take‑home pay of most salaried taxpayers due to the rising basic exemption limits and reduced slab rates. In FY 2020-21, for an income of Rs 10 lakh, the tax liability under the new tax regime was slightly higher compared to the old tax regime. However, over the subsequent five years (FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26), the reforms have reversed this picture, resulting in savings of Rs 75,400 in FY 2025-26 under the new tax regime as compared to the old tax regime. ”""For an income of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, the savings in FY 2025-26 are approximately Rs 1.74 lakh and Rs 2.02 lakh respectively as compared to the old tax regime. Now, if we compare savings under the new tax regime over the six-year period (FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26), savings have risen significantly — around Rs 78,000 at an income of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 1.58 lakh at Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1.87 lakh at Rs 40 lakh. With substantial taxpayers going ahead with the default/new tax regime, further slab adjustments in Budget 2026 could accelerate this trend,” he adds.While a certain percentage of taxpayers continue to benefit from the old tax regime, for example those who claim high levels of House Rent Allowance, or those who have a home loan, over 70% of tax returns filed for AY 2024-25 were under the new regime. Tax experts expect more taxpayers to switch to the new income tax regime in the ongoing financial year, with the Rs 12 lakh zero tax level prompting many to shift.However, experts note that the government may look to introduce some popular deductions and exemptions such as Section 80C and home loan interest benefits to incentivise savings and housing.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. She is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020. Over the years, the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127475885,imgsize-113754,width-400,resizemode-4/old-vs-new-income-tax-regime.jpg"
Interview slots for H-1B visas now only in 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/interview-slots-for-h-1b-visas-now-only-in-2027/articleshow/127503949.cms,".

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

PIO civil servant gets flak on X for negotiating Chagos deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pio-civil-servant-gets-flak-on-x-for-negotiating-chagos-deal/articleshow/127568529.cms,"Image: X@/BasilTheGreat

LONDON: An Indian-born British civil servant has found himself unwittingly under fire on social media over the controversial Chagos deal.Dr Francis Vijay Narasimhan Rangarajan was born in Delhi and educated at Cambridge University where he obtained a master’s in maths and PhD in astrophysics.Since March 2024 he has been chief executive of the Electoral Commission. Before that he led the negotiations over the Chagos deal in his role as a director-general at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). The Chagos deal, agreed in May 2025, is opposed by the Conservatives and Reform UK, and a large number of the British public.On Sunday night Rangarajan’s name was trending alongside “Chagos Deal” on X after it was revealed he negotiated the deal to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which Britain owns, to Mauritius, and then pay Mauritius millions of pounds a year to lease back the strategic Diego Garcia military base, used by US and UK forces.At the time of going to press, the FCDO had not responded to a request for comment.Journalist and former Tory MEP Daniel Hannan wrote on X: “Every former minister I have spoken to blames the Chagos fiasco on Vijay Rangarajan, the relevant FCDO official. But, in Britain, civil servants are never blamed for anything and, indeed, he is now running the Electoral Commission, which makes MPs reluctant to criticise him.”Former Tory MP Douglas Carswell wrote on X: “Vijay Rangarajan should be summoned to the bar of the House to explain his asinine deal.” British political commentator Nick Dixon commented: “So we let an Indian give away our territory to a majority Indian country? Did we lose a war or something?”An account called “Basil the Great”, with 265k followers, wrote: “INDIAN CIVIL SERVANT BEHIND CHAGOS DEAL. Vijay Rangarajan born in New Delhi has been revealed as the man behind the whole Chagos islands fiasco. An Indian giving away British territory to Mauritius, a majority Indian state. WHY ARE FOREIGNERS RULING OVER US?”The Chagos negotiating team, led by Rangarajan, “overstepped its brief and offered Mauritius too much”.“Officials were freewheeling,” said one political source, according to the UK Times.Last week US president Donald Trump had said giving away the land was “an act of great stupidity”.Although the treaty handing over sovereignty was signed in May 2025, the bill has not been ratified in UK’s parliament. The Tories on Friday tabled a motion in the House of Lords requiring the govt to confirm that the Chagos deal did not breach the existing 1966 UK-US treaty governing the use of Diego Garcia. Later that day the bill was removed from Monday’s order paper.India supports the deal. Last Sept PM Modi had called the Chagos deal “a historic milestone for Mauritius’s sovereignty”.","Dr Francis Vijay Narasimhan Rangarajan was born in Delhi and educated at Cambridge University.

Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through ‘lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

‘Insensitive and insulting’: BJP says Rahul Gandhi declined to wear Assamese Gamosa; Congress counters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insensitive-and-insulting-bjp-says-rahul-gandhi-declined-to-wear-assamese-gamosa-congress-counters/articleshow/127567076.cms,"Congress hits back

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for allegedly refusing to wear an Assamese 'Gamosa' during the reception hosted by President Draupadi Murmu after Republic Day parade.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma accused the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha of “insulting” the people of the entire Northeast and demanded an unconditional apology from him.Taking to X, Sarma said, “Times may change, but the attitude of the de facto supremo of the Congress party , Mr. Rahul Gandhi, regrettably appears unchanged. In an act that was deeply insensitive and insulting to the people of the entire North East, Mr. Gandhi chose not to wear the traditional Patka, a symbol of the region’s rich cultural heritage, at the reception hosted by the Hon’ble President of India this evening.”“From the President and the Prime Minister to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the Patka with respect and pride. Mr. Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards the North East. Such conduct explains why his party has lost the trust of the region and much of the country.

EU, India To Sign Security And Defence Pact In New Delhi, Aim To Conclude FTA Talks: Kaja Kallas

.

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union have concluded negotiations for a free trade agreement that will cover goods, services and other aspects of engagement with the deal set to be announced by leaders from the two sides on Tuesday, commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said.""It will be a balanced, forward-looking deal for better economic integration with the EU. It will propel trade and investment between both sides,"" Agrawal said on Monday on the agreement that has been under negotiation for more than 18 years, but got a lease of life in 2024. US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs are seen to have pushed both sides to engage more aggressively to finalise the agreement, factoring in each other's concerns in sectors such as agriculture and dairy.The agreement may, however, take a few months to be ratified and is likely to be implemented in early 2027, officials said. Over the next two weeks, the two sides will put together a cleaner text of the agreement, which will be legally vetted over the next 5-6 months before it is signed. The agreement will then have to be ratified by the European Parliament, but officials explained that it will not have to be approved by each member-state of the 27-nation bloc since it does not contain ""mixed competence"".India is expected to get zero-duty access to several key product segments such as textiles, leather and marine products, in return for concessions in sectors such as automobiles and wines and spirits.In a TV interview, European commissioner for trade and economic security MaroS Šefcovic said the aim was to see full or partial tariff reduction on 97-99% of goods, while factoring in sensitivity in sectors such as agriculture and dairy. He said the trading bloc was looking for a ""combination"" of lower tariffs on a specified number of vehicles along with phased reduction. He said India was a smaller market compared to EU, but growing rapidly, and auto was an important sector for both sides. He said it is a sector that is complementary given that India makes small cars, while European automakers focused on larger and technologically more advanced vehicles. ""We are looking at the way which would help us find solutions, create new supply chains and make an even better business case for European car makers, while opening new possibilities for cooperation,"" Šefcovic said.He underlined the broader strategic intent of the FTA in building resilient supply chains, reducing risky dependencies and creating jobs in India and EU.","India and the European Union have concluded negotiations for a free trade agreement.

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.Vice-chancellors also said the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff. The regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127388943,imgsize-100582,width-400,resizemode-4/ugc.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Kerala unit of Congress is again at the centre of a controversy after its ""cow urine research"" remarks on Padma Shri winner IIT Madras director V Kamakoti. The comments received a sharp retort from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu who came out in defence of Kamakoti.The Kerala Congress, in a post on X, congratulated Kamakoti on the civilian honour while taking a dig at his work, saying, “Congratulations to V Kamakoti on receiving the honour. The nation recognises your bleeding edge research on Cow Urine at IIT Madras, taking Gomutra to world stage.”Reacting on January 26, Vembu highlighted Kamakoti’s academic credentials and role in national service. “Professor Kamakoti works in deep tech: micro-processor design. He is the Director of IIT-Madras, the best technological institution in India. He serves in the NSAB. He richly deserves the honour,” he wrote on X.Defending the scientific validity of studying traditional substances, Vembu said, “I have defended him on scientific grounds and I will do so again: cow dung and cow urine have excellent microbiome that could be valuable for humans. It is the slavish colonial mindset that thinks these are not scientific propositions worthy of investigation.Some day, when Harvard or MIT publish a study on this, these enslaved minds would worship that as the gospel truth. ”Kamakoti, who is among this year’s Padma Shri award ees, earlier described the honour as a collective achievement.

Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”"," decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan.

KOLKATA: At least seven people were killed and 21 others reported missing after a massive fire tore through a warehouse complex in eastern Kolkata early Monday, trapping workers who had been sleeping inside units packed with flammable materials. The complex housed a decorators' unit and a factory supplying a popular momo chain.Police initially confirmed three deaths, but fire department sources later said seven badly burnt bodies had been retrieved. Identification was not immediately possible. Officials said numbers could change as search continued through smouldering debris.The blaze broke out around 2.30 am at a warehouse in Nazirabad of Anandapur - a densely populated neighbourhood off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, a major arterial road linking south and east Kolkata.According to missing-person complaints, 25 people had stayed overnight inside the decorators' unit, while three others were in the momo factory. Most of those missing are migrant workers from East and West Midnapore districts.Fire officials said the decorators' unit stored large quantities of thermocol and other highly combustible materials. Large stocks of soft drinks and packaged food kept in the warehouse may have further fuelled the flames, allowing the fire to spread rapidly across the structure.Ten fire engines were rushed to the spot, followed by 12 more in phases. Firefighters battled the blaze for hours, but pockets of fire were still burning well into the morning, hampering rescue. A bulldozer was brought in to clear debris. A nearby workers' mess and a residential house were evacuated as a precaution.Relatives of the missing gathered outside the blackened shell of the building, searching for signs of loved ones. Sonarpur resident Pankaj Haldar managed a frantic call to his family after the fire began, but the line went dead soon after, a relative said.""My father has been working here for the past seven years. There is still no news of him. We have found his cycle,"" said Nayan Haldar, standing beside a nearly burnt bicycle believed to belong to his father Basudeb Haldar, store-in-charge of the momo unit. Cops said efforts were under way to trace the warehouse owners and a probe was underway.",Blaze broke out around 2.30 am at a warehouse in Nazirabad of Anandapur.

Stage harassment allegation: Former TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty files police complaint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stage-harassment-allegation-former-tmc-mp-mimi-chakraborty-files-police-complaint/articleshow/127567223.cms,"Former TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty (PTI image)

NEW DELHI: Actress and former Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty has lodged a police complaint on Monday alleging harassment during a live stage performance at a cultural programme in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district.The incident reportedly occurred late Sunday night during an event organised in the Nayagram area of Bongaon town. According to the complaint, one of the organisers allegedly climbed onto the stage mid-performance, stopped the programme abruptly and asked the actress to leave without prior communication.In her complaint to the Bongaon police station, submitted via email, Chakraborty named an organiser, Tanmay Shastri, accusing him of forcibly interrupting her performance and asking her to step down around midnight. She later said the episode left her feeling “deeply humiliated”.The actor also took to the social media platform X to share her account of the incident, linking it to broader concerns around the dignity and safety of women and artists.Referring to the timing of the incident on Republic Day, Chakraborty wrote that while the country speaks of freedom and equality, “the independence and dignity of women and artists are still too easily violated”.Explaining the sequence of events, she said she had been invited by the Naya Gopal Gunj Yubak Sango Club to perform at the event and was asked to leave the stage mid-performance, in full view of the audience.She claimed that derogatory remarks were made on the microphone, which she said not only humiliated her but also damaged her public image. “I left quietly to maintain decorum,” she said, adding that she has now approached legal authorities and believes in due process.“If I keep quiet today, this behaviour will be repeated tomorrow. Dignity on stage is non-negotiable,” Chakraborty said in her post.However, the organisers denied the allegations, saying the programme was stopped due to time restrictions. Shastri claimed the actress arrived nearly an hour late and that police permission for the event was valid only until midnight.He said that the decision to halt the programme was taken keeping in mind upcoming board examinations of students in the area.“Mimi Chakraborty was neither insulted nor harassed, and the allegations made by her are completely baseless,” Shastri said, alleging instead that her security personnel misbehaved with him. He further claimed that the actress’s bodyguards forcibly removed women members of the club who had come on stage to felicitate her.Stating that the organisers had no intention to disrespect the actor, Shastri added that if she felt insulted due to any miscommunication, the club regretted the incident.Police said that the complaint has been taken on record and further investigation into the matter is underway.","Actress Mimi Chakraborty has lodged a police complaint alleging harassment during a live stage performance.

Six Sarpanches Booked in Kamareddy for Mass Killing of Stray Dogs Ahead of Elections

NEW DELHI: In yet another case of alleged mass killings of stray dogs in Telangana, about 200 canines were reportedly killed in Hanamkonda district. This takes the total number of stray dogs found dead in the state since December 2025 to around 1,100, according to animal rights activists.Animal welfare activist A Goutham, associated with the Stray Animal Foundation of India, lodged a complaint with police on Monday, claiming that the 200 stray dogs were brutally killed about a month ago in Pathipaka village of Shayampet mandal by administering poisonous injections.He alleged the act was carried out on the orders of the Gram Panchayat Secretary, news agency PTI reported.Goutham, who works as Cruelty Prevention Manager, said that he visited the village with other activists and spoke to locals, who reportedly confirmed the Panchayat Secretary's involvement.“The carcasses of the dogs were then buried in a graveyard,” he stated, seeking the registration of an FIR.A police official from Shayampet Police Station said the latest complaint has been added to an existing FIR connected to the alleged killing of around 300 stray dogs in Shayampet and Arepally villages.Earlier, nine people, including two women sarpanches and their husbands, were booked in relation to the killings.“Further investigation is ongoing,” the officer added.Several incidents of stray dog killings have been reported across Telangana in January alone. In Pegadapally village of Jagtial district, around 300 dogs were allegedly killed by poisonous injections on January 22.Animal rights activists blamed the village sarpanch and Gram Panchayat Secretary, prompting police to register an FIR under the relevant sections of the BNS and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act.Similarly, in Yacharam village, about 100 stray dogs were allegedly killed on January 19, leading to FIRs against the sarpanch, secretary and ward member of the gram panchayat.Another 200 dogs were reportedly killed in Kamareddy district, with six people, including five village sarpanches, booked for their alleged involvement.Activists have alleged that some elected representatives ordered these killings to fulfil promises made to villagers ahead of the December 2025 gram panchayat elections, aiming to address the stray dog menace.According to background reports, in recent weeks, mass killings of stray dogs have also been reported from Ranga Reddy and other districts, with carcasses often buried in pits. Activists have documented these incidents and continue to demand strict action against those responsible.","About 200 stray dogs reportedly killed in Hanamkonda district of Telangana.

Protocol and seating norms

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday accused the Centre of violating established protocol and undermining democratic decorum after Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge were seated in the third row during the Republic Day celebrations. The incident has triggered sharp reactions from senior party leaders.Leading the criticism, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned whether the seating arrangement met constitutional and institutional norms. In a post on X, Surjewala said the treatment reflected the government’s mindset rather than protocol.“Does such treatment of the Leader of the Opposition in the country meet the standards of any decorum, tradition, and protocol? This only reveals the frustration of a government plagued by an inferiority complex. In a democracy, differences will persist, but this treatment meted out to Shri Rahul Gandhi is unacceptable,” he wrote.Other Congress leaders echoed similar concerns, arguing that the decision diminished the dignity of constitutional offices. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the issue went beyond seating and reflected the government’s political approach.“Until 2014, opposition leaders like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and L K Advani always sat there.This is a very low level of politics by the government. Opposition leaders being insulted on Republic Day is unacceptable. Republic Day is the day when we all should be united and celebrate India's achievements that year,” he said.Tagore also shared an old photograph from the 2014 Republic Day celebrations to question the seating arrangement of opposition leaders this year.In a post on X, he wrote, ""This was in 2014—look at where LK Advani ji was seated then. Why this protocol mess-up now? Is it because Modi and Shah want to insult Kharge ji and Rahul ji? Leaders of the Opposition cannot be insulted like this, especially on Republic Day.""Senior Congress leader Rashid Alvi said both Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge held key constitutional positions and deserved front-row seating.“Rahul Gandhi is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and Mallikarjun Kharge is not only the Congress president but also the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. They should have been given seats in the front row. The BJP is constantly playing with the dignity of Congress leaders,” he said.Congress leader Kumari Selja linked the controversy to a broader disregard for constitutional norms.“Protocols hold great significance. The country takes pride in the Republic Day parade, where we celebrate our democracy and the republic,” she said, alleging that the government repeatedly sought to belittle the office of the Leader of Opposition.The Leaders of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are placed alongside union cabinet ministers in the official Table of Precedence, which governs protocol at national functions such as Republic Day.According to the Warrant of Precedence issued by the President’s Secretariat, seating arrangements at state and ceremonial occasions are decided based on constitutional rank and office and not political affiliation.The Order of Precedence is a protocol list that applies to state and ceremonial occasions, including national events such as the Republic Day celebrations and has no application in the day-to-day functioning of the government.Under Article 7 of the Table of Precedence, the Leaders of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are placed alongside Union Cabinet ministers, after the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of India and former Prime Ministers.Rejecting the Congress’s allegations, the BJP said the seating arrangement at the Republic Day celebrations was decided strictly according to established protocol.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, in a post on X, launched a sharp attack on the Congress, accusing it of placing entitlement and family-centric politics above constitutional norms.“Once again Congress puts entitlement & ego, parivar and position above people. They feel parivar tantra is above sanvidhan tantra. Seating is decided by a set format – Warrant or Table of Precedence. One can see even senior Cabinet ministers around or even behind Rahul Gandhi but none of them made it an issue,” Poonawalla wrote.He also questioned Rahul Gandhi’s attendance at major constitutional events in the past.“Rahul thinks he is the owner of India? By the way why does he bunk important programs. Where was he during VP oath? CJI oath? I-Day program?” BJP's national spokesperson further wrote.The BJP has previously criticised Gandhi for skipping the oath-taking of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Vice President CP Radhakrishnan, alleging that such absences showed disregard for constitutional occasions.The party has also flagged Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge’s absence from the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort last year, though both leaders had issued Independence Day messages on social media.",Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge were seated in the third row during the Republic Day celebrations. The incident has triggered sharp reactions from senior party leaders. Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned whether the seating arrangement met constitutional and institutional norms. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the issue went beyond seating and reflected the government's political approach.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127554158,imgsize-1320412,width-400,resizemode-4/127554158.jpg"

Republic Day Parade Turns High Octane As Bike Daredevils Showcase Skill Discipline And Nerve

NEW DELHI: From leading contingents to showcasing India’s missile arsenal to presenting daredevil skills on motorcycles, women military personnel stole the show during the 90-minute 77th Republic Day parade on Kartavya Path on Monday.Akshita Dhankar, a flight lieutenant with IAF, was part of one of India's highest ceremonial events — unfurling the national flag alongside President Droupadi Murmu. “It is a matter of great pride for me... Operation Sindoor was not just an Indian Air Force effort but a joint endeavour of all the armed forces,” she said before the majestic parade.Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of an IAF officer, led an animal contingent that made its debut on Kartavya Path. The contingent included Bactrian camels from Ladakh, raptors (black kites), Zanskar ponies and indigenously bred hounds that are used by Indian Army in security, surveillance and logistical operations in border areas.Capt Samira Z Buttar, a fourth-generation Army officer, was the contingent commander of the Integrated Operations Centre tableau that showcased the success of Op Sindoor.

Watch: Padma Shri 2026 Awardees Beam With Joy as Lifelong Work Gets Honoured

NEW DELHI: Prominent agriculture scientist Ashok Kumar Singh who developed over 25 rice varieties and former vice-chancellor of the Bihar-based Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Gopal Ji Trivedi, are among nine persons associated with farm and allied sector selected for this year's Padma Shri award.Trivedi helped farmers cultivate makhana (fox nuts) in a big way, and popularise this nutrient-dense, low-calorie, and gluten-free snack among health conscious Indians.Besides Singh, former director of the ICAR Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), there are four other scientists and four farmers in the list of awardees who not only helped farm growth through their research and innovative farm practices but also contributed towards improving livelihood of farmers in different parts of the country.Rice varieties including different Pusa Basmati and non-Basmati varieties, developed by Singh and other ICAR-IARI scientists, have significantly increased rice output over the years and helped India earn roughly around Rs 50,000 crore annually from Basmati rice export.On the other hand, the country's first genome-edited rice varieties - 'DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' and 'Pusa DST Rice 1' - which Singh co-developed with other scientists of the ICAR's institutes will not only enhance output but also save water and reduce greenhouse gas emission during cultivation.Besides helping farmers cultivate Makhana, the agriculture scientist Trivedi also popularised adoption of canopy management in Litchi orchards to improve yield and promoted winter maize cultivation in Bihar.Other scientists who have been selected for Padma Shri are P L Gautam, former chairperson of the National Biodiversity Authority and the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority; K Ramasamy, former vice chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; and N Punniamoorthy, former dean at Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.Four farmers who have been selected for the Padma Shri for their outstanding contributions to agriculture and animal husbandry include Raghupat Singh (posthumous), a progressive farmer from Moradabad district, who conserved more than 55 rare and nearly extinct vegetable varieties and developed around 100 new varieties; Jogesh Deuri of Assam who promoted Muga silk and helped it gain wider national and international recognition; Shrirang Devaba Lad of Maharashtra who developed the ""Dada Lad technique"" for cotton cultivation to increase yield; and Telangana's Rama Reddy Mamidi (posthumous) who strengthened cooperative models in animal husbandry and dairy development.","Nine persons associated with farm and allied sector selected for this year's Padma Shri award.

The proposal is expected to be placed before BKTC board soon, and has the support of most stakeholders, as per sources.BKTC chairman Hemant Dwivedi told TOI the proposed restriction was rooted in ""long-standing tradition"".""This has been followed since the time of Adi Shankaracharya. We see nothing wrong in preserving religious traditions,"" he said, adding that the ""entry for non-Hindus has historically been restricted at the shrines"".Citing Article 26 of Constitution, which grants religious denominations the right to manage their own affairs, Dwivedi said the committee was well within its rights to take such a decision. Dwivedi also sought to clarify that the term ""non-Hindus"" should not be misconstrued. ""Those who respect our faith are welcome. The dhams are centres of faith, not tourism.""Meanwhile, Uttarakhand govt is weighing a ban on the entry of non-Hindus at 105 ghats across Haridwar and considering declaring Haridwar and Rishikesh as 'sanatan pavitra shehar' (holy cities).

Watch: Padma Shri 2026 Awardees Beam With Joy as Lifelong Work Gets Honoured

NEW DELHI: RVS Mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) named for the Padma Shri this Republic Day eve, was instrumental in blowing the lid off the two contradictory affidavits filed by the UPA govt in 2009, under his signature, in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case.While the first affidavit had cited pinpointed inputs by central intelligence agencies establishing Jahan as part of an LeT module tasked to assassinate high-level political functionaries in India, the subsequent affidavit went on to dismiss the evidentiary value of these intelligence inputs and distanced the Centre from Gujarat govt's action based on the inputs.It was several years later that Mani went public, indirectly claiming ""political interference"" to revise the affidavit. Mani owned up to having drafted the first affidavit filed on Aug 6, 2009, based on intelligence reports he had seen and found to be ""precise, accurate and exact"". He said the reports had clear details regarding terror antecedents of the four-member module, comprising Jahan, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Jishan Johar and Amjad Ali, and laid down the sequence of events leading up to the encounter in Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004, in which all four were neutralised.The original affidavit cited Indian newspaper reports based on the claim made in LeT mouthpiece 'Ghazwa Times' that ""the veil of Ishrat Jahan, a woman activist of LeT, was removed by Indian police and her body kept with other 'mujahideens (terrorists)'"", as a confirmation of her terror links. However, in a subsequent affidavit filed on Sept 29, 2009, MHA said all intel inputs do not constitute conclusive proof and it is for state govt and state police to act on such inputs. It was submitted Centre was in no way concerned with such action and does not condone or endorse any unjustified or excessive action. While the first affidavit said the case was not fit for investigation by CBI, the second said the Centre would not object to an independent inquiry or CBIprobe.Mani had later said the second affidavit was not drafted by him and that he had signed and filed it as he was under orders. According to a statement made in 2016 by then home minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament, the second affidavit (in 2009) was vetted by the then attorney general and approved by the then home minister (P Chidambaram). Notings on the file did not mention any reason for revising the affidavit. Rajnath's statement also cited testimony of 26/11 accused and American LeT operative David Coleman Headley, confirming Jahan as ""a female terrorist"" killed by the Indian police in a botched-up LeT operation.Mani had also said he was ""tortured"" by the chief of SIT when summoned in 2013. Mani has penned several books based on the central theme of political interference in terror investigations, including 'The Myth of Hindu Terror: Insider Account of Ministry of Home Affairs' and 'Deception: A Family that Deceived the Whole Nation'.","RVS Mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) named for the Padma Shri this Republic Day eve.

NEW DELHI: Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said, even as interest from British and Canadian universities gathers pace under India's liberalised foreign education regime. Officials said that colleges under the University of London and several Canadian universities have also conveyed keenness, with preliminary discussions underway.The momentum follows policy changes that have opened India's higher education sector to foreign universities. The National Education Policy, 2020 first articulated the case for allowing top global institutions to operate locally, and this was operationalised in 2023 through UGC regulations. The rules allow eligible foreign universities to establish independent campuses, design curricula and set admission norms, marking a decisive shift from earlier partnership-only models.There are foreign universities already running physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong at Gujarat's GIFT City, and the UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon. These campuses offer programmes in high-demand areas such as STEM and management, and have demonstrated that overseas institutions can operate within India's regulatory ecosystem.University of Liverpool, University of York and University of Aberdeen, among others are working towards similar operations.Against this backdrop, Purdue University's proposed India campus is being seen as a major credibility boost for the foreign university policy. Sources said discussions have reached an advanced stage, with talks focused on academic offerings, regulatory compliance and operational frameworks. Govt officials indicated that the plan is for Purdue to offer its flagship engineering and technology programmes in India, allowing students to earn a Purdue degree without having to study overseas.","Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said.

.

NEW DELHI: Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids of up to 48% less than the estimated project cost, largely due to aggressive bidding, which usually has a direct bearing on the quality of work.In a recent case, the road transport ministry cancelled a tender for a project in Manipur as the contractor with the lowest bid quoted 47% less than the cost the ministry had estimated. The contractor challenged the bid cancellation in Gauhati high court, and the court ordered an interim stay. ""This case is a classic example of how highway agencies are caught in the middle. Highway contractors are getting projects quoting low bids arguing they have quoted price after carrying out detailed assessment,"" said an official.Data since April 2023 showed that because of less number of projects being offered, there is fierce competition among bidders. For each tender, the number of bidders is in the range of seven to 19.Officials and industry insiders said that while there has been a huge increase in the number of highway contractors in the past 7-8 years, with govt rolling out a large number of projects and also bringing down the qualification criteria, there has been a significant fall in the number of works being bid.""This has resulted in players quoting low bids to ensure that their manpower and machinery do not lie idle, which causes further financial stress. This trend will hurt the sector and quality of work as well since we can't reject a lowest cost or L1 bid in construction works,"" said another official.The details of some of the low quoted bids since 2023-24 showed that a project in Madhya Pradesh - four-laning of Rahatgarh to Berkhedi - was bid out at Rs 324 crore, which was 48.4% less than NHAI's bid cost of Rs 627 crore. In the case of another project in Maharashtra - augmentation of existing stretch in urban areas of Pune on the Pune-Satara section - was bid out at Rs 321 crore, around 46% less than the project cost estimated by the highway authority.Similarly, the work for four-laning from Dareota to Kalar Bala in Himachal Pradesh was tendered at Rs 435 crore against NHAI's project cost of Rs 734 crore this year, which was around 41% less.","Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids.

Congress says Modi government not serious about caste count in Census 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-says-modi-government-not-serious-about-caste-count-in-census-2027/articleshow/127579721.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Congress Monday raised questions about the intent of Modi govt to hold a caste enumeration in Census 2027 as it had announced earlier, pointing out that the question about the caste of the head of a household in the ""houselisting"" phase does not offer ""OBC"" as an option. Govt last week published the gazette notification for ""houselisting"" which is to start in April, and released a list of 33 questions to be asked to households being surveyed.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh demanded that Modi govt immediately hold talks with political parties, states and civil society organisations before finalising the details of the caste enumeration exercise.Ramesh argued that ""question 12"" for ""houselisting"" asks whether the head of a household belongs to SCs, STs, or 'other' categories, but does not explicitly ask about OBC and general categories.""Since caste enumeration is to be part of Census 2027, 'question 12' as formulated does raise serious questions on Modi govt's true intentions and on its commitment to a comprehensive, fair, nation-wide caste census,"" he said.Ramesh reminded that PM Modi had rejected the demand of caste census raised by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, even dubbing it ""urban Naxal mindset"". But, he said, Modi govt did a 'U-turn' on April 30 last year, and announced that caste enumeration would be included in Census 2027, adding that PM was ""forced to capitulate"".""Congress calls upon Modi govt to immediately initiate a dialogue with political parties, state govts, and civil society organisations before finalising details of the caste enumeration exercise,"" Ramesh said, adding that such consultations were an integral part of the caste survey that was carried out by the Telangana govt in 2025.","The question about the caste of the head of a household in the ""houselisting"" phase does not offer ""OBC"" as an option.

Everything Fine, Says Shashi Tharoor After Skipping Congress Rally Amid Growing Speculation of Rift

NEW DELHI: The Congress leadership is likely to meet senior party member Shashi Tharoor after his absence from a brainstorming session on Kerala elections last week triggered a row, suggesting he was unhappy with the party.Sources said the party brass is thinking of inviting Tharoor for a discussion to address his grievances.Tharoor set tongues wagging after he stayed away from a meeting to which select senior Kerala functionaries were invited by AICC to discuss strategy for the upcoming state elections. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi chaired the meeting, which was attended by all key party members from the poll-bound state.While Tharoor, who was in Kozhikode for Kerala Literature Festival, said he had informed the party about his inability to attend the session, the Thiruvananthapuram MP also underlined that he has some issues with the party which he wants to discuss with the leadership. He even corroborated press reports about his unhappiness, saying some of them were correct.Sources said the thinking in the party is that the Kerala MP should be invited for a discussion to address his grievances.According to a party manager, the brass wants to ensure that the party is united going into the Kerala elections in which it believes the opposition alliance, United Democratic Front (UDF), has a good chance of dislodging the governing Left Democratic Front (LDF) alliance, its hopes raised by Opposition's strong performance in the local body elections last month.It is felt that Tharoor has his own pull with the electorate and should actively participate in the run-up to the polls to boost the party's prospects. However, the Lok Sabha MP has his detractors in the organisation who blame him for repeatedly taking a stance at variance with Congress and even being soft on BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The sudden emergence of wrinkles in the Kerala party organisation last week left many disturbed as developments of the last couple of months had indicated a new-found unity in the otherwise fractious unit. Tharoor not only attended party events like Lakshya but also clarified that he had never diverged from the party stance on key issues. But the supposed thaw was shattered by his absence from the AICC meeting last week.","Tharoor set tongues wagging after he stayed away from a meeting to which select senior Kerala functionaries were invited by AICC.

"Use gender-neutral terms, courts told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/use-gender-neutral-terms-courts-told/articleshow/127578800.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has heeded a suggestion of a woman district judge, which came a few years ago, and cleared a proposal on the use of gender-neutral terms in court-related documents.In a communication on Jan 15, the court administration told all district courts to replace the requirement of the father's/husband's name with that of the parent's/spouse's name. A missive from the registrar-general to all district judges heading the seven courts referred to letters from 2021 and 2022 ""of Ms. Savita Rao, DHJS"".The letter said that the administrative and general supervision committee had directed that ""necessary changes may be made in the official communication, forms and documents... so as to incorporate gender-neutral terms like spouse's name and/or parent's (mother/father's) name, instead of providing only father's/husband's name"". The changes must be communicated to all the districts for action at their end, the letter said.Once implemented, the change is expected to show in personal files of judicial officers, the identity cards of court staff, their provident fund forms and medical claim cards, to give a few examples, a sitting judge said.In 2021, Rao, the in-charge of the Saket court mediation wing, flagged her views regarding the absence of any option for a litigant or a court staff member filling up a court form.""I am in receipt of official communications where there is only the option of providing father's/husband's name. The need of the current situation in empowering women, treating women with equality and equal rights, can be resolved only when the centuries-old Indian patriarchal system is dealt with by better law and procedure. Today, it is immensely needed that a woman has the freedom to choose her surname after marriage, and also to opt for providing either the father's or the mother's name, and for the children/men to carry their mother's name as well,"" Rao's letter, addressed to the then district judge, said.Rao, now the district judge of the commercial court in Saket, pointed out that despite the nod from Delhi govt long ago to include the name of the mother in all official documents, no option was given in the documents as far as court-related work is concerned.""Women have to use either the husband's/father's name, and even the men have no option to use the name of their mothers, if they want to, instead of the father's name, ""with no consideration ever in mind"" for the option to use wife's name, she said.The insistence that women must provide the father's/husband's name, and that children/men must provide only the father's name, reiterates the patriarchal norm that women and children are belongings. These norms look down upon alternative family structures, Rao added.The letter argued that judicial institutions are ""the torchbearer for reforms in society"". Therefore, ""it is probably high time that we also move away from such outdated thinking, ie insistence to provide only father's/husband's name,"" the judge said.Rao urged the decisionmakers in the judiciary to make appropriate changes in correspondence, documents and forms to reflect the new social reality.","Delhi High Court has cleared a proposal on the use of gender-neutral terms in court-related documents.

A century in uniform: Chandigarh girl carries 4 generations of Army service to Kartavya Path,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-century-in-uniform-chandigarh-girl-carries-4-generations-of-army-service-to-kartavya-path/articleshow/127567608.cms,"CHANDIGARH: A fourth-generation Army officer from Chandigarh, carrying a family legacy that stretches from the cavalry of the British Indian Army to post-Independence gallantry and modern-day integrated warfare, was among the commanding faces of this year’s Republic Day parade. Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine.","Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path.

CHANDIGARH: A 27-year-old first-generation Army officer from Bathinda commanded a T-90 Bhishma main battle tank at the Republic Day parade this year, as Captain Vipanjot Virk of the Indian Army ’s 77 Armoured Regiment led it along Kartavya Path. Commissioned as the first Young Officer of the regiment, Captain Virk traces his decision to join the Army to formative school years marked by regular exposure to military role models, including a defining 2013 interaction with then COAS General Bikram Singh that left a lasting impression.“I knew about the Army through the school’s legacy of producing officers. You grow up seeing seniors joining the forces, and that makes the idea of serving in uniform feel achievable,” said Captain Vipanjot Virk.He said a defining moment came in 2013 during his school’s Founders Day celebrations, when General Bikram Singh, then Chief of the Army Staff and an alumnus of the school, visited the campus for Founders’ Day. He met the Army chief during the event and that the interaction strengthened his resolve to pursue a career in the armed forces.Captain Virk is part of the Indian Army’s 77 Armoured Regiment, a unit raised in recent years. He was commissioned into the regiment as one of its first officers and has been associated with it since its initial phase, including its raising and training activities.A resident of village Virk Khurd near Bathinda, Captain Virk is the only child of Iqbal Singh Virk.With no prior family background in the armed forces, he joined the Army as a first-generation officer from Punjab’s rural belt.“My son’s interest in the Army developed during his school years,” said his father, a farmer. “We never had anyone in the forces in our family, but he was clear about his goal very early and worked consistently towards it.”He completed his schooling in 2016 and joined the National Defence Academy in 2017. Virk credits his early exposure to military life to his time at the Punjab Public School, Nabha, which has a long association with the armed forces and has produced several officers over the years, including Major Anuj Sood, who got martyred in Handwara in 2020.","Captain Vipanjot Virk is part of the Indian Army’s 77 Armoured Regiment.

Kashmir braces for heavy snowfall after last week’s spell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmir-braces-for-heavy-snowfall-after-last-weeks-spell/articleshow/127567195.cms,"ANI file photo

SRINAGAR:

After this season’s first major widespread snowfall last week, Jammu and Kashmir is once again bracing for heavy snowfall as another western disturbance was set to hit the region Monday evening.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a major advisory, warning that the fresh spell of snowfall could disrupt air traffic and key highways, including the Jammu-Srinagar national highway.In its forecast, the IMD said snowfall was likely to start on the night of Jan 26, preceded by strong winds for a brief period at some places. It said that on Jan 27, moderate to heavy snowfall is expected at most places across Kashmir and the higher reaches of Jammu.The IMD, however, said there is no likelihood of heavy snowfall in the plains of Jammu. On Jan 28, the IMD said, there are chances of light rain at some places and snowfall in the higher reaches of Kashmir.Sonam Lotus, head of the meteorological centre in Leh, said Srinagar is likely to receive moderate to heavy snowfall. Lotus, who earlier headed the meteorological centre in J&K state, is widely known across Kashmir for his weather forecasts.He said that on Tuesday morning, Srinagar will receive snowfall but the accumulation will not be much. He said there is a possibility of three to four inch of snow accumulation. Last week’s snowfall in the Valley didn’t touch Srinagar city, leading to disappointment among residents.After a prolonged dry spell this winter, the Kashmir Valley and Pir Panjal and Chenab Valley regions of Jammu witnessed heavy snowfall and severe winds reaching speeds of up to 155 kmph on Friday, which blocked highways, led to flight cancellations, shut down schools, disrupted power supply and left several homes roofless.Despite the disruption, the snowfall brought cheer among people. Youngsters in the areas, including south Kashmir districts which witnessed heavy snowfall, were seen playing in the snow and celebrating the change in weather. Social media in Kashmir was full with snowfall reels. Heavy snowfall has attracted tourists and social media influencers from within and outside the country to Gulmarg, which has come alive once again, with long queues at the gondola as hundreds of tourists thronged the resort to enjoy skiing and gondola rides.CM Omar Abdullah on Sunday also rushed to Gulmarg, took a snow scooter ride and also enjoyed skiing.","The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a major advisory, warning that the fresh spell of snowfall could disrupt air traffic and key highways.

SRINAGAR:

A proposed railway line from Bijbehara to the tourist resort of Pahalgam is facing growing opposition in Jammu and Kashmir, where political figures have joined local residents in protest, arguing that the project would divest them of vast agriculture, apple orchard lands and severely impact their livelihood.Bijbehara is a historic town in Anantnag district in south Kashmir and is located some 45 km from Srinagar.MP from Anantnag-Poonch, Mian Altaf, on Sunday met residents of Wulherhama village, whose apple orchards and agricultural land fall along the proposed railway alignment, and said the railway line would not benefit anyone. “It does not benefit the central govt, J&K govt or the people of J&K. We have to convey to the central government that this railway line will serve no purpose,” Altaf said while interacting with the residents.He appealed to lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha and CM Omar Abdullah to intervene and write to the Centre on the issue.Several villages in south Kashmir have been opposing the project, seeking government intervention since Dec 2025, after surveys for the proposed rail alignment were conducted in several villages.National Conference MLA from Bijbehara, Bashir Ahmad Veeri, has described the project as ill-conceived and against public interest.Echoing similar concerns, NC MLA from Pahalgam, Altaf Ahmad Kaloo, questioned the need for the project. Kaloo, who joined Mian Altaf on Monday when the latter visited the area, said that National Highway-501 has already been sanctioned and land for it demarcated. “There is already a road to Pahalgam, and the parallel road has been declared NH-501. When land is scarce and a significant portion has already been acquired for the NH-501, what is the need for another 40-km zig zag railway line that will not help in any way,” Kaloo said. He said large tracts of land had already been taken up by the highway project, which is to be constructed soon.On Jan 22, PDP functionary Iltija Mufti visited the area and said establishing a railway line spanning hundreds of kanals of fertile agricultural and horticultural land and residential homes was ill-conceived, detrimental and, most importantly, environmentally unviable. She appealed to Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to scrap the plan entirely.Iltija said the government should consult the people before proposing such projects. “If a railway line is taken through agricultural and horticultural land, it will leave people jobless and homeless in a large number of cases,” she said.","MP from Anantnag-Poonch, Mian Altaf, on Sunday met residents of Wulherhama village, whose apple orchards and agricultural land fall along the proposed railway alignment.

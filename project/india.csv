She is a bigger disaster than Rahul Gandhi, who thinks sporting a bag in support of Palestine in the Parliament, is about fighting patriarchy. That is right. Crass communal virtue signaling to Muslims is now cloaked as stance against patriarchy! Make no mistake, Congress is the New Muslim League,"" Malviya wrote on X.Priyanka Gandhi responded by saying that the criticism was ""typical patriarchy"" where she was ""being told what to wear and what not to wear"".""Who is going to decide what clothes I wear now. That is typical patriarchy that you decide what clothes women wear. I don't subscribe to it. I will wear what I want to.""BJP's Sambit Patra also hit out at Priyanka Gandhi, saying ""The Gandhi family has always been carrying the bag of appeasement"".""The appeasement bag is the reason for their losses in elections,"" Sambit Patra said during a press briefing at the national capital.Priyanka's gesture comes days after she was seen wearing a black-and-white keffiyeh (a traditional Palestinian headscarf) during a meeting with the Palestinian Embassy's Charge d'Affaires.","Pakistan's ex-minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain lauded Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi for carrying a bag to Parliament with ""Palestine"" written on it.

"Modi to visit Kuwait over the weekend, 1st by an Indian PM to Gulf nation in 43 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-to-visit-kuwait-over-the-weekend-1st-by-an-indian-pm-to-gulf-nation-in-43-years/articleshow/116383285.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will visit Kuwait on Dec 21-22 for what will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the Gulf country in 43 years. While Modi was also expected to visit Saudi Arabia this month, that visit is now expected to take place next year because of a delay in finalisation of dates. A reliable supplier of crude and LPG to India and home to a million-strong Indian community, Kuwait is the only Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country Modi has not yet visited. Kuwait currently holds the GCC presidency. Kuwait foreign minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya had visited India earlier this month and met Modi to deliver him an invitation to visit the country.Recalling his meeting with the Crown Prince of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah in Sept in New York, Modi had expressed satisfaction at the growing momentum in bilateral relations, according to an Indian readout. Modi discussed the situation in West Asia with the visiting foreign minister, expressing support for early return of peace, security and stability in the region. Kuwait had on Dec 1 hosted a summit of the six-member GCC countries at which it had called for an immediate ceasefire and urged the international community to provide international protection for innocent civilians and to ensure ""the opening of safe corridors and the arrival of urgent humanitarian aid."" India too has repeatedly sought a ceasefire in Gaza and called for efforts to ensure that the conflict doesn't spill over to other parts of West Asia.The visiting foreign minister and his counterpart S Jaishankar had signed an MoU for establishing a Joint Commission for Cooperation at the level of foreign ministers, under which new joint working groups will be set up in areas like trade, investment, education, agriculture, technology, security and culture.""The JCC mechanism will act as an umbrella institutional mechanism to comprehensively review and monitor the entire gamut of our bilateral relations under the new Joint Working Groups and the existing ones in areas including Hydrocarbons, Health and Consular matters,'' said the Indian govt.",PM Narendra Modi will visit Kuwait on Dec 21-22 for what will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the Gulf country in 43 years.

He also interacted with the jawans over lunch, besides visiting a nearby village to see how the development and welfare initiatives were being delivered to locals residing around the camps.Advising jawans to adopt a differential approach towards armed Maoists and villagers, Shah said: ""Be tough on Naxals but your actions should not alienate locals. You should help them in their basic needs like healthcare.

"J&J denied extension of patent on TB drug, to benefit patients",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jj-denied-extension-of-patent-on-tb-drug-to-benefit-patients/articleshow/116383276.cms,"New Delhi: In a move that will benefit tuberculosis patients, Indian Patent Office (IPO) has denied the US giant Johnson & Johnson's request to extend its patent on the life-saving TB drug Bedaquiline. This ruling potentially facilitates the entry of affordable versions of the long-acting injectable Bedaquiline over the next few years, improving access for millions of patients in India, and globally, patent experts told TOI.The cost of therapy for the injectable long-acting bedaquiline runs into hundreds of dollars, making it unaffordable for millions of patients in developing countries, including India, which are also tuberculosis hotspots. While tuberculosis drugs are supplied free of charge under the govt-run programme in India, the steep cost of treatment remains a significant challenge.With this decision, all three patent applications by Johnson & Johnson's pharma arm - Janssen - for Bedaquiline stand rejected by Indian Patent Office. Earlier in July, the company was denied a patent for a paediatric version of bedaquiline, a key treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis recommended by WHO. Last year, the company lost protection on the drug's primary patent.The present application filed by Johnson & Johnson's in 2020 seeking a patent for the long-acting injectable bedaquiline, primarily developed for tuberculosis preventive therapy, was opposed by patient groups - Delhi Network of Positive People, Ganesh Acharya and Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust.The patent was rejected on the grounds of lack of inventive step and novelty.Bedaquiline, the first drug approved to treat tuberculosis in 40 years, is hailed as a ""wonder drug"" due to its lower toxicity and greater effectiveness compared to traditional treatments that have been the standard for TB over the past five decades.","Indian Patent Office (IPO) has denied the US giant Johnson & Johnson's request to extend its patent on the life-saving TB drug Bedaquiline.

Supreme Court seeks Centre's response on pan-India women safety norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-seeks-centres-response-on-pan-india-women-safety-norms/articleshow/116383267.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday sought Centre's response to a PIL by a women lawyers' association demanding a pan-India safety and security mechanism for protection of women and children from sexual assaults, which, it said, is rising despite stringent laws and repeated interventions from SC.The contours, width and ambit of the demands in the PIL by SC Women Lawyers' Association was extremely broad and included mandatory chemical castration of convicted rapists, installation of street lights and CCTVs at every nook and corner, martial art training for women and girls for self-defence, ban on free pornography, maintaining a national database of sexual offenders, and no bail to those accused of sexual assault till commencement of trial.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notice after hearing brief arguments from senior advocate Mahalakshmi Pavani, but said the expanse of reliefs sought by the PIL was so broad that the apex court may find it difficult to direct their implementation.""One of the prayers is to frame a guideline for social behaviour in public transports, which appears to be the need of the hour given the obnoxious attitude and activities of certain passengers, even inside aircraft. The behaviour of travellers on trains, buses and other public transport must be regulated so as not to offend or harass anyone, especially women and children,"" the bench said.From 'Nirbhaya' to 'Abhaya', and to RG Kar incident, cases relating to sexual assault of women and children continue to hit the headlines, Pavani said. She added that there should be prescribed punishment for journalists who name and shame victims in their reports, and argued that rape survivors must not be subjected to humiliating questioning during cross-examinations before courts.The petitioner said the court should direct ready access to National Database on Sexual Offenders, maintained by National Crime Records Bureau, to enable them to take safety measures against repeat sexual offenders and convicted rapists.Turning to police officers, the association said they must be trained to handle a rape survivor and conduct themselves with sensitivity while recording her statement on the alleged crime. Police personnel misusing powers while dealing with a rape survivor must be visited with penal action or disciplinary proceedings.","Supreme Court seeks Centre's response to a PIL by a women lawyers' association demanding a pan-India safety and security mechanism for protection of women and children.

Should discuss this with Bangladesh govt and support those who are in pain.""Priyanka said she wanted to speak on Vijay Diwas in Lok Sabha, but received a message that she could not raise the matter as the govt would speak on the issue. She said the govt till then probably did not remember the occasion, and later, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey was given the chance to raise the matter.""I wanted to pay tribute to those who fought the war and to the people who backed the Army. Also, I wanted to remember Indira Gandhi who had the capacity to take strong action.

From Nehru to Priyanka Gandhi, they have always carried bag of appeasement, never bag of patriotism.

CHANDIGARH: Surprising fans during a live show in Chandigarh, singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh announced that he ""won't perform (live) in India until infrastructure for it is improved.""Stopping in the middle of a throbbing presentation on Saturday, he said, ""Instead of bothering us (artistes), improve your concert infrastructure or I will not perform in India... I want to say this to the administration. We do not have proper facilities for live shows here. It is a big revenue source. A lot of people work (on these events) and get employment due to it. So, please pay heed to it.""The statement was received by a fawning audience in the packed space with thunderous applause. Dosanjh also made it a point to say that it is not he who calls children to his recitals, but ""parents bring them"".Following Telangana's move some time ago, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights had issued an advisory regarding ""maintaining noise level, not inviting kids to stage, and not singing songs promoting drugs, alcohol and violence"" during the performance.In a video that has now been shared widely on the social media, the singer, who has starred in films like ‘Chamkila’ and ‘Udta Punjab’, can be heard asking: “Will you stop me like this?”Dosanjh’s much-in-demand Dil-Luminati India tour , which kicked off in Delhi on Oct 26 and has drawn massive crowds in every city it has premiered, has had it rough with the administrations in various states across country. It has been fraught with challenges for the entertainer.Ahead of his concert in Hyderabad on Nov 15, Telangana govt issued a notice to Dosanjh asking him to “refrain from performing songs that promote alcohol, drugs, or violence”. It came after a professor from Chandigarh, Panditrao Dharennavar, filed a representation to authorities to not allow Dosanjh “sing such songs”. Accordingly, the singer at that time changed the lyrics of some of his songs, but criticised Telangana govt for restrictions imposed on him.His next in Ahmedabad saw him issue a challenge of his own. “If alcohol consumption is banned nationwide, I will no longer sing songs that mention it,” he had said.It was worse in Indore. Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) workers held a protest near the venue hours before the concert began. In response, Dosanjh dedicated his concert in the city to poet Rahat Indori, a resident of Indore who had died in 2020, and recited his lines: “If they oppose, let them; life is not at stake. This is just smoke, not the sky. Everybody’s blood (sacrifice) is mixed in this land’s soil, Hindustan is not anyone’s property.”","Singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh says he won't perform in India until infrastructure for it is improved.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday came down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the removal of the iconic 1971 war ""surrender"" painting from the Army headquarters in New Delhi with a new artwork, calling it part of a broader effort to alter India’s history.Congress MP Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha to address the removal of a 1971 war photograph from the Army Headquarters in New Delhi and its repercussions.In his notice to speaker Om Birla, Tagore expressed concern over the removal of the photograph, which marks the historic surrender of Pakistani forces in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on December 16, 1971. He called the act not only troubling but a direct insult to the historical significance of the event, urging the central government to ""immediately"" return the photograph to its original location.""This action is part of a disturbing trend observed in recent years, where similar efforts to alter or erase India's original history have been reported across various ministries, monuments, and defense establishments. These incidents appear to be part of a wider push by the PM Modi government to erase or reframe historical events that do not align with certain narratives,"" the Congress MP said.Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the government, saying, ""A picture has been taken down from the headquarters of the Army in which the Pakistani Army is surrendering in front of the Indian Army .""A release from the Indian Army, featuring Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi welcoming his visiting Nepalese counterpart with the new painting in the background, was the first sign that the old photograph had been removed.Meanwhile, as the controversy grew over the removal of the iconic painting, the Indian Army informed on Monday that it has been installed ""to its most befitting place,"" at the Manekshaw Centre in New Delhi.""On the occasion of Vijay Diwas , General Upendra Dwivedi COAS, along with the President of Army Wives Welfare Association (AWWA), Sunita Dwivedi, installed the iconic 1971 surrender painting to its most befitting place, The Manekshaw Centre, named after the Architect and the Hero of 1971 War, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw,"" Indian Army said in a post on X.Meanwhile, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari replied to Congress's criticism, saying, ""(We don't remove photographs, we have in fact put up new photographs of Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, PV Narasimha Rao in Prime Minister's Museum.The historic picture at the center of the row depicted Pakistan's Lt General A A K Niazi signing the Instrument of Surrender in 1971, alongside India’s Lt General Jagjit Singh Aurora . It was prominently displayed in the Army Chief’s annexe, where he met important visitors. The painting, symbolizing one of India’s greatest military victories, served as the backdrop for many photos taken with foreign dignitaries and others.The new artwork, however, named '– Field of Deeds', features images of Chanakya, Garuda, and Krishna driving Arjuna’s chariot from the Mahabharata alongside tanks, helicopters, and boats, showing India's military might.December 16, 1971, marks the day Pakistan signed the Instrument of Surrender in Dhaka after a 13-day war with India.

Atul Subhash suicide case: Allahabad HC grants anticipatory bail to Nikita Singhania's uncle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/atul-subhash-suicide-case-allahabad-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-nikita-singhanias-uncle/articleshow/116376569.cms,"Atul Subhash.

NEW DELHI: The Allahabad high court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of Nikita Singhania, in the suicide case of Artificial Intelligence engineer Atul Subhash. Justice Ashutosh Srivastava passed the order while hearing the bail application filed on behalf of Atul's wife, Nikita Singhania, and her in-laws.According to a Bengaluru Police official, Nikita Singhania was arrested in Gurugram, Haryana, while her mother, Nisha Singhania, and brother, Anurag Singhania, were arrested in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly abetting Atul Subhash’s suicide. They were taken into custody on Saturday, brought to Bengaluru, and sent to judicial custody for 14 days after being presented in a local court.In the high court, senior counsel Manish Tiwary argued that while Nikita, Nisha, and Anurag had already been arrested, the anticipatory bail application was being pressed solely on behalf of Sushil Singhania.It was argued that the arrests were based on a suicide note and a video that had circulated online. The counsel submitted that Sushil Singhania, aged 69, suffers from chronic medical issues, is incapacitated, and could not have abetted the suicide.The counsel further argued that there is a difference between harassment and abetment, claiming that even if the suicide note is considered, the allegations suggest harassment rather than abetment. It was also submitted that Section 108, 3(5) of the BNS might not apply to the case.After hearing the arguments, the court ruled, “Considering the above, the court is of the opinion that applicant Sushil Singhania is entitled to get the privilege of pre-arrest (Transit) Anticipatory.”The court directed that if the applicant is arrested in connection with the case, he should be released on anticipatory bail until the police file a report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC. The applicant was asked to furnish a personal bond of ₹50,000 and two sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the magistrate or concerned court.The court also imposed conditions: the applicant must be available for police interrogation as required, must not influence witnesses, and cannot leave India without prior court permission. If the applicant has a passport, it must be submitted to the concerned SSP or SP.","The Allahabad high court granted anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of Nikita Singhania.

Where online education facilities exist, students and their parents will have the choice to opt for virtual learning.The stage 3 restrictions also prohibit non-essential diesel-powered medium goods vehicles with BS-IV or older standards from operating within Delhi. Additionally, non-essential diesel light commercial vehicles meeting BS-IV or older standards registered outside Delhi are barred from entering the city.These restrictions mark an expansion from earlier regulations, which only applied to BS-III vehicles.Earlier on December 5, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for Delhi-NCR revoked restrictive pollution control measures under stages 3 and 4 of the winter anti-pollution plan.

NEW DELHI: Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be ""used in any way, in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India.Following discussions at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, Dissanayake emphasised his commitment to strengthening Indo-Sri Lankan relations, saying, ""the cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support for India.""""I have also given an assurance to the Prime Minister of India that we will not allow our land to be used in any way in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India. The cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support for India,"" he assured.On his inaugural foreign visit since taking office in September, the Sri Lankan president expressed pleasure at choosing Delhi for his first state visit. The three-day tour marked a significant diplomatic engagement between the nations.""After becoming the President of Sri Lanka, this is my first foreign visit. I am so happy that I was able to come to Delhi on my first State visit. I want to thank India for the invitation extended to me and also for the warm hospitality that was extended to the whole delegation, including myself,"" he said.Dissanayake expressed gratitude for India's hospitality and the invitations from PM Modi and President Murmu. He highlighted how the visit strengthened bilateral cooperation between the two nations.""I want to thank PM Modi and President Murmu. This visit paved the way for the cooperation between the two countries to be developed further,"" he added.He acknowledged India's crucial support during Sri Lanka's recent economic crisis, saying, “we faced an unprecedented economic crisis some 2 years ago and India supported us immensely to come out of that quagmire. It has also helped us immensely after that, especially in the debt-free structuring process.""The Sri Lankan President highlighted India's commitment to his country, noting PM Modi's assurances regarding full support and protection of Sri Lanka's territorial integrity and sovereignty.“I know that Sri Lanka secures a very significant place in the foreign policy of India. PM Modi assured us full support and he also assured us that he will always protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka,” he added.The assurance from Sri Lankan president came at a crucial point as China is intensifying its presence in the Indian Ocean region, particularly targeting Indian interests.China's control over Hambantota Port, acquired through Sri Lanka's debt default, has enabled Beijing to station vessels like the Yuan Wang 5, a 25,000-tonne satellite and missile tracking ship. This development concerns India due to Sri Lanka's geographical proximity.Despite India's initial objections in August 2022, Sri Lanka eventually permitted Chinese vessels to dock for 'replenishment' at Hambantota.Meanwhile, Chinese surveillance vessels keep on patrolling the Indian Ocean region and using the Hambantota port.China secured a 99-year lease on Hambantota port after Sri Lanka struggled with loan repayments. The $1.7 billion project, with phase one completed in 2010, required annual payments of $100 million, which Colombo failed to meet.","Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be ""used in any way, in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India"" The assurance came at a crucial point as China is intensifying its presence in the Indian Ocean region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116373305,imgsize-1196617,width-400,resizemode-4/116373305.jpg"

I say this with full responsibility, EVM cannot be hacked. EVM cannot be tampered with. There is a simple reason for this. First, it is a standalone machine ... no connection with any network or outer gadget. So, hacking or tampering is not possible. Second, the chip used in it is one-time programmable, so there cannot be any reprogramming Maharashtra additional chief electoral officer Kiran Kulkarni

NEW DELHI: After Rahul vs Mamata leadership tussle, EVMs have become the latest flashpoint between INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance)bloc partners. A day after National Conference leader Omar Abdullah openly ridiculed Congress's stand with his remarks ""you can't accept election results when you win, and blame EVMs when you lose"" echoing BJP's line of attack, it was the turn of Trinamool Congress to sermon the grand old party.""The people who raise questions on EVM, if they have anything then they should go and show a demo to the Election Commission. If work is done properly at the time of EVM randomisation and the people who work on the booth check during mock polls and counting, then I don't think there is any substance in this allegation,"" Trinamool Congress MP and party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said on Monday.""If still someone feels that EVMs can be hacked, then they should meet the Election Commission and show how EVMs can be hacked ... Nothing can be done by just making random statements,"" the TMC MP added.The Congress reacted sharply to Omar Abdullah's remarks and reminded the J&K chief minister that it was not alone in questioning the use of EVMs.Urging Omar Abdullah to ""verify facts"", Congress leader Manickam Tagore questioned Omar Abdullah's swipe, saying, ""Why this approach to our partners after being CM?"" ""It’s the Samajwadi Party , NCP, and Shiv Sena UBT that have spoken against EVMs. Please check your facts,"" Tagore said on X . ""The Congress CWC resolution clearly addresses the ECI only. Why this approach to our partners after being CM?"" he added.Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav is a vocal critic of EVMs and is on record to state in Parliament that even if his party wins all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh he will still demand scrapping the use of EVMs.""I did not trust EVMs yesterday, I don't trust EVMs today and I will not trust EVMs even if I win all 80 seats in UP. I will use the victory attained by EVMs to remove the EVM. The doubts over the use EVMs has not died and we Samajwadis will not sit quiet till use of EVMs is stopped,"" Akhilesh had said in Lok Sabha.The Shiv Sena (UBT) of Uddhav Thackeray has also been vocal against the use of EVMs. After the party's humiliating show in the just-concluded Maharashtra assembly elections, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut put a post on his X handle along with a poster, which said, ""Jiska EVM, uski democracy"", which means democracy belongs to those who control Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).""In a dig at the BJP, which along with its partners Shiv Sena and NCP swept the Maha polls, Sanjay Raut had said the ruling Mahayuti should take out a procession of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and take the decision to construct an EVM temple.""During the first cabinet meeting, they should announce the construction of an EVM temple in front of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in Nagpur,"" Raut had said last week.Maharashtra NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) chief Jayant Patil had also raised concerns about the use of EVMs in the Maharashtra assembly elections, questioning the rise in voting numbers after 5 pm.""Even though our numbers are less, we will continue to raise questions. In the recent elections, voting increased in Maharashtra after 5 pm. This is a matter of concern. While the EVM is a simple calculator, it increases the vote count automatically at night. This is a critical issue that must be addressed. The Election Commission of India appears to be hiding something,"" Patil had said.Demanding the return of ballot papers, he had stated, ""Ballot papers must replace EVMs because it will also restore people's trust in the system. The voting percentage will decline if people do not trust the system.""The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra is still protesting against the use of EVMs. On Monday, members staged a demonstration on the steps of the Maharashtra Vidhan Bhawan in Nagpur and raised slogans against the use of EVMs in elections.Leader of opposition in the state legislative council Ambadas Danve led the demonstration of the MVA leaders, who called for ""saving"" the Constitution and democracy and opposed the use of EVMs. They raised slogans like ""EVM Hatao Desh Bachao"", ""EVM Hatao Constitution Bachao"" and ""EVM Hatao Democracy Bachao"".The Congress, which faced humiliating defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, is at the forefront of the campaign against the use of EVMs.A Congress leader has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking verification of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used during Haryana assembly polls. Karan Singh Dalal, a former 5-time MLA, in the plea sought directions to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to lay down a memorandum for the checking and verification of the original burnt memory/microcontroller of the four components of the EVM (Control Unit, Ballot Unit, VVPAT and Symbol Loading Unit).The Centre has cited the Election Commission remarks to reject all opposition charges on EVM tampering. ""Nearly 42 petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court and various high courts questioning the electronic voting machines (EVMs), with the higher judiciary repeatedly holding that the machines are credible, reliable and tamper-proof,"" the government said citing the EC in Lok Sabha recently.The divide over EVM comes days after the partners of INDIA bloc were openly engaged in a leadership tussle with Mamata Banerjee slamming the Congress over its electoral failures and staking claim to lead the opposition front. She was supported by leaders like Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad who backed Mamata's claim. The Congress is definitely not alone within the INDIA bloc in questioning the use of EVMs, but the grand old party has been singled out by some of its regional allies highlighting the power tussle within the opposition coalition.","TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee: ""If still someone feels that EVM can be hacked, then they should meet the Election Commission and show how EVMs can be hack"" Congress leader Manickam Tagore: ""It’s the Samajwadi Party, NCP, and Shiv Sena UBT that have spoken against EVM.

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab.

NEW DELHI: On the eve of, deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday called the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus an ""undemocratic group"" that is ""secretly supporting anti-liberation extremist-communal forces.""In a statement to commemorate the defeat of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh’s Liberation War of 1971, Hasina dubbed Muhammad Yunus as a ""fascist"" seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.The statement released by her party revolved around the role of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Awami League in the struggle that culminated in the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. Hasina took the opportunity to criticise Nobel laureate Yunus, who formed an interim government shortly after she stepped down and fled to India.""This undemocratic group, led by the fascist Yunus, has no responsibility towards the people,"" she said.""They are seizing power and obstructing all public welfare work,"" she added.Hasina slammed the Yunus-led administration, claiming that the people of Bangladesh were burdened by rising prices.""As this government is not democratically elected, it has no accountability to the people. Their main aim is to suppress the spirit of the Liberation War and the pro-liberation forces, silencing their voices,"" Hasina said.""The lack of sensitivity of the leaders of this government, including the fascist Yunus, towards the Liberation War and its history is evident in every step they take,"" she further said.Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh after massive student protests, accused the interim government of attempting to erase “progressive ideals,” the history and spirit of the Liberation War, and “all traces of the Great War of Liberation from national life.”In her statements after reaching India, Hasina has repeatedly accused Yunus of perpetrating “genocide” and failing to protect Hindus and other minorities.

Rejection is a bitter pill to swallow, especially when it’s from a dream like Stanford University. For 17-year-old Indian entrepreneur Aaryan Singh Kushwah , the rejection letter didn’t mark the end of the road. Instead, it became a turning point, fueling his already extraordinary journey and sparking a viral discussion on how failure often lays the foundation for success.Kushwah recently shared his “bittersweet” moment on social media, posting the rejection email alongside two snapshots of his entrepreneurial milestones.Despite Stanford’s denial, his achievements speak volumes. His venture hit an impressive 220,000 users, recorded over 2 million impressions in a single day, and secured a $10,000 emergent grant. In his post, he reflected, “Tough loss but gotta come back stronger. Grateful I had the opportunity to apply, grateful I felt badly about the loss. All in God’s glory.”The rejection letter, signed by Richard H Shaw, dean of admission and financial aid at Stanford, acknowledged the competitiveness of the admissions process and Kushwah’s exceptional application. Though it was a polite “no,” Kushwah’s story resonated deeply online, inspiring conversations about resilience and redefining success.Social media exploded with reactions. Many praised Kushwah’s ability to channel disappointment into motivation. One user wrote, “God’s got a plan for you, man. Don’t lose momentum, keep on going.” Another chimed in, “Failure teaches you better lessons than any university. Good luck!”Some saw the rejection as a blessing in disguise. “It’s all part of a bigger plan,” commented one supporter, while another encouraged him to try again: “The application process is overwhelming, but it teaches you so much. You’ve got this if you try again next year!”A cheeky commenter joked, “You mean you already dropped out of Stanford? Congrats! Looks like it’s going well for you already.”Kushwah’s story stands as a testament to resilience. While his dream of studying at Stanford is deferred, his entrepreneurial journey is soaring—and proving that success isn’t always found in Ivy League halls. Instead, it often emerges from grit, determination, and the courage to keep going.","Aaryan Singh Kushwah, a 17-year-old student shared three pictures on social media.

Setback for singer TM Krishna as SC says shouldn't be given MS Subbulakshmi award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/setback-for-singer-tm-krishna-as-sc-says-shouldnt-be-given-ms-subbulakshmi-award/articleshow/116370177.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said that Carnatic vocalist TM Krishna should not be recognised as the recipient of the MS Subbulakshmi award. It issued notices to Krishna, the Music Academy, and others on a plea filed by MS Subbulakshmi’s grandson, who challenged the use of the legendary singer’s name for the award, claiming it violated her will.The apex court on Sunday had declined to immediately intervene, stating that an appeal against the Madras high court’s order allowing the award could only be heard on Monday. Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna remarked, “The appeal will be heard on Monday, and the award could be taken back if the court ultimately finds any merit in the case.”Earlier, the Music Academy was granted relief when a division bench of the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order restraining the academy from using Subbulakshmi’s name for the award. The bench of Justices S S Sundar and P Dhanabal observed, “From the plain reading of the contents of the Will, the testatrix did not want anybody to form or create or make any trust, foundation, or memorial of any kind including erecting of any statue or bust in her name or in her memory.”However, the bench rejected the interpretation that Subbulakshmi intended to forbid the conferment of awards in her name, stating, “Had it been the intention of the testatrix that no award shall be conferred on anyone in her name, that could have been expressed in simple language. An interpretation contrary to the plain language of the instrument is not permissible in law.”The court noted that during her lifetime, Subbulakshmi had acknowledged several works and awards instituted in her name, and such practices were not in dispute. It also highlighted that the plaintiff, her grandson, had not included other organisations that had instituted similar awards in her name, adding, “This court is unable to reject the contention or stand taken by appellants that the suit and the interlocutory application is not for a bona fide cause, but with an oblique motive against Krishna.”After the Madras high court on Friday allowed the Music Academy to proceed with the award, senior advocate N Venkataraman urgently mentioned the matter in the Supreme Court. The award ceremony took place on Sunday despite the pending appeal.","Supreme Court issues notices to Krishna, the Music Academy, and others on a plea filed by MS Subbulakshmi’s grandson. The apex court on Sunday had declined to immediately intervene, stating that an appeal against the Madras high court's order allowing the award could only be heard on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116371044,imgsize-1333907,width-400,resizemode-4/116371044.jpg"
BJP: What's in Nehru letters that Gandhis want to hide?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-whats-in-nehru-letters-that-gandhis-want-to-hide/articleshow/116383249.cms,"NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD: A member of the Prime Minister's Museum and Library (PMML) has urged Rahul Gandhi , the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, to return the letters written by Jawaharlal Nehru to Lady Mountbatten, Jayaprakash Narayan and others, which were allegedly withdrawn on Sonia Gandhi 's orders in 2008, prompting BJP to ask what was in these letters that the Gandhi family ""did not want the nation to know"".PMML member and Ahmedabad-based historian Rizwan Kadri said the move to approach the LoP came after getting no response from Sonia. ""Since no response was received from her, I have requested Rahul Gandhi to help in getting these material restored. I have also urged him to consider that these documents are part of the nation's heritage and an important aspect of its history,"" Kadri said. He added that the collection included letters between Nehru and Lady Mountbatten, as well as exchanges with Govind Ballabh Pant and Jayaprakash Narayan.Kadri said in Sept this year, a formal request was made to Sonia Gandhi through e-mail regarding 51 cartons from eight different sections of Nehru collection at PMML, formerly Nehru Memorial Museum & Library.Pouncing on the development, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said on Monday, ""The question is whether Rahul Gandhi, as leader of opposition, will actually speak to Sonia Gandhi to return these letters to the nation.

When the decision was made in 2010 to digitise all these documents, why did Sonia Gandhi take these letters before the digitisation could happen? What was in these letters that the Gandhi family did not want the nation to know?""He further said, ""Two serious issues arise from this - first, the sense of entitlement by the 'first family', believing that it was their property to reclaim at will, and second, the content of these letters.""In the e-mail to Sonia Gandhi, Kadri said he had requested that the letters be either returned to PMML or be granted permission to scan them, or provided with their scanned copies.

Together, they raised three children - two daughters and a son. But as the years passed, differences began to surface, eroding the foundation of their relationship. By May 8, 2006, their lives had diverged and they began living apart.The husband filed for divorce, citing mental cruelty, but the Karnal family court rejected his petition in 2013. Unwilling to give up, he approached the high court, where his plea languished for 11 years before the court referred the case to its mediation and conciliation centre in Nov this year, offering a final opportunity for compromise.It was during this mediation process that a resolution was reached. The estranged couple, along with their grown-up children, agreed to dissolve the marriage. The husband committed to a remarkable alimony of Rs 3.07 crore.This sum was to be paid in a mix of demand drafts, cash, and gold and silver ornaments, reflecting the wealth accumulated over a lifetime. The land generated Rs 2.16 crore, while an additional Rs 50 lakh was paid in cash, earnings from his crops, including sugarcane. Gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 40 lakh were handed over to his former wife.The settlement marked a turning point. The agreement, signed on Nov 22, stipulated that the payment would serve as permanent alimony, closing all claims the wife or children might have had on the husband's properties.""Even after the death of the first party, the second and third party (wife and children) will not lay any claim over the estate,"" the agreement states, ensuring a clean slate for all involved.In its detailed order, the division bench of Justice Sudhir Singh and Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi formally dissolved the marriage, acknowledging the poignancy of the settlement.","Couple from Haryana's Karnal district has brought their 44-year-long marriage to a close.

Specialists in Mumbai and Delhi whom TOI spoke to, said that two anti-fibrotic medications aimed at reducing the scarred lung tissues are the mainstay of IPF treatment . ""Most of our patients don't survive beyond three to four years after the diagnosis,"" said Dr Priti Meshram, who heads the respiratory medicine department at Maharashtra govt-run JJ Hospital in Byculla.Pulmonologist Dr Sujeet Rajan from Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, though, said ongoing clinical trials for at least two compounds should help increase life expectancy a bit more. IPF is a condition in which lung tissues thicken and cause scarring. ""The scarred tissues impair oxygen transfer and make breathing increasingly difficult,"" said Dr Sourabh Pahuja from Amrita Hospital, Faridabad. It roughly affects 13-20 people per 1,00,000 people worldwide, said Dr Sandeep Nayar from BLK-Max Super Speciality Hospital, Delhi.One of the main problems with IPF in India is delayed diagnosis. The mean time between the appearance of symptoms and a diagnosis is between six months and one year in the West. ""In India, apart from the metro cities, the symptoms-to-diagnosis time is longer,"" said Dr Rajan. Given the high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in India, it's likely the first diagnosis that a patient receives when he goes with the symptoms of coughing and breathlessness - that are common to both TB and IPF. ""Moreover, IPF shows up in most X-rays as a subtle shadow that is rarely considered worrisome,"" said Dr Rajan.Dr Randeep Guleria, former director of AIIMS who is with Medanta Gurgaon at present, told TOI the cause of IPF is not known, but recent studies suggest genetic and environmental factors play a role. ""Also, IPF is a disease that affects older people. As longevity is rising, so is the incidence of these diseases,"" Dr Guleria said. Dr Pahuja said mutations in the MUC5B gene, which produces a mucus protein crucial for lung health, significantly increases the risk, while Dr Nayar added smoking, viral infections, and gastroesophageal reflux disease could also be likely contributors.Dr Rajan said the incidence is growing worldwide, pointing to a link with rising air pollution. Despite the dismal picture, doctors said research should help in the near future. ""I just finished a trial for a new medicine that may be available in the next 12-18 months. Another potential medicine is on trial. Both have shown promising results in stabilising patients,"" said Dr Rajan.","IPF is a condition in which lung tissues thicken and cause scarring.

Congress mutilated statute to promote 'dynasty': Nirmala

Kharge: PM bhakti taking us towards dictatorship

Rajya Sabha witnessed a fiery start to the two-day-long discussion to mark 75 years of the Constitution with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman launching a scathing attack on Congress for carrying out major amendments to the statute over the decades with the sole aim to help ""one family"" and promote ""parivarvad"" (dynasticism). She also called Congress ""anti-women"" for failing to get women's reservation bill passed when it was in office.Citing various amendments, ranging from the 42nd constitutional amendment that, among other things, amended the Preamble to insert 'socialist and secular', and enactment of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, to nullify a Supreme Court verdict in favour of an old Muslim divorcee woman, the FM said none of these passed the four-fold criteria - economic good, social intent, due process, and constitutional spirit.Her attack drew strong protests from Congress benches. Opening the debate from treasury side, Sitharaman cited example of the first amendment carried out under Jawaharlal Nehru to introduce curbs on freedom of press.She pointed out that during debates in the constituent assembly, B R Ambedkar had opposed incorporation of 'socialism' in the Constitution on grounds that the country's growth trajectory could not be straight-jacketed. ""Still, they put it in the amendment after putting the entire opposition in jail. Only five members voted against it in Lok Sabha, whereas in Rajya Sabha, it was passed unanimously because those who would have opposed it were in jail,"" she added.Taking on Congress for claiming to be defender of the Constitution, the FM referred to supersession of ""inconvenient"" judges by the Indira Gandhi govt and recalled Congress' espousal of the concept of ""committed judiciary"" to say that the party was not sincere in expressing concern about integrity of institutions.She was combative and ceded no quarter when Congress' Jairam Ramesh argued that while attacking Indira for controversial amendments during the Emergency, she should also point out that the former PM voted for their annulment. ""Those amendments were brought by the Morarji Desai govt and her vote was part of a process. People had taught a lesson to her by defeating Congress and she learnt her lesson,"" Sitharaman said. She was supported by BJP chief and leader of the House J P Nadda.Sitharaman pointed out that renowned lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri and actor Balraj Sahni were jailed in 1949. She said Majrooh was arrested after he refused to apologise for reciting a poem against Nehru at a mill workers' meet. ""That is the level of tolerance they have and they go around with the Constitution in their hand saying there is fear in the country and the Constitution is under threat,"" she added. She highlighted other instances, including banning of the film 'Kissa Kursi Ka' because it questioned Indira and her son.The FM termed Congress ""anti-women"" for not passing women's reservation bill under pressure of its coalition partners. She said Rajiv Gandhi had 426 members in Lok Sabha and 159 members in Rajya Sabha but the party did not have the conviction to pass the bill. ""Clearly, they have always been anti-women. Shah Bano case is a clear example,"" she said.In a no holds barred attack, leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday accused PM Narendra Modi and BJP of ""misleading the country"" by ""twisting facts"" and speaking ""untruths"" about first PM Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament. He demanded that the PM apologise for ""distorting facts"" about Nehru's letter on reservation to states.Opening the two-day discussion on the Constitution from the opposition side, Kharge said 'bhakti' of the PM is taking the country towards dictatorship. ""Democracy in the country should not turn into dictatorship,"" he warned. The Congress chief further accused BJP of being against reservations, claiming that was the reason the party was opposed to caste census.Referring to the PM's statement in LS on Saturday, Kharge said Modi ""misled"" the House by saying there was no elected govt between 1947-1952 when Congress had illegally amended the Constitution. The PM on Saturday and FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday slammed Congress for the then interim govt led by Nehru bringing the first amendment to curb freedom of press.On the first amendment which was brought through an ordinance in 1951, Kharge said it was done only to preserve reservations of SCs, STs, and BCs as these had been set aside by Supreme Court. He quoted a letter from Sardar Patel to Nehru, in which Patel had suggested that the amendment was the only remedy. The Congress chief said the amendment was done by constituent assembly whose members included Syama Prasad Mookerjee, one of the founders of Jana Sangh. He said the other aspect of this amendment was aimed to stop communal propaganda.Referring to the PM's speech in Lok Sabha, Kharge said, ""Modi distorted facts about Nehru's letters to CMs for which he should apologise to people of the country. He must apologise in both the Houses."" On the Emergency, Kharge said that it was a mistake that was rectified and the result was that Indira Gandhi came back to office with a thumping majority in 1980. Kharge also asked why PM Modi, who was moving around the whole world, had not been able to take out time to visit violence-hit Manipur.","Congress mutilated statute to promote 'dynasty': Nirmala Sitharaman.

"After NC, TMC too junks Congress' EVM charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-nc-tmc-too-junks-congress-evm-charges/articleshow/116381952.cms,"OUTCRY: Opposition politicians protest against EVMs at Maharashtra assembly’s Nagpur session on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of J&K CM Omar Abdullah questioning Congress for its inconsistent stance on EVMs, another INDIA bloc partner, TMC, has disengaged itself from the leading opposition party's carping against the voting machines.""People who raise questions on EVMs should go and show a demo to EC. If work is done properly at the time of EVM randomisation and people at the booth verify during mock polls and counting, then I don't think there is any substance to these allegations,"" TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee told reporters here, in what marked a strong endorsement of EC's claim about the voting machines being rigging proof.""If someone still feels that EVMs can be hacked, then they should meet EC, and show how that can be done... Nothing can be done by just making random statements,"" he added. TMC has been consistently winning elections against powerful opponents: BJP and once-dominant Left.The divergence of INDIA bloc partners with Congress's stand is the second big instance of dissonance in the coalition. SP, TMC and NCP(SP) have already publicly expressed reservations about Congress's continuing attacks over the Modi govt's alleged links with the Adani group.Omar's statement on Sunday said, ""When you get hundred-plus MPs using the same EVMs and you celebrate that as sort of a victory for your party, you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to,"" he had said.Congress MP Manickam Tagore asked J&K CM why has he changed his approach towards INDIA bloc partners after his win. Parties such as SP, NCP (SP), Shiv Sena (UBT) have spoken against EVMs while Congress is focused on EC. ""Please check your facts, Abdullah. Congress Working Committee resolution clearly addresses EC only. Why this approach to our partners after becoming CM?"" he asked.BJP swiftly latched on to the contradictions among its opponents, with party spokesperson Sambit Patra taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, saying if he doesn't know how to fight elections, he should not blame EVMs.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said, ""Whenever Congress loses polls, instead of introspecting, it blames someone else... When they form govts in Karnataka and Jharkhand, there is no problem with EVMs, but when they lose Maharashtra, they blame EVMs,"" he said, terming the Congress's remarks on EVMs as ""selective criticism"".",TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee says EVMs can't be hacked. J&K CM Omar Abdullah had questioned Congress' inconsistent stance on EVMs. The divergence of INDIA bloc partners with Congress's stand is the second big instance of dissonance in coalition.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116382009,imgsize-1596394,width-400,resizemode-4/116382009.jpg"

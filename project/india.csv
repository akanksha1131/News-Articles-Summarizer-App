■ Strategic autonomy is the core principle of French diplomacy and it is also the case with India. We have the same view on the Indo-Pacific. My president has always been very clear. We oppose any kind of hegemon in the region.We realise that thanks to this strategic partnership, which celebrated its 25th anniversary two years ago, our common interest is really to work hand in hand in different sectors. That’s why we adopted a new roadmap when PM Modi visited France.Defence and security really is the core of our partnership. We just had good news about the Rafale (M) aircraft. In the coming months and years, you will see more... Make in India is a priority for India and all our big stakeholders in the defence industry want to play the game. That means coming to India, building in India and transfer of technology. That’s the key.What we have done through a new roadmap is to enlarge the relationship. We have three pillars. The first is defence and security. The second is what we call the partnership for the planet... issues like climate change and biodiversity protection. The third pillar is, for me, maybe the most challenging because it’s the key to long-term (ties): people-topeople exchanges. Indian diaspora in France is quite small compared to your diaspora in other countries. And one of the consequences is that the number of students in France is also very small.■ Our president gave us a very ambitious target, to very rapidly have 30,000 Indian students (8,000 registered for 20232024, 10,000 threshold expected to be achieved this year). We have created a mechanism for international classes and signed agreements with 35 universities. And in those universities, we have specific classes only for Indians ( classes internationales ).We haven’t done this for other countries. So, we take Indian students at the end of high school, send them to those classes for one year (where) they will have intensive French learning and, at the same time, start courses for the curriculum they would like to follow. It means that after one year, there is no language problem.French business schools now are among the best in the world. What is very interesting is that since last year Indian students are the top foreign nationality in our business school. For the simple reason that in these schools the curriculum is totally in English. It suggests that Indian students find France attractive. We have a different approach to student mobility. Our intention is not to attract hundreds of thousands of students. We want to attract the best. And we want those students to come back to India because we want our university partnership and student mobility to be part of our strategic partnership.We have about 800 French companies in the country. They are already employing more than 500,000 Indians. So, we tell our Indian students, well, try to learn French but, if not, you go to France anyway to study and after you graduate, you come back to your country because your country needs you and you can help us develop this strategic partnership. We don’t want to facilitate any brain drain.■ Well, I think the new American administration has brought to the international scene more volatility and unpredictability. I would say that more than ever the strategic partnership between France and India is the key. Stability is important. And it’s not a question only for govts, it’s also essential for the private sector. I see an advantage in this new situation... which is that once again partnerships like the one we have with India are going to be very important. We just had a historic visit by the European Commission president during which it was announced that the India-EU FTA will be finalised by the end of this year.■ My answer to that is simple. When it comes to transfer of technology, or rehabilitation of the industrial sector, you won’t be able to find a better offer than that from the French. Judge us from the past and from the present. And what you have seen so far is just the beginning of a long journey. Our Indian partners trust us. They know that our industry is here to stay, to invest, as I said, to produce, to make in India,to do transfer of technology. I’m not sure that other stakeholders would be ready to do the same.■ In Europe, we have rules not to put barriers in our market. As a matter of fact, the European market is the most open in the world.It means huge opportunities for Indian companies. But, at the same time, we have rules which are there for everybody. Like for our own companies… protecting the environment, for example. It’s well known that we have a strong interest in the agri business, in exporting wines, champagne.... For Germany, it will be the automotive sector. India has its own interests. We have to sit around the table and look at all the parameters. I am confident that now there is political will on both sides for that.■ You have to understand there is one aggressor, Russia, and one country that has been invaded — Ukraine. An offer of peace has been put on the table and the US contributed to it. And Ukraine is eager for peace but not Russia.In order to have peace, everybody has to come to the table, including Russia. But that’s not the case. Most EU countries now realise they need to take their future into their own hands as far as security and defence is concerned. I’m sure that in a couple of years, when peace is back in Ukraine, you will see a totally different Europe. Our dream, to some extent, would be to have this strategic autonomy at the European level, which is obviously not the case so far.■ The need for unity and autonomy is clearly shared by all EU members. Ukraine was a real trigger for all of us to understand that we shouldn’t rely on outsiders. Look at Germany. The decisions they have taken are historic. Like the next chancellor’s decision to invest massively in defence. The way Europe sees itself is changing. But obviously it will take some time.■ Having a strategic partnership and very close relations with India means that we talk of everything. On the French journalist issue, a solution was found. Both countries trust each other and that is the core of the relationship.■ When you want to go to France as a tourist, we do our best at the Embassy of France in India to process the visa application in 48 hours after we receive the file. As France is part of Schengen zone, we are also bound by Schengen rules. We really want to welcome more Indian tourists, students, professionals.■ Well, I think it’s essential for these two big giants in the world and in Asia to find a way to fully normalise their relations. What I said about India being a key for finding solutions to challenges like global health, climate change is true also for China. At some point, the two countries will have to find a way to not just resolve the border issue but also find ways to address the big challenges that the world is facing. The 20th century to some extent or the 19th century was the West’s century. Now, all eyes are on Asia. And you have two big players — India and China. We naturally wish they can have normal relations.","French ambassador to India Thierry Mathou tells TOI how his country is looking to widen bilateral ties, expand trade, attract more students and tourists and double down on the defence partnership. India-EU FTA will be finalised by the end of this year, Mathou says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121151342,imgsize-562423,width-400,resizemode-4/un.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday reiterated its rejection of US President Donald Trump's offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan over J&K, and said India had a long-standing national position that any issue pertaining to the Union Territory would be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally.""That stated policy has not changed. As you are aware, the outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,"" MEA said when asked about Trump's offer.Government also rejected the US president's claim that he had threatened to stop trade with India and Pakistan to get them to agree to a ""ceasefire"".Also read: 'No mention of trade in India-US talks during India-Pakistan crisis' ""From the time Op Sindoor started on May 7 till the understanding on cessation of military action on May 10, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation. The issue of trade did not come up in any of these discussions,"" MEA said.Also, with Trump claiming that he had averted a nuclear war, govt said India's military action was entirely in the conventional domain and warned other countries not to get carried away by Pakistan's nuclear bluff.While there were reports that Pakistan's National Command Authority, which is responsible for the country's nuclear arsenal, would meet on May 10, govt recalled that Islamabad had later on record denied any ""nuclear angle"". May 10 was the day India pounded 8-10 airbases in Pakistan, forcing Pakistan to seek a DGMO-level dialogue.India's armed forces have denied they hit a nuclear site at Kirana Hills, debunking reports about a radioactive leak there. PM Narendra Modi had said on Monday that India would not tolerate any nuclear blackmail by Pakistan.""India has a firm stance that it will not give in to nuclear blackmail or allow cross-border terrorism to be conducted invoking it. In conversations with various countries, we cautioned that their subscribing to such scenarios could hurt them in their own region,'' MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Amid repeated claims by Trump that he had mediated a ""ceasefire"", govt reiterated that the specific date, time and wording of the understanding was worked out between the DGMOs during their phone call at 3.35 pm on Saturday. The request for this call was received by MEA from the Pakistani high commission at 1237 hours, Jaiswal said. ""The Pakistani side had initial difficulties connecting the hotline for technical reasons. The timing was then decided based on the availability of the Indian DGMO at 1535 hours,"" he added.""Early on 10th morning, we had mounted an extremely effective attack on key Pakistan Air Force bases.

Operation Sindoor: PM Modi has kept women at centre of India's retaliation against Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-pm-modi-has-kept-women-at-centre-of-indias-retaliation-against-pakistan/articleshow/121148779.cms,"Op Sindoor: Hidden Meaning Behind Codename Will Surprise You | India ‘Punishes’ Pak

NEW DELHI: From naming ' Operation Sindoor ' to deploying women officers to present India's perspective to the world and dedicating the success of the Indian armed forces in destroying terror hubs in Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has kept women at the centre of India's retaliation against the hostile neighbour.Calling the Pahalgam terror attack a personal tragedy, PM Modi on Monday had dedicated the bravery and courage of the armed forces involved in 'Operation Sindoor' to every mother, sister and daughter of the nation.PM Modi said the barbarity displayed by terrorists in Pahalgam had shocked the entire country and the world.Stating that more than 100 dreaded terrorists were killed in the strikes by India, PM Modi said not only were the buildings of terrorist organisations destroyed, but their courage was also badly shaken. ""The terrorists had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters, and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters,"" he said.Sindoor, or vermilion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. The word derives from the Sanskrit word Sindura, referring to red, orange-red or maroon cosmetic powder worn by married Hindu women in the parting of their hair. Sources said naming the operation after vermilion was suggested by PM himself, who wanted a strong message to be sent to the terrorists about the consequences of hurting Indian women.Since the operation was launched, several parents have named their newborn baby girls 'Sindoor' in many parts of the country, with such reports emerging from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Also read: 17 newborns named ‘Sindoor’ in UP’s Kushinagar Details of the retaliatory attacks on Pakistan were given to the world by two women officers - Col Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I’ve done it; I’ve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I’m not taking any of this for granted. Don’t assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I’ll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I’m not able to do what I want to do on the field, I’ll stop playing. That’s for sure. But right now, I know that what I’m doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he’s shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit’s message is clear: he’s still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he’ll do it on his own terms.","India's white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals.

The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets. These groups reportedly deployed malware, conducted phishing attacks, and launched denial-of-service operations targeting critical sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, and public services.Zone-H, a website that tracks defacements, reported incidents involving Indian govt domains.

No, it's not their place Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: Speaking in Riyadh during his Middle East tour, US President Donald Trump once again claimed the credit for brokering what he called a “historic ceasefire” between India and Pakistan, following days of heightened military tensions earlier this month.“Just days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan, and I used trade to a large extent to do it,” Trump said, addressing a crowd.He added, “I said, fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles. Let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully.”Trump praised the leaders of both India and Pakistan, calling them “powerful, strong, smart,” and expressed hope that the ceasefire would hold. He also suggested that US diplomacy may even lead to a potential thaw between the two countries.Trump specifically thanked Senator Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance for their role in the negotiations. “Marco, stand up. What a great job you did on that,” he said.“Maybe we can even get them together a little bit, Marco, where they go out and have a nice dinner together,” he suggested.“Millions of people could have died from that conflict that started off small and was getting bigger and bigger by the day,” Trump said.Later, White House deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott echoed Trump' claims during a press briefing saying, “We welcome the ceasefire between India and Pakistan and commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif for choosing the path of peace. As President Trump said, their decision reflects strength, wisdom, and fortitude. We urge both sides to maintain direct communication to preserve regional stability.”The comments come days after India launched Operation Sindoor in response to a terror attack in Pahalgam. The government said the operation targeted terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan and degraded the country’s military capabilities.Trump's remarks came during his first stop in Saudi Arabia on a three-nation trip focused on curbing Iran’s nuclear program, ending the war in Gaza, and addressing energy security.",US President Donald Trump once again claimed the credit for brokering what he called a ‘historic ceasefire’ between India and Pakistan.

No, it compromises security. Yes, as history shows.

NEW DELHI: Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday appealed to the opposition parties to rise above political divisions and support the Narendra Modi-led government’s efforts to explore peaceful means of engagement, particularly in the wake of a recent ceasefire initiative.In a detailed post on X, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said, “The Modi government should not be politically penalised for exploring peaceful means. This is a time for bipartisan statesmanship, not division. The opposition must rise above politics and support genuine efforts for peace and stability.”Calling for a national consensus, Mufti added, “I appeal all the opposition parties to resist the urge for knee-jerk criticism or political point-scoring.

Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority handles the day-to-day operations here. It lies close to Pakistan's border with Rajasthan in India.The IAF strike created a large crater in the runway, resulting in all flight operations being made non-operational for one week.Besides Rahim Yar Khan, the IAF also decimated PAF airbases Nur Khan, Sukkur, Murid, Shahbaz, Mushaf, Rafiqui and Bholari. Its retaliatory action came after Pakistan launched missiles on Indian military installations in response to Operation Sindoor.

More than 100 terrorists were killed in the operation.The strikes were India's response to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, where Pakistan-backed terrorists shot dead 26 male tourists on April 22.","Rahim Yar Khan is a forward operating base of the PAF’s Central Command.

SRINAGAR: Everyone except “a few media anchors living far away in Mumbai and Noida” want the pause in military operations between India and Pakistan to hold, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said Tuesday while continuing his outreach to residents of forward areas affected the most by shelling and drone attacks from across the LoC.“People living along the LoC, and even those in Srinagar and Jammu who have witnessed the situation first-hand, they all want the pause to continue,” Omar told reporters after touring north Kashmir’s battered border areas.“There has been extensive damage. Houses have been affected, shops have suffered destruction, and even a seminary has not been spared. The damage assessment will be completed within two days,” he said.The CM said the refrain across villages and towns he visited over the past three days was that bunkers should be built for all civilians. “For years, bunkers weren’t constructed because the situation didn’t demand it. Our govt will soon draft a policy on this and we will discuss it with the central govt.”Omar, who visited Tangdhar, Hajinard, Nachiyan, Shamspora, Baghbela, Batpora and Tarbonim, said the administration would do whatever it takes to help the affected population rebuild what they had lost. “The affected families have shown remarkable courage in the face of adversity.

Excerpts:

We've been following you here in India, and you virtually declared that India had a clear-cut victory in the skies. Could you elaborate... why you think India had an advantage, and where did Pakistan fail?

India has so far given no confirmation on striking any nuclear storage sites. In fact, at a press conference by the defence forces, they even jokingly said they didn't know where these existed.

Do you believe the radioactivity reports that have surfaced today?

It's relatively simple in military terms ... Pakistan attempted to hit back at India with UAVs, with artillery missiles, even with ballistic missiles... this effort failed because Indian air defences shot down the mass of incoming weaponry. On the other hand we have seen early on May 10 the IAF striking not only PAF bases but also the entrance, both entrances, to the Pakistan nuclear weapons storage site at Mushaf air base... And the fact is, in the way the military understands warfare, when you start targeting enemy nuclear weapon storage sites, it means you are absolutely sure the enemy cannot hit back... And from this point of view, it's a clear-cut victory for India.There is a video clearly showing hits on entrances, on both entrances of the nuclear storage site, which means it has been geo-confirmed... of course, Pakistanis, a few I have spoken to, they have said, 'No.' But I have a strong feeling ... that India is not shooting missiles wildly around the place where their (Pakistani) nuclear weapons are stored. So, the overall conclusion is that New Delhi does not want to further escalate. And once you keep in mind, Indian generals in particular ... they are stolidly conservative ... they wouldn't let anybody randomly shoot missiles in that direction. This is a clear message. We can hit you where it hurts. The conclusion is unavoidable. Pakistan cannot protect its own nuclear weapon storage sites, cannot even protect its air bases. Therefore, India is in a position of clear advantage...I haven't studied them closely yet... But the point is this: whatever the radioactivity explains, the fact is that the nuclear storage site has been hit, not directly the storage site, but the entrance into the underground complex. It means that most likely the entrance and exit to this storage site have been cut off ... If the Pakistanis cannot enter the storage site, if they cannot reach their nuclear weapons ... it's game over.","Austrian aerial warfare analyst and military historian Tom Cooper tells Times Now’s Navika Kumar that the videos are evidence that India has struck and destroyed the entrances to nuclear sites in Pakistan.

Poll Which aspect of the Akash missile system do you find most impressive? Its cost-effectiveness and indigenous development Its ability to counter drones and missiles effectively

India's AKASH Defence System Outfoxes Pakistan, Nips Drone Attacks In The Bud | 'My Baby Worked'

NEW DELHI: It took 15 years, a thousand scientists and combined effort of several defence labs situated across the country to develop the indigenous Akash missile defence system that successfully passed its first battlefield test along the western borders with Pakistan, said a proud Prahlada Ramarao , the then project director of the totally-indigenous missile shield programme of Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ).The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9. Indian military officials have confirmed the effectiveness of India’s missile defence systems like Akash and S400 Triump when IAF DGMO Air Marshal AK Bharti on Monday asserted that India’s defence systems “stood like a wall”, preventing enemy breaches.On Akash clearing its first ‘agni-pariksha’ and boosting India’s ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence production, Ramarao, a Padma Shri recipient, told TOI, “My eyes welled up when my baby worked so well. It is the happiest day of my life. This is bigger than my Padma award.”Ramarao was handpicked by India’s ‘Missile Man’ Dr APJ Abdul Kalam as the youngest project director at the age of 35 to head the Akash programme in early 1990s. Kalam was then head of DRDO’s defence laboratory Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) in Hyderabad, before he became scientific adviser to the defence minister and subsequently the President of India. “A leader brings team spirit and inspires all to work towards a common goal. Kalam was a true leader in that sense. The country now requires 10 Abdul Kalams to grow and develop in various fields like the way the aerospace and defence sectors grew under him,” he said.Though Akash had undergone numerous test trials and later user trials by the Army and IAF, this was the first time the missile defence witnessed a real battlefield condition when Pakistan attacked India with missiles and drones. Both Indian Army and IAF have strategically deployed this missile system alongside the western border as Akash has the capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles and even drones. The real time multi-sensor data processing and threat evaluation enables simultaneous engagement of multiple targets from any direction.“We started work on this project in 1994 with an initial budget of Rs 300 crore. When you invent something, you fail several times. We also failed. But we learnt from our mistakes. Developing Rajendra, a complex multi-function electronically scanned phased array radar, was the biggest challenge. But we overcame that challenge after several hits and trials. Later, the project budget was raised to Rs 500 crore,” Ramarao said.“I guarantee you, nowhere in the world a missile defence system could have been invented in just Rs 500 crore. Our Akash is the cheapest but most effective missile shield. It can detect a hostile missile from a distance of 70km and kill it at a 30km range,” the DRDO veteran, now 78 years old, said.After its development in 2009, Akash has since undergone continuous evolution, resulting in the development of several variants, each with enhanced capabilities tailored to address specific operational requirements. These variants include initial Mark-I, upgraded Akash-1S with an indigenous seeker, high-accuracy Akash Prime designed for high-altitude and low-temperature operations, and advanced next-generation Akash-NG, which boasts significantly extended range and sophisticated features.As per an estimate, IAF has inducted a substantial number of Akash systems, with reports indicating the induction of 15 squadrons. Army operates four regiments of Aakash, with plans for further acquisitions to augment its air defence capabilities.Impressed with its efficient working, Armenia became the first country to ink a deal with India in 2022 to procure 15 Akash missile systems worth around Rs 6,000 crore. Last year, India had dispatched the first batch of the missile systems to the central Asian country to protect its borders.",The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9.

NEW DELHI: A litigant managed to get a favourable order from Supreme Court after he propped up a ""ghost"" opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for SC for quashing orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant in the matter.Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC. It also came to light that the lawyer who allegedly represented the fake party does not practice law any more and he was even not aware of the case.Facing the tricky situation of who had appeared before the court on that day and who had placed the 'settlement agreement' that led to passing of the order, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi directed its registry to hold an inquiry and file a report within three weeks. Making it clear that the court cannot be taken for a ride, the bench said that it would order lodging of an FIR, if needed.SC had in Dec passed the order after the 'compromise agreement' was placed before it and the order sheet of that day mentioned the names of four advocates who had appeared for the alleged fake respondent, including advocate-on-record (AOR) J M Khanna and his daughter Shefali Khanna. In this case, a caveat was filed by the fake respondent due to which notice was not issued by the court which would have been served on the real respondent and he would have come to know about the pending case.The real respondent, who is based in Muzaffarpur in Bihar, came to know about the SC's verdict when his son-in-law stumbled upon it on the SC website and he rushed to the apex court. Advocates Gyanant Singh and Abhisek Rai, appearing for him, told the bench that the order was obtained by means of fraud, deception and calculated suppression of truth and it should be recalled forthwith.During the hearing, a lawyer appearing for AOR Khanna told the court that he is now 80-years-old and he had not been practising law for the last few years and expressed surprise how his name cropped up in the case. His daughter also told the bench that she also did not appear in the case on that day.""The petitioner has not only acted in violation of legal and ethical norms but has also committed a fraud upon this court, which, if not rectified, will embolden such mala fide litigants to continue their deceitful practices,"" the respondent said.

Gender integration in defence services calibrated to operational needs: Government

NEW DELHI: The Centre has told Supreme Court that men and women are recruited to the Judge Advocate General (JAG or legal) department in the Army through separate service selection boards (SSBs) because women officers are not readied for combat roles, while the men get mandatorily attached to artillery units as part of induction.A woman had challenged separate SSBs and merit lists for male and female officers recruited to the department. The apex court had reserved its verdict on the plea and asked the Centre to file its submissions.Govt said operational readiness determines vacancies in Army, and as a policy, women officers aren't meant for frontline combat deployment where contact with enemies is likely. They aren't deployed for counter-insurgency or counter-terror forces, such as Rashtriya Rifles & Assam Rifles, it cited.Countering the petitioner's argument before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan that JAG officers do not have combat roles, the Centre said not only do the male officers get attached to artillery units but are also expected to discharge the role of combatants in case of armed conflicts. It cited their deployment in Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka and Kargil operations.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said on behalf of the Centre, ""Due to the prevailing operational scenario, Indian Army has a standing operational deployment unlike modern western armies. India is surrounded by states inimical to our interests along the immediate neighbourhood. This implies that our Army is mandated to maintain operational readiness to undertake conventional operations along northern and Western borders.""Without referring to Operation Sindoor , govt said, ""No one can predict when the next conflict arises, in which or both borders, at what force level, and whether as a full-scale war or limited operations. Depending on the operational need and force strength, combatant personnel deployed in peacetime duties get mobilised irrespective of their arm/service to boost the operational necessities of the regular Army.""Arguing against judicial interference based on gender parity without considering its impact on operational readiness of armed forces , the Centre said, ""Gender integration in the defence services is an evolving process and is calibrated to the operational needs and is subjected to periodic review and studies.

Operation Sindoor: Indian air defence renders Turkish drones ineffective,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-indian-air-defence-renders-turkish-drones-ineffective/articleshow/121147836.cms,"Indian air defence renders Turkish drones ineffective

NEW DELHI: Turkish drones , extensively used by the Pakistani army during the recent limited conflict with India, came into prominence for the first time when Ukraine used them to destroy Russian defence assets in the initial phases of Russia-Ukraine war.However, these drones, which can stay airborne for up to 27 hours, as claimed by their manufacturer, failed to penetrate targets when Russia bolstered its air defence. Ukraine, as per reports, has since been using them for reconnaissance and repositioning its artillery. India may have learnt a lesson from the Ukraine war, it seems, as it destroyed Turkish drones as well as China's missiles midair, thus denying the advantage that Pakistan had hoped to gain by unleashing them in swarms in retaliation against Operation Sindoor True, the drones supplied to Pakistan by Turkiye - which under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been nursing the dream of becoming the new leader of the Muslim world - were not of the same calibre as the ones it had sold Ukraine but it was pointed out that they were taken out mostly by cheaper 'Made-in India' drones - a blow to Erdogan's aspiration to emerge as the new Caliph.No wonder Turkiye deputed a junior representative for India's defence ministry briefing on Operation Sindoor - a move seen as frustration over its drones' failure.The Indian armed forces also have sophisticated and deadly Israeli Harop drones, also known as ""loitering munition"", which identifies a target and crashes into it with loaded explosives. These have proved to be a potent weapon in India's arsenal, with some of them believed to have destroyed Pakistan's air-defence systems and key military sites during May 7-10 conflict.","Turkish drones came into prominence for the first time when Ukraine used them to destroy Russian defence assets in the initial phases of Russia-Ukraine war.

JAIPUR: As border tensions rippled into wildlife zones, conservationists raced to shield newborn Great Indian Bustard babies from warzone - and keep fragile recovery efforts alive. Nine chicks were relocated from a key conservation site in Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district following drone incursions and artillery fire from Pakistan.Sensitive to loud sounds and shockwaves, bustards are particularly vulnerable during early stages of life.Ramdevra Conservation Centre, located just a few km from Indo-Pak border, hosts the country's sole bustard recovery programme. Following shelling on May 10, scientists and forest officials moved nine of the 18 chicks born this year to a safer facility in Arwar village of Ajmer district - nearly 500km east. ""The chicks, aged between five and 28 days, were transported in soft-suspension vehicles fitted with padded compartments and sand bedding to reduce stress during the 10-hour journey,"" said Sutirtha Dutta, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Several of the chicks were hatched through artificial incubation - an effort to revive one of India's most endangered bird species, with fewer than 130 believed to remain in the wild.""The relocation was carried out successfully.

NEW DELHI: When Justice Sanjiv Khanna became the CJI in November last year, many thought it was poetic justice 50 years after his uncle Justice H R Khanna , through a historic political blunder in 1977, was denied the top post for his courageous dissent in support of fundamental rights during the Emergency even though four of his cowering colleagues caved in to govt's brute power.Justice Khanna's tenure as the CJI was short but eventful and challenging. What brought forth his steely resolve to serve transparency and call a spade a spade was the discovery of a huge amount of cash at Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma's residence. He uploaded videos and the Delhi HC CJ's reports on the incident on the SC website, leaving little to the imagination and winning kudos from the public for meeting challenges head on.On his last working day in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, CJI Khanna said, "" Public trust in judiciary cannot be commanded. It has to be earned."" With CJI-designate B R Gavai as his colleague on the ceremonial bench, Justice Khanna said, ""The country is getting an excellent CJI who is going to uphold fundamental rights, rule of law and the basic doctrines of the Constitution."" He attributed his upbringing and values to his grandfather Sarav Dayal, who was an advocate and an ardent believer in interaction of children with elders.In an informal meeting with SC reporters, CJI Khanna said he won't accept any post-retirement job but he would not give up law and do something related to law.CJI Khanna is a man who walked alone, without security, both in the judicial arena and Lodhi Garden. He inherited the legacy of fearlessness and fairness from his uncle, Justice H R Khanna who was denied the CJI's post because he stood by fundamental rights during Emergency. But justice was probably served when Justice Sanjiv Khanna became the 51st CJI, nearly 50 years after that historical blunder. However, he shunned both the legacy and publicity.Justice Gavai said, ""For a judge, there is no greater privilege than to preside over a bench and decide cases without fear and favour."" CJI Khanna's basics are deeply entrenched in the ideals of justice. He inherited the great H R Khanna's legacy but emerged from the shadow and painted his own legacy through sheer diligence and hard work. His judgments strengthened constitutional principles and ethos - of liberty and rule of law.Another bench partner for the last 10 months, Justice Sanjay Kumar said CJI Khanna never had a summary of the case before him yet remembered page numbers, paragraphs and the content line by line. Asked about this, CJI Khanna had told TOI, ""It is an acquired trait. After becoming a judge, somehow I started remembering the content of the case files line by line.""Law officers - attorney general R Venkataramani, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitors general S V Raju and Aishwarya Bhat - who mostly faced the brunt of intense questioning from CJI Khanna, were the most eloquent in praising his judicial acumen, integrity and courage. ""Clarity, sense of justice, something to always learn, crisp judgments that were not thesis, a man who honoured the chair and increased its dignity,"" were some of the accolades that came his way.","CJI Khanna is a man who walked alone, without security, both in the judicial arena and Lodhi Garden.

AGRA: Citing lack of evidence and witnesses turning hostile, a court in Muzaffarnagar acquitted 11 accused in a case of looting and arson during the 2013 riots that left 62 dead and over 50,000 homeless.These 11 people, all residents of Lisarh village in Shamli, were charged with looting and setting fire to the house of one Kamruddin, who fled with his family and later took shelter in a refugee camp, said defence lawyer Yogendra Singh.In his police complaint on Sept 9, 2013, Kamruddin alleged: ""On Sept 8, 2013, a group of people entered my house and looted gold jewellery and Rs 1.8 lakh in cash, and set my house on fire. My family and I somehow managed to escape and took refuge at a relative's house in Shamli.""After Kamruddin filed the complaint at Phugana police station, the SIT filed a chargesheet under multiple sections, including IPC section 436 (mischief by fire with intent to destroy a house) against 11 people.District govt counsel Rajeev Sharma said on Tuesday, ""The court order was passed recently. We will study the order and then decide our course of action.""Several riot-related cases have since resulted in acquittals for lack of evidence and witnesses turning hostile.

Our brave forces have successfully defended the nation and the country’s integrity.”ISPR said Pakistan army had launched ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’, which was part of ‘Marka-e-Haq (battle of truth)’ that began after the Indian strikes inside Pakistan. PM Sharif expressed condolences to the families of those killed in ‘Marka-e-Haq’.Meanwhile, a day after PM Narendra Modi made it clear that Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) cannot be delinked from action against terrorists by clearly emphasising that “water and blood cannot flow together”, Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Tuesday the pause in hostilities between the two countries could be threatened “if the water issue is not resolved”.The Foreign Office reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to stand by the arrangement over pause in hostilities, saying it was ""taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability"". The FO also said that Pakistan will take all necessary measures to preserve its rights under IWT.","11 soldiers and 40 civilians were killed and 199 others including army and air force personnel injured in last week's Indian strikes.

JAMMU: In the past six-seven years, over 2,000 family bunkers were built for residents of border areas in J&K, the utility of which was realised during the recent Operation Sindoor , said union minister Dr Jitendra Singh during a day-long visit to areas along the international border on Tuesday. He also announced that an additional 600 bunkers would be constructed and an automated, centralised siren system will be set up in border areas.Dr Singh said Kathua was the first district in the country to experiment with family bunkers in border areas when he, as an MP, had taken up the issue soon after Narendra Modi took over as prime minister. Thereafter, more than 2,000 such bunkers came up in the border areas.Following the public demand for more bunkers, Dr Singh said he consulted the administration and immediately issued directions for the construction of 600 additional family bunkers and more later, if needed.In response to citizens’ complaints that the siren was not audible enough, Dr Singh said he directed the use of modern technology instead of manually operated sirens. “An automated, centralised siren system would be installed, which will be controlled from the district headquarters. It will start operating spontaneously, and the siren will be sounded through speakers set up at each border village,” he said.After Operation Sindoor was launched, Kathua district was provided with 39 medical ambulances for the convenience of border dwellers, while two more critical care ambulances were made available at GMC Kathua.During his visit, Dr Singh held a series of meetings with officials of the district administration, led by deputy commissioner Rakesh Minhas, and attended by public representatives including MLAs and DDC members. The minister subsequently met residents of border villages before heading to Jammu GMCH to inquire about the patients injured in Pakistani shelling.","In the past six-seven years, over 2,000 family bunkers were built for residents of border areas in J&K.

He used such cheap words for our daughters, Mohan Yadavji should clarify if his entire cabinet and BJP agree with Shah’s remarks, and if not, Vijay Shah should be immediately removed from the post.”“I will write to the Prime Minister, the defence minister, BJP national and state president, and MP CM to clarify their stand on Shah’s remarks,” he said.Apart from Congress leaders of Madhya Pradesh, Rajya Sabha MP Imran Pratapgarhi took to X (Twitter) to slam the minister over his remarks. The MP wrote, “The person who made this absurd and communal statement is not an ordinary man but a minister of the MP govt. He thinks that (the Indian Army official) is the sister of the terrorists, who killed innocent people in Pahalgam.This person has insulted the country's army. The Prime Minister is requested to immediately remove this person from the post of minister, and BJP chief JP Nadda should clarify whether this person's statement is the statement of Bharatiya Janata Party?” As he came under attack, Shah told a news channel that his statements were ‘misinterpreted’.“The Prime Minister has responded to those who left our sisters widowed in their own language. Do not view my speech in a different context. Some people are misinterpreting it. They are our sisters, and they have worked with the army with full strength,” he said. In his apology Shah claimed that he and his family were ‘distressed’ by the Pahalgam attack.“My family has a military background, and several members have been martyred, including during Kargil war. While making a speech with such a saddened heart, if some objectionable sentences were uttered by me, I am ready to apologise 10 times,” he said.","Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah made an indecent remark against Col Sofiya Quereshi, who has become the face of armed forces briefing the nation about operation Sindoor.

Kolkata Airport Bomb Threat: Passenger Arrested After Alarming Comment Delays Flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/passenger-arrested-at-kolkata-airport-after-bomb-remark-delays-flight/articleshow/121141889.cms,"



KOLKATA: A 26-year-old air passenger from Imphal was arrested at Kolkata airport on Monday afternoon for allegedly uttering the word ""bomb"" while preparing to board a Mumbai-bound IndiGo flight. The incident triggered a full-scale security alert and delayed flight operations.The flyer, Regal Chongtham, reportedly told an IndiGo security officer at the step ladder point in Hindi, ""Mere paas bomb hai?"" (Do I have a bomb?), moments before boarding IndiGo flight 6E 5227, scheduled to depart for Mumbai at 1.30 pm from Bay 57L.According to officials, Chongtham grew frustrated while interacting with airline staff during the secondary ladder point checking and multiple checks of passengers' baggage as part of enhanced security measures because of the current tension between India and Pakistan.In an apparent act of sarcasm, he remarked, ""Mere paas bomb hai"" to an airline employee. Security personnel, adhering to strict airport safety protocols, immediately apprehended him and initiated emergency procedures.Upon receiving the alert, the Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) was activated and classified the situation as ""specific"", leading to the aircraft being moved to an isolation bay in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP).The airport's Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) and a sniffer dog unit promptly arrived at the scene to inspect Chongtham's belongings.Security protocols were quickly enforced, and all boarding operations were suspended. At the time of the incident, 179 of 186 passengers had already boarded. The remaining passengers and crew were de-boarded, and the aircraft underwent a thorough inspection.Following a thorough examination using explosive vapour detectors (EVDs), authorities declared his luggage safe, and no threats were found. Despite this, security measures were intensified, and relevant agencies were informed.Chongtham, who earlier arrived in Kolkata from Imphal on flight 6E 6716, was taken into custody for questioning. He is a resident of Sega Road Jonjeng Hajailukai in Imphal and was staying at a hostel in Mumbai.Cops said they were probing the motive behind the statement. Preliminary reports suggest the possibility of a prank or poor judgment on the part of the flyer, though officials have not ruled out other possibilities.Flight operations resumed after security agencies cleared the aircraft. No explosive materials were found.Authorities have reiterated the importance of adhering to strict security protocols at airports . They emphasised that making bomb-related remarks, even in jest, can lead to serious legal consequences, including detention or arrest.""We always urge passengers to remain cautious and cooperative during security checks to ensure the safety and smooth functioning of airport operations,"" said a senior airport official.","Regal Chongtham, 26, reportedly told an IndiGo security officer at the step ladder point in Hindi, ""Mere paas bomb hai?""

Wayne Gretzky and the Donald Trump controversy: A Canadian icon’s moment of reckoning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-and-the-donald-trump-controversy-a-canadian-icons-moment-of-reckoning/articleshow/121139719.cms,"Wayne Gretzky's public support for Donald Trump ignited a fierce debate in Canada (Getty Images)

Canada's hockey icon meets a political reckoning

Back in early 2025, Canada found itself in an identity crisis — and at the center of it was none other than Wayne Gretzky . Long celebrated as the embodiment of Canadian humility and excellence, Gretzky became an unlikely flashpoint in a political and cultural storm that tested national sentiment like never before.The incident unfolded in the shadow of tense U.S.-Canada relations, with new American tariffs, political jabs from President Donald Trump, and a rising wave of Canadian nationalism . For years, Gretzky had lived quietly in the U.S., his image largely untarnished despite the distance. But a string of high-profile appearances alongside Trump — including his attendance at an election-night celebration and the 2025 inauguration — changed that.A photo of Gretzky wearing a white-and-gold MAGA hat went viral, and suddenly, the question wasn't about goals or assists — it was about loyalty.This was no minor controversy. “You were a great Canadian, but now you are not,” Edmonton Sports Talk’s Matthew Iwanyk famously said at the time — a quote that captured the frustration of many Canadians. In Edmonton, where Gretzky led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups, fans were openly questioning the man immortalized in bronze outside Rogers Place. Some, like Oilers fan Rob Munro, simply wished he’d “be a little more Canadian.”Gretzky’s neutral stance during the NHL ’s “4 Nations Face-Off” didn’t help. While his American counterpart wore a jersey, Gretzky appeared in a suit, giving a thumbs-up to the U.S. bench. It was the kind of symbolism that stuck — and stung.The disappointment wasn’t about party lines; it was about a sense of national pride. “It’s not that we expect more of him,” said Edmonton resident Grant Prete, who started a petition to rename Wayne Gretzky Drive. “It’s that it stings more.”Some, like Ontario Premier Doug Ford, came to his defense. “He is a patriot. He loves Canada,” Ford insisted. But in the eyes of many, Gretzky’s silence amid the controversy was deafening.Also Read: “Pretend you don’t know me”: Wayne Gretzky caught in crossfire as Donald Trump friendship sparks Canadian backlash Looking back, 2025 was the year Canadians asked themselves a hard question: What do we do when our greatest hero no longer reflects the values we hold dear?","Wayne Gretzky's public support for Donald Trump ignited a fierce debate in Canada.

What’s Next for Golden State?

Theface an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run. Stephen Curry is nearing the end of his of his illustrious career and so is Draymond Green. Even though they acquired Jimmy Butler earlier this year, their path to the Western Conference could look bleak given the injuries that these players succumb to. Could a blockbuster move for a Lakers superstar change their fortunes next season?(Disclaimer: The data and analysis in this post are based on conjecture as of right now.Although the information is based on reliable sources, it's crucial to remember that these are not official declarations or verified actions. It is advised that readers use caution when interpreting this analysis and wait for official updates as the offseason progresses.) Sports Illustrated’s Alex Kirschenbaum recently suggested that the Golden State Warriors might pursue Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James this offseason. James, a four-time NBA champion, could provide Golden State with much-needed frontcourt size and experience.Kirschenbaum noted: ""(LeBron) James has long been linked to Golden State, in part because his rivalry against Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (they've played each other in five playoff series, during which James has gone 2-3) eventually blossomed into a bromance.""However, age and injury concerns loom large. A potential lineup featuring James (39), Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (35), and Draymond Green (34) would raise questions about durability.According to Caleb Hightower of the Sporting News 1. Championship Pedigree: James brings unmatched playoff experience and leadership.2. Fit with Curry: Their contrasting skill sets could create an unstoppable offensive duo.3. Lakers’ Struggles: With L.A. failing to advance past the first round, James may seek a new challenge.- Injury Risks: James, Curry, and Butler all dealt with significant injuries this postseason.- Contract Hurdles: James holds a $52.6 million player option, complicating any trade or signing.- Lakers’ Plans: His commitment to playing alongside Luka Dončić could keep him in Los Angeles.If the Warriors exit the playoffs early and seek a roster shakeup, James could emerge as a high-risk, high-reward target. While his arrival would electrify the Bay Area, logistical and financial challenges make this move far from guaranteed.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies star to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic For now, fans can only speculate—but the idea of LeBron in a Warriors jersey remains a fascinating possibility.","The Golden State Warriors face an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run.

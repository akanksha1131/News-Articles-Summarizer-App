"Bihar elections: Smallest member of opposition bloc, but with victory under its belt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-smallest-member-of-opposition-bloc-but-with-victory-under-its-belt/articleshow/125374479.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: The smallest member of Mahagathbandhan in Bihar has made its presence felt in an otherwise trainwreck of an election for the opposition. In a state crowded with sub-regional satraps who are identified with their castes, I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.Gupta (55) won from Saharsa by defeating his BJP rival by over 2,000 votes, marking a successful electoral debut for his party which had contested three seats as an MGB constituent.It was an outcome that eluded better-known parties helmed by much bigger names. Jan Suraaj Party of Prashant Kishor and Vikashsheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, the latter an RJD ally like Gupta, are two such examples. While Kishor fielded candidates in over 235 seats, VIP contested 12. Both parties drew a blank.Gupta quit Congress in 2023 to champion the cause of Tanti-Tatwa, which falls under Extremely Backward Classes and is estimated to be 1-2% of the population, and pushed for a separate quota for them along with members of the Paan community. He blamed the state's NDA govt for the Supreme Court verdict that had overturned the move to grant SC quota to Tanti-Tatwa (historically weavers) and put the community back in the EBC category.He showed a knack for mobilisation by organising a successful rally in Patna's huge Gandhi Maidan in April, coming to the notice of parties of all hues in the election year. He said he was contacted by formations from across the political spectrum, from NDA to AIMIM and MGB, before he reached a deal with the opposition alliance. He held meetings with Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav and accused NDA of trying to sabotage his politics while holding talks with him.An engineer who ran a business before plunging into politics, Gupta's stock is likely to rise in a state where mobilisation along caste lines is central to political shifts.","I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.

‘Full Stop to Many Questions’ Chirag Paswan Hails PM Modi, Nitish as NDA Soars Past 200 Seats

NEW DELHI: RJD leader Rohini Acharya’s announcement that she is quitting politics, along with emotional allegations of humiliation and abuse by her own family, drew sympathy from Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, who referenced his own experiences with personal crises while responding to the matter.On Saturday, Rohini declared that she was separating from both her family and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). A day later, she escalated her allegations, accusing her brother Tejashwi Yadav of humiliating and abusing her, claiming that the situation deteriorated to the point where “a slipper was raised to hit her.”In a post on X, she wrote, ""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, abuses were hurled, shoes were raised to kill her... I didn't compromise on my self-respect, didn't give up on truth... just because of this, I had to face insults. Yesterday, a daughter left her crying parents and siblings due to helplessness... she was forced to leave her parental home... she was made an orphan... I pray that none of you ever have to walk my path, and no house should have a daughter-sister like Rohini. ""Speaking to reporters Sunday, Chirag Paswan said, ""I will not make any comments on this because I can understand the mental status when a family goes through such a difficult situation.I have also been through this.”Paswan added that political differences have never affected his personal warmth toward Lalu Prasad Yadav’s children.""We might have had political differences but I have always considered Lalu ji's family my own. Be it Tejashwi, Tej, Misa or Rohini, I have considered them my siblings,"" he said, as quoted by ANI.""I pray that this family dispute is resolved at the earliest. If there is unity in the family, a person can fight tough situations outside. The family must be going through a tough situation,"" he added.Rohini’s public fallout comes on the heels of the RJD’s dramatic electoral collapse, with the Tejashwi-led party winning just 25 of 143 seats- a loss of more than 100 seats.Her brother Tej Pratap Yadav, who himself was expelled from both the Yadav family and the RJD a few months earlier, also reacted to the developments, warning those he called “traitors” and issuing an emotional appeal to his father, Lalu Prasad Yadav.",Rohini Acharya announced that she is leaving the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

"Bihar elections: With NDA sweep, number of M-Y MLAs in Bihar hits a low",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-with-nda-sweep-number-of-m-y-mlas-in-bihar-hits-a-low/articleshow/125374331.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: In an election marked by determined consolidation of votes against the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (MGB), the social composition of the newly elected MLAs too has changed strikingly with the share of Muslims and Yadavs hitting a low. What is just as striking : NDA now boasts more Yadav MLAs than the MGB.The decline in the M-Y block has seen a corresponding rise in MLAs belonging to other voting blocs - from non-Yadav OBCs to Extremely Backward Classes and upper castes - which is evidence of RJD's abysmal failure to expand its support base meaningfully beyond its traditional Muslim-Yadav base.Muslims at 17.7% and Yadavs at 14.3% make up the two biggest voting groups, but they have not been able to harness their numbers due to a larger counter-consolidation of other communities since 2005 when Nitish Kumar-led NDA to its first assembly poll win. The 2015 poll when Nitish had aligned with MGB was an exception.Muslim representation in the 243-member assembly is the lowest now, with only 11 as against 19 in 2020. The number of Yadav MLAs has shrunk by almost half to 28 from 55. The number of MLAs from the most populous caste is the lowest in the post-Mandal era, which saw the community fuelling Lalu Prasad's rise, with RJD governing Bihar from 1990 to 2005.What is equally telling is that it is not RJD but the Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM that now has the most Muslim MLAs (5).RJD has 3, Congress 2, and JDU 1, with the last being the lone Muslim representative from NDA.Muslims' preference for AIMIM, at least in seats where their numbers are decisive, convey their growing impatience with ""secular"" formations which, the community complains, bank on their solid support but fight shy of airing their issues or giving them proportionate representation fearing Hindu consolidation.Some opposition netas are of the view that Muslims began rallying behind AIMIM, especially in Seemanchal, after MGB named Mukesh Sahani, whose caste accounts for just around 2.6% of the population, as its deputy CM candidate. That RJD had given tickets to only 18 Muslims as against 51 Yadavs also irked Muslims, especially the young population, and a section of them broke ranks to back Owaisi.In NDA, JDU had given tickets to 4 Muslims and LJP(RV) to 1, but only one of them, Zama Khan, a minister in the outgoing govt, could win.As Yadavs appeared to consolidate behind MGB, NDA gave them fewer seats. JDU, which has traditionally fielded a decent number of Muslim candidates, also cut down from eight in 2020 to four due to a perceived lack of support over its alliance with BJP. However, the overwhelming victory of NDA has led to the unusual scenario of its having more Yadav lawmakers (15) in the assembly than MGB (12). Incidentally, the lone BSP MLA is also a Yadav.Though Muslim-Yadav representation corresponds with the fortunes of MGB, the polarisation and counter-polarisation witnessed in this election as the NDA campaign foregrounded the misrule associated with the 'jungle raaj' of RJD, has especially hit the two communities.","Muslims at 17.7% and Yadavs at 14.3% make up the two biggest voting groups. Muslim representation in the 243-member assembly is the lowest now, with only 11 as against 19 in 2020.

Rudra may change how Army operates: Upgrade likely from ‘Cold Start’ to ‘Cold Strike’ doctrine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rudra-may-change-how-army-operates/articleshow/125374266.cms,"CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: With the successful testing of a newly-raised integrated 'Rudra' all-arms brigade in the major tri-Service Trishul exercise on the western front with Pakistan, the Army may now well upgrade its ‘Cold Start’ doctrine to 'Cold Strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.This doctrinal evolution has gained ground after Southern Army Command chief Lt-General Dhiraj Seth said performance of the Rudra brigade under the 12 `Konark’ Corps, with integration of all fighting arms backed by combat support and logistics, was “fully validated operationally” during the `Akhand Prahar’ drills in the desert sector under the just-concluded Trishul exercise.“Now, with the Rudra brigade, the time has come to change the Cold Start doctrine into the Cold Strike one. I am fully satisfied that the Rudra brigades in the coming times will be successful in multi-domain operations and executing their task effectively against the enemy,” Lt-Gen Seth said.The Army had formulated its “pro-active conventional war strategy”, colloquially called the Cold Start doctrine, after its “strike formations” under Operation Parakram took almost a month to mobilise at the border launch pads against Pakistan in wake of the terror attack on Parliament in Dec 2001.By that time, Pakistan had shored up its defences, and the US also had jumped in to pressurize India against launching any cross-border attack. Having learnt a harsh operational lesson, the Army since then has been refining its strategy for faster mobilisation for multiple but limited offensives into enemy territory under the nuclear overhang.Pakistan, which does not have a “no first-use” nuclear policy like India, in turn, took to brandishing its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other nuclear-capable missiles as an effective counter to the Cold Start conventional military strategy.Now, the 11.5-lakh strong Army is converting a few of its over 250 single-arm brigades (each has over 3,000 troops) into Rudra all-arms brigades, with integration of infantry, mechanized infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, air defence, engineers, signals and drone units, along with logistics and combat-support elements.In effect, a Rudra brigade brings together all fighting arms and support units into a self-contained group even during peacetime to ensure much better cohesion and faster mobilization for combined arms operations.Two Rudra brigades have already come up on the northern borders with China, one in eastern Ladakh and the other in Sikkim. “Each Rudra brigade will be tailor-made as per its earmarked area of operation, the type of terrain there and the operational task to be executed. The brigades will have units that can be attached or detached as per the requirements,” an officer said.As for the `Akhand Prahar’ drills, the “full-spectrum combat readiness” of the Konark Corps was validated through integrated employment of all arms and services from mechanised and infantry manoeuvres to the execution of land operations by the Rudra Brigade called ‘Black Mace’, special heliborne operations, and coordinated attack helicopter missions. “It also witnessed seamless synergy between the Army and IAF, with fighter ground attack missions in close support of the land forces,” another officer said.","The Army may now well upgrade its 'Cold Start' doctrine to 'Cold Strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.

PATNA: In a moment that highlights both continuity and political longevity, JD(U) president Nitish Kumar will take oath as Bihar chief minister for the 10th time on Thursday, Nov 20, a senior party leader told TOI on Sunday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new NDA govt. At least one deputy CM is also likely to be appointed.“The swearing-in ceremony will be organised at the sprawling Gandhi Maidan. Many top NDA leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, other central ministers Rajnath Singh, Dharmendra Pradhan, Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, and the chief ministers of other NDA-ruled states, will attend the grand event,” a senior BJP leader said.State administration officials on Sunday began preparations to turn the Gandhi Maidan event into a major public spectacle.“The Gandhi Maidan will remain closed to the general public from Nov 17 to 20. There will be a complete ban on the entry of common people into the Gandhi Maidan during this period,” the Patna district administration said in a notice issued on Sunday.“The Maidan has been closed for four days to make preparations for the upcoming swearing-in ceremony of the new govt,” a senior official said.Sources said the formula for distributing cabinet berths among allies has been finalised. Along with JD(U) and BJP, the smaller allies – Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV), Manjhi-led HAM-S and Upendra Kushwaha-led RLM – will also join the govt.“The LJP (RV) is likely to get three berths in the new state cabinet while the HAM-S and RLM one berth each. A maximum of 16 ministers from the BJP and 14 ministers and the chief minister from JD(U) will take oath on Thursday,” a senior BJP leader said.According to a notification issued by the cabinet secretariat department on Sunday, the last cabinet meeting of the outgoing govt will be held at 11.30am on Monday.“The cabinet meeting, to be chaired by Nitish, would pass a resolution to make a recommendation to the governor for dissolving the current assembly. From the cabinet meeting, the CM and other senior ministers of the outgoing govt would drive to the Raj Bhavan, where Nitish would submit his resignation and urge the governor to dissolve the assembly,” sources in the NDA said.After submitting his resignation, Nitish will attend a meeting of the newly-elected JD(U) legislators, where he will be formally elected leader of the JD(U) legislators’ party.A senior BJP leader said the saffron party has called a meeting of its newly elected legislators in Patna on Tues. This will be followed by a combined meeting of the NDA legislators’ party. Nitish will then be formally elected as leader of the NDA legislators’ party in the presence of senior BJP leaders. After that, Nitish, accompanied by leaders of all five NDA allies, will go to the Raj Bhawan to stake claim to form the new govt, a senior BJP leader said.The state’s chief electoral officer, Vinod Singh Gunjiyal, on Sunday handed over the list of 243 newly elected members of the state assembly to governor Arif Mohammed Khan at the Raj Bhavan, marking the completion of the electoral process. Later in the evening, the Election Commission lifted the model code of conduct from across the state.Earlier in the day, activity continued at Nitish’s official residence for the second consecutive day. Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai, outgoing deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha and former Union minister and RLM president Upendra Kushwaha met Nitish and discussed issues related to govt formation.Kushwaha’s wife Snehlata, who won from the Sasaram seat, is likely to get a berth in the new cabinet.

LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Investigators are racing to close the arc of a Jaish-e-Mohammed project they said was years in the making - one that turned a campus doctor into ""Madam Surgeon"" of a cross-border terrorist blueprint.The alleged architect linking these threads is 43-year-old Dr Shaheen Shahid - ""Madam Surgeon"" in the underground lexicon of the JeM module of medics accused of the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast and preparing coordinated terrorist strikes on six cities, investigators said.Investigators described Shaheen, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset. Seized digital evidence, handwritten diaries and planning notes - now central to the case - describe a plan for a Dec 6 strike aimed at ""avenging"" the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition The papers outline ""D-6 Mission"", target lists, recruitment pitches, fund movements and secure communication protocols. Investigators also identified roles assigned to Kashmiri doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Umar Un Nabi, alongside Shaheen, who allegedly joined a deeper JeM-backed structure in 2021.The probe has allegedly uncovered an Rs 20-lakh hawala channel routed through a JeM handler for operational use by Umar, Muzammil and Shaheen - money suspected to have funded recruitment, safe houses, secure phones and reconnaissance.Agencies have begun an audit of Shaheen's financial footprint, scrutinising every high-value transfer, cash withdrawal and unexplained deposit across her three Kanpur accounts, two Lucknow accounts and two Delhi accounts. The hunt: any tie to the foreign-funded module.Teams are also reconstructing Shaheen's movements in Kanpur, especially at GSVM Medical College, where she worked until her unexplained disappearance. Officials are collecting entry logs, duty rosters, visitor lists and details of where she stayed between Jan and Oct 2025. Colleagues remembered a soft-spoken doctor from Lucknow who rarely took leave, brought her young child to duty because there was ""no one at home"", and avoided speaking about her divorce. She lived in an L-Block campus residence, maintained cordial ties with women co-workers, and vanished in Dec 2013 after handing over HOD responsibilities, promising to return by Jan 4, 2014. She never did. For nearly a year, official letters went unanswered. In 2016, two staffers sent to her registered address found it incorrect. She was formally dismissed in 2021.Interrogations showed that in March 2022, the module travelled to Turkiye for a meeting with ISI handler Abu Ukasha, allegedly securing a ""green signal"" for the Dec 6 plan. The timeline under reconstruction spans 2010 ideological drift, 2015-16 induction into JeM circles, and structured planning from 2021 as part of a project backed by Pakistan-based handlers.A former GSVM staffer recalled her transformation beginning around 2010 after contact with an Indian-origin doctor abroad who shared ideological videos and literature. She soon adopted new attire, including a hijab, and repeatedly spoke of relocating overseas.According to officials, her ideological shift was unmistakable by 2021. When confronted by a relative about abandoning her marriage, job and family, she allegedly said: ""I have lived enough for myself. Now, it's time to repay the debt of my community.""","Investigators describe Dr Shaheen Shahid, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset.

Rohini Acharya's Controversial Claims Ignite Family and Political Tensions in Lalu Yadav's Dynasty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rohini-acharya-row-lalu-yadavs-sprawling-family-tree-7-daughters-2-sons-and-political-fault-lines/articleshow/125374377.cms,"Inside the Political Dynasty of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi

1. At the top of the sibling line-up is Misa Bharti (49), the eldest daughter. Armed with an MBBS degree, she entered public life early and went on to serve as a Member of Parliament from Patliputra. Married to computer engineer Shailesh Kumar, Misa’s name itself has historical resonance, drawn from the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) under which Lalu was jailed during the Emergency.

2. The second daughter, Rohini Acharya (46), is also a doctor. Based in Singapore with her husband Samresh Singh, she earned widespread admiration for donating a kidney to her father, a gesture she once described as giving “just a small chunk of flesh.” In recent years, however, she has chosen to step back, publicly declaring that she was distancing herself from both politics and the family.

Among the other daughters, several have pursued quieter paths.

3. Chanda Singh, married to pilot Vikram Singh, keeps a low public profile.

4. Ragini Yadav, who studied engineering, is married to Rahul Yadav, a Samajwadi Party figure.

5. Hema Yadav, believed to have a BTech background, is married to Tej Yadav and remains largely out of public view.

6. Anushka “Dhannu” Rao, whose academic interests include interior design and possibly law, is married into a politically active Haryana family through Chiranjeev Rao.

7. The youngest daughter, Raj Lakshmi, an engineering graduate, married Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, extending the family’s ties to yet another political lineage.

Among the sons, the dynamics were always more intense.

8. Tej Pratap Yadav (37) has served as a minister in Bihar and held various public roles. His journey, however, took a dramatic turn in 2025 when Lalu expelled him from both the family and the party, citing “irresponsible behaviour.”

(37) has served as a minister in Bihar and held various public roles. His journey, however, took a dramatic turn in 2025 when Lalu expelled him from both the family and the party, citing “irresponsible behaviour.” 9. The youngest, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav (35), emerged as Lalu’s political successor. Despite leaving formal education after Class 12, he rose swiftly to serve as Bihar’s deputy chief minister. Married to Rajshree Yadav, he is also the father of two children.





PATNA: The family of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and former chief minister Rabri Devi has long been central to Bihar’s political landscape.Married in 1973, the couple raised nine children, seven daughters and two sons each carving out a distinct identity within and beyond politics. Together, they form one of India’s most recognisable political dynasties.Together, these nine siblings form a complex and far-reaching family network — blending politics, professional careers, and cross-state alliances.Tensions had been quietly accumulating over the years as Tejashwi consolidated control within the RJD, increasingly relying on a coterie of advisers, a move that some siblings viewed as exclusionary. The party’s poor showing in the recent Bihar assembly elections — winning only 25 of the 143 seats it contested — intensified scrutiny of this leadership style.The situation escalated this week when Rohini Acharya publicly alleged that she had been mistreated at the family home and unfairly targeted by individuals close to Tejashwi. Her remarks prompted three of her sisters — Ragini, Chanda, and Raj Lakshmi — to leave their parents’ Patna residence, adding to the perception of a widening divide.Tej Pratap, who had himself fallen out with the party and was publicly disowned by Lalu last year, came out strongly in Rohini’s support, saying her treatment was unacceptable. His reaction underscored the emotional and political complexity of the family’s evolving dynamics.The RJD’s top leadership, including Lalu and Tejashwi, has so far maintained a deliberate silence. Party insiders suggest that the emerging questions around decision-making and the role of Tejashwi’s advisers have been simmering for months and are now surfacing as the organisation grapples with its electoral setback.Amid the uncertainty, JD(U) leaders have publicly urged Lalu to address the matter, arguing that the unfolding discord has broader implications for Bihar’s political landscape.","The family of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and former chief minister Rabri Devi has long been central to Bihar’s political landscape. Married in 1973, the couple raised nine children, seven daughters and two sons each carving out a distinct identity within and beyond politics. Together, these nine siblings form a complex and far-reaching family network.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125374446,imgsize-1982952,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/inside-the-political-dynasty-of-lalu-prasad-and-rabri-devi.jpg"

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.





NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a partial shock: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.On Tuesday afternoon, when word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.The case devastated families.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the family devastated.Among those, a 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli. Investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125365659,imgsize-46652,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi, and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

Delhi Police file new FIR; uncovers 'deeper conspiracy' in Red Fort car blast; doctor module used ‘spycraft’ tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-car-blast-probe-intensifies-fir-uncovers-deeper-conspiracy-doctor-module-used-spycraft-tactics/articleshow/125340660.cms,"Delhi Blast: Security Forces Demolish House of Red Fort Bombing Accused Umar Nabi in Pulwama





NEW DELHI: The special cell of Delhi Police has filed an FIR to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near Red Fort.The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA. The special cell has invoked sections of criminal conspiracy in this FIR and will reportedly make arrests soon.The blast was so powerful that the ground nearby shook, intelligence sources said on Friday, citing fresh CCTV footage of underground areas of Red Fort metro station. It shows the entire station experiencing a significant tremor causing goods on a cart to shake and rattle. The footage also reveals widespread chaos as panic-stricken commuters run for safety.Explosive experts who picked up samples from the spot are yet to give their report detailing the nature of the bomb, though police maintain Umar Un Nabi, who was behind the wheel when the car blew up, possibly used military grade explosives.Sleuths examined new CCTV footage of the route taken by Umar. “While travelling on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he stopped near a dhaba but didn’t eat anything and slept in his car, the footage shows.On the day of the explosion, Umar stopped at a small shop in Wazirpur and had tea. He was there for around 15 minutes but didn’t talk to anyone,” said a cop.Meanwhile, two doctors were detained for questioning from Haryana’s Nuh district on Thursday night, sources said. One of them pursued an MBBS course from China and recently finished an internship at Al-Falah University. Police informed his family that he was detained for questioning after he allegedly talked to some terror suspects.Suspicious numbers were found on his mobile phone, the cops claimed. The person recently appeared for a job interview at a prestigious medical institution in south Delhi. The other doctor also interned at Al-Falah.Haryana’s Nuh district has come under the radar of intel agencies following the blast. In the last week, five suspects — three MBBS doctors, a fertiliser vendor, and an imam — were taken into custody from the area. Multiple raids have been conducted in the district, which was earlier known as Mewat.Sources in the agencies suggest ammonium nitrate, which could have been used in the explosion, was purchased from Nuh. This suspicion is fuelled by reports that past locations of Umar and his doctor colleague, Muzammil, have been traced to Mewat on multiple occasions.The probe has revealed members of the ‘doctor module’ would draft emails in a shared account without sending them. The recipient would log in, read the draft and delete it to avoid leaving digital evidence. This method is generally used in spycraft. The module also used the Threema app, which operates without phone numbers or email IDs, and possibly created a private server to share maps and locations.","The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA.

Bangladesh witnessed a series of crude bomb explosions in Dhaka on Sunday, police confirmed to Reuters, heightening tensions across the capital ahead of Monday's verdict in a case against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over alleged violence during last year's street protests.No casualties were reported, but the incidents added to the anxiety already gripping the city after days of unrest. Security was tightened overnight across Dhaka and other regions amid sporadic arson attacks and crude bomb blasts.Hasina, 78, is being tried in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering a deadly action against student demonstrators in mid-2024. She denies all allegations and has been in India since fleeing there following her ouster in August last year.Security agencies - including military, paramilitary and police units - were placed on heightened alert after reports that Hasina's now-defunct Awami League had announced a two-day shutdown ahead of the International Crimes Tribunal–Bangladesh (ICT-BD) verdict.On Sunday night, unidentified assailants set fire to a vehicle dumping corner inside a police station complex and detonated two crude bombs outside the residence of an advisory council member of interim government chief Professor Muhammad Yunus.Several intersections across Dhaka also witnessed explosions.The Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) issued strict orders to crack down on violent mobs, authorising personnel to shoot if necessary. ICT-BD prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for the former leader.“I stated over the wireless that anyone who sets a bus on fire or throws crude bombs with intent to kill should be shot. This authority is clearly provided in our law,” Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner SM Sazzat Ali said late Sunday.Since November 10, the capital has seen a wave of mostly predawn attacks, including crude bombs detonated at the entrance of the Grameen Bank headquarters in Mirpur, founded by Yunus. Several branches of the bank were also targeted with coordinated petrol bomb and arson attacks, officials said.Multiple buses were torched during the week, resulting in the death of a sleeping driver.Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal are facing trial in absentia, while the third accused — former police chief Abdullah Al Mamun — appeared in person and has turned “approver”, apparently seeking leniency.“We have sought the highest possible sentence for Hasina. We also requested seizure of the convicts’ property for distribution among families of martyrs and injured victims of last year’s violent street protests,” ICT-BD prosecutor Gazi MH Tamim said.He added that under ICT-BD law, Hasina cannot appeal to the Supreme Court’s Appellate Division unless she surrenders or is arrested within 30 days of the judgment.The verdict is expected to be broadcast live on state-run BTV, with screens installed at multiple locations in Dhaka. Select parts will be aired after tribunal clearance, and live streaming will also be available on ICT-BD’s official Facebook page.In an audio message posted on the Awami League’s Facebook page, Hasina dismissed the charges and urged supporters to remain calm. “We have seen enough of these attacks and cases, this is just a matter of time,” she said.Interim government home affairs adviser, retired lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said the verdict, “whatever it is, will be executed”.Authorities remain on high alert nationwide to avert unrest.Hasina and several senior Awami League leaders face accusations ranging from murder to corruption and abuse of power. Monday’s verdict relates to five counts of alleged crimes against humanity during the July Uprising of 2024, including killings, attempted killings, torture, use of lethal force against unarmed student protesters, deployment of heavy weapons and drones, and specific killings in Rangpur and Dhaka.Hasina insists she is being targeted, accusing interim government chief Yunus of plotting her ouster. She labelled him a “usurper”, saying, “Let them try me, I don’t care… The verdict will not be able to gouge my mouth.”Calling the charges “entirely false”, she added, “If someone makes a false complaint in court, he is tried under law, and one day it will happen.” She also cited Article 7(B) of the Constitution, saying, “If someone by force removes the elected representatives from power, they will be punished. Yunus just did it.”","Sheikh Hasina, 78, is being tried in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

High votes, low wins: The big contradiction



Contest more seats



NDA's math clicked, MGB's math cracked



JD(U)'s comeback flipped the story



BJP grows bigger than ever



MGB slipped because allies didn't deliver



Jan Suraaj and AIMIM changed the margins



So, what really happened?



NEW DELHI: Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi Yadav 's RJD turned out to be the party with highest vote share in the state, yet it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the NDA kept the power with landslide victory, clinching over 200 seats in 243-member assembly, keeping the Mahagathbandhan far from the seat of government.RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 percent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. So the striking question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish with so few seats?The answer lies in how votes were spread. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes. It remained popular, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.In simple terms, RJD got votes but not victories. This is no surprise in India's electoral mechanism of 'First Past the Post System.'RJD contested 143 seats this time, the highest among all parties across both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Lalu-led party had fielded one more candidate, contesting 144 seats.Contesting widely helped the party accumulate more total votes, contributing to the highest vote share. But losing candidates also add to vote share totals.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) fought on 101 seats each. They contested fewer seats but converted their votes efficiently into victories. That is why their seat count shot up, even with a lower vote share than RJD.A major turning point this election was the return of Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas) to the NDA camp. In 2020, the LJP had hurt the NDA's chances by cutting into its votes, but this time its support helped strengthen the alliance instead of splitting it.In the previous election, LJP (RV) was unhappy with the NDA's seat-sharing formula in Bihar. Even though it was part of the alliance at the Centre, Chirag Paswan chose to go solo in the state and contested 134 seats, which ended up damaging NDA numbers—especially Nitish Kumar 's JD(U).Similarly, Upendra Kushwaha's party contested 104 seats independently in 2020, further cutting into votes that could have benefitted the NDA.This time, with both LJP (RV) and Kushwaha’s RLM back in the NDA fold, the alliance appeared far more united, organised, and prepared. The result: NDA outperformed the Mahagathbandhan by a wide margin.One of the biggest turnarounds happened in seats where RJD and JD(U) were in direct fight.In 2020, RJD dominated these contests. But in 2025, JD(U) turned the tables and won 50 out of 59, almost wiping out RJD in head-to-head battles. JD(U)'s vote share also jumped from 15.39 percent in 2020 to 19.25 percent this time, helping it win 85 seats from the tally of 43 last time.RJD simply failed to see this drastic reversal coming.The BJP crossed 89 seats, its highest tally ever in Bihar, marking a historic leap for a party that once had almost no grassroots base or ideological legacy in the state. By staying aligned for years with ""sushasan babu"" and steadily expanding its footprint, the saffron party has now grown into Bihar's biggest political force.With this mandate, the BJP has effectively redrawn the political map of Bihar. It now sits at the centre of power, holding the strongest bargaining position in the alliance. For years, Nitish Kumar played the ""big brother"" to the BJP, but for the second election in a row, the BJP has outperformed the JD(U), this time doing so with its best-ever numbers.The shift isn't just about arithmetic -- it's psychological. For decades, Bihar's political story revolved around the Lalu–Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s weight, influence and negotiating power.Unlike NDA, the Mahagathbandhan struggled with coordination and clarity.Congress contested on 61 seats as compared to last time's 70, but won only six. The Left parties, which surprised everyone in 2020, could not repeat their performance either. Seat-sharing disagreements and confusing ""friendly fights"" meant votes did not transfer smoothly within the alliance.The opposition was visible but not united -- and unity decides tight contests.Prashant Kishor's much-talked about startup -- Jan Suraaj did not open its account, but it made a strategic dent, in at least 35 seats, its vote share was higher than the winning margin, influencing outcomes for both alliances.Meanwhile, AIMIM repeated its strong Seemanchal performance, winning five seats with 1.85 percent of votes and signalling a shift in political thinking among Muslim voters.The traditional Muslim–Yadav (MY) vote base of the RJD showed signs of fragmentation, with Muslim voters exploring alternative platforms in multiple constituencies, leading to a near wipeout of the Mahagathbandhan in Seemanchal, barring one Congress candidate who scraped through.Mayawati's BSP also registered a presence, securing 1.62% of the total vote share with one seat in the west.RJD did not lose popularity, but lost positional advantage. It remained a strong choice for many voters but could not cross the finishing line often enough. High vote share created the impression of strength, but seats reflect actual power -- and that is where NDA towered above everyone.","RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 percent, just few decimals down from 2020. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125363704,imgsize-759459,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-99.jpg"

Rohini jo bolti hai, sach bolti hai

NEW DELHI: Rohini Acharya, daughter of Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav , on Sunday recounted what she says unfolded during the family feud that erupted after the Mahagathbandhan’s crushing defeat in the Bihar assembly elections, stressing that she is “not lying about any of the events. ”She added that her parents — former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi — as well as her sisters “cried” for her following Saturday’s developments.“Whatever I had to say, I have already said on my social media. I have not lied about anything that happened.(Whatever Rohini says is the truth). You may go and ask Tejashwi Yadav , Sanjay Yadav, Rachel Yadav, and Rameez. My father has always stood by me. My parents and my sisters were crying for me yesterday. I am blessed to have parents like them,” she told reporters.Rachel Yadav is Acharya’s sister-in-law — her brother Tejashwi's wife, who adopted the name Rajshree after their marriage. Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat have been accused by Rohini of being behind the events that made her “disown” her family and quit politics. Sanjay Yadav is a close confidante of Tejashwi and an RJD Rajya Sabha MP.Rameez, also an RJD leader and Tejashwi’s childhood friend, is the son-in-law of Rizwan Zaheer, a former MP from the Balrampur Lok Sabha seat in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.“I feel fortunate to have parents like mine. In a family, why is it that only daughters are expected to make sacrifices, especially when there are brothers? When questions were asked of the brothers, they told me to go to my in-laws’ house. As a result, I have decided to disown my brother (Tejashwi),” she added.The former RJD leader mentioned that she is now heading to Mumbai to stay with her mother-in-law. “She is worried and has been crying since yesterday,” Acharya noted.On Saturday, a day after the results were declared and the RJD and its allies suffered a rout — dashing Tejashwi Yadav’s hopes of becoming the third chief minister from the family — Rohini Acharya announced on social media that she was “disowning” her family and quitting politics. She blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemach for the situation.“Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated; abuses were hurled, shoes were raised to kill her… I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not give up on truth… and because of that, I faced insults. Yesterday, a daughter left her crying parents and siblings out of helplessness… she was forced to leave her parental home… she was made an orphan. I pray that none of you ever have to walk my path, and no home should ever have a daughter-sister like Rohini,” she wrote on X earlier on Sunday.","Rohini Acharya, daughter of Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, on Sunday recounted what she says unfolded during the family feud.

Kishor would at best be a spoiler, many of his critics had said

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj Party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested but data suggests it may have played spoiler in quite a few seats. In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin. NDA won 19 of these seats while 14 went to Mahagathbandhan. AIMIM and BSP each won one of these seats.Of course, the fact that Jan Suraaj got more votes than the margin in a seat does not necessarily mean it made the difference to the outcome since there is no way of knowing where those votes would otherwise have gone.The party came third in 115 seats and in one, Marhaura, it finished second.Of the 35 seats, within NDA, JDU, Kishor's former party, won 10 of these seats while BJP won five. The tally was three for LJP-RV and one for RLM.In the MGB camp, RJD was the winner in nine of these seats while Congress won two. One seat each went to CPM, CPIML-L and IIP.Despite his amplified presence on the social media, many critics of the party had claimed that Prashant Kishor would at best be a spoiler.Some felt his upper caste identity meant he would cut into BJP's vote while others argued he would divide the anti-incumbency youth votes since he was talking about issues like migration from the state.","In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Sunday termed the Bihar assembly election outcome “abnormal,” claiming it was shaped by three “experiments.""According to him, these included the transfer of Rs 10,000 to women under the Mahila Rojgar Yojana, the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, and the transfer of land to a ""corporate house"" at a “throwaway price.”“The poll dates were not announced until all the targeted welfare schemes of the government, including the provision of Rs 10,000 for women, materialised. This is an unprecedented and unique experiment in India’s electoral history,” Bhattacharya told reporters in Patna, two days after the results were declared.The CPI(ML)L, a constituent of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, won just two of the 20 seats it contested — a sharp fall from the 12 out of 19 it secured in 2020. Overall, the three Left parties in the alliance won only three of 33 seats this time, compared to 16 out of 29 in the previous election.Speaking on SIR, Bhattacharya said the deletion of 65 lakh voters and the later addition of 3.5–4 lakh names before the polls had a ""significant impact"" on the result.He added that the third issue — the land transfer — had been raised by the opposition but failed to resonate with the voters, cautioning that it would “normalise the corporatisation of Bihar’s resources.”“From November 18 to 24, our candidates and party workers will go among the people as part of a feedback and public outreach exercise. We need to stop these experiments; otherwise, there will be no level-playing field in politics,” the Left leader stated.The Bihar assembly elections were held on November 6 and 11, covering 121 and 122 constituencies respectively.The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a sweeping victory, winning 202 of the 243 seats. The Mahagathbandhan managed just 35 seats. In 2020, the NDA and the opposition bloc had won 125 and 110 seats respectively.","The Bihar assembly elections were held on November 6 and 11, covering 121 and 122 constituencies.

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns that Indian arms companies were failing to deliver emergency procurements on time and that some of them were even inflating the extent of indigenous content in their products, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has said the armed forces expect ""a bit of nationalism and patriotism"" in industry's ""profit-driven endeavours"".""Defence reforms are not a one-way street. (Domestic) industries will have to be truthful about their indigenous capabilities to us. You cannot leave us in the lurch.

The EP mechanism empowers the armed forces to fast-track contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore that have to be executed within a year, instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.After EP-5 last year, which was reserved exclusively for domestic companies, the defence ministry had approved EP-6.This came following the cross-border hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.It will help the Army, Indian Air Force and Navy to build as well as replenish their stockpiles of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition, through both foreign and domestic sources.Amid allegations that many domestic companies are merely assembling systems after importing them, instead of manufacturing them, Gen Anil Chauhan said, ""A lot of industries say this (a product) is 70% indigenous, but actually, if you find out, it is not. You have to be truthful about this. Because it is related to matters of security.""The Chief of Defence Staff also criticised the overpricing of weapon systems and platforms.""You will have to be cost-competitive.

Thirty minutes later, an explosion ripped through Srinagar's Nowgam police station, killing Asrar and eight others. The victims were police officers, forensic personnel, revenue officials and a tailor, all between 30 and 45.The cousin who had waited for Asrar spent the night visiting Srinagar hospitals before finding his body in the police mortuary the next morning.

Just a day after declaring she was distancing herself, Rohini accused Tejashwi of humiliating and abusing her, claiming that matters escalated to the point where ""a slipper was raised to hit her. ""Taking to X, Rohini wrote an emotional post, stating she was forced to leave behind her aged parents, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi - in tears while protecting her dignity. She posted writing in Hindi, which translates to: ""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, filthy abuses were hurled at her, a slipper was raised to hit her. I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not surrender the truth, and solely because of this, I had to endure this insult.

NIA Arrests Alleged Aide Of ‘Suicide Bomber’ Umar Nabi In Delhi Terror Attack

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday said it has arrested an aide of suicide bomber Umer un Nabi who had carried out the Nov 10 car blast, for allegedly facilitating purchase of the car in Delhi and conspiring with the bomber to carry out the terror attack.Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Samboora, Pampore in J&K and in whose name the car involved in the attack was registered, was arrested from Delhi by the NIA, which had launched a massive search operation after taking over the case from Delhi Police.NIA described the arrest as “a major breakthrough” in the Red Fort area car bomb blast case.NIA investigations so far have revealed that accused Amir had come to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the Hyundai i20 car used in the blast. NIA has forensically established the identity of the deceased driver of the vehicle-borne IED as Umer Un Nabi. Dr Umer hailed from Pulwama district of J&K and was working as an assistant professor in the general medicine department of Al Falah College of Medical Science and Research Centre, while also working for a Jaish terror module purportedly planning major, pan-India terror attacks. The massive recovery of over 2,900 kg of explosives foiled these plans.NIA on Sunday said it has seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi. The vehicle is being examined for evidence in the case.The central anti-terror agency has so far examined 73 witnesses, including those injured in the blast that had rocked the national capital on Nov 10 and claimed a dozen lives.“Working in close coordination with Delhi Police, Jammu & Kashmir Police, Haryana Police, UP Police and various sister agencies, NIA is continuing its investigation across states. It is pursuing multiple leads to unearth the larger conspiracy behind the bombing and identify others involved in the case RC-21/2025/NIA/DLI,” NIA said in a statement on Sunday.","Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Samboora, Pampore in J&K, was arrested from Delhi.

People of Bihar did not want the jungle raj to return: Jan Suraaj



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party on Sunday claimed that World Bank funds meant for some other project were diverted and transferred to women voters ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections.Jan Suraaj spokesperson Pavan Verma said the scale and timing of the payouts under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana had not only tilted the electoral field but were also sanctioned just an hour before the Model Code of Conduct came into force.He said the party had received information that Rs 14,000 crore out of a total Rs 21,000 crore linked to a World Bank-funded project had been used for this purpose.""The public debt in Bihar is at present 4,06,000 crores. The interest per day is 63 crores. The treasury is empty. We have information which could be wrong, also that the amount of Rs 10,000 given to women in the state was given from Rs 21,000 crores, which came from the World Bank for some other project. An hour before the moral code of conduct for the polls, Rs 14,000 crores were taken out and distributed to 1.25 crore women in the state,"" he claimed in an interview with news agency ANI.Union minister Chirag Paswan dismissed the allegations outright, questioning both the credibility of the data and the intent behind the accusations.""Where do they get this data from, this information from?... Making empty claims - if you have any facts, present it and the Govt will respond,"" the LJP(RV) chief said, as quoted by ANI.Verma further rejected suggestions that Prashant Kishor’s stand on lifting the liquor ban had damaged the party. He argued instead that the prohibition regime was already ineffective, with liquor “being sold at every nook and corner” and even home-delivered at inflated prices. He noted that over two lakh people, mostly from extremely backward Dalit communities, had been jailed under the prohibition law. “People are consuming it and paying more for it. Would that not affect women who have to run their homes?” he asked.Despite mounting a high-energy campaign and contesting all 243 seats, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single constituency. Verma said last-minute cash transfers, women-centric schemes, and a consolidation among voters who did not want the “jungle raaj” of the RJD to return proved decisive. “Nitish ji was the X factor… People of Bihar did not want the jungle raj of Lalu ji, RJD and Tejashwi to return,” he said.The ruling NDA got 202 seats, a three-fourths majority in the 243-member House. This is the second time the NDA has crossed the 200-mark in the assembly polls.

Karnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar Sparks Row By Singing RSS Anthem In Assembly, Then Clarifies

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Sunday asserted there is “no need” for him to step down as the state Congress president, stressing that his health is “good” and that he has several responsibilities to discharge as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief.“I have worked to build the party day in and day out, and I will continue to do so. My mental, physical and political health is good,” he told reporters in Bengaluru, according to ANI.Shivakumar noted that he must oversee the laying of foundation stones for 100 Congress party offices in Karnataka and is scheduled to meet Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. “We have to celebrate the Congress foundation day (December 28). Who will do all this? I have to do it. Why should I resign from the KPCC presidency? There is no need for it,” he remarked.Describing himself as a “loyal soldier” of the party, he added that he would continue as KPCC chief for as long as the leadership wants him to remain in the role.On whether he would raise rumours of a Cabinet reshuffle during his meeting with Kharge, Shivakumar distanced himself from the matter. “That is left to the CM (Siddaramaiah). He will discuss it with the high command.I am meeting Kharge only to finalise dates for laying the foundation for the new Congress offices. I would like both Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi to lay the foundation stone.

NAVI MUMBAI: Nerul police have filed an FIR against Amit Thackeray , the son of MNS chief Raj Thackeray and 70 MNS workers including office bearers for defying police prevention and forcibly unveiling the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in a canopy constructed by NMMC at a junction in sector -1, Nerul near Rajiv Gandhi flyover on Sunday afternoon.The accused have been booked under relevant sections of BNS for assault or criminal force against a public servant, voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of their duty, unlawful assembly, rioting, joint liability and mischief causing loss or damage to property along with relevant sections of Maharashtra Police Act. The accused are Amit Thackeray, chief of Maharashtra Vidyarthi Sena, Mumbai, Gajanan Kale, MNS President of Navi Mumbai City and Abhijit Desai, MNS Nerul unit chief among other MNS workers, informed Brahmanand Naikwadi, senior inspector of Nerul.Inspector Naikwadi said, ""The accused had took out a morcha without permission and gathering unlawfully assaulted the on-duty Assistant police inspector Nilesh Chavan and also created obstruction in government work by disregarding the instructions given by the police and also maliciously damaged the net installed around the statue by NMMC.""During his visit to Nerul, Amit Thackeray got annoyed after seeing that the statue of Maratha King was covered in a cloth on which dust had accumulated, as NMMC had delayed the unveiling since Feb last year.As Nerul police learnt that Amit Thackeray was going to unofficially unveil the statue, a police team from Nerul was deployed at the spot to prevent the unofficial unveiling of the statue of Maratha King. But, the MNS workers accompanying Thackeray vehemently protested defying the police prevention and forcibly reached the canopy and tore apart the cloth covering the statue after which Thackeray himself washed the statue.Gajanan Kale, MNS President of Navi Mumbai said, ""Despite repeated communication with NMMC since Feb last year demanding unveiling of the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Nerul chowk built with an expenditure of around Rs 46 lakhs, the concerned civic authorities have been ignoring as probably they are waiting for appointment of CM Devendra Fadnavis. As the cloth used to cover the statue had become dirty, it was indeed desecration of the statue of Maratha king. Hence, Amit Thackeray took the lead to unveil the statue and himself washed the statue.""NMMC has released a presser stating that, the unveiling the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Nerul was not done by NMMC. Actually, the construction work around the statue has not been completed yet and is in the final stages. Therefore, the ceremonial installation of the statue was to be announced soon. Unveiling the statue without taking permission from the concerned authority and without giving any prior notice is very wrong and unauthorized from the point of view of law and order.","Nerul police have filed an FIR against Amit Thackeray and 70 MNS workers.

AQI still 'very poor'



NEW DELHI: The national capital shivered through its coldest November night in three years on Sunday, with temperatures dipping to 9°C — 4.5 degrees below the seasonal average according to the India Meteorological Department. Not since 29 November 2022, when the city recorded 7.3°C, has November felt this cold. In the past two years, the lowest November readings were 9.2°C in 2023 and 9.5°C in 2024.The weather office expects the chill to persist, forecasting a minimum of 9°C and a maximum of around 25°C on Monday, along with shallow fog by early morning. Humidity touched 81 per cent at 8.30am on Sunday, adding to the dense smog that blanketed large parts of the city.Even as temperatures plunged, pollution levels remained grim. Delhi’s 24-hour average Air Quality Index stood at 377 on Sunday — firmly in the ‘very poor’ category. At several monitoring stations, conditions were far worse: the CPCB’s Sameer app showed that 11 of 39 sites were in the ‘severe’ bracket with readings above 400. By Sunday morning, 18 stations had slipped into the severe range, while another 20 recorded ‘very poor’ air.Iconic locations such as India Gate, Rajghat and ITO were engulfed in a thick layer of smog, with Rajghat and ITO hitting an alarming AQI of 417. Chandni Chowk touched 420, while Anand Vihar, Alipur and Ashok Vihar hovered between 400 and 415. Even areas with slightly lower levels, such as Dwarka (378) and Dhaula Kuan (338), remained heavily polluted.Authorities said PM2.5 and PM10 particles were the dominant pollutants. With the haze settling deeper as winter begins, the Commission for Air Quality Management has enforced Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan. Measures include a ban on most non-essential construction, restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of classes up to Class 5, curbs on polluting industrial activity and a ban on non-emergency diesel generator sets.","The national capital shivered through its coldest November night in three years on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: BJD on Sunday rejected the Nuapada by-poll results after finishing third behind the BJP and the Congress, accusing the Election Commission of India of failing to stop “rigging” by the ruling BJP.The by-poll was held after the death of the sitting BJD MLA. His son, Jay Dholakia, was expected to contest as the BJD candidate but switched to the BJP and became its nominee. The BJD then fielded its women’s wing chief, Snehangini Chhuria.At a press conference at the party headquarters, Chhuria said, “I completely reject the Nuapada by-poll results and condemn the ECI and the district administration for failing to conduct a free and fair election.”Dholakia won the seat with over 1.23 lakh votes. Congress candidate Ghasiram Majhi came second with 40,121 votes, and Chhuria finished third with 38,408 votes.Chhuria alleged that the BJP “manipulated” the election using administrative machinery and police support. She claimed the Nuapada district collector, the district election officer, and the SP acted like “BJP agents” and failed to act on complaints of electoral malpractice. She also said the high voter turnout in 41 booths, crossing 90 per cent for the first time, was “suspicious”.Also read: Bihar polls similar to those seen in North Korea, Russia & China, says Digvijaya Singh She accused the ECI of changing voter turnout figures multiple times.According to her, the commission first announced 75 per cent turnout at 5 pm on 14 November, later raised it to 77 per cent, then 81 per cent the next morning, and finally revised it to 83.45 per cent.Chhuria said the BJP gained from “rigging” carried out with help from local officials. She claimed that BJD leaders followed the ECI’s 48-hour silence rule and left the district, but BJP leaders stayed back and “distributed money”.She also alleged that a BJD worker who filed a complaint was detained under the Arms Act, while complaints about BJP workers entering booths were ignored.BJP general secretary Biranchi Tripathy rejected all allegations and said the BJD should “introspect” instead of questioning the voters’ decision.""The BJD should realise that the people of Odisha have now completely lost faith in them.

CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

Growing need for anti-drone systems

NEW DELHI: The Army and the Air Force are preparing to place orders for 16 indigenous drone detection and interdiction systems. These systems can hit unmanned aerial vehicles at a distance of 2 km using lasers and disable them.The defence ministry is expected to clear DRDO ’s Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System (Mark 2). Officials told ANI that this version can engage enemy drones with a 10-kilowatt laser at 2 km. The earlier system could target drones only up to around 1 km.DRDO has also test-fired a direct energy weapon system that can target threats at 5 km. Trials are under way with support from the armed forces. This 5 km range will come from a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon.In April, India showcased, for the first time, its ability to shoot down fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser weapon. With this demonstration, India joined a small group of countries, such as the US, China, and Russia that have shown similar capability.CHESS, a DRDO lab, recently carried out a successful field demonstration of the land version of the vehicle-mounted Laser Directed Weapon DEW MK-II(A) in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh.It brought down a fixed-wing UAV and swarm drones, causing structural damage and disabling their surveillance sensors.Also read: 'Nari Shakti' in force?

Yatras: A time-honoured tool of Indian politics



Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra



Tejashwi Yadav’s Bihar Adhikar Yatra



Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj padyatra



Structure trumps yatra



In the lead-up to Bihar’s assembly polls, three major marches: Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra, Tejashwi Yadav’s Bihar Adhikar Yatra and Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Padyatra were expected to energise the opposition and reshape the election narrative. All three drew large crowds and garnered a lot of attention.Yet, when the votes were counted, none of these grand yatras translated into electoral gains. The BJP-led NDA romped home with over 202 seats out of 243, consigning Congress and its allies to a crushing defeat. The INDIA bloc’s ambitious marches proved ineffective: Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra did not prove to be a trump card, and its message of “vote theft” remained largely irrelevant in Bihar politics.Likewise, Tejashwi Yadav’s tour failed to expand his party’s base, and Kishor’s two-year-long trek ended without a single Jan Suraaj victory. In short, symbolism could not substitute for organisation in Bihar’s rugged electoral terrain.Pan-India “padayatra” has long been a favourite strategy for politicians seeking to connect with voters. And they are suddenly all the rage in politics, with leaders across parties taking to the road in dramatic, high-octane treks.Rahul Gandhi helped revive the trend with his Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2022–23, walking nearly 4,000km from Kanyakumari to Srinagar, followed by the far longer Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra earlier this year.Hot on his heels came Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai, whose En Mann, En Makkal journey criss-crossed 10,000km and ended with a grand finale attended by the Prime Minister. TDP’s Nara Lokesh completed his own youth-focused Yuva Galam, insisting it was more about listening than winning.Such yatras can energise party cadres and highlight campaign themes. The yatras can be termed as “sanjivani” (life-giving) for parties, refreshing the organisation and giving campaigns a solid foundation.In Bihar, where rural networks and caste ties are crucial, parties often deploy yatras to visit far-flung villages and rural clusters. A well-timed yatra can build momentum by showing unity and giving voters a sense of participation. Yet this year, spectacle without substance was no match for the NDA’s disciplined strategy. Despite the grand fanfare of these three yatras, Bihar’s electorate delivered a very different verdict.Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra (August–September) was hyped as a campaign to protect voter rights. Covering over 1,300 km across 25 districts and more than 100 constituencies, Rahul donned Bihar’s cultural symbols, the gamcha scarf, a cap and attacked alleged “vote chori” (vote stealing) and the state’s Special Intensive Revision of rolls. The march began with impressive crowds, especially in Sasaram, and projected Congress’s return to rural areas.However, from the very start, it was clear that public enthusiasm would not last. In the ensuing weeks, energy fell sharply. The yatra began with strong crowds, but as the campaign moved forward, the initial spark faded. Congress leaned heavily on the yatra’s symbolism but failed to build an effective ground organisation. Outside of a few big rallies, senior Congress leaders were largely absent, and booth-level mobilisation was weak. Rahul’s strategy focused obsessively on national issues like electoral rolls, which did not strike a chord with most Biharis. Ordinary voters were more concerned with jobs, inflation and local governance than allegations of “voter chori.”Rahul’s campaign squandered precious time attacking the Election Commission, and the shift backfired. After rallying around national narratives, Congress’s messaging was drowned out by local realities it failed to read. By election day, Congress only won 6 seats out of 61 contested: a miserable 10% success rate. Rural crowds did not turn into rural votes. Internal alliance tensions didn’t help either: Rahul kept a distance after the Yatra and reappeared only weeks later, and the absence of sustained leadership further undermined Congress.Meanwhile, Bihar’s ruling BJP and JD(U) gleefully declared Rahul’s march a flop show. Their taunts echoed the ground reality: for all its high production values, the Voter Adhikar Yatra failed to translate into votes for Congress, leaving the party facing one of its worst-ever Bihar results. In short, Rahul’s narrative of “vote chori” and his focus on fighting SIR proved largely irrelevant to the Bihar electorate. His Yatra simply did not prove to be a trump card.Tejashwi Yadav’s Bihar Adhikar Yatra was launched on September 16, almost immediately after Rahul’s tour. Setting out from Jehanabad, Tejashwi promised to challenge the Nitish Kumar government on unemployment, crime and local grievances. The yatra was partly pitched as filling gaps left by Rahul’s march; RJD officials openly said they covered districts left out of the Voter Adhikar Yatra. By highlighting issues in RJD strongholds: Jehanabad, Nalanda, Supaul, Saharsa and others. Tejashwi aimed to consolidate his party’s core vote and signal that the RJD was the main force in the INDIA bloc. He also used the trip to assert himself: earlier, he had declared he would contest all 243 seats, underlining his claim to be the alliance’s undisputed leader.In theory, Tejashwi’s focused effort should have solidified his social coalition and countered anti-incumbency. In practice, it barely made a dent outside his base. By election day, the RJD had outperformed Congress, but only marginally: the party was on course for about 25 seats, far below its 75 in 2020.Tejashwi failed to convert the momentum and anti-incumbency wave against Nitish Kumar into actual votes, leaving the RJD with its second-worst tally ever. The much-heralded yatra vision of reaching every village did little to overcome the RJD’s narrow caste profile. Most communities beyond the Muslim–Yadav base remained unconvinced, and even within the RJD, ticket distribution caused resentment. Seat-sharing disputes led to friendly fights where opposition partners split the anti-NDA vote.In the end, Tejashwi’s personal crusade could not overcome these structural flaws. The RJD held on to pockets of support but did not expand beyond its traditional base. The youth-versus-experience narrative he touted collapsed under the weight of Nitish Kumar’s intact governance credentials and the shadows of the ""jungle raj.""Prashant Kishor entered the fray with arguably the grandest walking tour of all: a 3,500 km Jan Suraaj Padyatra launched on Gandhi Jayanti 2023. A celebrated poll strategist-turned-aspirant, Kishor promised a people’s movement – reaching every panchayat, listening to voters, and forging a vision document on education, health and agriculture. For months, he walked through remote Bihar, courting media attention and projecting himself as an alternative to both the NDA and the Grand Alliance.Yet on November 14, the results laid bare the folly of that endeavour. The Jan Suraaj Party failed to register a single electoral win. Most of its candidates forfeited their deposits, signalling minimal vote share. Kishor entered the Bihar polls as a political aspirant and walked out as its biggest loser. Despite all the media hype, his technocratic, governance-centric message did not resonate in a polarised contest dominated by clear caste and welfare narratives. Voters showed little appetite for this new kind of politics.Kishor had gambled that his nationwide profile and long trek would translate to votes; instead, it highlighted the disconnect. The Jan Suraaj experiment demonstrated that mere visibility cannot replace grassroots machinery. His late decision to withdraw candidates from certain constituencies only reinforced perceptions of organisational chaos.While the three opposition yatras floundered, the NDA executed a far more disciplined and targeted campaign. The alliance maintained unity and clear messaging throughout. The BJP ceded certain seats to allies to consolidate OBC and Dalit votes. Caste calculations paid off, and the coalition’s welfare-focused agenda resonated strongly. Record female turnout over 71% tilted the mandate towards the NDA, driven by schemes such as women’s entrepreneurship subsidies.The NDA ran on a combination of Nitish Kumar’s governance brand and BJP’s organisational muscle. Nitish (JD(U)) carried the narrative weight, focusing on law-and-order and welfare. He unleashed a series of high-profile welfare schemes for women, the elderly and the poor: for example, a deposit of Rs 10,000 in women’s accounts, free electricity up to 125 units, and higher pensionsIn contrast, the Mahagathbandhan’s strategy was messy. Seat-sharing remained an open wound: even on the eve of polling, allies had not finalised allocations, leading to several cases where partners fielded candidates against each other. This confusion squandered whatever goodwill Rahul’s Yatra had generated. The INDIA bloc lacked a coherent narrative. Issues like the Special Intensive Revision failed to galvanise voters, whereas the NDA’s focus on good governance and economic benefits rang true at the booth level. The opposition entered the polls divided, with disputes and no unified strategy, while the NDA’s welfare-focused messaging proved far stronger.Grand marches can generate excitement, but in Bihar, they cannot substitute for solid organisation and clear leadership. Rahul Gandhi’s 1,300-km yatra dazzled onlookers but saw Congress’s vote share collapse to one of its lowest levels. Tejashwi Yadav’s bid for prominence reinforced the RJD’s base but did not expand it. And Prashant Kishor’s sprawling padyatra proved that even two years of walking cannot conjure an instant vote ban","Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra did not prove to be a trump card, and its message of “vote theft’ remained largely irrelevant in Bihar politics.

NEW DELHI: The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Kerala’s electoral roll is expected to be severely affected on Monday after multiple trade unions announced that Booth Level Officers (BLOs) across the state will boycott work. The decision follows the death of a BLO in Kannur, whose family and colleagues allege he was under intense work pressure linked to the SIR process.The Action Council of State Government Employees and Teachers, the Joint Committee of Teacher Service Organisations, and the Kerala NGO Association said on Sunday that their members would not report for duty. They have also announced joint protest marches at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer and at collectorates in all districts.According to the organisations, BLOs are burdened with unrealistic targets as part of the SIR and the preparations for the upcoming local body elections. “Instead, it imposed an unrealistic workload with high targets in a very short period. This pressure is pushing BLOs toward suicide,” their statement said.Tension escalated after the death of Aneesh George, 44, a BLO from Payyannur, Kannur, who was found hanging in his home on Sunday.His family and local residents have alleged that he took the extreme step due to the heavy workload associated with the SIR. Police records also state he had been under stress related to his duties.His father said George had been tense for days. “I never expected that things would reach this level… He took the extreme step out of this tension,” he said. A family acquaintance, Shyam, also said the deceased had spoken about the pressure to complete SIR-related work.Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan demanded a thorough probe, saying the workload faced by BLOs must be examined. “SIR was initiated by the central government. The ongoing process is more intensive than even the preparations for the Assembly elections,” he said.CPI(M)’s M V Jayarajan said George “might have felt that there was no option other than to end his own life,” and urged that the SIR be halted until the local body polls. Congress leader Rijil Makkutty alleged that George was a victim of the Election Commission’s attempt to advance the process “to fulfil the BJP agenda”.Chief Electoral Officer Rathan U Kelkar said a report from the district collector has been sought. He added that BLOs are only required to handle SIR-related work for 31 days and “normally there is no chance of any work pressure”. The police probe and collector’s report, he said, will clarify the circumstances.","Multiple trade unions announce that Booth Level Officers (BLOs) across the state will boycott work. The decision follows the death of a BLO in Kannur, whose family and colleagues allege he was under intense work pressure linked to the SIR process.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125365818,imgsize-798972,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

‘Not a big issue’: Karnataka HM Parameshwara says ‘only cabinet reshuffle’; day after Rahul–Sidda meet spark CM change rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-a-big-issue-karnataka-hm-parameshwara-says-only-cabinet-reshuffle-day-after-rahulsidda-meet-spark-cm-change-rumours/articleshow/125364960.cms,"NEW DELHI: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Sunday said there will only be a cabinet reshuffle quashing rumours about a possible leadership change in the state.His remarks came a day after chief minister Siddaramaiah met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, sparking fresh talk about impending changes. While reports suggested that the high command had begun considering a reshuffle, Siddaramaiah dismissed those claims, saying there were “no discussions on the reshuffle” and that the meeting focused solely on the Bihar election outcome.Speaking to reporters, Parameshwara said the matter rests entirely with the chief minister and the party leadership. “It is said that the high command has given permission for a reshuffle. Media is saying it and this subject is coming out in the open. Now you can guess what's happening with regard to the change of guard. Normally, leadership changes do not happen when the Cabinet reshuffle takes place,” he said, as quoted by PTI.He added that several Congress legislators have been pushing for ministerial berths. “Now, after getting permission for a reshuffle, the CM and the high command will do it. To me this is not a big issue,” he said.Public works minister Satish Jarkiholi echoed the position, saying the decision lies with the party leadership. “On Saturday, the chief minister met the party high command. Only he knows what discussion took place with the high command. The decision on the Cabinet reshuffle is left to him and the party top brass,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah reiterated that his meeting with Rahul Gandhi was strictly political and connected to the Bihar results. “Yes, I met Rahul Gandhi. We only discussed the Bihar election. He's our leader, so we encouraged him after a setback in the Bihar election. He said he's not worried about it. We have told him not to lose his spirit. There was no discussion about a cabinet reshuffle at all. I will meet the PM on Monday if I get an appointment,” he said.Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar, who previously said he would “follow” Siddaramaiah’s word amid leadership rumours, distanced himself from Saturday’s meeting. “I don't know about the CM's meeting with Rahul Gandhi. I don't know about a cabinet reshuffle discussion... If you want to ask anything about a reshuffling of leadership change issues, speak to CM. We have to follow what the party says,” he said.","Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara says there will only be a cabinet reshuffle.

NEW DELHI: The Lalu Yadav family feud drew reactions from several National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders as they demanded answers from Tejashwi Yadav , who has been accused of hurling ""filthy abuses"" by his sister Rohini Acharya.BJP leader Nitin Nabin said that is Tejashwi had ""become so unpopular in his own family, so how can you think he will be able to move things forward in society?""""It's a family matter, but the way Lalu Yadav has brought his entire family into politics is a bad outcome. Tejashwi Yadav has become so unpopular in his own family, so how can you think he will be able to move things forward in society? Tejashwi Yadav should come forward and answer,"" Nabin, who won from Bankipur Assembly said.Meanwhile, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal said that Acharya was being made ""scapegoat"" for RJD 's crushing defeat in the Bihar polls.""It is their family matter. It (election results) was the responsibility of Tejashwi Yadav, but his aide, Sanjay Yadav, told Rohini to take responsibility. And if his sister was asked to take responsibility for that defeat, how painfully did she take that responsibility? That's why she is talking about retiring from politics, even distancing herself from her family.If they can't take care of their family, how will they take care of society?"" he said.Echoing similar sentiments, BJP leader Dr Guru Prakash Paswan said, ""This is an internal matter of his family. However, if someone is involved in politics or social life, nothing remains private; everything becomes public. The way political questions are raised, first by Tej Pratap Yadav and then by Rohini Acharya, someone must take responsibility for the defeat. Lalu Prasad Yadav has had a long political career. He claims to represent the so-called socially disadvantaged. Yet, with the clouds of an existential crisis looming over him following election results, I believe his party definitely needs to determine its own course.""Tej Pratap Yadav, who himself has been ousted from the family and party, extended support for sister Rohini and said, “Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances. Listen, traitors— If you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away. ”He urged his father Lalu to take action against ""traitor"" who had ""clouded Tejashwi’s judgment.""“Father, give just one signal… just one gesture, and the people of Bihar themselves will bury these traitors. This is not a fight of any political party — it is a fight for the family’s honour, for the dignity of daughters, and for the self-respect of Bihar,” he said.Acharya’s social-media posts on Sunday, alleging humiliation, abuse and expulsion from her parental home, have intensified scrutiny of deepening power struggles within the Yadav family. She said she was “disgraced, abused, and even hit” after raising questions about the RJD’s poor showing in the Assembly polls.""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, filthy abuses were hurled at her, a slipper was raised to hit her. I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not surrender the truth, and solely because of this, I had to endure this insult... Yesterday, a daughter, out of compulsion, left behind her crying parents and sisters and came away; they tore me away from my maternal home... They left me orphaned,"" she said.In another post, referring to her kidney donation to Lalu, she said, ""I did what I did to save my God -- my father -- and today, the kidney is being called 'dirty'... May none of you ever make a mistake like mine, may no family ever have a daughter like Rohini.""Acharya also named RJD leader Sanjay Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav’s close aide Rameez Khan as key figures behind the rift, alleging that their actions drove her to quit politics and leave her parents’ home.","BJP leader Nitin Nabin said that is Tejashwi had ""become so unpopular in his own family, so how can you think he will be able to move things forward in society?""

Mahe-Class: Navy to commission its first indigenous shallow water anti-submarine warfare vessel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahe-class-navy-to-commission-its-first-indigenous-shallow-water-anti-submarine-warfare-vessel/articleshow/125364302.cms,"CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

The Indian Navy is set to achieve a new milestone in its drive toward self-reliance with the commissioning of INS Mahe, the first of the Mahe-class Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Crafts (ASW-SWCs). The vessel will be officially inducted at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai on November 24, marking a significant step forward in India’s indigenous shipbuilding capabilities.Built by Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL), Kochi, INS Mahe is a key symbol of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, reflecting the Navy’s sustained push for homegrown defence technologies. Designed and constructed entirely in India, the vessel demonstrates the nation’s growing expertise in modern naval architecture, combat systems, and platform integration.Compact yet formidable, Mahe blends agility, endurance, and cutting-edge technology—qualities essential for operations in shallow waters and coastal zones. Equipped with advanced sonar, radar, and weapons systems, the ship is designed for anti-submarine warfare, coastal patrols, underwater surveillance, low-intensity maritime operations (LIMO), and mine-laying missions. Its primary role will be to safeguard India’s critical maritime approaches and counter underwater threats in littoral regions.According to the Ministry of Defence, Mahe was delivered to the Indian Navy on October 23, 2025, ahead of its commissioning. At approximately 78 metres in length and displacing around 1,100 tons, the platform integrates torpedo systems and multifunctional anti-submarine rockets, giving it significant capability for underwater combat and area denial.With over 80 percent indigenous content, the Mahe-class ships represent a major leap in India’s quest for self-reliance in naval ship design and production. The vessel’s crest features the Urumi—the flexible sword of Kalarippayattu—symbolizing the same agility, precision, and lethal grace that define the ship’s operational character.Named after the historic coastal town of Mahe on the Malabar Coast, INS Mahe heralds the arrival of a new generation of Indian-built shallow-water combatants—sleek, swift, and resolutely Indian. Seven more ships of this class will follow, further bolstering the Navy’s capabilities in coastal defence and anti-submarine warfare.","The Indian Navy is set to achieve a new milestone in its drive toward self- reliance with the commissioning of INS Mahe.

When giving is a way of life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-giving-is-a-way-of-life/articleshow/116900675.cms,"(Know about any such inspiring story? Share it with us at changebegins-here@timesofindia.com)

Pranav Sontakke, a banker from Maharashtra’s Amravati district, has shown that one doesn’t need pots of money to give back to society.Growing up in a modest household, his schoolteacher parents had instilled in him the belief that true wealth isn’t measured in money, but in the ability to give.“We’re not rich, but we’ve always been content with what we had,” says the 33-year-old. His journey into philanthropy began almost by accident, five years ago, during a govt fellowship programme, when he worked on India’s first Digital Village project. It was there that he saw first-hand the power of education to transform communities.“Education empowers people,” he says, “and for tribals, it’s a way to uplift entire communities.” Even with a steady job, Sontakke couldn’t forget the families he’d worked with. So, he started channelling his earnings into setting up free libraries and coaching centres for tribal students.Then there’s Gurgaon-based Parag Agarwal, who, after a long career in the corporate sector, including a stint as an adviser at Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, felt increasingly drawn to social causes.“Maybe it was my exposure to Buddhism and meditation. Also, the suffering of children always troubled me,” he reflects, remembering how he would drive past children begging on the streets with his son beside him. “I knew I had to do something for them.”Agarwal went on to start a foundation focused on education for disadvantaged children before a shift in perspective that led him to champion the cause of animal welfare, after he watched videos shared by his niece on the treatment of animals in dairy and leather industries. “It felt like a neglected cause, and I knew I needed to do more to protect animals,” he says.The Good Samaritan streaks in both Sontakke and Agarwal were fuelled by this community called Living My Promise (LMP) that encourages Indians with a net worth of Rs 1 crore or more to pledge at least 50% of their wealth to causes close to their hearts.In 2019, Sontakke and Agarwal joined LMP. Sontakke’s foundation now supports schools with water coolers and digital boards and has helped tribal students secure spots in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, to prevent migration from disrupting their education.Meanwhile, Agarwal is determined to bring both capital and talent into creating an ecosystem where “animals are treated with the same respect as humans,” he says.As Gunjan Thaney, head of LMP puts it: “We want to show that anyone can give back and make a real impact.” She described how the idea quickly snowballed into a movement by word of mouth and a mutual belief in giving back. The stories of early members struck a chord and now there are 154 of them, going beyond the typical philanthropist circles.“The inspiration for LMP came from Warren Buffet and Bill Gates’ The Giving Pledge, which focuses on billionaires committing to give away most of their wealth. But LMP had a different approach. Conceived by founding promisor Girish Batra and four #DaanUtsav volunteers, it aimed to democratise philanthropy for both beginners and the seasoned,” explains Thaney.Unlike traditional philanthropy, LMP thrives on connections, not corporate structures. “The pledge isn’t legally binding, but a personal commitment to support causes of their choice, either during their lifetime or through their will. Once they join, members become part of a community and are encouraged to share their story publicly to inspire others,” says Thaney.“For most, it’s about wanting to give back in a way that goes beyond just providing for our families,” says Thaney.Interestingly, more than half — around 52% — of LMP members are women, many of whom have made this philanthropic pledge independent of their partners.“These women come from all walks of life and may or may not be single, but what sets them apart is their determination to take control of their finances and philanthropic journey,” Thaney adds.While LMP doesn’t directly suggest causes or organisations, it does connect members to NGOs based on their specific interests — only when they request it.The initiative is careful to remain non-judgmental and refrains from suggesting where to give or which organisations are ‘better.’ The idea is to respect the autonomy and personal motivations of each promisor.One of the standout efforts within the LMP community is the Bundelkhand Integrated Village Development initiative that tackles rural challenges in Uttar Pradesh head-on.Over two years, promisors have supported education for underprivileged children, introduced sustainable livelihoods through agroforestry, and developed a model village in Gaurahari, focused on women empowerment, skillbuilding, and healthcare.Some members have also co-created platforms such as Dolphin Tank (on the lines of Shark Tank) that gives micro grants to inspiring stories and led to unexpected partnerships with NGOs working on education, healthcare, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability.In 2021, Rs 24 lakhs from LMP’s Dolphin Tank helped launch a project with Navoday Foundation in Assam’s Tamulpur district —training women in mushroom cultivation. What started with 200 women, earning Rs 19.2 lakhs collectively, has now grown to 1,200 women, who together earn a staggering Rs 1.2 crore every month, totalling Rs 14 crore annually.","Pranav Sontakke, a banker from Maharashtra’s Amravati district, has shown that one doesn’t need pots of money to give back to society.

Agra's 1 7th-Century Mughal-era haveli razed by 'builder',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agras-17th-century-mughal-era-haveli-razed-by-builder/articleshow/116898547.cms,"Plaque at Agra site indicated Aurangzeb built the monument

AGRA: The 17th-century Mubarak Manzil , a Mughal heritage site also known as Aurangzeb 's Haveli, was largely demolished in Agra just three months after the state archaeological department issued a notification to protect the monument. Over 100 tractors of debris were removed from the site after the demolition drive, local residents said on Thursday. They say a builder, in connivance with officials, demolished it.Mubarak Manzil has a significant place in history, detailed in Austrian historian Ebba Koch's book 'The Complete Taj Mahal and the Riverfront Gardens of Agra'. Built during Aurangzeb's reign, it served as a residence for key Mughal figures, including Shah Jahan, Shuja and Aurangzeb. The structure was modified under British rule, becoming a customs house and salt office. By 1902, it was known as Tara Niwas.In September, the state archaeological department had issued a notification calling for objections to the site being declared a protected monument within a month, but none were raised. And two weeks ago, officials from Lucknow visited the site to initiate preservation measures. However, demolition began shortly after their visit, leaving the historic structure in ruins.Locals alleged that a builder, in connivance with police and administrative officials, carried out the demolition despite objections and the presence of a police outpost near the site along the Yamuna.A local resident, Kapil Vajpayee, told TOI, ""I filed several complaints with the authorities, but no action was taken. So far, 70% of the structure has been destroyed.""Agra DM Aravind Mallappa Bangari confirmed that the authorities were ""aware"" of the issue. ""We have taken cognisance of the matter. Archaeological Survey of India and the revenue department have been directed to conduct a probe. The sub-divisional magistrate has been asked to visit the site and present a report. Meanwhile, no further changes will be allowed at the site,"" Bangari said.Archibald Campbell Carlyle's 1871 report provided detailed insights into the architecture of Mubarak Manzil. A marble plaque at the site indicated it was built by Aurangzeb after his victory at the Battle of Samugarh. Historian Rajkishore Raje added that Aurangzeb renamed Dara Shikoh's palace to commemorate his triumph in the same battle.The 1868 map of Agra places Mubarak Manzil near the pontoon bridge, where the current iron bridge stands. During British rule, the East Indian Railway used it as a goods depot. The structure's red sandstone base, arched lower floors, and minarets reflected a mix of Mughal and British architectural influences.","Mubarak Manzil, a Mughal heritage site also known as Aurangzeb's Haveli, was largely demolished in Agra just three months after the state archaeological department issued a notification to protect the monument.

Government to probe recovery of Starlink devices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-probe-recovery-of-starlink-devices/articleshow/116898510.cms,"'Starlink has refused to provide details citing data privacy laws'



NEW DELHI: Starlink may be heading into fresh regulatory trouble in India with satellite communications devices of the Elon Musk-run company finding its way into the hands of insurgents and smugglers, raising red flags with the home ministry and the department of telecommunications.What has made the situation even more challenging for the government is that Starlink has refused to provide details of those who originally procured the devices, citing data privacy laws. Concerned over an alien, and illegal, communications channel being used by unlawful elements, MHA has now asked DoT to look into the matter immediately and take ""appropriate steps"", sources said. Questions sent to Starlink did not elicit a response.For Starlink, the recovery of satcom devices in India in the hands of unlawful elements comes at a time when the licence application of the company has been pending with government due to security issues.""Government had written to Starlink to know about the ownership of the devices after their recovery with drug smugglers in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, but the company has refused to provide details citing data privacy laws,"" said a source. Government acted after a probe into the biggest drug haul of 6,000kg of methamphetamine in the Andamans showed that smugglers from Myanmar were using the Starlink satellite internet services for navigation.Andamans DGP Hargobinder Singh Dhaliwal said the smugglers directly operated phones with satellites, creating a WiFi hotspot.In the other case in Manipur, Starlink satcom devices were found with insurgents during a raid by Army and Assam Rifles.When a user on X pointed out the recovery of equipment in Manipur and tagged Musk, the billionaire CEO denied operationalisation of the company's services, ""This is false. Starlink satellite beams are turned off over India."" There is a growing concern with the security establishment over instances of the devices finding their way into the hands of unlawful elements.Teams representing Starlink have been meeting officials in DoT and MHA, seeking clarification around any objections while giving out details around their plans. government officials said they have sought fresh details around ""security aspects"" from Starlink and added that permission will be given after government was satisfied with the measures taken to control illegal communication setups as well as data movement.","Starlink has refused to provide details of those who originally procured the devices, citing data privacy laws.

Iran offers help to Kerala nurse on Yemen death row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-offers-help-to-kerala-nurse-on-yemen-death-row/articleshow/116898420.cms,"A senior Iranian official said Thursday that Tehran was ready to take up the case of Nimisha Priya , a nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of a Yemeni national. ""We are ready to do whatever we can as it involves a humanitarian issue,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iran-backed Houthi rebels remain in control of large parts of Yemen, including capital Sanaa.After the Yemen president last month upheld the death sentence of Nimisha, in jail since 2017, India said it was in touch with her family members and was extending all possible help to them in exploring legal options.Iran's offer of help came ahead of another round of foreign office consultations with India in which Tehran is expected to call for revival of trade ties, including resumption of oil supplies to India. Unlike with Iran, India has not just continued to import crude from Russia despite international sanctions but also ramped up Russian supplies.The official also spoke about bilateral ties with India and the need to explore opportunities to enhance trade ties, despite the sanctions Iran is facing. ""We don't want to impose any hardship on India but there are opportunities that can be explored. The nature of sanctions against Iran and Russia are different but it's still a legitimate question why India has continued to import energy from Russia but not Iran. We need to see how this issue can be addressed,"" said the official.Speaking about the conflict in Gaza and the overall West Asia situation, the official said Israel's military actions in Gaza had only worked to further ""internationalise'' the Palestine issue. ""The core issue is the occupation of Palestine and it must be addressed. We want to see an independent Palestine state. Nobody can erase it from the global agenda,"" said the official, who also backed stronger counter-terrorism cooperation with India in the context of recent developments in Syria.Also read: 'Last-min pardon' the hope for kin of nurse on Yemen death row","Iran is ready to take up the case of Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of a Yemeni national.

Pay current market rate if land compensation delayed: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pay-current-market-rate-if-land-compensation-delayed-supreme-court/articleshow/116898328.cms,"Payout using '03 land rate would be travesty of justice, says SC

Supreme Court on Thursday employed its exclusive powers under Article 142 of Constitution to rule that landowners are entitled to current market value of their plots if payment of compensation for their land acquired by a government is delayed for a long time.The order, which will bring relief and adequate recompense to many farmers and others across the country, was triggered by a petition against Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board, which in 2003 notified the acquisition of thousands of acres of land to construct the Bengaluru-Mysuru Infrastructure Corridor project.While land parcels were taken over, no award for compensation to the owners was passed. It took contempt of court proceedings for the land acquisition officer to pass award for compensation in 2019. However, he based the compensation on rates prevalent in 2003.Ruling that the value of land must be computed as of '19, Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said, ""Right to property ceased to be a fundamental right by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978. However, it continues to be a human right in a welfare state, and a constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution.""Justice Gavai said the landowners have been deprived of their legitimate dues for almost 22 years and if the market value of the land is computed as of 2003, they would stand to lose considerably. ""It is, therefore, of utmost importance that the determination of the award and disbursal of compensation in case of acquisition of land should be made with promptitude,"" he said.In 2019, the landowners protested when the then land acquisition officer based the compensation on rates prevalent in 2003, but lost their challenge before a single judge of Karnataka HC. They appealed the adverse order, but a division bench ruled against them.Setting aside the concurrent judgments of the single judge and division bench of HC and holding Karnataka government and KIADB solely responsible for non-payment of compensation till now, the SC bench said, ""We find that it is a fit case wherein this courtshould direct shifting of the date for determination of the market value of the land in question of the appellants.""Gavai said, ""If the compensation to be awarded at the market value as of the year 2003 is permitted, it would amount to permitting a travesty of justice and making the constitutional provisions under Article 300A a mockery.""In the interest of justice, the bench ordered the land acquisition officer to compute the market value of the acquired land as on April 22, 2019. It permitted the land owners to challenge the award as per law, if they so wished.","The order will bring relief and adequate recompense to many farmers and others across the country.

The hill is also popular among nature lovers from Thane, Mumbai, and Navi Mumbai.With the start of the funicular train, the time taken to climb the 2,600 stairs to the hill will reduce from more than 2 hours now to 10 minutes, bringing much relief to senior citizens, the differently abled and children.An official said at a time, two funicular trains will operate on the route, and each has two compartments with a capacity for 120 passengers.A senior PWD official from the Thane division said, ""The work is complete, and all trials are done, including safety measures, and we have planned to inaugurate it on Jan 25 or Jan 26 in the new year.""There are around 70 staff members to operate and maintain the service.

After murder, Utkarsh typed suicide note on dad's phone to dodge cops

NAGPUR: A 21-year-old third-year engineering student, Utkarsh Dakhole , throttled his mother to death, waited with the body for around 2 hours, and then fatally stabbed his father when he returned to their New Khasala residence near Kamptee Road, on December 26.He was apparently angry over being told to shift to ITI after he failed his physics paper thrice.Utkarsh lied to his sister about their parents going on a meditation trip to Bengaluru, and kept her away from home at a relative's house, till the smell from the decomposing bodies led to the discovery of the gruesome crime on Wednesday. Utkarsh had also penned a fake suicide note, and saved a screenshot of it as a wallpaper, on his father's cellphone.The New Khasala area woke up on the first day of the new year to the news of the double murder of the Dakhole couple by their son. Sources said Utkarsh's father, Leeladhar, an employee with Koradi thermal power station, slapped him on December 25, asking him to give up engineering and shift to their native place at Bailwada. Leeladhar had also told Utkarsh to take admission in ITI, and take up farming on their ancestral agricultural land, as he had failed in physics paper for the last three years.Utkarsh's mother, Aruna, a teacher, too had relentlessly urged him to discontinue engineering. This had angered Utkarsh, who was the younger of two siblings. On December 26, Utkarsh's father had gone to attend some last rites, and his sister had gone to her college. Utkarsh first throttled his mother to death and left her body on the bed in the bedroom of the one-storeyed house.Utkarsh Dakhole (21) allegedly killed his parents at their New Khasala residence near Kamptee Road, on December 26. The crime reportedly stemmed from Utkarsh's anger after being told to shift to ITI following his failure in the physics paper for the third time in engineering.Utkarsh first throttled his mother, Aruna, to death and left her body on the bed in the bedroom. When his father, Leeladhar, returned home two hours later, Utkarsh attacked him from behind as he tried to enter the bathroom. Utkarsh stabbed him with a knife he purchased from Kamal Chowk.Police sources said Leeladhar, even after being stabbed, tried to calm his son down and sort out the matter. A profusely bleeding Leeladhar told Utkarsh to call his mother Aruna, so the three could sit together and discuss a solution. Utkarsh then allegedly revealed that he had murdered his mother.When Utkarsh asked whether his injured father still wanted him to withdraw from engineering college, Leeladhar apparently said he would still insist he discontinue. This was the point where Utkarsh pinned him down and stabbed him repeatedly until he fell motionless. After the murder, Utkarsh typed a suicide note on his father's cellphone and saved it as wallpaper.Utkarsh then called up his sister and picked her up at Automotive Square while on way back from her college. He told her that their parents had left for Bengaluru for a 10-day meditation camp as they got a good package deal.The brother and sister duo then went to their kin's residence at Bailwada. Utkarsh's sister tried calling their father, but his cellphone was switched off, which Utkarsh explained was because of the ban on mobiles at the meditation camp.On Thursday, Utkarsh got a call from the neighbours complaining of a strong stench from their house, which was locked from inside. The neighbours forced the door open after Utkarsh reached the place. The drawing room was found locked from outside.The neighbours were stunned to find Leeladhar dead in the drawing room, and Aruna in the bedroom. The cops were alerted. Kapil Nagar police station in-charge Mahesh Andhale and Zonal DCP Niketan Kadam too reached the place.A cop said, ""Utkarsh had switched off the timeline and location of his father's mobile phone and taken it with him. He placed the cellphone somewhere in the room on returning with the neighbours, and told them he just found it. Police were intrigued why the location service was turned off. Also, the drawing room was locked from outside. Hence, it could not have been a case of suicide. Utkarsh spilled the beans in just one hour when police grilled him.""Sources said Utkarsh tried to mislead the cops but could not explain many things, including his father's cellphone with the location turned off, and his lies about their whereabouts to his sister.","Utkarsh Dakhole, 21, allegedly killed his parents at their New Khasala residence near Kamptee Road, on December 26.

'Chacha will be voted out'



NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said he was ready to ""forgive and welcome"" Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to the opposition INDIA boc.""Our doors are open (for Nitish). He should also unbolt his gates. This would facilitate movement of people from both sides,"" Lalu Yadav said.Reacting to the RJD chief's remark, CM Nitish Kumar gave no affirmative response.""Kya bol rahe hain (What are you saying)"" was all the JD(U) boss said in response to queries from journalists about Prasad's fresh offer, according to news agency PTI.Meanwhile, former JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh ""Lalan"" snapped when asked about Lalu Yadav's remark.""The NDA is strong. JD(U) and BJP are united. It is a free society and anybody can say whatever he pleases. It is for Lalu ji to say more on his own utterances"", Lalan Singh said.Nitish Kumar, who ditched the INDIA bloc after spearheading its formation last year, joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.With the switch, though Nitish managed to remain the CM, RJD leader and Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav had to step down as his deputy.Just hours after he resigned, the Janata Dal (United) chief took oath as the chief minister for a record ninth time.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also took a dig at Lalu Yadav, saying his ""dream will always remain dreams (Mungeri Lal ke Haseen Sapne hi rahenge). They will never be fulfilled.""Things seemed to fare smoothly for the NDA until the opposition got a shot in the arms after the Lok Sabha poll results.In the parliamentary election, BJP missed out on the majority numbers as it won only 240 seats, 32 less than the halfway mark.Whereas, the JDU won 12 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and emerged as a key ally in the NDA, positioning Nitish Kumar as a crucial player in the ruling alliance.The BJP-led NDA at the Centre majorly hinges on the JDU and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, which won 16 seats for the ruling coalition to cross the majority figure of the 272 seats.If the table turns in Bihar, the INDIA bloc with 235 seats, would have a direct advantage of an additional 12 seats, an opportunity that the opposition has been eying since June 4 results.Unlike his father, Tejaswi Yadav was a little hard-hitting with his remark as he claimed that the new year will mark the ""departure"" of the CM Nitish-led NDA government in Bihar.Tejashwi Yadav, who is now leader of the opposition, was talking to reporters shortly after governor designate Arif Mohammad Khan left his house in Patna.""It is too cold. Keep yourselves warm but do not make any wild guesses. The new year will see a new harvest (nai fasal) and a new government that will be sensitive to the people's need for health, education and jobs (padhaai, kamaai, dawaai, sunwai aur karvaayi ki sarkaar),"" the RJD leader was quoted as saying by PTI.He added: ""In the new year, my uncle (chacha) Nitish Kumar will be voted out.

Poll Which of the following astronomical events are you most excited to witness in early January 2025? The January ‘SuperSun’ and Moon-planet conjunction The Quadrantid meteor shower

Why is it named Quadrantids?

Viewing details

The initial weekend of 2025 presents multiple astronomical occurrences, including a brief meteor display, a January 'SuperSun', and a twilight conjunction of the Moon and a planet.A remarkable celestial display welcomes New Year 2025, as the Quadrantids, visible from December 27 until January 16, reaches maximum intensity on January 3 and 4.A meteor shower is a celestial spectacle that occurs when Earth travels through cosmic debris trails. This natural phenomenon creates streaks of light in the night sky, often referred to as 'shooting stars' by observers.The debris originates primarily from comets, which shed particles as they orbit the sun. These particles, ranging from tiny dust grains to small rocks, remain in space along the comet's orbital path. When Earth intersects these debris trails during its annual orbit, the particles enter our atmosphere at extremely high speeds.While most meteor showers are annual events, their intensity can vary year to year. This variation occurs because Earth passes through different densities of debris trails during each encounter. Some years may produce exceptional displays when Earth passes through particularly dense regions of cosmic debris.Meteor showers are predictable events that occur at specific times each year. Each shower is named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to originate, known as the radiant point. For example, the Perseids appear to come from Perseus, while the Leonids seem to emerge from Leo.This shower's name derives from Quadrans Muralis, an obsolete 18th-century constellation, referencing the quadrant instrument historically used for celestial measurements. Contemporary observers locate the Quadrantids' radiant in Boötes constellation, near the Big Dipper in the northern sky. Discovered in 1825, the shower's source remained unknown until 2003, when a Lowell Observatory astronomer identified asteroid 2003 EH1 as its origin.The intensity of meteor showers varies significantly. Some showers produce only a few meteors per hour, while others can create spectacular displays with hundreds of meteors visible each hour. This rate is known as the Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR).The Quadrantid meteors reach their peak on Thursday, with calculations suggesting a ZHR of 80. Viewing conditions are favourable with a 27% waxing crescent Moon. The minimal lunar illumination creates excellent observation conditions for the 2025 'Quads'.The visibility of meteor showers depends on several factors. Dark skies are essential, as artificial light pollution can obscure the meteors. The phase of the moon also plays a crucial role - a new or crescent moon provides darker skies than a full moon. Weather conditions, particularly clear skies, are vital for optimal viewing.The best viewing time is typically between midnight and dawn, when your location on Earth faces the direction of Earth's orbit. This timing means more meteors are likely to be visible as they enter the atmosphere.Meteors may appear any night, but showers occur when Earth passes through comet or asteroid debris orbiting the sun. These particles, sometimes minuscule, create luminous streaks whilst burning in Earth's atmosphere.Annual meteor showers have predictable timeframes lasting days or weeks, with peak activity occurring during Earth's passage through the densest debris sections. Meteors appear to emanate from a single celestial point during observation.Peak activity occurs between 15.00-18.00 Universal Time (UT) on Friday, providing optimal viewing for northern Pacific observers at dawn.North American and European observers should consider watching during the early hours of Friday and Saturday, as peak timing may vary. However, its peak time in India will be on the night between Thursday and Friday.","The Quadrantids meteor shower will be visible from December 27 until January 16.

""J&K and Ladakh Through the Ages""

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that Article 370 had ""sown the seeds of separatism in the valley"", which ultimately evolved into terrorism. Praising the Modi government's ""strong resolution"" that led to the abrogation of the article, Shah described the decision as the catalyst for establishing a ""Naya Kashmir "".Speaking at the launch of the book, Shah said, ""Article 370 sowed the seeds of separatism in the valley which later turned into terrorism. Article 370 spread a myth that the connection between Kashmir and India is temporary. There was terrorism there for decades and the country kept watching. After the abrogation of Article 370 , terrorism is reduced by 70%. Congress can accuse us of whatever they want.""He further described these articles as major roadblocks to Kashmir's unity with the nation and hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's leadership in abrogating Articles 370 and 35A, which also helped revitalise the languages of Kashmir through the creation of two Union Territories.""We not only controlled the terrorism, but the PM Modi government also demolished the terror eco-system from the valley. Article 370 and 35A, were the articles that stopped the unison of Kashmir with the rest of the country. PM Modi's strong resolution abrogated Article 370. This began the development of Kashmir along with the rest of the country,"" Shah said.""I want to thank PM Modi for giving a new life to the languages of Kashmir by making two Union Territories. PM Modi insisted that every language spoken in Kashmir should be given importance and has to be included. This proves how a PM of any country can be sensitive towards the languages of the country,"" he added.He further asserted that Kashmir is also ""known as the land of Kashyap. It may be possible that it may have been named after him.""According to Shah the bookpresents all factors in detail, from ""the art in the ruins of old temples that proves that Kashmir is a part of India only. All the history from Buddhism, to demolished temples, to the use of Sanskrit, to the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, to Dogra reign, to the mistakes made after 1947 and to their rectification, all the 8000 years of history are included in this book.""On August 5, 2019, Modi government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and reorganised the region into two Union Territories. This decision sparked a huge political and social transformation in a region that had enjoyed special rights since Independence.Earlier speaking to news agency ANI, chief minister Omar Abdullah commented on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir's statehood, stating, ""The BJP should talk about the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir if they are so worried about the state.""","Union home minister Amit Shah said that Article 370 had ""sown the seeds of separatism in the valley"", which ultimately evolved into terrorism.

BHOPAL/INDORE: Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal for a disposal plant in Pithampur, 230km away, on Wednesday night, even as workers of other factories in the industrial estate near Indore voiced concern about their safety.""Transportation to Pithampur has begun. The convoy has been fortified with the highest security protocol ever witnessed in movement of industrial waste in the country,"" said MP gas relief & rehabilitation department director Swatantra Kumar Singh.TOI had reported Wednesday that the trucks were loaded and ready to move. At 9pm, the convoy carrying 337 metric tons of waste in sealed containers set out from Bhopal, escorted by police and emergency vehicles along a green corridor.Forty years of wait and four days of suspense had ended. The scars of the world's worst industrial disaster may never heal, but a chapter from the tragic episode is drawing to a close. It would take about seven hours to reach the final destination, said Singh.The convoy of 40 vehicles stretched over a kilometre. Twelve trucks are carrying the hazardous cargo. It's a no-halt, no-stop journey to Pithampur Waste Management Pvt Ltd, where the waste will be incinerated. Five district administrations are on high alert. Around 700 security personnel have been deployed for the convoy.""The 337 MT of UCIL waste will undergo scientific disposal within three to nine months,"" said Singh.It took strong words from Madhya Pradesh HC to get the administration moving on the long-pending disposal of this toxic waste. ""Are you waiting for another tragedy,"" a division bench of Chief Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Vivek Jain had asked the authorities in their Dec 3 order. HC set a deadline of four weeks to shift the hazardous waste for disposal.Singh has repeatedly assured all safety factors have been taken care of and there is no risk to the environment, land, or people around the disposal plant at Pithampur.On Wednesday, aiming to ease anxiety among Pithampur residents and industrialists about the Union Carbide waste disposal, MP pollution control board regional officer in Indore Shriniwas Dwivedi issued a video statement explaining the safety precautions. ""A special shed has been created with a concrete floor. It is leakproof,"" Dwivedi says in the video, adding: ""No activity will be carried out that will affect the people, farm, property, land or environment.""At Pithampur, however, workers at other plants are worried about potential fallout. ""Employees are scared. We are receiving calls from family members of our employees enquiring about the situation in Pithampur. Some employees have requested leave. The circumstances are extraordinary and everyone is under immense pressure,"" said Dr Darshan Kataria, an industrialist at Pithampur.Another industrialist from Pithampur Sector 2, where the waste disposal factory is situated, said he has lost count of calls made to various govt departments and fellow industrialists regarding contingency measures.""What occurred in Bhopal was an unfortunate accident, but what is happening now can be handled by taking everyone in confidence. It presents a difficult situation and is deeply unsettling for us as we cannot be immune to the problem,"" said Rajendra Modi, director of an engineering products manufacturing unit in Pithampur.Local industrialists say govt officials neither initiated discussions with them nor apprised them about safety measures implemented for industries and residents in proximity to the disposal facility.Swatantra Kumar Singh has, through public statements, repeatedly allayed safety concerns and assured disposal and incineration shall be conducted under expert supervision without any adverse consequences.",Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal.

They are sending goons and murderers across the border. This is an inside job by the BSF, supported by a blueprint from the central government. Without such a plan, these activities would not be possible,” the chief minister said.Banerjee warned that if such activities persisted, her party would stage protests against the BSF.""People are entering through BSF Islampur, through Sitai, through Chopra, we have news. Why are you not protesting? The border is in the hands of the BSF. If anyone thinks that they are intruding into Bengal and maligning the Trinamool, let them be warned that the Trinamool Congress does not do these things. Don’t abuse Trinamool by supporting the wrongdoings of BSF,” Banerjee said, as reported by ANI.Her remarks come amidst a growing political slugfest over border management and allegations of partisanship.Banerjee also added that she had repeatedly raised her concerns with the central government but claimed her warnings were ignored. She stated that while the TMC would adhere to the government’s decisions, it would not hesitate to oppose actions that threaten the state’s peace and stability.Meanwhile, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari accused the West Bengal government of obstructing efforts to acquire land for building BSF outposts along the Bangladesh border earlier this week. Adhikari alleged that the state government’s lack of cooperation with the Centre and the ministry of home affairs was hindering national security .“I gave out the details of how non-cooperation is being done (by the state government) with the Centre and MHA... Joint meetings are not being held, no coordination with central government agencies, and police released all the 1,500 intruders arrested by BSF last year and 1,000 this year,” Adhikari claimed. He further accused the state of withholding land for 17 proposed BSF outposts and using the assembly to pass resolutions against the BSF.Adhikari’s allegations extended to the state’s handling of transborder crime. He alleged that many criminals operating across the border are allegedly shielded by the ruling party. “Politics should be stopped for the sake of the country and the Bengali community,” he said, urging the state to prioritize collaboration with the central government.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has accused the Border Security Force ( BSF ) of aiding infiltrators to enter India to destabilise the state.Banerjee warned that if such activities persisted, her party would stage protests against the BSF.

Slightly more rainfall than normal in Jan, forecasts IMD

NEW DELHI: 2024 was by far the warmest year on record in the country since 1901, IMD said Wednesday. It also noted that the last three months of the year (Oct-Dec) together were the warmest on record whereas Oct 2024, individually, was the warmest month in 123 years.With an annual mean temperature of 25.75 degrees Celsius, 2024 was 0.65 degree C above the long-term average (1991-2020 period). The previous warmest year, 2016, had an anomaly of 0.54 degree C. As annual averages go, the difference of 0.11 degree C between the mean temperature in 2016 and 2024 is quite huge.The record heat in India was in sync with worldwide rise in annual average temperatures as global warming accelerates. World Meteorological Organisation has observed that 2024 was globally the warmest year on record, exceeding the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degrees C of warming above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time. This follows on from the record-breaking 1.45 degrees C rise in 2023, the previous globally warmest year on record.Releasing the outlook for January, IMD said monthly minimum (night) temperatures are likely to be ""above normal"" (warmer) over most of India except parts of UP and Rajasthan, some parts of MP and Gujarat and portions of east India such as Bihar, where normal to below normal temperatures are likely.IMD chief M Mohapatra, however, said ""above-normal cold wave days"" are expected over western and northern parts of central India during the month of Jan.Specifically asked about the weather situation in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh (Jan 13-Feb 26), Mohapatra said though there was a possibility of below normal (colder) minimum (night) temperature during the period, IMD would provide more precise forecast closer to the religious festival.Probabilistic forecast map for Jan, released by Met department, shows the possibility of colder day and night (normal to below normal minimum/maximum temperatures) in the region, Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, during the month.Otherwise, the monthly maximum (day) temperatures for Jan are likely to be above normal (warmer) for ""most parts of the country except some parts of the northwest, central and adjoining east India and central parts of South Peninsula"" where it is likely to be normal to below normal.As far as rainfall is concerned, Jan is likely to witness slightly more rainfall than normal rains for the month - a situation which may be helpful for the standing rabi (winter sown) crops during the period if its distribution is uniform.IMD said, ""Monthly rainfall for Jan over north India consisting of seven meteorological subdivisions (East Uttar Pradesh, West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) is most likely to be above normal,""It said the monthly rainfall even over the country in Jan is also most likely to be above normal. ""Above-normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country except some parts of northwest India and some pockets of the northeast and central India where normal to below normal rainfall is likely,"" said Met department.","2014 was by far the warmest year on record in the country since 1901, IMD says.

Who was Sree Narayana Guru?

NEW DELHI: Congress leader V D Satheesan on Wednesday criticized Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan 's statement on Sanatana Dharma , saying it attempted to associate the concept exclusively with the Sangh Parivar.Satheesan said Sanatana Dharma is a part of cultural heritage , including Advaita philosophy, the teachings of the Vedas, and the Upanishads. ""Claiming that all of this belongs to the Sangh Parivar is misleading,"" Satheesan told reporters after an event at the Sivagiri pilgrimage.Attending a Sivagiri pilgrimage conference, Vijayan had warned against efforts to portray Sree Narayana Guru , who advocated ""one caste, one religion, and one God,"" as a supporter of Sanatana Dharma. Vijayan described Sanatana Dharma as varnashrama dharma, a caste-based system that Guru opposed.Satheesan compared Vijayan’s remarks to suggesting that all who visit temples, wear saffron, or use sandalwood paste belong to the RSS. ""Handing over Sanatana Dharma and its legacy to the Sangh Parivar is incorrect. What the chief minister said is wrong,"" Satheesan said. He added that Hinduism, like other religions, has faced misuse by priesthoods and monarchies but said dismissing Sanatana Dharma or associating it solely with the Sangh Parivar is inaccurate.""We do not support the varna-ashrama or chaturvarnya system. Even Sree Narayana Guru has explained the essence of Sanatana Dharma in detail. It is not right to dismiss Sanatana Dharma entirely or claim that it exclusively belongs to the Sangh Parivar,"" Satheesan said.Satheesan argued that Sanatana Dharma is not communal and that it has been misinterpreted and misrepresented by the Chief Minister. ""His portrayal is inaccurate. In the past, people used to talk about 'saffronisation,' which was also misunderstood and misused. Driving all Hindus into the RSS fold through such narratives is not the right approach. This is not what should be done,"" he said.Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief K Sudhakaran also responded, alleging an attempt to ""hijack"" Sree Narayana Guru's ideals and legacy. ""There is an effort to confine Sree Narayana Guru, who proclaimed 'One Caste, One Religion, One God,' within the frameworks of chaturvarnya and varna-ashrama under the guise of Sanatana Dharma,"" he said, adding that the Guru’s teachings cannot be surrendered to such narratives.""Guru was never a propagator or practitioner of Sanatan Dharma. Instead, he was someone who tried to reconstruct Sanatan Dharma for the new age,"" Vijayan had said, adding, ""Guru was someone who stood against casteism. His new age dharma was not something defined by religion but rooted in the betterment of people, irrespective of their religion. Tying (him) within the framework of Sanatan Dharma would be a sin against Guru.""Widely respected in Kerala for combining spiritual teachings with social reform, Sree Narayana Guru's philosophy, originating in the early 20th century, is rooted in Advaita Vedanta. This doctrine emphasizes ""non-duality,"" asserting that the ""ultimate reality"" or ""Brahman"" is singular and indivisible, and that the ""individual self"" or ""Atman"" is unified with this universal essence.Guru's transformative message, ""One Caste, One Religion, One God for Man,"" challenged societal norms and promoted the opening of consecrated temples to people of all castes.","Congress leader V D Satheesan criticized Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan's statement on Sanatana Dharma.

However, the law officers said no other country has provided for free treatment of SMA as the therapy has not been medically sanctified as fruitful by experts.They said Delhi high court had ordered that treatment of all SMA afflicted children be borne by Centre, but Supreme Court has recently stayed it given the huge financial strain that would be caused to the exchequer. The bench agreed that the treatment would be given free of cost till further orders and that it would examine later the policy of free treatment to such patients.","Court said free treatment of the child should continue unhindered at Army R&R hospital.

"From 25 in 2023 to 15 in 2024, proactive efforts cut CISF suicides by 40%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-25-in-2023-to-15-in-2024-proactive-efforts-cut-cisf-suicides-by-40/articleshow/116895031.cms,"NEW DELHI: Proactive measures taken by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to address suicidal tendencies among its jawans - including direct communication with the commanding officer, counselling and a posting policy that maintains work-life balance - brought about a 40% decline in suicides within the force from 25 in 2023 to 15 in 2024.This is for the first time in the last five years that CISF's suicide rate, at 9.8 per lakh personnel in 2024, has fallen below the national rate of 12.4 per lakh, as per the latest NCRB data on central armed police forces (CAPFs). Since 2020, 730 suicides were reported across different CAPFs, Assam Rifles and NSG, of which CISF accounted for 105. The suicide rate in CISF, which peaked at 18.1 per lakh personnel in 2022, fell to 16.9 per lakh in 2023 and to 9.8 per lakh in 2024. A key initiative to address suicidal tendencies among CISF personnel, is the new posting policy aimed at improving work-life balance.With a recent study revealing that 2/3rd of all the personnel grievances were related to posting matters that also affect their personal life, the HR policy notified last month offers the jawans choice-based postings. ""The policy will affect the non-gazetted staff that constitutes 98% of CISF manpower. It also caters to the needs of working women, married couples and personnel nearing retirement,"" said a CISF spokesperson. Another step taken by CISF is personalised engagement through regular visits by commanding officers to duty posts.Company commanders are also holding daily ""briefing-debriefing"" to promptly identify and address any signs of distress among jawans. Project Mann - a mental health support helpline that allows 24x7 tele-counselling and personal counselling - has seen 4,200 jawans use the facility until September 2024.","This is for the first time in the last five years that CISF's suicide rate, at 9.8 per lakh personnel in 2024, has fallen below the national rate of 12.4 per lakh.

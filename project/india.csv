LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Thursday launched a sharp attack on the Samajwadi Party , accusing it of exploiting Dalits for political gains under the guise of its recent PDA (Pichhde, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) campaign. In a series of posts on X, the BSP leader said that the SP, much like other parties, was attempting to incite tension and violence by using Dalits as political tools.""It is well known that like other parties, SP too is trying to create an atmosphere of tension and violence by pushing forward Dalit individuals from their party. The controversial statements, blame games, and programmes being run under this strategy reflect their deeply selfish political motives,"" Mayawati wrote.She went on to warn the Dalit community , as well as backward and Muslim communities, against falling for SP's tactics.""SP can go to any extent for Dalit votes. Therefore, along with Dalits, backward and Muslim communities should also avoid being misled by them and falling prey to their political tricks,"" she stated.In her third post, Mayawati advised against attacking icons of other communities and instead encouraged focus on educating Dalits about their own history, referring to the controversy stoked by SP Rajya Sabha MP Ramji Lal Suman's remarks on Rajput ruler Rana Sanga.""Also, instead of opportunistic Dalits associated with such parties making comments on the history of others, if they enlighten people about the saints, gurus, and great personalities of their own community and their struggles, then that would be appropriate' because it is through this that people become truly capable,"" she said.The BSP chief's remarks come amidst a renewed pitch by the Samajwadi Party to consolidate support among backward classes, Dalits, and minorities in Uttar Pradesh.","Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati accuses Samajwadi Party of exploiting Dalits for political gains.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar on Wednesday DGP Rajeev Kumar at Bhawani Bhawan in Kolkata, accompanied by victims of recent violence incidents in Murshidabad. After the meeting, Majumdar claimed that the ""call for riots was given from the loudspeaker of the masjid.""""... According to the victims, the call for riots was given from the loudspeaker of the masjid,"" BJP leader said, citing victims' accounts.Taking aim at Trinamool Congress-led state government, Majumdar further added, ""... The provocative statement made by Tawha Siddique is very shameful. This mentality is increasing with their percentage increase and change in demographics. This mentality is because they are being sheltered by Mamata Banerjee's government.""He said that a BJP-led government would not tolerate the misuse of religious institutions. ""If the BJP comes to power, the party will ban any religious place used for such activities,"" he said.The Union minister also alleged that the Popular Front of India (PFI) was active in Murshidabad, yet no arrests had been made by the state police. ""The victims of the violence have travelled a long way to reach Kolkata to tell the world what happened in Murshidabad,"" he added.Majumdar claimed that many residents from the violence-hit areas of Murshidabad and Shamsherganj have fled to Malda and are now living in refugee camps. ""After the riots in Murshidabad's Shamsherganj, people migrated to Malda and are living in refugee camps. 11 people from there have come here to express their pain and suffering before the people of the state,"" he told ANI.The violence reportedly erupted on April 11 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act—a controversial law that has drawn criticism in parts of the state. In response, over 150 people have been arrested, and police presence has been strengthened in areas including Samserganj and Dhuliyan.Earlier on the same day, leader of opposition in Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari accused TMC leaders of orchestrating the communal violence . In a video statement shared on X, he named Dhulian Municipality chairman Md Inzamul Haque as a ""key instigator"".""There is clear evidence in the video that this person is involved in the riots. He should be arrested immediately and severely punished for this heinous crime. Why are they being left out?"" Adhikari said.He alleged a broader conspiracy, saying, ""From Mothabari to Dhulian, Trinamool Congress leaders are the main conspirators and catalysts of anti-Hindu riots. Such toxic politics of the Trinamool Congress is just an attempt to endanger Hindus and enrich their vote bank.""""They are the ones who are disturbing the peace by spreading hatred in society and inciting fundamentalists. Their hate speech and activities are directly responsible for creating riots. It is time to unmask these rioters!"" he added.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a meeting with Muslim clerics in Kolkata, amid the ongoing protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.","West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar on Wednesday DGP Rajeev Kumar at Bhawani Bhawan in Kolkata, accompanied by victims of recent violence incidents in Murshidabad.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, outlining concern over the sudden cancellation of the Private Haj quota and urging PM to ""take up the matter with Saudi Arabia immediately"" to resolve the issue.In his letter, Stalin drew attention to the distress faced by thousands of Indian Muslim pilgrims , including many from Tamil Nadu, who had been preparing for the upcoming Haj pilgrimage.""I am writing this letter to bring to your attention a matter of urgent concern regarding the sudden cancellation of the Private Haj quota that is causing significant distress among thousands of Indian Muslim pilgrims, including many from Tamil Nadu, who are eagerly preparing for the upcoming Haj pilgrimage,"" Stalin said in the letter.He also highlighted the spiritual importance of Haj, saying, ""As you are aware, the Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam, representing a deeply sacred and once-in-a-lifetime religious duty for Muslims. The pilgrimage holds immense spiritual significance, and pilgrims often spend their lifetime savings to undertake this journey. This year, the Haj is expected to take place from June 4 to June 9, with pilgrims likely to begin their travel to Saudi Arabia in the month of May 2025.""The chief minister provided context on the current year's arrangements, stating that around 1.75 lakh Indian pilgrims had participated in the Haj pilgrimage in 2024.""During 2024, around 1,75,000 Indian Pilgrims partook in Haj pilgrimage. In January 2025, India signed a bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia, finalising a quota of 1,75,025 pilgrims. The said quota was divided into a ratio of 70:30 among State Haj Committees and Private Haj Tour Operators. Accordingly, State Haj Committees were allotted 122,517 seats, and Private Haj Tour Operators were allotted 52,507 seats for Haj 2025. I am given to understand that there has been a sudden reduction in India's Haj quota by Saudi Arabia; approximately 52,000 Haj seats earmarked for private Haj tour operators have been cancelled. This abrupt decision has left many pilgrims, who have already completed payments, in a state of deep anxiety and uncertainty,"" he wrote.Stalin concluded the letter by requesting the Prime Minister's prompt involvement to help restore the quota and provide relief to the affected pilgrims.""Considering the gravity of this situation, I request that the matter be taken up with the authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urgently and seek an expeditious remedy. I am sure that your intervention will restore the Haj quota and provide reassurance to the pilgrims and their families,"" he added.Several Muslim pilgrims and community leaders have also sought PM Modi's intervention after minority affairs ministry confirmed that 42,000 applicants won't be able to perform Haj in June this year.","Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

SC on Urdu use: Language shouldn't divide society,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-on-urdu-use-language-shouldnt-divide-society/articleshow/120361050.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: At a time when language has become politicised, with incidents of people being attacked in several states for not speaking the local language, Supreme Court has said India's linguistic diversity should be celebrated and it should not cause divisions. It said language was not related to any religion and Urdu was as much an Indian language as Hindi and Marathi, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. SC upheld use of Urdu, along with Marathi, on a signboard of Patur municipal council in Maharashtra's Akola district.T he court said there was a misconception that Urdu was alien to India and observed that it was “pitiable” to consider Hindi as the language of Hindus and Urdu of Muslims, a ploy used by the colonial powers to divide the country. “The prejudice against Urdu stems from the misconception that Urdu is alien to India. This opinion, we are afraid, is incorrect as Urdu, like Marathi and Hindi, is an IndoAryan language. It is a language which was born in this land. Urdu developed and flourished in India due to the need for people belonging to different cultural milieus who wanted to exchange ideas and communicate amongst themselves. Over the centuries, it attained ever greater refinement and became the language of choice for many acclaimed poets,” a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandra said.“Language is not religion. Language does not even represent religion. Language belongs to a community, to a region, to people; and not to a religion. Language is culture. Language is the yardstick to measure the civilisational march of a community and its people. So is the case of Urdu, which is the finest specimen of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, or the Hindustani tehzeeb, which is the composite cultural ethos of the plains of northern and central India,” the bench said.Noting that a petitioner fought a legal battle against Urdu for the last five years before Bombay HC and SC, the court said the petitioner’s misconception over the issue of language should be addressed as many other people may also have the same feeling. The court said language was a medium for exchange of ideas that brought people holding diverse views and beliefs closer and it should not become a cause of their division.The bench said even today, the Hindi used by common people was replete with Urdu words, even if one was not aware of it. “It would not be incorrect to say that one cannot have a day-today conversation in Hindi without using words of Urdu or words derived from Urdu. The word ‘Hindi’ itself comes from the Persian word ‘Hindavi’. This exchange of vocabulary flows both ways because Urdu also has many words borrowed from other Indian languages, including Sanskrit,” it said. The court said Urdu and Hindi were not two languages as per linguists and literary scholars and if Urdu was criticised, it was also a criticism of Hindi in a way. It expressed concern over deterioration of Hindustani language which is a mix of various languages including Hindi and Urdu .“This is not an occasion to have an elaborate discussion on the rise and fall of Urdu, but this much can be stated that this fusion of Hindi and Urdu met a roadblock in the form of puritans on both sides and Hindi became more Sanskritised and Urdu more Persian. A schism exploited by the colonial powers in dividing the two languages on religion. Hindi was now understood to be the language of Hindus and Urdu of Muslims, which is such a pitiable digression from reality; from unity in diversity; and the concept of universal brotherhood,” the bench said. “We must respect and rejoice in our diversity, including our many languages. India has more than 100 major languages,” it added. The court said if people or a group of people residing within the area covered by the Patur municipal council were familiar with Urdu, then there should not be any objection if Urdu was used in addition to the official language, ie, Marathi, at least on the signboard of the municipal council.","Supreme Court of India said language was not related to any religion.

What did SC say?



On Bengal violence



'Waqf by user is an established practice of Islam'



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard a batch of petitions against the Waqf (Amendment) Act and various points of contention concerning the law, including "" waqf by user "", inclusion of non-Muslims on the board and also the violence in Bengal's Murshidabad that broke out during the protest against the law.During the hearing, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna-led bench, which included Justices Sanjay Kumar and KV Viswanathan, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the Centre, on how ""waqf by user"" can be disallowed as many will not have the requisite documents to get such waqfs registered.The phrase ""Waqf by user"" refers to land or property that has been treated as waqf over time through continuous public or religious use, even if no formal waqf deed exists.""How will you register such waqfs by user? What documents will they have? It will lead to undoing something. Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also. I have gone through privy council judgments also. Waqf by user is recognised. If you undo it then it will be a problem. Legislature cannot declare a judgment, order or decree as void. You can only take the basis,"" the bench said, according to news agency PTI.""The properties declared by courts as waqfs should not be de-notified as waqfs, whether they are by waqf-by-user or waqf by deed, while the court is hearing the challenge to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025,"" the bench added.Mehta submitted that there was a large section of Muslims who did not want to be governed by Waqf act.The bench then asked Mehta, ""Are you saying that from now on you will allow Muslims to be part of the Hindu endowment boards. Say it openly.""The apex court said that when a public trust was declared to be a Waqf 100 or 200 years ago, it couldn't suddenly be taken over by the waqf board and declared otherwise.""You cannot rewrite the past,"" the bench said.Mehta submitted that a joint parliamentary committee had 38 sittings and examined 98.2 lakh memorandums before Parliament's both houses passed it.The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the violence occurring during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 is ""very disturbing"".""One thing that is very disturbing is the violence that is taking place. If the matter is pending here then it should not happen,"" the CJI said.Echoing a similar sentiment, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said, ""They (protesters) think they can pressurise the system by this.""At least three people were killed and hundreds were rendered homeless in communal violence in parts of Murshidabad district, mainly Suti, Samserganj, Dhulian and Jangipur, on April 11 and 12 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, opposing Waqf Act, said Waqf by user was an established practice of Islam and couldn't be taken away.Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioners referred to Waqf Amendment Act and said was challenging the provision that says only Muslims could create Waqf.""How can state decide whether, and how I am a Muslim or not and hence, eligible to create Waqf?""

What SC said on inclusion of non-Muslim in Waqf council?



What SC said on violent protests against Waqf Act?



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard multiple petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.It noted that undoing ""waqf by user"" would create several issues and sought the central government's reply to over 100 petitions challenging the Act. However, it refused to put a stay on the operation of the law.On inclusion of non-Muslim members in the Central and state Waqf boards, the apex court asked if the BJP-led Centre would ""allow Muslims to be part of Hindu religious trusts"". It ruled that ex-officio members could be appointed regardless of religion but others had to be Muslims.The court is set to hear the matter at 2pm on Thursday.The top court noted that most of the mosques were built during 14th and 15th century and and producing a ""registered deed"" was impossible.""Many of the masjids are created in 14th or 15th centuries. To require them to produce a registered deed is impossible. Most of the cases, say Jama Masjid Delhi, the waqf will be waqf-by-user,"" CJI Sanjiv Khanna said. ""If you are going to de-notify waqf-by-user properties, it will be an issue,"" he added.Kapil Sibal had argued that the abolition of the 'waqf by user' provision struck at the core of religious practice, asserting, ""Its my integral part of religion, its recognised in Ram Janbhoomi judgment. Problem is, they will say if a waqf is created 3000 years ago, they will ask for deed.""The removal of the provision is another point of contention driving the anti-Waqf protests . Under the Waqf Act of 1954, properties could be designated as waqf if they had long been used for religious or charitable purposes, even in the absence of official documentation. The amendment does away with this classification, raising concerns and ambiguity over the legal status of many such properties.The apex court has sought clarification over non-Muslim members in the Waqf council. ""Will you allow Muslims to be part of Hindu religious trusts,"" it asked. It said that ex-officio members could be appointed regardless of their faith but others members had to be Muslims.According to the Act, in the Central Waqf Council, up to two of the 22 appointed (non-ex officio) members may be individuals from non-Muslim communities. State Waqf Boards may include up to two non-Muslim members among the 11 appointed (non-ex officio) positions.Addressing the anti-Waqf protests that turned violent in Bengal's Murshidabad killing three, SC said that it was ""very disturbed"".""Once Supreme Court is seized of the matter, this should not happen,"" the CJI said.Violent protests erupted in Murshidabad on April 11 over the contentious Waqf (Amendment) Act, leading to the deaths of three individuals, injuries to many others, and significant property damage.According to the West Bengal Police, 150 people have been arrested so far in connection with the violence, and security has been stepped up with heavy police deployment in affected areas such as Samserganj and Dhuliyan.The BJP-led central government recently notified the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, following its passage in Parliament amid intense debates in both houses. The bill received President Droupadi Murmu’s assent on April 5. It was approved in the Lok Sabha with 288 votes in favour and 232 against, while in the Rajya Sabha, it passed with 128 members supporting and 95 opposing it.However, a total of 72 petitions have been filed challenging the validity of the Act. Petitioners include AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi , the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the DMK, and Congress MPs Imran Pratapgarhi and Mohammad Jawed. In response, the Centre filed a caveat in the Supreme Court on April 8, requesting to be heard before any orders are issued.","Supreme Court on Wednesday heard multiple petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.

Waqf by user "" refers to a practice where a property is recognised as a religious or charitable endowment (waqf) based on its long-term, uninterrupted use for such purposes, even if there isn't a formal, written declaration of waqf by the owner.2) The Amendment Act provision stating that a Waqf property would not be considered as Waqf during a Collector's inquiry into government land status should not be implemented.3) ""All Members of the waqf boards and central waqf Council must be Muslims, except the ex-officio members.""The court questioned the registration process for waqfs by user and the documentation requirements.

Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also. I have gone through privy council judgments also. Waqf by user is recognised. If you undo it then it will be a problem.

Poll Should the government have the authority to determine the eligibility of individuals to create waqf? No, it infringes on personal rights. Yes, it ensures regulations.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre whether Muslims would now be allowed to be part of Hindu religious trusts , as it heard a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.A bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan raised several questions on the Act, particularly about the practice of "" waqf by user "", where a property is considered waqf based on long-standing religious or charitable use, even without formal documentation.""How will you register such waqfs by user?

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday addressed the tense situation in Murshidabad district in her meeting with Imams. She also responded to the allegations pushed by the BJP leaders, which claimed TMC 's involvement in unrest over Waqf issue.Mamata hit back at the BJP-led Centre, alleging "" Communal riot in Murshidabad pre-planned.""“Had TMC been involved in the Waqf violence as claimed by the opposition, the houses of our leaders wouldn’t have been attacked,” she said. She also pointed out that the TMC had taken a strong stand in Parliament against the Waqf law. “TMC is at the forefront in the fight against the Waqf law,” Banerjee stated during a meeting with Imams.She added: ""Yesterday, I saw a tweet from ANI quoting the Home Ministry that Bangladesh is involved in this ( Murshidabad violence ). If this is true, the Central Govt is responsible for it. BSF takes care of the border and not the state govt. Why did you allow the people of BJP to come from outside, cause a disturbance and run away?""Taking aim at the Centre and sections of the media, Banerjee accused “godi media” of spreading misinformation and targeting Bengal unfairly. “The Centre hiked petrol and diesel prices, but some 'godi media' only speak against Bengal and against me,” she said, challenging critics to speak to her directly instead of spreading misinformation.She alleged that some media houses backed by the BJP had circulated fake videos to defame the state. “We have nabbed them... Out of eight videos, some are from Karnataka, some from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, or Rajasthan. They are tarnishing Bengal. They should be ashamed,” the CM said.Banerjee also questioned the central government’s record on employment and inflation: “They should answer how many youths have got jobs. The prices of medicines, petrol, and diesel have increased, but instead, they’re busy targeting Bengal with fake narratives.”Earlier in the day, the BJP sharpened its attack on Bengal CM Mamata over the violence in Murshidabad, accusing her government of orchestrating a “targeted attack” on the Hindu community.At a presser, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad questioned the state government's intentions, saying, “What’s happening in Bengal? How low will they stoop for vote banks? What does it mean that Hindus are fleeing?” He cited television visuals showing shops owned by Hindus being set on fire and described the violence as deliberate.“One report showed a poor Dalit man who had saved Rs 2 lakh for his wife’s treatment — all of it was burnt. This is inhumane,” he said, slamming the Mamata government for what he called a total lack of sensitivity. “Politics will happen, but has your government lost all humanity?” he asked.Prasad further alleged that the police in Bengal were operating without accountability and praised the intervention of the high court, which led to the deployment of central forces in the area.","Mamata hit back at the BJP-led Centre, alleging "" Communal riot in Murshidabad pre-planned."" “Had TMC been involved in the Waqf violence as claimed by the opposition, the houses of our leaders wouldn’t have been attacked,"" she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120336635,imgsize-836079,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-56.jpg"

What is the National Herald Case?

What happens next?

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Wednesday detained several Congress workers protesting outside the All India Congress Committee headquarters at 24, Akbar Road. The protest erupted after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a chargesheet in the National Herald case , naming senior party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as key accused.The detained protesters were demonstrating against what they called a ""politically motivated"" move by the Centre to target opposition leaders using investigative agencies. The ED filed its prosecution complaint at Delhi’s Rouse Avenue Court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.The protest, which took place in front of the Congress headquarters, saw participation from several senior leaders.Sachin Pilot, former Rajasthan deputy CM, said, “We are seeing this case for a long time. There is no transaction, no transfer of property, no asset movement. I have full faith in the judiciary. This is being done only to divert public attention. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will fight legally and politically. The BJP is feeling threatened because we are reviving the party in Gujarat. This is a clear misuse of the ED.”Imran Pratapgarhi, Congress MP and minority cell chairman, said the timing of the chargesheet was suspicious. “You have to understand the chronology—Rahul Gandhi is in Gujarat, Bihar elections are coming, BJP is nervous about Assam, and suddenly this chargesheet appears. This is an attempt to crush the opposition, but they forget this is the Gandhi family—whose sacrifices for the country are unparalleled,” Pratapgarhi said.Supriya Shrinate, Congress spokesperson, launched a scathing attack on the Modi government saying, “This is a 12-year-old case. The government waited till the last day to file the chargesheet, which shows how legally and morally bankrupt they are. No money has exchanged hands. This is a desperate attempt to trap the Gandhi family. Modi is scared of Rahul Gandhi. But vendetta politics will take them only so far. We will fight this in court and on the streets.”Udit Raj, another party leader, called the chargesheet “fake and illegal”. “We want to go to the public. No one is bigger than the people. The people must know this chargesheet is completely baseless.”Congress has announced nationwide protests against the move, particularly in front of ED offices across the country.In a press conference held in Delhi, senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad defended the ED’s action and hit back at Congress.“Congress has the right to protest, but they do not have the right to loot land and public funds. This entire case is about misappropriation of funds and assets. In 2008, the National Herald ceased publication. After that, Congress gave ?90 crore to Associated Journals Ltd (AJL), the publisher. This was a clear violation because party funds cannot be given to a private company.”He further alleged, “Young India Ltd was then created, with 38% share each held by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. This was a corporate conspiracy to grab the assets of AJL. Properties in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Patna, and Bhopal—valuable properties—were transferred to Young India. And what charity has Young India done since then? None.”Prasad accused the Congress of misleading the public and using protests to distract from the real legal issues.The National Herald was a newspaper founded by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1938, published by AJL. In 2008, AJL stopped publishing. Later, in 2010, Congress leaders created Young Indian Pvt. Ltd. , a company in which Sonia and Rahul Gandhi hold the majority stake.BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a private complaint in 2012 alleging that Congress provided Rs 90 crore in loans to AJL, which was later acquired by Young India for a paltry Rs 50 lakh. He alleged this allowed Young India, and by extension the Gandhi family, to effectively control real estate assets worth over Rs 2,000 crore.The ED began investigating under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. On Tuesday, it filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) naming Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and others, including Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes.The complaint has been filed under Sections 44 and 45 of the PMLA, for offences under Section 3 (money laundering), Section 70 (offences by companies), and Section 4 (punishment for money laundering).The chargesheet will now be taken up by the Delhi court, and summons may be issued to the accused. Congress has announced continued protests, claiming it will “not be silenced.” Meanwhile, BJP leaders insist the law must take its course and that no one is above the law.","Police detain Congress workers protesting against Central Government and Central agencies, outside their party office.

"As US-China ties crash and burn, eyes turn towards India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-us-china-ties-crash-and-burn-eyes-turn-towards-india-tariff-trade-war/articleshow/120316772.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.More signs of the US-China flame-out emerged on Tuesday after Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of Boeing aircraft. China is Boeing's biggest customer with projections by the company of delivering nearly 9,000 planes to China — about 20% of the total — over the next two decades. By contrast, India is expected to order around 2400 Boeing aircraft till 2043.Also read: China plays rare earth card as US, India dig deep The Chinese directive also included halting orders of aircraft-related equipment and parts, indicating it is ready to suffer pain and disruption to crank up domestic aircraft manufacturing by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which has been ramping up to take on Boeing and Airbus, the two global aircraft majors.Beijing's blow to Boeing in response to President Trump's tariff gambit came amid growing apprehension in the American commentariat that the MAGA supremo may have overplayed his hand in trying to paint China into a corner -- without rallying support from the rest of the world. There is dismay that on the contrary he has alienated almost the entire world, including European allies.A viral meme showing Trump saying ""I hold the cards"" and Xi responding with ""The cards are made in China"" provided an apt metaphor for the tariff fallout, with many experts saying although both countries will feel the pain from the spat that has inflamed the world, Beijing appears to have more leverage than the Trump White House anticipated, not to speak of greater resilience and endurance to ride out the punishment.US analysts are increasingly looking at India as a potential winner in the trade war expecting New Delhi to take advantage of the tariff differential. ""Is India ready to step in for China?"" the NYT asked in a front page story that said while Trump’s trade war with Beijing could be good for New Delhi, the country's dreams of becoming a new factory to the world is beset with familiar problems -- lack of skilled workers, supply chain issues, infrastructure shortcomings and red tape.But MAGA hardliners, despite being mocked for expecting low-end, assembly-line manufacturing to return to the US, bristle at the idea of depending on India for items like pharmaceuticals after extricating itself from China's dominance. The argument has caused the US President to go back and forth on taxing pharma imports, first holding back on tariffs and later indicating he will review it.In fact, the MAGA Supremo's back-and-forth on the tariff issue on some sectors, including automobiles in the latest instances, has led to allegations of crony capitalism and insider trading as the United States appears to be in far greater turmoil than China and rest of the world after igniting a global trade conflagration.A defensive President Trump pushed back on Monday, asserting that he does not change his mind but he is a ""very flexible person."" Following signs that he's carve out another tariff exception to help the US auto sector, the country's $ 42 billion toy industry, which is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and supplies, is also clamoring for a break arguing that toys are critical for child development.Many liberal pundits are now surmising that instead of running rings around China as the White House mandarins are suggesting the US President is doing, it is Trump who is running around in circles. Amid growing concerns about the Chinese President Xi's high-profile visits to Vietnam and Malaysia, US experts are wondering if Trump has unwittingly ceded global primacy to Beijing.""What if you get into a trade war with China and you lose? What if, after infuriating the rest of the world, putting tariffs on them, too, you make China look stronger, more reliable, more farsighted, more strategic in the eyes of all these other countries that are now looking for an exit from the unreliable consequences of US hegemony?"" the liberal podcaster Ezra Klein asked amid growing self-doubt across US business circles.But Trump made light of the Chinese leader's purported inroads in East Asia, saying he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam for engaging while seeming to hold out an olive branch to Xi. ""I like him. He likes me. I mean, you know, who knows?” Trump said as Chinese interlocutors continued to taunt the US with a flood of memes, cartoons, and videos. One meme showed Xi holding a pair of aces and Trump holding a two and a seven, about the weakest hand in cards.The distrust engendered by Trump's trade, tariff assault, and geo-political assault on the world, including on allies, is so great that the European Commission is reported to have issued burner phones and basic laptops to some US-bound staff to avoid the risk of espionage in Washington, where they are headed to for the World Bank/IMF meetings, according to the Financial Times. The caution is traditionally reserved for trips to China.","US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.

How one of India’s biggest jobs scandals was executed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-one-of-indias-biggest-jobs-scandals-was-executed/articleshow/120359362.cms,"People received appointment letters but were not allowed to join. Non-publication of the fourth phase of the counselling list contrary to the rules. Rank jumping i.e. candidates holding rank below petitioner(s) getting appointment letters.(The WBSSC had not made the merit list public. The rank jumping became apparent only after the CBI got hold of the original database. Also, some candidates managed to secure some answer sheets using RTI.) Candidates in the waiting list for Group D posts in the panel [shortlisted] published on 20.06.2019 were ignored, as a new notification dated 14.06.2021 published initiating a new recruitment process Pick and choose method in selecting candidates and flouting of recruitment rules. Candidate(s) neither in the merit list nor in the waiting list given appointment letters.

Teachers have the onerous task of inculcating values. They have the task of creating and maintaining a pristine atmosphere around a student so as to nurture creativity. It would be naive to accept such qualities from persons obtaining employment by dubious means,"" observed Calcutta high court while setting aside the recruitment process for teaching and non-teaching staff in West Bengal. The HC judgment was upheld by Supreme Court on April 3.The two judgments affected almost 25,000 people recruited for government-aided educational institutes by West Bengal School Selection Commission ( WBSSC ) through a process, which started in 2016 but went on up to 2020. The process, the two courts ruled, was so ""unashamedly"" manipulative that the teachers it produced should have no business to get anywhere near a young student. Of the 25,000 recruitments, more than 18,000 were for teaching staff for classes IX to XII . The sheer number of people affected by the judgment, coupled with the fact that the courts refused to protect those who were supposedly ""untainted"", led to some outrage. The Calcutta HC, however, had given reasons for not being able to separate ""the grain from the chaff"" calling the fraud perpetuated ""too deep and pervasive"" to allow separation of the tainted from the untainted. The two court orders deal in some detail about how the scam was perpetuated from the start to end. Here's how norms were trampled upon in what can possibly be only described as the Great Bengal Recruitment Scam.WBSSC appointed M/s NYSA without any open tender process to evaluate candidates and maintain a soft-copy database of all the tests/exams. NYSA's appointment gave the impression that commission wanted to make sure that NYSA, and nobody else, got the contract. It just invited a few firms to apply and then selected NYSA as it was ""the lowest bidder"".The HC judgment noted that the WBSSC did not produce any document to show if it had done any evaluation to check if NYSA was qualified to carry out the work. ""Letter of appointment of M/s NYSA contains only two lines which requires M/s NYSA to scan and evaluate the OMR sheets. No other terms and conditions of the appointment have been specified,"" the judgment said. As often is the case in such scams, NYSA subcontracted the work of maintaining a soft-copy database of answer sheets to M/s Data Scantech Solutions. While court records mention that the answer sheets were scanned inside WBSSC's offices, WBSSC curiously submitted that it did not even know that the scanning work was carried out by Data Scantech. The court concluded that the appointment of both M/s NYSA and Data Scantech was ""unashamedly orchestrated"" to ""facilitate, implement and perpetuate"" the eventual fraud.The 2016 notification issued by WBSSC for regional and state level selection tests involved 12,905 posts for assistant teachers for classes IX and X; 5,712 assistant teachers for classes XI and XII; 2,067 non-teaching staff under Group C; and 3,956 non-teaching staff under Group D. This meant that the total vacancies across all categories was 24,640. However, after the recruitment process ended, recommendations made by the WBSSC were for only 22,930 posts. There was also a mismatch between the answer sheets data base with WBSSC and data maintained by NYSA in at least 4,091 cases. CBI investigations showed that 8,163 marksheets were manipulated. As per a data set provided by WBSSC, there were 926 cases of rank-jumping and 1,498 people were appointed despite not featuring in any of the tests and, therefore, not being a part of the recruitment process. Some people who were appointed were found to have submitted blank answer sheets. One of Calcutta HC's orders described this number as ""large"".And that is not all. The number of candidates who got the appointment letters outstripped the number of candidates ""recommended for appointment"" by the WBSSC. The gap was significant - 2,355. This took the total appointments to 25,735, 1095 more than the total vacancies across all categories as per 2016 notification.It was the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) which was responsible for issuing the appointment letters. Before the court, the Board maintained that it received all recommendations from different regional offices of WBSSC - mostly hand delivered and some through the post.Curiously enough, all the records maintained at the WBSSC office were destroyed in July 2019 while the recruitment process was still on. A copy of the database maintained by NYSA was passed on to WBSSC in addition to the physical records that originally existed with WBSSC. Citing a particular rule for the recruitment process, an executive order issued on July 22, 2019 directed destruction of all the records. However, court orders note that WBSSC provided scanned copies to the candidates from 2018 right till 2023, claiming that they were from its WBSSC database.The CBI seized three hard-disks from the house of one of the ex-employees of NYSA in Sept 2022 - over three years after the WBSSC had destroyed its records. Similar files were also recovered from Data Scantech and most of the anomalies like rank jumping were accepted by WBSSC only after these discoveries. Also, the CBI did not find any scanned copies at the WBSSC's offices, which, according to HC, indicated that WBSSC officials were taking NYSA employees' help, after they had destroyed their records, to reply to RTI applications by candidates seeking details of their answer sheets.The WBSSC filed two petitions before Calcutta HC seeking extra posts in recruitment process so that those who were appointed without even appearing for any exam could be retained. This did not go down well with the court and it sought to know who had approved this request, to which WBSSC head took the responsibility. The court, however, sought all records from the WBSSC office pertaining to this request and it came to light that it was approved by the State Cabinet. The principal secretary of the state appeared before HC in Nov 2022 and produced a cabinet note and a cabinet memo regarding the request for supernumerary posts. The cabinet decision was of May that year. Based on the objections raised by the original petitioners and the court's approach, the WBSSC eventually sought to withdraw its petition.The court, however, rejected WBSSC's petition. The HC finally directed the CBI to investigate this aspect as well - creation of supernumerary posts. The Supreme Court in a separate order on April 8, five days after it allowed scrapping of the entire recruitment process, set aside the Calcutta HC order for CBI investigation into WB government's request for supernumerary posts.","Calcutta high court and Supreme Court set aside the recruitment process for teaching and non-teaching staff in West Bengal. The process, the two courts ruled, was so ""unashamedly"" manipulative that the teachers it produced should have no business to get anywhere near a young student. The sheer number of people affected by the judgment led to some outrage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120360121,imgsize-72626,width-400,resizemode-4/teachers-scam.jpg"
ED quizzes Vadra for 2nd day; he says 'not scared of anyone',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-quizzes-vadra-for-2nd-day-he-says-not-scared-of-anyone/articleshow/120359348.cms,"Robert Vadra (PTI photo)

GURGAON: Businessman Robert Vadra appeared before Enforcement Directorate (ED) for the second consecutive day on Wednesday in connection with a money laundering probe into a 2008 land deal in Gurgaon between his company Skylight Hospitality and DLF.Vadra, who reiterated to the media that he was a political target, was accompanied by wife Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress general secretary and MP from Wayanad.Before going in for the second round of questioning, Vadra, referring to the Gandhi family, told reporters ""hum kisi se darte nahin (we are not scared of anyone). ""I will never call myself a soft target. If you (Centre) harass me or put pressure on me, I will rise stronger. We speak for the people, and that's why we are being targeted. We are not afraid of anyone. We will keep fighting for the people. Whether Rahul Gandhi is stopped in the Parliament or I am stopped outside, we will continue to fight for truth and for the people. We are certainly targets, but we are not soft targets. We are hard targets and will keep becoming harder. Times keep changing,"" he said.Vadra also expressed frustration with the repeated summons, and said, ""I was surprised to see the second summons as I have already appeared 15 times before the agency regarding the same case. I was questioned for 10 hours, and I gave 23,000 documents. I showed my statements from 2019 to the agency, and they are asking the same questions that I answered in 2019. I can just say that the agencies are being misused.""ED had earlier summoned Vadra on April 8, but he did not appear. The case also involves former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who is accused of favouring Vadra's company in the deal for over 3.5 acres of land in Shikohpur that Skylight bought for Rs 7.5 crore. Four months later, it sold the plot to DLF for Rs 58 crore.Congress has called ED's actions politically motivated.","Businessman Robert Vadra appeared before Enforcement Directorate (ED) for the second consecutive day on Wednesday.

Supreme Court to government: Will you allow Muslims in Hindu trusts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-government-will-you-allow-muslims-in-hindu-trusts/articleshow/120359166.cms,"NEW DELHI:SG said there was no basis for the apprehension of fresh scrutiny of ‘waqf by user’ properties. It was meant to enable only those Muslims who had already created a trust for charity, by assuring that their properties would not be treated as waqf property, he said. CJI said, “Before the British came to India, there was no concept of registering properties on transfer. How will someone produce documentary proof of a waqf if it was done during the 14th to 19th century. Jama Masjid in Delhi may be ‘waqf by user’. Who will produce documentary proof for this? But at the same time, no one can make an absurd claim that Parliament or Delhi HC land is waqf land.”Mehta said Muslim charity commissioners could enter temples and have been entering temples. “The Tamil Nadu govt says it can appoint archaks (pujaris) and the court approves it saying it is a secular function of the govt,” he said, adding, “It is the administration of properties. Nothing to do with the religious affairs of Muslims.”The bench said as long as a non-Muslim was confined to the post of ex-officio member, it was fine. “But as far as other members are concerned, it can’t be that out of 22 members in the council, only eight are Muslim,” the CJI said.The SG said this issue was raised before the Joint Parliamentary Committee and it was emphatically clarified by the minister concerned that a maximum of two out of 22 members would be non-Muslims in the council.“The provisions are now inclusive as membership is expanded to include all categories of Muslims, which was earlier confined only to Shias and Sunnis. Among the members, two must be women, so it has become even more inclusive,” Mehta said. The bench said this was a positive development.Mehta also allayed the SC’s apprehension of immediate reconstitution of the council and boards by saying the existing bodies would continue till their end of tenure. He said that interestingly, among the 150 petitioners, not a single board had approached the SC claiming that it was affected by the changes in the waqf Act.At one point, the SC mulled the option of sending all petitions in the SC and before HCs to one HC. But the Muslim side opposed it and said the issue required adjudication at the earliest. The SG said let the court issue notice to the Union govt, which would respond in detail. However, when the SC intended to dictate an interim order, Mehta and Dwivedi successfully opposed it by seeking to advance arguments.","SG said there was no basis for the apprehension of fresh scrutiny of ‘waqf by user’ properties.

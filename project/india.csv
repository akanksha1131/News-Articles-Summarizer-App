Negative Neutral Somewhat Positive Very Positive

Among the important takeaways from Narendra Modi's fourth visit to Sri Lanka as prime minister was a tripartite agreement - also involving the UAE - to develop the coastal district of Trincomalee in the country's northeastern part as an energy hub. Announcing the project in the traditionally Tamil-majority area, which will include a multi-product pipeline, Modi said all Sri Lankans will benefit from it.With its natural harbour and energy facilities, Trincomalee is of great strategic value for India as a strong presence there will also allow it to ramp up influence in the northeast Indian Ocean. The announcement follows Sri Lanka's securing of investments worth $3.7 billion from China's oil giant Sinopec, the largest foreign direct investment to date in the country, for an oil refinery in the southern Hambantota region during Lankan President Anura Dissanayake's visit to Beijing earlier this year. For India, it's imperative that China, which has in the past explored energy projects in islands off the Jaffna peninsula, is not allowed to make inroads into northern and eastern parts of the country.India already has an agreement with Sri Lanka for developing some of the Trincomalee oil tank farms and India could develop more under the new MoU. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the proposed energy hub is an initiative designed to ensure Sri Lanka's energy security, provisioning of energy at affordable rates, and also to possibly contribute revenue for the country through export of energy. As a major strategic and energy partner, the UAE was an ideal partner for the first of its kind project in the region.In line with their growing strategic convergence, India and the UAE had agreed in 2018 to jointly work on development projects in third countries.Also read: Modi assures Sri Lanka help in dealing with Trump tariff fallout ""And what the exact contours of the UAE role will be is something that is going to be elaborated once the B2B discussions kick off under this MoU,"" said Misri.""The immediate next step that will be enabled by this framework MoU is the identification and the nomination of specific agencies and entities that could be govt entities or private sector entities or could be entities related to the govts themselves that will try and realise the business-to-business part of this agreement,"" added the official.","India and the UAE signed a tripartite agreement to develop the coastal district of Trincomalee in the country's northeastern part as an energy hub.

BHOPAL: Authorities in Madhya Pradesh are investigating allegations that a man hired by a missionary hospital in Damoh district as a 'highly skilled cardiologist' from the UK was a fraud, whose surgeries killed anywhere from seven to a dozen people in less than a month.The suspect, whose real name could be Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav, allegedly posed as UK doctor N John Kem. It is alleged that the hospital hired him although he didn't possess valid medical qualifications or professional credentials.He is accused of performing risky heart surgeries on unsuspecting patients, many of whom died shortly after undergoing the procedures. Local authorities fear that the actual number of victims could be higher.Neither collector Sudhir Kocher nor Damoh chief medical and health officer Dr Mukesh Jain could be contacted for their versions despite multiple attempts. The suspect has gone missing after the complaint.Deepak Tiwari, district president of the Child Welfare Committee, who raised the matter, said that several families alerted the administration after they noticed discrepancies in Yadav's qualifications and credentials. Some patients, who were sceptical of the doctor's expertise, took their relatives to a different hospital in Jabalpur, where it was discovered that Yadav was impersonating a foreign-trained cardiologist.""I came to know that the internal report submitted to the collector has referred to casualties of seven patients who were operated on by the quack, but we think the toll must be around 12,"" Tiwari told TOI.It is also alleged that Yadav has a criminal case against him in Hyderabad and had failed to provide any legitimate identification or medical certificates when questioned.Priyank Kanungo, a member of National Human Rights Commission, posted it on social media and said that the hospital is associated with Prime Minister Ayushman Yojana. In this way, govt money has also been misused, he said.","Suspect, whose real name could be Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav, allegedly posed as UK doctor N John Kem.

The Lok Sabha had passed the legislation earlier this week after a 13-hour marathon debate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the move as a “watershed moment,” saying that the waqf system had long suffered from a lack of transparency and accountability. “This legislation will boost transparency and safeguard people’s rights,” he posted on X.The Act aims to reform the governance of waqf properties, enhance transparency in dealings, and ensure representation from different Muslim sects in waqf boards. It also includes provisions to safeguard heritage sites, improve social welfare, and support the economic inclusion of marginalized groups, including Muslim widows and divorcees.Minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, who piloted the Bill, said it would benefit millions of poor Muslims and asserted it does not interfere with waqf properties. “This legislation is based on extensive stakeholder consultation and incorporates recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee,” he said. He clarified that the Central Waqf Council would comprise 22 members, with no more than four non-Muslims, ensuring the body remains secular yet representative.Opposition leaders, however, accused the government of pushing a divisive agenda. Congress MP Dr Syed Naseer Hussain said the Bill was misleading and intended for communal polarisation. DMK’s Tiruchi Siva called it anti-secular and unconstitutional, while TMC’s Mohammad Nadimul Haque said it violates fundamental rights. AAP’s Sanjay Singh urged the government to withdraw the Bill.Union home minister Amit Shah countered that the opposition was misguiding people. BJP’s JP Nadda emphasised that the Bill aligns with UMEED — Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development — to modernise property administration.Supporting the Bill, JD(S) chief and former PM HD Devegowda said waqf properties had long been misused by elites. BJP MP Radha Mohan Das said previous governments had neglected the upliftment of poor Muslims, and the Modi government is working to bring them into the mainstream.Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a withdrawal of the Bill, citing constitutional concerns. AIADMK’s Dr M Thambidurai supported changes in board composition, while Minister Ramdas Athawale claimed the Bill integrates all minority communities.Alongside this legislation, parliament also approved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, which repeals the century-old Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923, aiming to eliminate outdated provisions.As the new law comes into force, political debate continues over its long-term impact — whether it will empower marginalised communities or, as critics claim, centralise control and erode minority autonomy.","President Droupadi Murmu has given her assent to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025.

No, it needs improvement Yes, it's effective

BENGALURU: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar 's determined refusal to step down as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president has intensified the internal power struggle within the party, even as the leadership in Delhi has signalled it is backing him - at least for now.Shivakumar, who returned to Bengaluru after a two-day trip to Delhi, is said to have firmly conveyed to the Congress high command that he would not relinquish the party post unless he is assured of the chief ministership.Sources said the high command has, in turn, communicated to CM Siddaramaiah and his cabinet loyalists, who have been pressing for Shivakumar's removal, that there would be no leadership change in the state unit before the upcoming zilla and taluk panchayat elections later this year.Observers believe Shivakumar's insistence on retaining his KPCC post is closely tied to his goal of becoming CM. Relinquishing it, they say, could weaken his leverage within the party.""There is an undercurrent of one-upmanship between the two stalwarts - Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar - to take control of Congress' state unit. Shivakumar's retention of the KPCC chief's position is seen as a move to balance these power equations,"" said political analyst Vishwas Shetty.The campaign to remove Shivakumar, led by a group of ministers close to Siddaramaiah, including cooperation minister KN Rajanna, was based on the party's ""one man, one post"" principle. But the movement lost momentum following a honeytrap controversy that shook the political establishment. Rajanna's open admission that he was among 48 politicians targeted in the alleged plot forced a temporary pause in the campaign.Unmoved by the internal dissent, Shivakumar has asserted that leadership roles should be earned. ""KPCC positions aren't available in shops, nor can they be obtained by speaking to the media,"" he said in response to his critics.Public works minister Satish Jarkiholi, who has emerged as a key aspirant for the top KPCC role, has publicly pushed for a leadership change. ""There is a written note with the AICC general secretary (organisation) and MP KC Venugopal on the change of the KPCC president after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" Jarkiholi insists, arguing that a dedicated president is crucial to building grassroots support ahead of the 2028 assembly elections.", DK Shivakumar has refused to step down as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president.

We have said what we had to say and made our decision. This file is closed for us now.”His remarks come a day after he sharply criticised the Bill, alleging that it was less about protecting Muslim interests and more about facilitating a business-like acquisition of Waqf land and property by the government. Raut had claimed the move was driven by an interest in Waqf assets worth an estimated Rs 2 lakh crore.While the Shiv Sena (UBT) is stepping back, several other leaders have already taken the matter to the Supreme Court. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi , Congress leader Mohammad Jawed, and AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan have all filed petitions challenging the Bill.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, has already been passed by both Houses of Parliament and now awaits President Droupadi Murmu ’s assent.The Lok Sabha cleared the Bill after a 12-hour debate, with 288 MPs voting in favour and 232 against. The Rajya Sabha passed it shortly after midnight, with 128 in favour and 95 opposed.The Bill aims to amend the Waqf Act of 1995 and strengthen the administration and management of Waqf properties across India. It includes provisions to streamline the registration of Waqf properties, reduce the mandatory contribution to Waqf Boards from 7% to 5%, mandate audits for institutions earning above Rs 1 lakh, and introduce a centralised digital system for better oversight.The government has said the legislation is based on recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee and is intended to make Waqf institutions more transparent and efficient.","Shiv Sena MP and senior leader Sanjay Raut said the party will not challenge the Waqf Amendment Bill, 2025, in the Supreme Court.

NEW DELHI: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is grappling with internal unrest following Rajya Sabha MP Sasmit Patra’s support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025. Senior party leaders, including former minister Pratap Jena, have urged party president Naveen Patnaik to take disciplinary action, marking the first major intra-party challenge since the BJD's defeat in the 2024 state elections.Jena wrote to Patnaik, demanding accountability for Patra’s stance. The issue intensified after BJD Vice-President Debi Prasad Mishra described the bill as a “debatable issue” and said, “It is up to BJD MPs whether they want to support it or not.”The bill, passed narrowly in both Houses of Parliament, seeks to amend the 1995 Waqf Act to improve property management and digital record-keeping.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh accused the BJD of ""capitulating to BJP pressures at the last minute,"" weakening opposition strength in the Rajya Sabha. ""The 95 number would have been more had not the BJD capitulated,"" Ramesh posted on X.Sasmit Patra confirmed his support for the bill, saying, “The party has decided that the MPs were to vote as per their conscience... I have supported the bill.” BJD sources revealed that four MPs opposed the bill, two supported it, and one abstained.Senior BJD leader and six-time MLA Badri Narayan Patra raised serious concerns, “The party president had explicitly directed members to oppose the Bill… Naveen babu had personally instructed Muzibulla Khan twice — once during a recent Iftar party and again over phone — to vote against the Bill. There is something amiss.”His remarks were echoed by party leaders Shashi Bhusan Behera and Bhupinder Singh, who flagged confusion over BJD’s stance. “All the senior leaders are concerned,” Singh said.A delegation of party leaders, led by deputy leader of opposition Prasanna Acharya, met Naveen Patnaik to express dissatisfaction over the lack of a party whip and the perceived indiscipline. Acharya, while confirming the meeting, said the BJD remains committed to secular values and equidistant from both the NDA and INDIA bloc.Meanwhile, OPCC chief Bhakta Charan Das alleged a tacit deal between the BJD and BJP, hinting that a faction led by Patnaik and aide V K Pandian may merge with the saffron party. BJP’s Babu Singh called the row an “internal discord” while Odisha Law Minister Prithiviraj Harichandan dismissed Congress’s claims.","The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is grappling with internal unrest following Rajya Sabha MP Sasmit Patra’s support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025.

Why PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka matters now

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake ’s assurance that the island nation “will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India,” calling the gesture a reaffirmation of the deep trust between the two neighbours and a statement that appeared to assuage concerns about China's growing influence over neighbours.“Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar said—what could be bigger protection against the enemy if not the shield of a true friend and his friendship?” PM Modi said, adding, “President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had chosen India for his first foreign visit. Today, I am his first foreign guest here in Sri Lanka. It shows the depths of our special relationship. Sri Lanka has a special place in our neighbourhood first policy and mission SAGAR.”Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri added context to the growing strategic partnership: “The President of Sri Lanka stated very clearly that Sri Lankan territory will not be used or be allowed to be used in any manner that is inimical or detrimental to India’s interests. During discussions today, he said that neither Sri Lanka's land nor the oceans around it will be allowed to be used in any manner inimical to India’s security.”He said the remarks set the stage for a milestone development. “This is the background of the signature of the Defence MoU between the two countries for the first time, and the MoU is in itself an umbrella framework document that will make existing defence cooperation initiatives more structured.”President Dissanayake also acknowledged India’s regional role and sought its support in key bilateral issues. “I reaffirmed Sri Lanka's stand that it will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India as well as towards regional stability,” he said. “I requested Prime Minister Modi's intervention in convening early bilateral technical discussions pertaining to Sri Lanka's claim to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for the establishment of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone.”He also highlighted the countries’ collaboration in technology and digital transformation . “Sri Lanka recognizes the importance of developing a digital economy to drive growth, innovation and efficiency. Furthering this policy initiative, Prime Minister Modi and I discussed possible collaboration in digitalization in multiple domains,” he said. “I thank the Government of India for the financial grant of Indian Rupees 300 crores to implement Sri Lanka's unique Digital Identity Project.”Chinese investments and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka to develop its economy have raised concerns ranging from sovereignty and security issues.Beijing’s control of the Hambantota Port—secured on a 99-year lease after Colombo defaulted on loan repayments—has enabled Chinese surveillance vessels, such as the Yuan Wang 5, to operate near India’s southern coast. Despite protests from New Delhi in 2022, Sri Lanka allowed Chinese ships to dock at Hambantota for “replenishment,” a practice that continues.China has also pledged a record $3.7 billion investment in Sri Lanka following President Dissanayake’s recent visit to Beijing. The funds will be used to build a new oil refinery at Hambantota as part of an upgraded Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) agreement.PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka is more than a goodwill gesture—it marks a pivotal step in deepening defence and strategic cooperation between the two nations at a time of growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean region.The visit is expected to culminate in the signing of a key defence cooperation agreement, signalling a reset in India-Sri Lanka military ties that have remained cautious since the withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) from the island nearly 35 years ago.PM Modi arrived in Colombo on Friday evening and was welcomed at the Bandaranaike International Airport by five senior Sri Lankan ministers, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, and Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar.On Saturday morning, he received a ceremonial welcome at Independence Square by President Dissanayake, underlining the importance both nations attach to their long-standing ties.",PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka is more than a goodwill gesture.

Defending its stance, JDU claimed it backed the legislation only after JPC accepted all five of its key recommendations. Party spokesperson Anjum Ara listed these as keeping land under the state list, ensuring the law applies prospectively, preserving the status of religious structures on unregistered waqf land, raising the rank of officers resolving disputes, and extending the digitisation deadline.RJD's attacks have continued, nonetheless.

""This bill won't be implemented at any cost, it will be thrown into the dustbin,"" he said.A poster war has also erupted. RJD kicked it off by likening CM Nitish Kumar to a 'chameleon'. In retaliation, JDU posters accused RJD chief Lalu Prasad of similar flip-flopping, pointing to his 2010 speech in Lok Sabha demanding strict laws for waqf property, which contrasts with RJD's opposition to the bill now.Adding to the fire, governor Arif Mohammed Khan backed the bill, describing it as a necessary reform. ""Which waqf board is actually serving the poor - running orphanages or hospitals?"" he asked, arguing that waqf assets should be used for public good.Union minister Chirag Paswan, too, has joined in, accusing the opposition of stoking fear among Muslims.","The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, cleared by both Houses of Parliament, has led to a fierce political storm in Bihar.

Some opposition parties and political figures are likely to knock Supreme Court's doors against the proposed law on various grounds.They alleged that the sweeping changes brought under Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act ""curtailed religious and cultural autonomy of Muslims, enabled arbitrary executive interference, and undermined minority rights to manage their religious and charitable institutions"".The petitions, filed by advocate Adeel Ahmed, questioned introduction of non-Muslim members in waqf boards and Central Waqf Council. ""Principle of equality before the law demands that any classification must be based on intelligible differentia and bear a rational nexus to objective of the law. However, this amendment arbitrarily interferes with religious affairs of Muslim minority, while similar restrictions do not apply to non-Muslim religious institutions, thereby failing the test of fairness, reasonableness, and non-discrimination. Inclusion of non-Muslims in religious affairs of the Muslim minority is not a step toward 'inclusivity' rather, it dilutes the autonomy of an already under-represented community in India's institutional framework,"" his petition said.""In contrast, non-Muslim charitable institutions actively prohibit Muslim participation in their religious affairs, highlighting the discriminatory impact of this amendment,"" it added. The petition filed by the NGO highlighted Sachar Committee Report presents compelling evidence of abysmal socio-economic status and severe under-representation of Muslims in public institutions.Adeel Ahmed's petition also alleged that the transfer of adjudicatory powers from the tribunal to executive authorities like the district collector (Section 4) and curtailment of the tribunal's powers to stay (Section 83) amounted to denial of fair procedure. ""The drastic overhaul proposed by UMEED Bill is not only unnecessary but also an alarming interference into religious affairs of Muslim community diluting the fundamental purpose of waqf,"" it said.""The petitioner humbly submits that UMEED Bill is an unconstitutional and unjustified legislative overreach that must be struck down in the interest of upholding fundamental rights, individual freedom and religious autonomy guaranteed under the Constitution,"" it added.",The Waqf Amendment Bill received President Droupadi Murmu's assent late Saturday evening.

Won't let our land be used against India: SL President,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-let-our-land-be-used-against-india-sl-president/articleshow/120024573.cms,"Modi 1st foreign head to visit Lanka in Dissanayake tenure

NEW DELHI: Amid growing Chinese footprint in the Indian Ocean, India signed its first ever MoU for defence cooperation with Sri Lanka that will help both sides formalise and enhance cooperation between their armed forces. The agreement was one of the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's ongoing visit to the strategically-located neighbour that also saw a major boost for energy ties in the form of a grid inter-connectivity agreement that will allow Sri Lanka to export electricity and another MoU for developing Trincomalee as an energy hub.The bilateral meeting was followed by signing of seven MoUs and agreements. The leaders acknowledged that the security interests of India and Sri Lanka are interlinked and the President reassured India that he won't allow Lankan land or, as foreign secretary Vikram Misri recalled after the bilateral meeting, the oceans around it to be used in any way inimical to India's security interests or regional stability.""We believe that we have shared security interests. The security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent,"" said Modi, thanking Dissanayake for his sensitivity towards India's interests.Modi also announced a debt restructuring agreement that he said will provide immediate assistance and relief to the people of Sri Lanka, along with reduced interest rates on loans. ""Today, we have also decided to reduce interest rates. It symbolises that even today, India stands with the people of Sri Lanka. For the social and economic development of the Eastern Provinces, a support package of approximately 2.4 billion Lankan rupees (around Rs 70 crore) will be provided,"" he said. India had earlier extended an aid package worth $4 billion to Sri Lanka to help the Indian Ocean country from a food and fuel crisis.Modi, the first foreign leader to visit Sri Lanka since the President assumed office last year, quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar to say that in the face of challenges and enemies, there is no stronger assurance than a true friend and the shield of his friendship.On the sensitive issue of fishermen, the two decided to handle it with a humane approach with Modi emphasising on immediate release of fishermen and their boats.On the Tamil issue, Dissanayake briefed Modi about his “inclusive” approach and the Indian PM expressed hope that the Sri Lankan govt would meet the aspirations of the Tamil people and fulfil its commitment towards fully implementing the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and conducting provincial council elections. Like in their last meeting in Dec, when Dissanayake visited India, Modi did not specifically refer to the 13th Amendment for the devolution of power to the provinces.“Relations between India and Sri Lanka are based on mutual trust and goodwill. We will continue to work together to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of our people,” said Modi.Briefing the media about the defence MoU, Misri said it will make existing defence cooperation initiatives more structured. “There will be activities related to, of course, the continuing and even intensifying the tradition of high-level visits between the two countries, more joint exercises, capacity building in various areas, exchanges in HADR related operations, increasing port calls by naval units of both countries, and also to explore defence industry cooperation between the two sides,” said Misri.On conclusion of the debt restructuring process, Misri said India has been pursuing an investment-led strategy with Sri Lanka, together with a grant assistance-oriented approach to ensure that Sri Lanka is firmly on the path to sustainable and long-term economic recovery. In his address, Modi also said that loans worth $100 million had been converted into grants in the past six months.",India signs its first ever MoU for defence cooperation with Sri Lanka.

"Omar Abdullah govt backs quota review outside, opposes it in court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-govt-backs-quota-review-outside-opposes-it-in-court/articleshow/120023736.cms,"SRINAGAR: Omar Abdullah govt has landed in a political hotspot after asking HC to dismiss a petition that calls J&K’s policy of high reservations anti-merit and seeks its rationalisation. The govt’s move is at odds with its long-standing position that the quotas need to be re-examined and its decision to set up a cabinet committee for the review.The govt’s stand in the HC has been spelt out in an affidavit filed on Friday by the social welfare department, whose minister Sakina Itoo heads the cabinet sub-committee. As the govt came under attack from opposition, Itoo suggested Saturday that the affidavit was a mistake and a fresh one would be drawn up.The petition argues that changes brought in reservations laws after abrogation of Article 370 has limited access to open merit candidates to govt jobs and education institutions. Filed last Dec by a lawyer, Zahoor Ahmad Bhat, and some others, the plea contends that the changes reduce open merit seats from 57% to 33%.In its affidavit, the govt said the plea should be dismissed with heavy costs in spite of the fact that it set up the cabinet after massive protests last Dec against the quotas. The affidavit describes the existing reservation policy as constitutional and insists that amendments brought in after abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019 has not violated any rights, “whether fundamental, legal or statutory.” It also argues that the govt is entitled to include or exclude any particular section to make “the country socialist in its true spirit”.Omar’s rivals seized on the apparent dichotomy. “The govt is defending a deeply flawed reservation policy in court. The so-called cabinet committee was nothing but a facade to mislead the public,” PDP MLA Waheed Parra said.Peoples Conference legislator Sajad Lone, who had flagged the issue in the assembly last month, noted the silence on the panel. “Nowhere has the govt mentioned the formation of the sub-committee. This is a legal mystery. Seems the govt is not taking its own committee seriously enough to merit a mention in its affidavit,” Lone said.During a debate on March 16 in the assembly, minister Itoo had asserted that the cabinet would examine grievances against the reservation system. Ministers Satish Sharma and Javed Rana as the other members of the panel.As the row escalated, Itoo held a presser Saturday to reaffirm the govt’s commitment to rationalising reservations. She said the govt was “looking at the circumstances” in which the affidavit was filed. The govt will come up with a report on reservations within six months and ensure the recommendations of the panel are implemented, Itoo said. “We are sincere and we are not here to mislead anyone,” the minister added.","The petition argues that changes brought in reservations laws after abrogation of Article 370 has limited access to open merit candidates to govt jobs and education institutions.

"Four centuries on, Caravaggio’s Mary Magdalene finds her way to India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/four-centuries-on-caravaggios-mary-magdalene-finds-her-way-to-india/articleshow/120020564.cms,"She leans back with her eyes closed and lips slightly parted, her face flushed with a wave of intense emotion. At her feet lies a skull — possibly a quiet reminder of the impermanence of beauty. Painted around 1606 by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, 'Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy' depicts the saint not in grief or sacrifice or with a group of disciples, but alone, suspended in a moment of pure rapture.Long considered lost, with at least eight known imitations in circulation, the original 'Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy' was rediscovered and authenticated in 2014 by Mina Gregori, the most famous Caravaggio expert. For the first time, the painting is now coming to India at an exhibition at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA).On display from April 17 to May 18, the exhibition is a result of a collaboration between the Italian Embassy Cultural Centre and KNMA, timed with the official visit of Italian deputy prime minister Antonio Tajani and minister for university and research Anna Maria Bernini.To Roobina Karode, director and chief curator of KNMA, the exhibition is not just historic — it’s a dialogue across centuries, continents and artistic vocabularies. “This is a rare opportunity for local audiences in India to see a Caravaggio in its physical, original form — not in reproduction, not in textbooks, but in its presence,” Karode says.Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571–1610) was a revolutionary Italian painter whose short, turbulent life left an outsized mark on the history of Western art. Trained in Milan and active across Rome, Naples, Malta and Sicily, he rejected the idealised figures of the Renaissance and instead painted saints and sinners with startling realism.The biblical figures in his religious paintings were not seen as distant icons but as flesh-and-blood individuals. Even in the case of Mary Magdalene — a prominent figure in Christian tradition, often described as a devoted follower of Jesus — Caravaggio’s compelling work adds to the intrigue.His signature use of chiaroscuro — the sharp contrast between light and shadow — imbued his religious scenes with a cinematic intensity that often unsettled viewers and thrilled patrons. In a life cut short mysteriously at the age of 38 while he was on the run after allegedly killing a man, Caravaggio created fewer than 90 works. However, his influence inspired generations of painters from Rembrandt to Artemisia Gentileschi, and he remains one of the most studied and mythologised figures in art history.“Since Caravaggio has never come to India, and it’s become increasingly difficult to move paintings of this stature, it’s been a long-standing dream of mine to bring his work here,” says Andrea Anastasio, director of the Italian Embassy Cultural Centre in Delhi. “If this goes smoothly, I’m hoping to bring more Caravaggios over the next two years.”The project was brought to fruition in just two and a half months — a remarkable logistical feat involving conservation protocols, high-security transport, complex insurance and bureaucratic precision. “Usually this kind of thing takes a year. The opportunity came through a chance message. The ambassador (of Italy to India, Antonio Bartoli) messaged me at seven in the morning to say that there was a Caravaggio in Beijing, on its way back to Rome. He asked, 'what if we could bring it to Delhi instead?,” Anastasio recalls.To ensure wider access and understanding, the exhibition will be accompanied by virtual reality experiences, documentary screenings and educational programs. “Caravaggio isn’t widely known in India beyond academic circles,” says Anastasio. “We want to introduce him in a more direct, less formal way. Technology can help bridge that gap.”The exhibition also opens up questions of influence. Can Caravaggio’s chiaroscuro be found in Indian visual traditions? “Modern Indian artists who’ve been exposed to Western art have definitely felt his relevance,” Anastasio says. The exhibition will run parallel to a solo show by senior artist Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, whose monumental painting titled 'Kaarawaan' places portraits of various global masters on a single symbolic boat “That’s why we’re also showing this painting next to works by Sheikh. He must have seen Caravaggio’s paintings in person. The importance of light in his compositions certainly owes something to Caravaggio.”Attention to emotional nuance and realism has resonated with Indian artists who’ve encountered Caravaggio’s work. “Artists such as A. Ramachandran, Krishen Khanna and others were moved by the drama of light and mystery of Caravaggio's style and technique of painting,” adds Karode.","The original 'Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy' was rediscovered and authenticated in 2014 by Mina Gregori, the most famous Caravaggio expert.

It will culminate in a public meeting at Jantar Mantar where leaders of other Left parties, including the CPI(M), CPI, RSP and the CPI(ML) Liberation, are expected to speak in solidarity.The Forward Bloc's primary demand is the immediate declassification of all files related to Bose, the Indian National Army (INA), and the ""Azad Hind Sarkar"", according to a statement.""Despite decades of public interest and the sacrifices made by 'Netaji' and the INA, these files remain shrouded in secrecy. The people of India have a right to know the truth,"" the party said in the statement.Transparency will help resolve the mystery around Bose's disappearance and honour the legacy of one of India's most revered freedom fighters, it added.Several reports have claimed that Bose had boarded a plane from the Taihoku airport in Taiwan in August 1945 that later crashed. There is, however, no confirmation that Bose died in the crash.The Centre constituted several commissions over the years to shed light on the mystery but none could dispel the doubts surrounding his disappearance.Raising concerns over the rising cost of living, the Forward Bloc said the continuous hike in prices of essential commodities such as food items and fuel was ""crippling"" working and middle classes.""Immediate steps must be taken to stabilise prices and protect the basic needs of common citizens,"" it said.The Left party also called for urgent action to tackle the growing unemployment crisis, especially among youngsters.It urged the government to adopt policies promoting skill development and create sustainable jobs for all, with a focus on empowering marginalised communities.The Forward Bloc also highlighted its opposition to the privatisation of national assets. It criticised the ongoing sale of public sector undertakings and key national resources, warning that such moves undermined national sovereignty and weakened public services meant for the common good.The Forward Bloc slammed what it called rising communal polarisation in the country.""The government must take a firm stand against the politics of hatred and work towards strengthening the secular fabric of India,"" it said.",All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) is organising the march under the 'Dilli Chalo' banner.

The line moves from a dot to a grid. The grid expands into patterns of structure that pause, create and slowly disperse into a formlessness that celebrates control and freedom of the breath, the mind, and the space in between. All of this takes place in the now, in the present, in the contemporary. Time moves in the form of constant nowness in Trishla Jain’s work. The two series, ‘ Yantra ’ and ‘ Tantra ’, may initially stand starkly apart from each other but, on slow immersion through time spent with each painting, the dots and dashes configure themselves differently across canvases to create new compositions. These configurations resonate with the present, which arises from a mindfulness associated with discovering the expanse of space between the breath and the mind that exists within each of us.The mind, breath, and space are three important anchors to understanding and experiencing Jain’s work. ‘Yantra’ and ‘Tantra’, Jain’s most recent series of paintings, resemble dualities and opposing parts that exist within all of us. She refers to them as ‘yin and yang, the male and female’, which allow her to bring herself to the canvas, not in fragments but as a whole. On closer observation, viewers will notice extremely structured elements such as the grid and patterns from ‘Yantra’ in the ‘Tantra’ series and vice versa.While ‘Yantra’ deals with a systematic progression of the focused, logical, and structured mind that helps understand Jain’s layers of entering the state of samadhi; ‘Tantra’ takes on the same mind in its unleashed, challenged, and boundless form, flowing free. Yet, the breath returns to centre both series of paintings.Every line, dot and grid in ‘Yantra’ is representative of the inhalation and exhalation of the artist’s breath. The centre is clearly determined within the structure until, with a slow release, the breath is let go in ‘Tantra’. By adjusting to the openness of ‘Tantra’ and observing it with time, the breath gradually returns to point out symmetry and order even in its chaos. The tiny dashes of brushstrokes are measured lines of breath and every now and then one can spot a constellation forming only to disperse back into the flow of another order.At a time when everything in our world seems driven and controlled by technology, Jain’s works invoke a sense of surrender grounded in trust that comes with letting go of control to accept freedom. There is sustained mindfulness in this achievement from observing oneself through the breath and mind in the present moment in ‘The Quiet Interlude’. With this alignment of the mind and breath, there is a very conscious space that arises within the body of work and the human body. For a form to be defined, it requires space. It is only when there is distance that one begins to observe patterns, grids, and structures.On coming too close, the detail takes over but then pushes the viewer back to create a space that allows one to be absorbed into the painting’s entirety. It is in this act of emptying that we are nourished to the brim with a contemplative energy and light which brings with it contentment, peace and harmony.","Trishla Jain’s dance of dots and dashes create a harmonious whole in her new show. The two series, ‘ Yantra ’ and ‘ Tantra, may initially stand starkly apart from each other. On closer observation, viewers will notice extremely structured elements such as the grid and patterns.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120020217,imgsize-1393854,width-400,resizemode-4/article-9.jpg"

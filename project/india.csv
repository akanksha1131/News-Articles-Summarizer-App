"AAP's poll anthem a Kejriwal eulogy, veiled dig at LG & BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aaps-poll-anthem-a-kejriwal-eulogy-veiled-dig-at-lg-bjp/articleshow/117037753.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid cheers of ""Aam Aadmi Party, zindabad"" and lively dance moves among the crowd, party national convener Arvind Kejriwal launched his outfit's election anthem on Tuesday.Titled 'Fir Layenge Kejriwal,' the song combines an upbeat, danceable melody with lyrics showcasing the party's significant achievements in Delhi.The song, part-eulogy to Kejriwal as well as a pointer to all the popular schemes that Delhi govt implemented, subtly touches on the all-season tussle between the govt and the lieutenant governor's office. ""Unke roke ye nahi rukta, chalta rehta apni chaal. Saamne wale shor machaye, karle chahe jitna bawal (He doesn't stop when they try to halt him. He keeps moving forward, undeterred by the noise and chaos),"" it says.The song also targets opposition parties, accusing them of spreading misinformation. It portrays Kejriwal as a leader who overcomes obstacles to work for the people.At the launch, Kejriwal said, ""For months, I've got calls asking me when the song will be released. Here it is, dedicated to the people of this country. Enjoy it, dance to it and play it in weddings and celebrations.""In a veiled dig at BJP, he added: ""There's a political party in this country that thrives on abuse and insults. I'm sure its leader will also appreciate this song. If he wishes, he can listen to it in the privacy of his own home and enjoy it. No one is watching.""The song highlights Delhi govt's key initiatives such as free electricity and water, and improvements in health and education infrastructure. It features visuals of completed projects, such as roads, schools and flyovers. The lyrics proclaim: ""Dilli ke janta ke kaam karta hai, bas apna Kejriwal. Dilli mein bijli-paani muft rakhta hai, bas apna Kejriwal. (Only Kejriwal works for the people of Delhi. Only Kejriwal keeps electricity and water free in Delhi).""The video shows Kejriwal addressing rallies, leading roadshows and engaging with supporters, alongside clips of him stepping out of Tihar Jail last Sept. It also shows common people singing, dancing and celebrating.The anthem also outlines AAP's promises, including a proposal to provide a monthly allowance of Rs 2,100 to women and free medical treatment to the elderly. ""Beheno ko 2,100 bhi bhejega woh. Buzurgo ko free me ilaaj dega firse. (He will send Rs 2,100 to women and once again provide free treatment to the elderly),"" the song says.Kejriwal, announcing the Rs 2,100 scheme in Dec, described himself as a ""magician"" of finances, asserting that he knows how to save money to fund such programmes. The song calls him a magician. ""Jaadugar hai. Jaadu karta hai (He is a magician, he performs magic),"" it says about the AAP chief.The event was attended by chief minister Atishi, former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and MLA Gopal Rai. Delhi health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj reminisced about the success of previous campaign songs, ""When we released 'Paanch Saal Kejriwal' in 2015, it quickly became a favourite at weddings and other social events. I'm confident this new anthem will have a similar impact.""","'Fir Layenge Kejriwal' is part-eulogy to Arvind Kejriwal and pointer to Delhi govt's schemes. The song portrays Kejriwal as a leader who overcomes obstacles to work for the people. The video shows Kejriwal addressing rallies, leading roadshows and engaging with supporters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117037762,imgsize-1643289,width-400,resizemode-4/117037762.jpg"
"With Eye On Muslim Votes, Owaisi's Party Plans To Contest 10-12 Seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-eye-on-muslim-votes-owaisis-party-plans-to-contest-10-12-seats/articleshow/117037743.cms,"HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) is planning to contest 10-12 seats in the upcoming Delhi elections . So far, it has announced only two candidates - Tahir Hussain from Mustafabad and Shafur Rehman, who is the Jamia Alumni Association (AAJMI) president, from Okhla.AIMIM's Delhi unit, in consultation with party president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi , is likely to announce the remaining candidates in the next couple of days.Sources in AIMIM told TOI the Delhi unit is keen to contest from Babarpur, Ballimaran, Chandni Chowk, Okhla, Jangpura, Sadar Bazar, Matia Mahal, Karwan Nagar and Seelampur. Most of these constituencies have a large population of Muslims. Except Karwan Nagar, which was won by BJP in 2020, the others have been electing an AAP candidate for the last two terms.If AIMIM fields a candidate in Jangpura, the person would be up against AAP's former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. BJP has fielded Tarvinder Singh Marwah while Congress has given a ticket to former councillor Farhad Suri.AIMIM's Delhi head Shoaib Jamai said the party has the scope to become a kingmaker, adding it will support any party that defeats BJP and can beat it in the future too.On fielding Delhi riots accused Tahir Hussain from Mustafabad, Jamai said everyone has the right to contest elections in a democracy. ""Other parties too are fielding candidates who went to jail. Ultimately, it is the people who decide who should represent them. We are trying to give voice to those suppressed,"" he added.Hussain was linked to the 2020 Delhi riots, with the police naming him as a key accused. AAP parted ways with him after he was charged. Recently, he got a reprieve in a related case after Delhi High Court quashed an FIR against him.AIMIM had contested the municipal polls from a few wards in northeast Delhi and Muslim-dominated constituencies. Owaisi had campaigned in the national capital, but the party drew a blank.The smaller parties have largely not been able to pose any major challenges to AAP and BJP in the assembly polls, which have been a bipolar contest.

5 years of turmoil after dream run: Govt faced 'corruption' charges and LG kept pot boiling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-years-of-turmoil-after-dream-run-govt-faced-corruption-charges-and-lg-kept-pot-boiling/articleshow/117037681.cms,"NEW DELHI: Since the 2020 assembly polls, when Aam Aadmi Party trampled upon the opposition with a massive mandate to govern Delhi for the second consecutive term by winning 62 of the 70 seats, a lot of water has flown under Loha Pul.The image of the ruling party, which was formed on the anti-corruption plank, has since taken a severe beating and it struggles with charges of bribery and financial irregularities. AAP 's top leadership, including supremo Arvind Kejriwal and his lieutenant Manish Sisodia, spent lengthy periods in jail, directly impacting the city's governance which led to an erosion in civic amenities.On the other side, the BJP-led central govt wrested control of services - matters of bureaucracy, including posting and transfer of officials - by enacting a new law and appointed a lieutenant governor in May 2022 who has refused to remain a constitutional head or a mere rubber stamp for the state govt. He has been proactive in actual governance, regularly conducting meetings not only with officials of agencies that fall under his direct jurisdiction but also with the heads of the departments controlled by the elected dispensation. This has led to unending wrangling and trading of barbs between LG VK Saxena and AAP govt.After a 49-day stint in govt with the outside support of Congress in 2013-14 followed by a year-long President's rule in Delhi, AAP created a record by winning 67 of the 70 assembly seats in 2015. The 'Delhi model' of governance largely centred on improvement of city schools, mohalla clinics and free electricity and water to everyone consuming them within a capped amount. With a reputation of ""fulfilling"" most of the electoral promises it made and running a largely untainted govt, AAP contested its third election in 2020 and was re-elected with a drop of just 1% in vote share - from 54.6% in 2015 to 53.6% - and five fewer seats than in the previous term.The 2020 assembly polls were held amid vociferous protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill - which later became a law - the nerve centre being the Muslim-dominated Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi's Okhla. The consolidation of votes this caused helped AAP emerge the victor. It got a huge mandate and validation of the masses, but its fortune started changing within a year. The first was the denting of the image of an ""honest"" dispensation. Starting with the allegations of irregularities in formulation and implementation of now-withdrawn Delhi excise policy to allegedly benefit a particular liquor cartel, the party has faced a flurry of corruption charges in the last three years or so. Nobody had imagined that Kejriwal, idolised by the people for his honesty, would go to jail on corruption charges. The renovation and furnishing of the chief minister residence at 6 Flagstaff Road in north Delhi's Civil Lines, allegedly at an extravagant cost, has further tarnished the kattar imandaar image.The 2020 election was held when the Municipal Corporation of Delhi - which is responsible for basic civic amenities such as sanitation and internal roads - was under the control of BJP. The saffron party was constantly attacked by AAP on civic issues and its ""mis-governance"" was cited as an example of the administrative (in)capability to govern. The tide turned in 2022 with AAP winning the municipal polls. The civic condition of the city hasn't changed much since then. In fact, the intractable power struggle in the municipal body has caused a paralysis of action. Two years later, AAP will be judged for its performance in MCD, especially on the stalemate in the formation of the standing committee, which decides all the important capital-intensive projects.In the last 30 months or so, several inquiries ordered by LG into projects under the direct control of the elected govt have irretrievably soured his relationship with AAP functionaries and provided BJP with ammunition to attack them during the assembly polls. Many big names in the party, including three ministers - Kailash Gahlot, Raaj Kumar Anand and Rajendra Pal Gautam - exited AAP, alleging involvement in corruption and little being done for the scheduled castes.The enactment of the new law that gave LG control of bureaucracy too came as a stumbling block for Delhi govt. Though they work for the elected govt, bureaucrats know it is LG who has the power to decide their transfer and posting and appraise their performance. Their loyalties, therefore, have accordingly shifted. Never earlier had senior bureaucrats held press conferences against their own ministers or made confidential communication public.""This had serious repercussions for the functioning of our govt,"" a senior AAP functionary confided. ""Several projects that we wanted to implement faced obstructions in the absence of bureaucratic support. The registration of corruption cases against our leaders and their imprisonment also had a direct impact on governance."" The functionary, however, remained optimistic. ""The electorate is fully aware that AAP was hobbled from working fully all these years,"" he claimed.The arrest of Kejriwal in the excise policy case in March last year led to a near collapse of the governance in the city. He continued to remain CM while incarcerated, thus incapacitating govt from taking major decisions. The restriction on signing files and entering the Delhi secretariat imposed on him by the Supreme Court while granting him bail forced Kejriwal to hand over the baton to Atishi in Sept. While AAP is still projecting him as the incoming CM, the question remains whether Kejriwal will be able to take up helmsmanship if AAP is re-elected in view of the bail order. Though there has been no change in the legal position since then, AAP insists that he can.Taking a critical look at governance in the last few years, Chandrachur Singh, associate professor of political science at Delhi University's Hindu College, said Kejriwal, who stood for ""ideal"" politics for a decade, was now being made to answer questions about probity in public life. ""Kejriwal's political journey so far has proved that idealism and politics are two totally different aspects. People have started to think that somebody who entered politics to cleanse it himself got enmeshed in it. He had the potential to become a pan-India leader had he taken governance more seriously,"" said Singh.Ravi Ranjan , a professor of political science at DU's Zakir Husain College, said the situation isn't as clear cut this year as it was in 2020. ""AAP has tried to convince the electorate of the obstructionist stances of LG and BJP in delivery of projects, and so the voters of unauthorised and JJ colonies may continue to support Kejriwal. Those who are opposed to the saffron ideology may not consider Congress strong enough to counter BJP,"" he said. ""Yet, the arrests of AAP's stalwarts and failure in delivery, in particular health and education infrastructure, could give BJP the edge, provided that party puts up the right candidates and its campaigners desist from barbs at women, minorities and marginalised sections.""","The image of the ruling party, which was formed on the anti-corruption plank, has since taken a severe beating. AAP's top leadership, including supremo Arvind Kejriwal and his lieutenant Manish Sisodia, spent lengthy periods in jail, directly impacting the city's governance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117037702,imgsize-1446708,width-400,resizemode-4/117037702.jpg"
Arvind Kejriwal with his freebies is AAP's best guarantee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arvind-kejriwal-with-his-freebies-is-aaps-best-guarantee/articleshow/117037671.cms,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party, which is the only party to have announced candidates for all 70 seats for the Feb 5 assembly elections in Delhi, has undergone significant transformation in its character and approach since the last polls in 2020. The party, which once talked about Congress and BJP as being chips off the same block and enmeshed in corruption, now prioritises electoral win in selecting candidates and has nominated eight individuals who were earlier members of BJP and Congress.Some long-standing members who were associated with the party since the Anna Hazare era have departed, among them Rajya Sabha member Swati Maliwal and minister Kailash Gahlot. Maliwal left after accusing Arvind Kejriwal's aide Vibhav Kumar of physically assaulting her, while Gahlot charged the party with deviating from its founding principles. The two Dalit ministers, Raaj Kumar Anand and Rajinder Pal Gautam, quit the party claiming AAP wasn't attentive to scheduled castes.Following corruption allegations against senior functionaries, AAP was beset with internal challenges until Kejriwal was released on bail from jail in Sept last year. His presence helped reunite the party and present a cohesive front to the public. Its electoral strategy continues to centre on Kejriwal's leadership, emphasising his ""ability"" to fulfil promises. The party has announced direct transfer of Rs 2,100 to women, garnering positive support among the public. To counter criticism about the funds required for such an outlay, Kejriwal described himself as a ""magician of finances"", asserting that ""only"" he knew how to save money to fund such programmes.Since the 2020 polls, AAP's leadership has undergone substantial changes, partly forced by desertions and partly by imperatives after the jailing of Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia on corruption charges. Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Durgesh Pathak rose to prominence as key party representatives, assuming duties formerly managed by Sisodia and incarcerated minister Satyendar Jain.The party has also focused on building an organisation structure with Rajya Sabha member Sandeep Pathak taking on the main responsibility. Pathak, an MP from Punjab, played a pivotal role in the party's victory in Punjab in 2022 and now focuses on grassroots mobilisation. Vijay Nayyar, who was arrested in the excise policy case, also acts as the backroom boy on formulating AAP's election strategy.For AAP, winning Delhi again is about vindicating it's stand that its functionaries were framed by BJP in a cynical turf war. Kejriwal, when resigning as CM, declared that the people's court would decide the corruption allegations. An AAP functionary said, ""The people of Delhi know that our leaders were wrongly framed after BJP realised it couldn't defeat us democratically. We have made Delhiites' lives easier. No other state gives so much to people in the form of free services.""AAP has had three significant turnouts in assembly elections. It's first ever foray as a political party in 2013 got it 28 of Delhi 70 assembly seats. It formed the govt with Congress support that lasted 49 days. In 2015, it got a landslide victory, triumphing in 67 seats. It maintained its dominance in 2020 by grabbing 62 seats. However, AAP's performance in the Lok Sabha polls has been notably poor and it failed to secure any of the seven parliamentary seats in the last three general elections. The Lok Sabha voting in terms of assembly seats shows that AAP led in only five seats in 2019, the rest going to BJP. In 2024, BJP had leads in 52 constituencies, while AAP had the upper hand in 10 and Congress in eight.","Aam Aadmi Party is the only party to have announced candidates for all 70 seats for the Feb 5 assembly elections in Delhi. The party, which once talked about Congress and BJP as being chips off the same block and enmeshed in corruption, now prioritises electoral win in selecting candidates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117037678,imgsize-31606,width-400,resizemode-4/117037678.jpg"
BJP makes graft slur against AAP campaign's pivot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-makes-graft-slur-against-aap-campaigns-pivot/articleshow/117037670.cms,"NEW DELHI: Out of power in Delhi for more than 25 years, BJP has focused its campaign on allegations of corruption against AAP functionaries and renovation of the chief minister's residence, which they refer to as ""Sheesh Mahal"". The party is yet to spell out its own agenda for governance if it manages to oust AAP.With the AAP govt's promise of a Rs 2,100 direct transfer to women being one of the talking points ahead of the polls, some Delhi functionaries are waiting for the party's nod for their strategy to somewhat blunt the threat from AAP's Mahila Samman Scheme with their own offer of direct transfer benefits to women which it could include in its manifesto.A senior party functionary said BJP is in a good position to convince people with the examples of party-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.AAP's claim that BJP will put an end to freebies related to 200 units of electricity, bus travel and water if it came to power was countered by PM Narendra Modi himself at the 'Parivartan Rally' in Rohini on Sunday. He gave the assurance that BJP won't end any of the welfare schemes being run by the AAP govt.He also targeted former CM Arvind Kejriwal over the renovation of his residence at Flag Staff Road, giving a clear indication that the issue is critical for BJP's campaign.The party, with its extensive karyakarta network and with the benefit of a decade long anti-incumbency against AAP , aims to maintain its Lok Sabha voting percentage of over fifty percent in the forthcoming election. With a vote share of 54.33 per cent, BJP made a clean sweep of all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi for the third time in a row last year. Its vote share in 2019 was 56.7 per cent.The party has conducted a year-long outreach programme in jhuggis, an AAP stronghold during the previous two Vidhan Sabha elections, to achieve this target. This approach was again evident during the PM's speech where he urged party members at the venue to record photographs and videos of Swabhiman Apartments. He instructed party workers to reach out to those who don't have pucca houses and inform them about similar housing opportunities. The PM's remarks were in reference to the 1,675 newly built flats at Swabhiman Apartments in Ashok Vihar, which were inaugurated on Friday and some handed over to slum-dwellers.The party is also counting on what it perceives as discontent against AAP. ""There is anti-incumbency against both state govt and MCD with the latter failing to keep the city clean or build roads. There is waterlogging everywhere during rain,"" pointed out a BJP functionary.What BJP, however, lacks is a chief ministerial candidate and AAP has targeted the party on the issue. However, BJP considers this approach advantageous, having successfully implemented it in several states, including Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana.While some BJP members believe having a leader matching Kejriwal's popularity could have been beneficial, the absence of a CM face prevents factionalism, which is prevalent in BJP's local unit. The party attributes its poor performance in the 2020 elections partly to naming Kiran Bedi as the CM candidate.Party insiders said that at the core of BJP's strategy is whipping up a wave in the last month. ""This involves several central leaders campaigning in Delhi, wide publicity and taking the corruption allegations against AAP leaders to the residents of Delhi. These efforts will help change people's minds,"" they said.",BJP has focused its campaign on allegations of corruption against AAP functionaries and renovation of the chief minister's residence. The party is yet to spell out its own agenda for governance if it manages to oust AAP. Some Delhi functionaries are waiting for the party's nod for their strategy to blunt the threat from AAP's Mahila Samman Scheme.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117037684,imgsize-1179598,width-400,resizemode-4/117037684.jpg"
"8 lakh voters added in past five years, but electorate shrank in 14 constituencies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/8-lakh-voters-added-in-past-five-years-but-electorate-shrank-in-14-constituencies/articleshow/117037609.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of voters in the capital increased by nearly eight lakh since the last assembly polls, but the electorate shrank in 14 constituencies in the past five years.An analysis of the electoral data provided by the office of the chief electoral officer of Delhi revealed that between the 2020 assembly polls and the final data published Monday, the number of voters increased by over 5% while it surged by more than 10 percentage points in the preceding state assembly elections.Among the major constituencies that witnessed a fall in the numbers were Delhi Cantonment, New Delhi, Rajendra Nagar, RK Puram and Laxmi Nagar.In Delhi Cantonment, the number of voters dropped from almost 1.3 lakh in 2020 to 78,893 in 2025, making it the smallest assembly constituency in the capital, and registering the highest decline of 50,445 votes (39%). In New Delhi constituency, over 1.4 lakh voters were enrolled in 2020, which dipped to less than 1.1 lakh in 2025 - a decline of 36,879 electors (25.3%).Constituencies with a significant increase in numbers included Bawana, which saw a surge of 62,413 voters (19.5%) - from less than 3.2 lakh in 2020 to over 3.8 lakh in 2025 - followed by Vikaspuri, Burari, Kirari and Okhla. The increase in Vikaspuri was recorded at 59,863 (14.8%), in Burari 58,574 (16.2%), in Kirari 45,310 (16.5%) and in Okhla 44,432 (13.2%).According to experts, the increase in the number of voters was registered more in constituencies in Outer Delhi, which have a large migrant population and where a lot of land is still available for new habitations to come up.""All constituencies that saw double-digit growth are those where the migrant population settles down,"" said Chattar Singh, who was associated with Congress for over five decades and now analyses election data independently.""Constituencies like Delhi Cantt, New Delhi and RK Puram, where the number of electors has dipped, are govt housing colonies. In New Delhi constituency, govt demolished a large number of flats in areas such as Sarojini Nagar, Kidwai Nagar and Laxmi Bai Nagar, to build highrise general pool residential accommodation, and thousands of families moved out,"" Singh said, adding, ""Similar is the case with RK Puram and Delhi Cantt, where number of govt employees seeking housing reduced.""Interestingly, the population in land-locked constituencies grew in single digits, indicating there was little scope for new families to settle here. In fact, residential areas have shrunk in the past few years due to massive commercialisation, resulting in either negative or marginal growth of electors.Voter percentage grew by just 0.4% in Chandni Chowk, and only marginally in Madipur (0.7%), Tilak Nagar (1%) and Jangpura (1%).Of the 12 reserved constituencies for Scheduled Castes, only Bawana witnessed a huge growth. Madipur (0.7%), Gokalpur (1.7%), Patel Nagar (1.8%) and Ambedkar Nagar (3.3%) saw below-average surges in the number of voters Mangolpuri (0.2%) and Trilokpuri (4.6%) saw a decline.Except Okhla, most Muslim-dominated constituencies also registered a below-average rise in the number of electors.""Overall, between 2008 and 2013, the number of voters increased by 10.1%. The rise was 11.1% between 2015 and 2020. However, it is just about 5% between 2020 and 2025. I don't know if it is natural or a deliberate one,"" said Singh.In central Delhi, Model Town (5.7%), Sadar Bazar (5.3%) and Ballimaran (8.1%) saw a modest rise in the number of electors in the past five years.","The number of voters in the capital increased by nearly eight lakh since the last assembly polls. But the electorate shrank in 14 constituencies in the past five years.

Law And Order

NEW DELHI: Few can predict voter behaviour with any certainty and political analysts and psephologists will not disagree. The capital has shown quite resolutely over the years that it can live with the Centre-state dichotomy and all issues - howsoever stark and emotive - may not be of consequence to all individuals. A cumulative effect of all the issues can set a narrative but overriding factors can come into play when one casts the vote. As the city heads for possibly the most bitterly fought elections in its history, TOI looks at the issues that could weigh on the voters' mind.If there is one issue that AAP is counting on for swaying the electorate, it is that of freebies or 'revdis', depending on which side of the political divide you stand. The bureaucracy has been raising the red flag, warning about depletion of the exchequer, but freebies have in a way been the centrepiece of the Arvind Kejriwal govt's welfare measures. These include free power for households consuming up to 200 units per month, free water up to 20,000 litres and free bus rides for women. The govt also provides free pilgrimage for the elderly, financial aid to students and healthcare services through mohalla clinics and hospitals. It has also promised Rs 1,000 per month under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana, with plans to eventually increase it to Rs 2,100 if the party returns to power. The underprivileged, bulwark of AAP's support base, see this bouquet of freebies as their lifeline, a fact being gradually acknowledged by the opposition. Congress has promised Rs 2,500 for women and BJP may be mulling such a scheme.BJP's biggest success in trying to make a comeback in the capital has been that it has gradually chipped away at the image of AAP and its founder, Arvind Kejriwal, as being ""kattar imandar"". Honesty and transparency have been the calling cards of AAP, a party forged in the crucible of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption agitation. The exigencies of running a govt has forced the party to make ideological compromises, but the plethora of cases slapped on AAP's ministers and other functionaries has dented its image. The alleged excise policy scam landed their leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, in jail and they were later let out on bail. The LG, too, has ordered a series of inquiries. Earlier, former health minister Satyendar Jain was arrested on money laundering charges. AAP has countered with its own charge of ""persecution"". However, the allegedly extravagant expenditure on renovating the CM's house has given BJP and Congress an opportunity to target AAP with charges of reckless financial spending and even graft. ""Sheesh Mahal"" is both a taunt and a potent image that AAP will have to counter convincingly.Delhi has the dubious distinction of being one of the cities in the world which have the worst air quality. It has been gasping every winter, surviving on emergency measures but unable to come up with long-term solutions because of a virtual policy paralysis. Its poisonous air contains high levels of PM2.5 and PM10, the primary concerns, besides SOx, NOx and Ozone. People expected an AAP govt in Punjab to eradicate stubble burning but that hope has been belied. Those who have the resources are relocating but most have no choice. Children on inhalers is now a common sight. Meanwhile, former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's promise in 2021 to clean the Yamuna by February 2025 and take a dip in it remains unfulfilled. The river's most polluted stretch, running for over 20km through Delhi, was found to have the worst quality metrics in four years during December 2024, with faecal coliform levels reaching 8.4 million units as against a permissible limit of 2500 units. In fact, the foam on its surface has become the photographer's wicked delight.Some attribute it to AAP's misgovernance and others to LG's interference over the past few years which stalled developmental work, but no one disputes the fact that the civic infrastructure in Delhi has suffered degradation like never before. In fact, the condition of roads is a daily reminder to people of the poor quality of life in the city. Despite repeated promises by the state govt of a 'pothole-free city', including a recent October announcement by chief minister Atishi, roads remain bumpy. In 2023, the then CM Arvind Kejriwal had introduced a comprehensive decade-long road maintenance initiative which was opposed by MCD, also under AAP, citing jurisdiction over road sanitation. The project remains unimplemented. A June 2023 amendment to Mukhyamantri Sadak Punarnirman Yojana guidelines, which enabled councillors, along with MLAs and urban development minister to allocate road development funds, has shown no tangible improvements. The decision to transfer major drainage systems to the irrigation and flood control department last year, aimed at preventing severe flooding which erodes the road surface, remains incomplete.A rise in incidents of gang wars and gangsters targeting businessmen and even small traders for extortion - often brazenly shooting at business outlets - has caused unease in the city. Lawrence Bishnoi, Himanshu Bhau, Kapil Nandu and other criminals have suddenly acquired notoriety. The Centre intervened, with Union home minister Amit Shah sending a stern message to Delhi Police in November last year. The cops have also failed to curb the frequent bomb threats sent to city schools, which have disrupted the academic calendar. Hospitals and IGI Airport were also targeted but the menacing calls have disturbed children and the parents the most.","Freebies have in a way been the centrepiece of the Arvind Kejriwal govt's welfare measures. The underprivileged, bulwark of AAP's support base, see this bouquet of freebies as their lifeline.

BENGALURU: What started as a minor fall at home for an eight-month-old infant has left his family grappling with unanswered questions about his health.The baby boy rolled off his bed in sleep on Jan 1 at his Hunsamaranahalli home, near Kempegowda International Airport, and fell about 2ft down. Startled, the child began crying but his parents were relieved to find no visible injuries or scratches.However, their relief turned into concern when the child developed high fever later that day. When the fever persisted for more than 24 hours, the child was taken to Bangalore Baptist Hospital , Hebbal.""At Baptist Hospital, the doctor initially suspected an internal injury and advised us to keep monitoring him,"" the father told TOI. ""As a precaution, they ran some tests on Jan 2.""The results, which came back on Jan 3, left the family shocked and confused. ""The doctors said our son had tested positive for HMPV, but he appeared perfectly normal. We didn't understand how he could have contracted the virus, especially when our initial concern was just a simple fall,"" the father said. ""We feel helpless.

""The hospital insists he couldn't have caught it there, but now we're left dealing with this situation.""The parents are also frustrated with the unexpected attention their child's case has garnered. ""Instead of answers, all we have is confusion, and now people keep bringing it up. It feels like he has become known for this,"" said the father.The family urged hospitals to provide people clearer communication about how such viruses are transmitted and to ensure transparency in infection-control measures.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has confirmed two cases of Human Metapneumovirus HMPV) in Karnataka through routine surveillance.

Financial burden and emotional stress are said to have forced the couple to take the extreme step.Preliminary investigation suggested Anup Kumar and Rakhi (35) poisoned their five-year-old autistic daughter Anupriya and two-year-old son Priyansh, before hanging themselves. The family was from Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, and was staying in a rented house in Sadashivanagar.On Monday, when a woman employed by the couple to take care of the children came for work, she discovered Anup hanging and raised an alarm. Neighbours rushed in and found the others dead in another room. The woman, Reshma, told police she was asked to come a little early as the family had planned to leave for Puducherry. Police checked Kumar's laptop and mobile phone and found that he had sent an email around midnight to his elder brother Amit.Based on the contents of the mail and the statements of those known to the family, police said Anup's financial troubles began after his maternal uncle Rakesh lured him into investing around Rs 25 lakh on a piece of land in Prayagraj to start a petrol bunk in 2018. The business remained a non-starter and his hard-earned money was stuck.After Anupriya was admitted to a pre-school, the couple got their daughter's medical examination done on teachers' insistence. The results suggested she was autistic. Most of Anup's salary was spent on daughter's treatment. The financial strain took a toll on his mental health.

Poll What Drives Loyalty Shifts in Politics? Personal Gain Ideology

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar seems to have some uncanny connection with political doors. In 2023, Amit Shah had shut "" BJP doors"" for the JD(U) chief and yet he managed to open it and go inside. Two years later, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad again opened ""Mahagathbandhan doors"" for Nitish but the chief minister says he is not interested.Last week, Lalu Prasad triggered fresh speculations about realignment in Bihar politics when he said that doors were open for Nitish Kumar if the JD(U) president showed willingness to snap ties with the BJP which represented ""communal forces.""Nitish Kumar, whose several political U-turns in the past have given him the dubious distinction of being the ""paltu ram"" of Bihar politics, responded with a categorical 'No' to Lalu's offer and ruled out quitting the NDA this time around. The JD(U) chief went on to call his two short-lived alliances with the RJD-Congress combine a ""mistake"". With Lalu's offer putting the focus back on his previous flip-flops, Nitish invoked former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee perhaps to add credibility to his claims of allegiance to the BJP.""It was respected Atal ji who made me a Union minister. He used to shower so much of affection on me. I never faced any difficulty in getting my proposals cleared. It was Vajpayee's wish that ""I become the CM"" when the NDA first won assembly polls in Bihar in 2005,” Nitish told reporters in Vaishali district, which he toured as part of the state-wide ‘Pragati Yatra'.Lalu's remarks on Nitish followed Amit Shah's interview last month to a news channel in which he was asked whether the NDA could go to polls in Bihar without declaring a chief ministerial candidate, like it recently did with great success in Maharashtra. When asked whether Nitish Kumar would be the face of the NDA in the upcoming Bihar elections or if the BJP would adopt a strategy similar to Maharashtra's, Shah chose not to give a clear answer. ""We will sit together and decide over the issue. Once we take a decision, we will let you know,"" he said, adding that such policy decisions are not made in public forums.Shah's response led to speculations that the BJP could insist on not projecting Nitish Kumar, who had been leading Bihar's NDA charge for close to a couple of decades, in the 2025 assembly polls. The state BJP leaders soon swung into damage control mode. Dilip Jaiswal, state minister and Bihar BJP chief said, ""We should understand that Amit Shah was trying to underscore that he was a ‘karyakarta' (worker) of a party in which big decisions are taken by the parliamentary board"". ""But, the leadership role of chief minister Nitish Kumar had been a given for long. There is no question of going back on that,” asserted Jaiswal.Ironically, in 2023, it was Amit Shah who had led the charge against Nitish Kumar after the JD(U) chief dumped the BJP and joined hands with RJD and Congress. Amit Shah had then accused Nitish Kumar of changing from ""Vikaswadi to Avsarwadi"" and had also taken swipes at his prime ministerial ambitions.However, the 2024 Lok Sabha elections has changed the equations within NDA. Both the BJP and the JD(U) won 12 seats each in the state. But the BJP is now dependent on Nitish Kumar's crucial support to run its government at the Centre. Surely, Nitish Kumar will extract a cost for this help especially after being reduced to being the junior partner in Bihar assembly. The BJP, which was the junior partner in the coalition till 2015, surged ahead of the JD(U) in the 2020 assembly elections. Nitish Kumar was reduced to 43 seats in the assembly while the BJP increased its tally to 74.On the other hand, the RJD, which has emerged as the single largest party in the last two assembly elections, is going all out to form a government in 2025. Tejashwi Yadav , who has served two stints as deputy chief minister of the state under Nitish Kumar, had led the RJD campaign in the last elections and managed to put up an impressive show. Tejashwi is confident that Nitish Kumar will be voted out in the elections this year.""It is too cold. Keep yourselves warm but do not make any wild guesses. The new year will see a new harvest (nai fasal) and a new government that will be sensitive to the people's need for health, education and jobs (padhaai, kamaai, dawaai, sunwai aur karvaayi ki sarkaar),"" said the young leader when asked about Nitish Kumar. He added, ""In the new year, my uncle (chacha) Nitish Kumar will be voted out. He has been in power for 20 years. Soil gets ruined if the same crop is sown for so long. So, it is time for the departure of Nitish ji and the NDA.""The RJD has Congress on its side, but Lalu knows the strategic importance of having Nitish in its fold to take on the BJP. The run up to the assembly elections will see a lot of flexing of muscles in both the coalitions. So, perhaps Lalu was testing the waters with his open invitation to Nitish?","In 2023, Amit Shah had shut "" BJP doors"" for the JD(U) chief and yet he managed to open it and go inside. Two years later, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad again opened ""Mahagathbandhan doors"" but the chief minister says he is not interested. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections has changed the equations within NDA.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117028173,imgsize-43652,width-400,resizemode-4/117028173.jpg"

Poll What Should Be the Immediate Priority After a Major Earthquake? Providing Shelter and Food Rescue and Medical Aid

NEW DELHI: At least 95 people were killed and over 100 injured after an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck near the Tibet-Nepal border on Tuesday morning, as reported by China's state media via AFP.""A total of 95 people have been confirmed dead and 130 others injured as of 3 pm (0700 GMT) Tuesday,"" Xinhua reported.The quake, which occurred at 6.35 am IST, had its epicentre in Tibet region, about 93 km northeast of Lobuche , Nepal, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).""Over 1,000 houses have sustained varying degrees of damage, "" Xinhua news agency said.""Dingri county and its surrounding areas experienced very strong tremors, and many buildings near the epicentre have collapsed,"" state broadcaster CCTV said.Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday emphasised ""the full-scale search and rescue efforts, minimizing casualties to the greatest extent possible, properly resettling affected residents, and ensuring their safety and warmth through the winter"", CCTV added.The earthquake, centred at a depth of 10 kilometres, also caused tremors in Bihar and several parts of North India. Lobuche, located near the Khumbu Glacier in Nepal, lies approximately 150 kilometres east of Kathmandu and is close to the Everest Base Camp.China's earthquake monitoring agency recorded the quake's magnitude as 6.8, with the epicentral region at an altitude of about 4,200 metres (13,800 feet), according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.Further, as per NCS data, two more earthquakes struck the region later in the morning.One of magnitude 4.7 was recorded at 7.02 AM IST, with its epicenter at latitude 28.60 degrees North and longitude 87.68 degrees East, at a depth of 10 kilometers.Another earthquake of magnitude 4.9 occurred at 7.07 AM IST, with its epicenter at latitude 28.68 degrees North and longitude 87.54 degrees East, at a depth of 30 kilometers.Nepal, according to experts, is exposed to earthquakes as it is in a seismically active zone, which makes quakes inevitable.The last time Nepal felt such a strong earthquake was on April 25, 2015, when a 7.8 magnitude quake killed some 9,000 people, the worst in Nepal's history, and damaged about 1 million structures. The previous deadliest earthquake that struck the region was in 1934 with over 8,000 fatalities.A day earlier, on Monday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 hit Afghanistan at 12.47 pm IST, the National Centre of Seismology (NCS) reported.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

He is the second police officer to be fired in the Jaahnavi accident case. Earlier, Daniel Auderer , vice-president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, who was seen on body camera footage making fun of her death, was fired in July 2024.According to Seattle police, interim Seattle police chief Sue Rahr, in an email sent to her employees, said she fired Dave after the Seattle office of police accountability found he had violated four department policies. The policies he failed to follow included using emergency lights for an emergency response and being responsible for safely operating a patrol vehicle.Jaahnavi (23) died after she was struck by a police patrol vehicle in Seattle. She was hit just after 8pm on Jan 23, 2023. She was rushed to Harborview Medical Centre where she succumbed to her injuries.In July 2023, body cam footage surfaced which showed Jaahnavi being struck while crossing the street and fatally run over by a Seattle police car driven by Kevin.According to FOX 13 Seattle, in the body camera video, a loud rumble of the engine was heard as Kevin's speedometer showed speeds of up to 74 mph, higher than the prescribed limits of 20 to 25 mph. Kevin was also heard saying ""I f****d up"" in the video and performing CPR on Jaahnavi after the accident.Jaahnavi's death drew international attention after an audio recording was published in Sept 2023 of officer Daniel Auderer laughing and downplaying her death, saying she had ""limited value"" and that the city should ""just write a check"" for $11,000. Auderer was fired in July for his callous commentsJaahnavi had completed her bachelor's in computer applications in April 2019 and worked with a software company in Bengaluru for two years. She later moved to Seattle, in Sept 2021, to pursue a master's in information systems at Northeastern University. She also worked part-time on her campus as an administrative and event support assistant.US media reports in Feb 2024 had quoted King County prosecutors as saying that they would not file criminal charges against Dave because there was no evidence he was impaired or driving recklessly during the collision. The Seattle city attorney's office issued Dave a $5,000 citation in March for second-degree negligent driving in the crash that killed Jaahnavi.According to the Seattle police department, Kevin was on a ""high priority one"" call.

As pilot in command (PIC), this captain had on March 1, 2024, carried operated a Bagdogra-Bengaluru flight (QP 1851) which had a hard landing at the destination. The airline closed this with just a counselling session only without any corrective training for the PIC, the regulator said in its order Monday.This came to light during an audit of Akasa conducted at its Mumbai office on Oct 10. Subsequently a show cause was issued to the pilot and the airline. The regulator found the airline’s reply unsatisfactory and has now issue its order in the case. The pilot has been directed to undergo “corrective training simulator session of two hours to cover stabilisation criteria…. (And) specific training on hazards of attempting takeoff after applying reverser and cancelling go-around decision after applying TOGA (take off go around).”The DGCA has also withdrawn the pilot’s LTC approval and short take off and landing “with immediate effect and till further orders.” LTC approval allows a providing practical training on commercial flights to trainee pilots.In the past few months, Akasa has been in the DGCA’s line of fire for its training.

This 124 million gallon per day wastewater treatment plant has already been delayed by a year and its inauguration is likely soon now.While road repair work announced by the state govt in Oct last year will continue on stretches for which tenders were floated, mega projects like the repair of Outer Ring Road are yet to be taken up. ""No new sanction or tender will be floated because polls have been announced,"" said a PWD official. ""Work on projects for which contracts haven't been awarded will also come to a halt for now.""The development of a corridor near Indira Gandhi International Airport and the plan to construct a mega integrated children's home at Alipur under the department of women and child development are likely to begin only after the assembly polls. Stuck in bureaucratic hurdles, the water bill settlement scheme, under which recipients of inflated domestic water bills have been offered a waiver, can also only be launched post-polls.Progress on MCD's long-pending multi-level parking projects at four busy locations -Rajendra Place, Rani Bagh, Shastri Park and Idgah - will also be affected. In April, the civic body attempted to give a fresh push to three projects by hiring a consultant to prepare a detailed project report and draft the tender document. But with no decision taken on hiring a consultant, any progress will be stalled.New Delhi Municipal Council's plan to redevelop the Shivaji Bus Terminal will also see a slowdown. The council recently revised the plan. The project, conceived about six years ago, aims to transform the facility into a commercial complex-cum-bus terminal, but the plan hasn't yet been finalised nor work started. Recently, NDMC decided to re-invite tenders after adding some features of international standards.Expecting the commencement of work on the creation of a 9km cycling route between New Moti Bagh and South Block-Udyog Bhawan, NDMC had approved the budget estimates and was awaiting approvals of the planning and finance departments. ""After their nod, the plan would have been placed for final approval and budget sanctioning,"" an official had said. NDMC has estimated the cost of the project at Rs 11 crore.","Public Works Department, Delhi Jal Board and Municipal Corporation of Delhi projects likely to slow down.

Centre has cleared site for Pranab memorial: Sharmistha Mukherjee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-has-cleared-site-for-pranab-memorial-sharmistha-mukherjee/articleshow/117035285.cms,"NEW DELHI: The govt has ""earmarked"" a site at Rashtriya Smriti Sthal for a memorial to late President Pranab Mukherjee. This comes amid speculation of the govt earmarking a site for former PM Manmohan Singh's memorial very soon. Singh's family is likely to visit sites shortlisted by the govt at Smriti Sthal and adjoining areas in the Raj Ghat precinct soon, sources said.Earmarking of the site for Mukherjee's memorial was made public by the late President's daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee in a tweet on Tuesday after meeting PM Modi. The land and development office (L&DO) under the housing and urban affairs ministry earmarked the site on Jan 1. Sources said as per norms, the site will be allotted to a trust after it is set up.The order said, ""The competent authority has approved earmarking of a designated site within 'Rashtriya Smriti' complex (a part of Raj Ghat precinct) for erecting a samadhi of late Pranab Mukherjee, former President.""In a post on X, Pranab's daughter Sharmistha said, ""Called on PM Narendra Modi to express thanks and gratitude from the core of my heart for his govt's decision to create a memorial for baba. It's more cherished considering that we didn't ask for it. Immensely touched by this unexpected but truly gracious gesture by PM... Baba used to say that state honours shouldn't be asked for, it should be offered. I'm so grateful that PM Modi did this to honour baba's memory. It doesn't affect baba where he is now - beyond applaud or criticism. But for his daughter, words are not sufficient to express my joy.""Sources said as per norms, the site will be allotted to a trust after it is set up. But earmarking of the site makes it clear that a memorial will be built there. The former President was cremated with full state honours at Lodhi Road electric crematorium on Sept 1, 2020. Sources said the same process is likely to be adopted for Singh's memorial, of earmarking a spot and allotting it when a trust is in place.TOI has learnt that an undeveloped land space close to Raj Ghat, sites at Rashtriya Smriti Sthal and around Sadaiv Atal, the memorial of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have been shortlisted for Singh's memorial. But the final decision will be taken after his family gives consent. Though the family was scheduled to visit the sites on Sunday, it was postponed.Sharmistha had attacked Congress after it accused the Modi govt of ""insulting"" Singh by conducting his state funeral at Delhi's Nigambodh Ghat. She said when her father passed away, Congress didn't even bother to call CWC for a condolence meeting. She had also said that a senior representative told her it's not done for presidents. ""That's utter rubbish as I learned later from baba's diaries that on K R Narayanan's death, CWC was called and condolence message was drafted by baba only,"" she had posted on X.","The land and development office (L&DO) under the housing and urban affairs ministry earmarked the site on Jan 1.

What is the use of creating an institution under a legislation and not keeping it functional?""The bench was faced with a peculiar position in Jharkhand, where state information commission (SIC) has been non-functional for the last four years.

The bench ordered the largest party in opposition, which is BJP, to nominate one of its MLAs for inclusion in the selection panel and directed the state to appoint chief information commissioner and six information commissioners within seven weeks.Laying down the timeline for compliance, the bench directed all other states to publish a list of applicants for the posts of CICs and ICs within one week, composition of search committee along with selection criteria a week thereafter, completion of interviews in next six weeks, and make appointments in the subsequent two weeks.SC asked chief secretaries of all states to file compliance reports after eight weeks and asked them to inform the level of pendency before information commissions.","SC expressed concern over continued vacancies in state and central information commissions.

Delhi elections: Stage and pitch set in 3-way capital contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-stage-and-pitch-set-in-3-way-capital-contest/articleshow/117035249.cms,"NEW DELHI: Twice in the past 10 years, Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP halted BJP's relentless victory march in head-to-head contests in Delhi, reversing 7-0 clean sweeps by the saffron juggernaut in the immediately preceding Lok Sabha polls to win thumping majorities in the assembly elections of 2015 and 2020. Will the script be repeated in 2025? Or have incumbency and charges of corruption dimmed Brand Kejriwal's lustre enough to enable BJP to triumph in a state in which it last won a majority in an assembly election in 1993? The answer will become clear on February 8, when the results of what promises to be a bitter and high-voltage election will be announced.Election Commission of India Tuesday released the poll schedule for Delhi, fixing Feb 5 as the polling date for over 1.55 crore eligible voters. Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said the poll process has to be completed by Feb 10.The outcome of the poll will be crucial for the three main players. Incumbent AAP is fighting to secure a third consecutive term in the city-state regarded as its bastion, but is looking more vulnerable here than it has in a long time. BJP dominates large swathes of India but has found success elusive for 26 years in the capital (it was voted out of office in 1998 and hasn't run a state govt in Delhi since then). Congress dominated Delhi politics from 1998 to 2013, with Sheila Dikshit serving as three-term CM, but has seen its fortunes plummet since then and is now battling to regain its vote base from AAP in order to stay relevant.While the election process will start from Jan 10 with notification of elections, the last date to file nominations is Jan 17. Nomination papers will be scrutinised on Jan 18, and candidates will be able to withdraw till January 20. The next 14 days, until the evening of Feb 3 when the silent period will begin, are expected to witness a blitzkrieg by candidates and parties vying for the attention and votes of the electorate.Though poll dates were announced only on Tuesday, campaigning has effectively been going on for several months. In fact, a brief lull after the Lok Sabha polls gave way to hectic activity after AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal was released on bail. AAP has already announced its candidates for all 70 seats, Congress has declared 48 names, and BJ. And while AAP has been busy unveiling ""guarantees"" to different sections to woo voters, the other two have not been far behind.In the 2020 polls, AAP got an impressive 53.6% of votes and won 62 of the 70 seats, while BJP managed to win the remaining eight, with a vote share of 38.5%. Congress barely managed to get 4.3% of votes and its column of seats remained empty. In the preceding election, AAP fared even better, winning 67 seats and 54.6% vote share. BJP polled 32.8% of votes and won three seats. Congress had a vote share of 9.7%, but none of its candidates could score a win.Confident of repeating his success story, Kejriwal said the election was going to be a battle between ""politics of work and politics of hurling abuses"". Calling party volunteers his greatest strength, Kejriwal urged them to rise with determination to ""defeat the opposition's machinery"".Showcasing its work in healthcare, education, power, and women's welfare as ""transformative achievements"", senior AAP functionary and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia claimed, ""Delhi will vote for a leader who has provided 24-hour electricity, ensured zero electricity bills, eased the lives of families with free pilgrimages, ensured free bus travel for women, and implemented welfare schemes with sincerity and integrity.""Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva expressed confidence that ""lotus will bloom"" in the capital and a ""double-engine govt"" will take charge. ""Those who are inflating balloons of lies and attempting to exert political pressure by threatening election officials have now been silenced. People of Delhi are resolute in their determination to oust this corrupt and plundering AAPda govt,"" Sachdeva said, adding that party volunteers were actively engaged in a door-to-door campaign across the city.Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav claimed that the people of Delhi ""desired"" to see Congress back in govt and their dream would be ""realised"" soon. ""The date has been announced for the end of the sins of corruption and misrule by AAP and BJP, to end the toxic, unbreathable air, rid Delhi of the mountains of garbage, purify the polluted Yamuna and free Delhi of crimes and lawlessness,"" Yadav said.Congress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal claimed on Feb 5, Delhi will get to make a decision on whether it wished to see ""five more years of chaos and confrontation"" between the state and Centre, or a ""stable govt"" that works solely for the people. ""Under Congress, Delhi was transformed into a modern city that responded to 21st-century needs. Be it the world-class metro or the massive infrastructure that brought connectivity, Delhi had its golden period under Congress rule,"" Venugopal said.The number of eligible voters is likely to swell further with the Delhi election office still scrutinising more than five lakh new applications for the addition of names to the voters' list. ""It is a single-phase election... We have deliberately kept polling on a Wednesday so more people come out to vote...like we did in Maharashtra,"" CEC Kumar said.Of the 70 seats in Delhi, 58 are general and 12 reserved. Kumar said bypolls to two assembly constituencies - Milkipur in Uttar Pradesh and Erode in Tamil Nadu - will also be held according to the same schedule while two constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir - Budgam and Nagrota - will vote later due to current snowy conditions.","Election Commission of India Tuesday released the poll schedule for Delhi, fixing Feb 5 as the polling date for over 1.55 crore eligible voters.

This is because model code of conduct has come into force only on Tuesday, with announcement of assembly polls in Delhi.When asked about the alleged objectionable remarks of netas like BJP candidate from Kalkaji, Ramesh Bidhuri, against Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi, Kumar said he, in general, strongly condemned degrading remarks against women.

After all, the party failed to open its account in the Delhi assembly in 2015 and 2020, a decimation that started with it being supplanted by the newbie AAP of Arvind Kejriwal in 2013 as Congress was relegated to eight seats.Delhi has held a political appeal disproportionate to its size and partial statehood, as it was used by Congress in 2003 to project its resilience in the face of BJP's sweep of polls in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and MP. The 2015 results, that defied the national mood of Narendra Modi's sweep to office, was deployed by Kejriwal to proclaim AAP as the ""new Congress"". The mood held, even if the promise did not.Going by past narrative, Congress is in an unenviable position. It is looking at its negligible muscle in Delhi to beef up the national mood, dampened by its shock defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra just after it had announced ""revival"" following LS 2024.From the national perspective, Congress would hope for a marginal bounce back and enough AAP slide that can lead to an alliance govt of estranged INDIA partners. It would give Congress just enough wiggle room to tease BJP and to portray itself as a party that matters pan-India.

This consideration is whetting motivation for the party to make a determined effort to claw back the prominence it enjoyed in a city that became a pocket of its influence much before its success in regions that it currently dominates.BJP leadership recognises that unseating AAP is not going to be an easy task because of the support Kejriwal enjoys among large sections of the poor on the strength of its welfare schemes. Lack of a face, which could be projected against the AAP boss, and a weakened organisation are seen as the other hurdles.But BJP strategists see an opening in the diminution of Kejriwal because of charges of corruption, high-handedness symbolised by 'Sheesh Mahal', the opulent residence built for him, and decade-long incumbency highlighted by crumbling infra, traffic congestion and a rotting Yamuna. The fact that AAP is in control of MCD has doubled incumbency, shutting the room for blaming poor conditions on the civic body, which was under the BJP for over 15 years.PM Modi cottoned on to Kejriwal's vulnerability by dubbing the Kejriwal experiment as ""AAP-DA (a crisis of Kejriwal's creation)"".

Ram Rahim plea: HC resumes hearing in journo murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ram-rahim-plea-hc-resumes-hearing-in-journo-murder-case/articleshow/127873636.cms,"Gurmeet Ram Rahim

CHANDIGARH: Citing the “emergence of new facts”, Punjab and Haryana HC has resumed hearing in the Ram Chander Chhatrapati murder case, more than four months after reserving its verdict on the appeal filed by Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and others.“The appeals have been finally heard on Sept 25, 2025. However, while dictating the judgment, some new facts have emerged, which require further clarification for proper adjudication of the matter,” a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Vikram Aggarwal observed in its order released on Jan 30, while starting re-hearing of the matter.On Jan 17, 2019, a special CBI court in Panchkula had sentenced the Dera chief and three others to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, editor of ‘Poora Sach’ newspaper.The Dera chief challenged the conviction before HC, claiming that he had been falsely implicated by CBI as the first chargesheet against other accused, Nirmal, Kuldeep and Krishan Lal, had already been filed and none of them had alleged his involvement in the conspiracy.Counsel for Gurmeet Ram Rahim contended that he was not named in the first chargesheet filed by police in 2002 and that his name was included in it “by way of revenge”.“The investigating agency failed to prove that the appellant ever read the said newspaper (Poora Sach). As per the prosecution’s own story, it was an evening newspaper and only reported news that had already been published by the morning newspapers. There was, thus, no question of the appellant having any grudge against the deceased,” the Dera chief’s petition stated.",Punjab and Haryana HC has resumed hearing in the Ram Chander Chhatrapati murder case.

LUCKNOW: VHP demanded Monday a ban on entry of non-Hindus at major temples in UP, including Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, widening a simmering national debate over religious sanctity and public access.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal said Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains could be exempted, contending their faiths originated in India. He alleged attempts by “ill-intentioned” non-Hindus to enter temples. On Jan 10, a 55-year-old man from J&K, identified as Ahmed Sheikh, was detained after allegedly attempting to offer namaz inside Ram Janmabhoomi temple complex. Family members said he was not mentally sound.VHP’s demand follows similar moves in Uttarakhand, where temple committees of Gangotri and Badrinath-Kedarnath have announced plans to bar non-Hindus from shrines starting with upcoming Char Dham Yatra season, after portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri reopen in April. Bansal said temples were places of worship, not tourist attractions. “The temples are not tourist spots for making reels. They are meant for worship,” he said, adding the ban should be strictly enforced to restrict the entry of people whom he described as “anasthawan” (non-believers).Pressure to restrict access has also come from Haridwar, where Ganga Sabha, a trust managing religious affairs of ghats, has demanded a ban on non-Hindus at 2027 Kumbh Mela.","VHP demands ban on entry of non-Hindus at major temples in UP.

NEW DELHI: Jailed activist Sonam Wangchuk was taken to AIIMS Jodhpur for a medical examination on Saturday after the Supreme Court sought his medical report by February 2.The 59-year-old former educationist was examined for about 90 minutes before being escorted back to prison.

HYDERABAD: Telangana police have arrested a man from Maharashtra for murdering one of his three children so that he would be eligible to contest the gram panchayat election. Those with more than two children are barred from contesting local body elections in Maharashtra.Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, who was arrested on Monday, has been accused of drowning his six-year-old daughter, Prachi, in the Nizamsagar canal in Nizamabad on Jan 29. ""Pandurang first had twin daughters, including Prachi,"" a police officer told TOI. ""Later, he had a son too. He decided to kill Prachi to realise his political ambitions.""Officials also arrested the present sarpanch of Kerur, Ganesh Shinde, for allegedly helping Pandurang plan the murder.The killing came to light after police officers from Nizamabad's Bodhan rural police station started investigating the suspicious death of an unknown girl, whose body was found in the Nizamsagar canal. To identify the girl, a constable uploaded a photograph of the body as his status message on WhatsApp and asked people to share leads. The image was also shared with other police stations.Within a few hours police officers from Mukhed taluk in Maharashtra contacted their counterparts in Bodhan and identified the girl as Prachi, barber Pandurang's daughter, who had been missing for a few days.Bodhan police officials then got in touch with Pandurang and found that he was giving inconsistent replies to many of their queries.Suspecting that Pandurang had killed his daughter, police officials tracked his mobile phone's tower locations and found out that he had brought Prachi to Telangana. During interrogation, he allegedly cracked and confessed to killing Prachi.Officials alleged that Ganesh encouraged Pandurang to contest the panchayat elections, due in about six months. However, both realised that Pandurang would be ineligible as a candidate as he had three children.Nizamabad police commissioner P Sai Chaitanya said the duo initially tried to give the girl up for adoption to couples wanting children. ""When the attempt failed, they allegedly conspired to kill Prachi. On Jan 29, Pandurang came to Nizamsagar canal with Prachi and pushed her into the water before returning to his village,"" Sai Chaitanya said.","Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, Maharashtra, was arrested on Monday.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

What happened at Heathrow?

UK incident challenges claim AI fuel switch movement was manual: Expert

MUMBAI: In a development with direct implications for the investigation into the June 12 fatal Air India Boeing 787 Ahmedabad crash, another Air India Dreamliner saw a fuel control switch move from “run” to “cut-off” after a crew member pressed it to check whether it was locked.The switch moved without the required lift action, suggesting the safeguard meant to prevent fuel supply cut off and inadvertent engine shutdown did not function as designed, sources said. The London incident challenges the controversial narrative that the Ahmedabad crash resulted from a deliberate pilot act, pointing instead to a possible and critical technical flaw in the aircraft’s fuel switch design.The incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT-ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru. The fuel control switches on the 787 require a two-step action: they must be lifted before they can be moved between “run” and “cut-off”. The safety feature is intended to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown.“The pilot lightly pushed the left fuel control switch to check if its lock feature was working and found it was not because the switch moved though it was not lifted first,” the source said. It again failed to lock the second time.But the third time the switch stayed locked and did not move without lifting. The aircraft departed at 9.40pm for Bengaluru, where it is currently grounded.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report released last July, said that both fuel control switches on the ill-fated aircraft had moved from “run” to “cut off” seconds after takeoff. The report said one pilot asked the other why did he cut off the fuel, to which the other responded that he did not do so.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report, added that no technical or design flaw was found with the aircraft so far, implying pilot action. Therafter, the DGCA mandated an inspection of the fuel switch locking system. Air India later announced that it completed these inspections and found no faults. But the London incident brings back to fore the unresolved question around switch design, its locking integrity and the possibility of inadvertent activation, said sources.A senior commander said: “The London incident directly challenges the assumption that fuel switch movement in the Air India crash was manual. Until now, the cut-off transition was treated as near-conclusive evidence of pilot action. The London event shows that uncommanded switch behaviour, through mechanical detent failure, signal corruption or other causes, is a credible failure mode. That places the DGCA’s earlier claim of fleet clearance under sharp scrutiny, as a defect appearing months later suggests inspections may have been visual, non-diagnostic, or incomplete. For the AAIB, the implication is clear: fuel cutoff can no longer be equated with intent, the investigation must widen to fleet-level and component analysis, and attribution of deliberate pilot action without fully eliminating system anomalies is no longer defensible.”Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh said: “The London incident is particularly concerning because in 2018 the US aviation regulator cautioned that fuel control switches on Boeing 787s could malfunction and lead to inadvertent engine shutdown. Occurring after Air India said its fleet’s fuel control switches have been checked, and amid the ongoing June 12 B787 crash investigation, it raises serious questions about inspection adequacy and demands the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. ”Air India, in a statement, said: “We are aware that one of our pilots has reported a possible defect on the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft. After receiving this initial information, we have grounded the said aircraft and are involving the OEM to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis. The matter has been communicated to the aviation regulator, DGCA. Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA, and had found no issues. ” Boeing said: “We are in contact with Air India and are supporting their review of this matter”.",Incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT- ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru.

GUWAHATI: India’s plan to secure the strategic “chicken’s neck” corridor to the Northeast from Bengal includes laying underground rail tracks through the nearly 40km stretch flanked by Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Monday.Vaishnaw said the Budget contains a proposal to expand railway link between the region and the rest of the country to four tracks, fulfilling a long-felt need. Northeast Frontier Railway GM Chetan Shrivastava said the underground stretch would run from Tin Mile Haat to Rangapani stations within Bengal.Decision to take the tracks underground stems from threats — overt and covert — to target the chicken’s neck, which is barely 25km wide at the narrowest point. Concerns over the corridor, being seen as India’s Achilles heel, grew after the fall of Hasina govt in Bangladesh, with some groups speaking about “choking the chicken’s neck” to cut off the Northeast. Voices have framed the region as part of their vision of a “greater Bangladesh”. Dhaka’s outreach towards China is another red flag.During the 2017 Doklam stand-off, military planners had talked about the vulnerability of the Siliguri stretch of the corridor. Any disruption here could isolate NE, severing supply lines and impeding movement of troops.“Taking the tracks underground is part of the strategy to ensure connectivity even in times of crises,” an official said.","Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the Budget contains a proposal to expand railway link between the region and the rest of the country to four tracks.

Trump Announces India-US Trade Deal, Reduces Reciprocal Tariffs On Delhi To 18%; PM Modi Reacts

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Monday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump announced an ""immediate"" India-US trade deal from Washington, adding New Delhi would move to cut tariffs and non-tariff barriers on American goods while the US reduces reciprocal tariffs on India.In a post on X, Ramesh alleged that key announcements impacting India, including the halt of Operation Sindoor, updates on India’s crude purchases from Russia and Venezuela, and now the trade deal itself, were being made from the US capital.""He announced the halt of Op Sindoor from Washington DC. He announced the updates on India’s oil purchases from Russia and Venezuela from Washington. He’s now announced an India-US Trade Deal from Washington, the full details of which are awaited,"" he wrote.""President Trump clearly seems to have some leverage over Prime Minister Modi,"" he wrote, adding that the Prime Minister appeared ""mortified of even being seen with him"", in an apparent reference to PM Modi’s earlier public bonhomie with Trump.Ramesh suggested that Modi had ""capitulated"" and questioned whether the agreement could be “the father of all deals”, using the Bollywood catchphrase “Mogambo Khush Hai” to underline the attack.""President Trump clearly seems to have some leverage over Prime Minister Modi - who is now mortified of even being seen with him, let alone engage in the usual bout of hugs. It appears Mr. Modi has capitulated finally. Surely this cannot be the father of all deals. In Washington clearly Mogambo Khush Hai,"" he said.The Congress leader's remarks came minutes after Trump, in his Truth Social post, said India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and would buy “much more” from the US and potentially Venezuela, arguing the shift would help end the Russia-Ukraine war. He also said the US would lower reciprocal tariffs from 25% to 18% and that India would move to reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the US to “zero”.Later, PM Modi thanked Trump for the tariff announcement. In a post on X, the Prime Minister said he was “delighted” that Made in India products would get a reduced tariff of 18%, and thanked the US President “on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” for the “wonderful announcement”.","Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump announced an ""immediate"" India-US trade deal from Washington.

'India Showed...': Ex-Army Chief Naravane's Remarks On Galwan Clash Resurface After Lok Sabha Row

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be published book of former Army General Manoj Mukund Naravane has shone the spotlight on the rules and regulations that restrict senior military officials from revealing classified information or crucial leadership decisions even after retirement.Senior military officials, particularly those dealing with classified information, are subject to regulations under the Official Secrets Act that restrict the publication of books or information even after retirement to prevent such classified material from becoming public.While a general one-year “cooling-off” period exists for taking up commercial or private employment, regulations for publishing secret content require prior govt clearance.""Four Stars of Destiny"", a memoir of Naravane, who was Army chief from Dec 31, 2019, to April 30, 2022, remains unpublished due to pending clearance from the defence ministry regarding sensitive details on the 2020 LAC standoff and Agnipath scheme.The book was slated to hit the stands in Jan 2024, but the Army and the defence ministry asked the publisher not to go ahead until they had reviewed its contents.There has been no official word from the publisher, author, or even the ministry on the status of the book.If the said rules and regulations are violated, govt can take legal action and such violations can also lead to the withholding of part or all of the pension of the military official concerned, as per CCS (Pension) Rules. There are chances that if the memoir is published, it could “flare up” the LAC situation with China.In May-June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in violent face-offs along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and Sikkim, most notably during the June 15, 2020, clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers. There were casualties on the Chinese side as well. This marked the deadliest confrontation in decades, leading to major troop escalations.Under the then General Naravane’s command, India and China held a series of ground-level talks that led to “disengagement” in a phased manner from the stand-off areas. As of today, the situation along LAC is characterised by a “thaw” following a series of disengagement agreements, yet high-level military forward deployment from both sides persists.",Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be published book of former Army General Manoj Mukund Naravane has shone spotlight on rules and regulations.

12-yr-old lured into trading Rs 85L jewellery for ‘unlimited momos’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-yr-old-lured-into-trading-rs-85l-jewellery-for-unlimited-momos/articleshow/127871310.cms,"Generative image

LUCKNOW: Gold buys food. In eastern Uttar Pradesj, food brought gold. For a 12-year-old schoolboy, an offer of unlimited free momos was worth more than the metal locked in a family cupboard. For two roadside vendors, the boy’s craving turned into a gold mine.Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers near Dumari Chauraha in Deoria — about 350km east of Lucknow — trading ornaments for what he was promised would be a lifetime supply of free dumplings. The trail surfaced when jewellery vanished from the cupboard. The boy’s mother and aunt went looking. The cupboard was empty. Questions followed. The child broke down and told his father he had traded the valuables for “unlimited free food for a lifetime”.According to a complaint filed by the boy’s father, a temple priest, the child had grown fond of momo sold at the roadside stall.The vendors allegedly began feeding him free of cost, winning trust bite by bite. Soon came bigger offers — food, small sums of money, loyalty.Then persuasion. Unaware of the stakes, the boy began removing jewellery from home and handing it over, police said.Gold necklaces. Rings. Bangles. Mangtika. Nose pins. Earrings. Silver toe rings. Family heirlooms, one snack at a time. The vendors vanished soon enough.The priest approached police on Feb 1, alleging the momo sellers threatened the child with dire consequences to keep him silent. Police teams are now searching for the two fugitives and tracing the jewellery trail, SHO Devendra Kumar Singh said, adding legal action will follow. Other suspects are also being questioned.",Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers.

Two suspects detained in Samba; searches launched in Udhampur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-suspects-detained-in-samba-searches-launched-in-udhampur/articleshow/127870532.cms,"Representative photo

JAMMU: Two terror suspects were detained in Cantonment Area in J&K’s Samba district on Monday, even as multiple cordon-and-search operations continued across several regions of Jammu division, including snowbound Kishtwar’s Chatroo-Dolgam-Dichhar belt, where Operation Trashi-I entered its 16th day. Late Sunday, a search operation was launched in Joffer area in Udhampur’s Rampur sector following reports of suspicious movement.“Terrorist movement was reported in the upper reaches of Udhampur. Search operations are also underway in the high-altitude, forested areas of Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Doda, and Reasi districts,” an official said.Around 10.30am Monday, a Quick Reaction Team caught two men near an old quarter of the Army in railway area. “One person was sleeping outside, near the shaft, while the other was found inside. Both were taken into custody and sent to Bari Brahmana PS for further action,” an official source said. “One of the men was identified as Muneer Khan from Chang, in Jammu district. He said he works in Flaxfour Company, Bari Brahmana. The other man was identified as Pawan Singh from Neeli village in Udhampur district,” the source added.On Jan 6, Punjab Police detained a minor in Pathankot on charges of spying and for allegedly sharing confidential information via social media to terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers. The detention prompted a statewide alert for similar espionage activities involving children.Due to its proximity to the international border, Samba serves as a gateway for terrorists to reach Kashmir Valley via the upper reaches of Samba-Udhampur-Doda-Kishtwar. The district remains a hotspot of terrorist activities.Under Operation Trashi-I, security forces have engaged in four encounters with terrorists in the past fortnight. Initial contact was established in Sonnar forest near Mandral-Singhpora, Chatroo, on Jan 18, in which eight security personnel were injured, one of whom eventually succumbed. On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead. A brief gun battle occurred in Dolgam on Jan 31.Braving inclement weather, troops have been trudging through hostile, forested terrain to track and kill a group of three holed-up ultras. Security agencies were also trying to trace terrorist sympathisers who may have helped the ultras with food and shelter. Mobile internet services (all bandwidths) have remained temporarily suspended within a 6km-radius covering Singhpora, Chingam, and Chatroo since Jan 30 as a security measure.Officials said the terrorists, on the run for more than two weeks now, had been continuously changing hideouts. Additional forces were roped in to fortify the cordon, and sniffer dogs were deployed to assist the troops on the ground. The region was put under aerial surveillance using drones and choppers to plug possible escape routes.",Two terror suspects were detained in Cantonment Area in J&K’s Samba district on Monday.

JAMMU: J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) on Monday urged BJP to move beyond demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu and instead press the Centre to restore statehood to the Union territory.Surinder Choudhary, deputy chief minister in the Omar Abdullah-led govt, accused BJP of raising the NLU issue as part of its claims about discrimination against Jammu while remaining silent on larger concerns.“They (BJP) wake up every morning and start shouting that the Omar govt is discriminating against Jammu,” NC’s Choudhary said on the opening day of the J&K assembly’s 27-day budget session in Jammu.J&K has no NLU at present but the demand for it to be located in Jammu gained traction after CM Omar said last year that it would come up in Kashmir’s Budgam. Omar has rejected the recent BJP demands, calling the controversy “politically motivated” and pointing out that there were no protests in the Valley when Jammu was given both an IIT and an IIM.Deputy CM Choudhary stressed that J&K faced far more pressing issues than NLU and accused BJP of abandoning its promise of restoring statehood. “Why is he not asking the Centre to fulfil the promise of statehood,” Choudhary said.He was referring to Sunil Sharma, BJP leader of opposition who joined students’ protests at Jammu University over the NLU.A legislator from Jammu’s Nowshera, Choudhary rejected allegations of discrimination, arguing the NC govt would not have revived the “Darbar Move” after four years if that was the case.In June 2021, LG Sinha’s administration ended the Darbar Move, a 149-year-old practice of shifting the seat of govt between Srinagar and Jammu every six months. Sinha described the system as “a big racket”. Before its abolition, over 10,000 state employees shuttled between the two cities twice a year, boosting trade and commerce in Jammu. The Omar-led govt resumed it this year after demands from Jammu’s traders, who said its suspension had hurt business.Referring to the NLU demand, deputy CM Choudhary flagged “lack of statehood” as the biggest issue, leading to local jobs being taken away by “outsiders”. “BJP has a habit of sitting on roads and accusing the govt of discrimination. But they don’t look at Jammu University, where not a single vice-chancellor has been from Jammu. Are our professors from Jammu not capable of leading the university? But BJP will not talk about it,” Choudhary said.",J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) on Monday urged BJP to move beyond demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu.

'Nonsense, Lies': BJP Blasts Rahul Gandhi For Citing Ex-Army Chief Naravane's Memoir, Oppn Hits Back

'I'm quoting an article': Rahul Gandhi reiterates his stance

NEW DELHI: The Budget Session of Parliament witnessed sharp exchanges on Monday after Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attempted to quote from an unpublished memoir of former Army chief Gen MM Naravane (retd) during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address.The incident triggered strong objections from the treasury benches, leading to repeated disruptions and adjournments. Following the prolonged deadlock, the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day and will reconvene at 11 am on Tuesday.The controversy erupted when Gandhi rose to respond to remarks by BJP MP Tejasvi Surya , who had questioned the Congress party’s nationalism. Gandhi said that he wanted to counter those allegations by citing passages related to the India-China border situation from what he described as the former Army chief’s memoir.However, defence minister Rajnath Singh objected, questioning whether the book being cited had been formally published or authenticated. He told the House that unpublished material could not be quoted and accused the Congress leader of misleading Parliament.Speaker Om Birla subsequently ruled that unpublished books or magazine articles not directly related to the proceedings could not be read out in the House.Despite the ruling, Congress leader maintained that the excerpts he was referring to were authentic and available through a published magazine article citing the memoir, triggering repeated protests from treasury benches and counter-sloganeering from the Opposition.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju later accused Gandhi of defying the Speaker and violating House rules. Speaking to reporters, Rijiju said the Leader of Opposition had ignored the Chair’s ruling repeatedly.“Right from the beginning, Rahul Gandhi flouted rules. Even after the Speaker’s ruling, he kept repeating the same mistake and wasted half an hour of the House,” Rijiju said.Union minister Giriraj Singh also criticised Gandhi’s conduct, calling it “childish behaviour.” He said the dignity of the House required members to adhere strictly to the agenda under discussion.“The way Rahul Gandhi is displaying indiscipline and refusing to obey the Speaker’s orders is unfortunate. He should have confined himself to the President’s Address,” Singh said.BJP MP Jagdambika Pal described the episode as unprecedented and embarrassing. “This must have happened for the first time since Independence that a member was asked repeatedly to stop and still continued. His address was condemnable and action should be taken,” Pal said.The Opposition, however, rallied firmly behind Gandhi, accusing the government of stifling debate on national security. Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Gandhi was not attempting to defame the armed forces.“He was not trying to defame the army. He was reading an excerpt attributed to a former Army chief. The government always reacts like this when something uncomfortable comes out,” she said.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, ""He never got a chance to lay out his concerns. The article does not blame the forces or the soldiers at all. The issue is about some of the decisions that were taken or not taken by the central government. And that clearly is what Rahul ji intended to raise. All I can say is I think the government did not need to overreact.""Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said that it was unfortunate that the Leader of Opposition was not allowed to speak on an issue of national importance. “National security is a crucial issue. Not allowing him to speak on this matter is not right. We hope the Speaker will give justice,” Hooda said.Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that Gandhi had raised substantive issues related to Doklam, Ladakh and India-China relations. Accusing the government of avoiding scrutiny, Singhvi said, “Instead of answering questions, you are blocking them. This suppresses matters of public interest.”Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee alleged that Parliament was losing its democratic character. “Every right of MPs is being taken away. If someone has violated rules, there are procedures, but this is not the way,” he said.Congress MP Karti Chidambaram questioned the demand for an apology over historical events. “What happened in 1962 happened in 1962. Rahul Gandhi was not part of the government then. We want to discuss the conduct of the present government, which the former Army chief has written about,” he said, adding that those views appeared “inconvenient” for the ruling dispensation.TMC MP Mahua Moitra widened the attack, alleging intimidation of Opposition voices both inside and outside Parliament. She cited restrictions faced by people at Banga Bhawan in Delhi as an example of shrinking democratic space.As tempers flared, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav urged the Speaker to allow the Leader of Opposition to speak, saying issues related to China were sensitive and deserved discussion.Despite interventions, the deadlock persisted, forcing multiple adjournments of the Lok Sabha before proceedings were finally suspended for the day.During the session, Gandhi defended his attempt to raise the issue, asserting that national security should not be curtailed in parliamentary debate. Speaking inside the House amid the uproar, he said that the matter had made the government uncomfortable.“I consider national security to be the most important issue in the country. I understand that it has made the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister uncomfortable. If they are not, they should allow me to speak. Rajnath Singh ji is sitting here and he is aware of this matter. He is the person who spoke to General Naravane,” Gandhi said.After the House was adjourned, the Congress leader reiterated his position while speaking to reporters outside Parliament, insisting that he was not expressing personal views but referring to the former Army chief’s account.“This is not me, this is what the Army Chief (former) has written in a book. The book is not being allowed to be published. It is languishing, and this is the Army Chief's perspective,” Gandhi said.Questioning the government’s objections, he asked why it was reluctant to allow discussion on the contents attributed to the memoir.“Why are they so scared of what the Army Chief has to say? We will learn something from it. Of course, we will learn something about a Prime Minister. We will learn something about Rajnath Singh ji. But we will also learn something about the Army and how it was let down by the political leadership of the country,” he said.Congress leader further claimed that the references to the memoir had already appeared in a published article and that he was quoting from that source.“I am quoting the article. They are not letting me speak. They are scared because if it comes out, the reality of Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh will be revealed to the people and what happened to the 56-inch chest when China was standing against us, advancing?” he asked.","Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day and will reconvene at 11 am on Tuesday.

NASHIK: The Jalgaon health department cancelled nearly 3,000 delayed birth and death certificates after it found they were generated illegally, and reported the matter to the state govt.Dr Sachin Bhayekar, the district health officer, said the administration, at the beginning of Jan 2026, received information that illegal delayed birth and death certificates were generated and delivered from Bhatpuri village in Parola taluka. Subsequently, an investigation was launched.“Upon going through the details, the district administration found that since 2016, when the online process for registration began, a user ID was generated for Bhatpuri, a far-flung village, but it was never used. However, at least 4,907 delayed birth and death certificates were generated from the village,” the officer said. The matter came to light after the administration got an alert from the Yavatmal district administration about several certificates being generated from Bhatpuri.It was found the certificates were issued for the period 2010 to 2025, and they were all processed during Nov-Dec 2025. “The names in whose favour the certificates were generated included the likes of Sarita Devi and Gopal Das, and some Muslim-sounding names.However, Patil, Mahajan, Bhil, etc, are the common surnames of people who live around this area. The investigation also covered the neighbouring village of Ratale but, there too, people with such names/surnames were not found,” Bhayekar said.The district administration conducted a thorough investigation and found that there was no record of these names. The health department raised the issue with state govt and informed the state registrar. Following directives from the state registrar, the health department started cancelling the certificates. So far, close to 3,000 certificates have been cancelled. The entire process will be completed in a week’s time.Bhayekar said a special investigation team was set up at the district level. An FIR was also registered against unknown people.","The Jalgaon health department cancelled nearly 3,000 delayed birth and death certificates.

Ajit Pawar’s Sudden Air Crash Death Sparks Massive Shockwave Across Bollywood and Politics

Parliament panel on Ajit Pawar's death

MUMBAI: India’s charter aviation sector has grown steadily, filling a crucial gap left by airlines by connecting smaller towns & airports. But industry insiders say safety compliance across non-scheduled operators is uneven and often weaker than airline standards. Implementation of pilots' flight duty time limits, maintenance standards & weather-related decision-making vary widely between operatorsCharter flying offers speed, flexibility and access to places far beyond an airline’s scheduled network, making it the fastest way to reach remote destinations. But this convenience, which is the very core that defines charter operations, also exposes a fundamental difference in how safety is prioritised. Unlike in airline operations, decisions on whether to operate or land are often taken closer to the cockpit, where passenger urgency and convenience can weigh heavily, sometimes pushing safety to the second place.“Non-scheduled flights carry high-net-worth passengers with a fixed objective, an event, a meeting, a function. That creates immense pressure on pilots to land at the intended destination at all costs, even when diversion would be the safer option,” said Capt Manoj Hathi, former senior flight operations inspector at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Capt R K Bali of the Business Aircraft Operators Association said India’s non-scheduled aircraft operators have a fleet of about 300 aircraft. “The need of the hour is a pre-flight open, clear communication between pilot and the passenger. The pilot should carry out an objective assessment of the risk involved for a given flight and brief the passenger especially when flying into a small uncontrolled airport with no landing aids in marginal weather conditions. The pilot should be under no duress from anyone to make the landing, because ultimately the buck stops at the pilot”.But that is often not the case. A senior pilot spoke about the pressure the crew comes under. “When a politician travels by road, traffic is stopped, junctions sealed and inconvenience is imposed on everyone else in the name of the VIP safety. When the same politician travels by air, the inconvenience quietly shifts to rest solely on the pilot. A chartered aircraft is expected to get in and get out, often to small airfields and on tight timelines because a meeting, a rally or a public appearance cannot be missed. ”Then there are other aspects that influence the safety standards in charter aircraft operations. Unlike scheduled airlines, where pilot flight duty time limitations are tightly monitored and crew can be replaced at short notice, charter operations operate with limited manpower. “There is an expectation that you should be able to fly whenever you want. Passengers are frequently late, and replacement crew are rarely available except at the main base,” said Capt Hathi. Irregular schedules also impact pilot proficiency. Charter pilots often lack the consistency that airline crew benefit from, affecting skill retention and operational discipline. The sector also struggles to retain experienced flight crew. “Many first officers and captains see charter flying as a steppingstone to airlines. Attrition is high. Many captains are older, retired from airlines, or were not selected elsewhere,” said an operator.Capt Hathi said, “Training infrastructure is another weak point. Most non-scheduled operators do not have dedicated training departments comparable to airlines, largely due to cost constraints. Refresher training and procedural updates are often left to self-study. The problem is compounded when operators maintain multiple aircraft types within small fleets, making standardisation of procedures difficult. ”Short-notice flights such as medical evacuations or emergency travel add another layer of complexity. “There is often insufficient time for proper briefing or preparation,” said a source. Compounding this, pilots in charter operations are responsible for tasks that airlines distribute across multiple departments. Flight preparation, loading calculations, technical documentation and coordination are often handled solely by pilots, meaning their effective duty begins hours before the recorded reporting time. These factors create a system where compliance depends heavily on individual operators and pilots rather than institutional safeguards as is the case with airlines.","Safety compliance across non-scheduled operators is uneven and often weaker than airline standards.

How much do genes decide

NEW DELHI: You can eat right, exercise daily and avoid every bad habit — but your genes may still have a major say on how long you live. A major new study suggests that nearly half of human lifespan is determined by genetics, challenging the belief that lifestyle and environment shape longevity the most.Published in Science, the research shows that once deaths caused by accidents, infections and other external factors are excluded, about 55% of the human lifespan is heritable, meaning that more than half of the observed variation in longevity across a population is attributable to genetics. That is a much greater proportion than the previous estimates of 10-25%, according to the research, published on Jan 29.The findings are based on an analysis of more than a century of lifespan data from large Scandinavian twin cohorts in Denmark and Sweden. Researchers studied identical and non-identical twins raised together and apart, as well as siblings of US centenarians. Most participants were born between 1870 and 1935, a period marked by high mortality from infectious diseases and accidents.By separating such “extrinsic” deaths from those linked to biological ageing, the study found the true influence of genetics on longevity had been masked. Once these external causes were accounted for, lifespan similarities between identical twins became far stronger.It also helps explain why genetic influence on lifespan appears clearer today. As deaths from infections, violence and accidents have declined over time, role of genes in determining longevity has become more visible.Indian experts say the findings carry important public health implications. Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-DOC, said genetics plays a major role in biological ageing but warned that Indian conditions could blunt this advantage. “About half of human lifespan is genetically determined once external causes are excluded, but poor nutrition, air pollution, and rising diabetes and obesity can override genetic advantages and accelerate biological ageing,” he said.Dr Ambrish Mithal, group chairman, Endocrinology and Diabetes, Max Healthcare, said longevity reflects a balance between inheritance and environment. “Genetics provides a broad upper limit for lifespan, while epigenetics and lifestyle determine how close one comes to that limit,” he said, explaining that environmental factors can switch genes on or off without altering DNA itself. Scientists caution the findings do not mean that lifespan is fixed at birth. Nearly half of lifespan variation is still shaped by lifestyle, healthcare access and living conditions. However, the study suggests that genes set the biological ceiling — and the environment determines whether people reach it. Researchers say the findings could reshape debates on ageing and longevity, while reinforcing the urgency of tackling risks that shorten the biological lifespan.","Major new study suggests that nearly half of human lifespan is determined by genetics.

INDORE: What a mother hears, the child remembers — or so the epics say. Abhimanyu learned how to breach a battle formation before he was born. Madhya Pradesh is turning that belief into policy with Garbh Sanskar rooms planned across govt hospitals to “educate the mind of the fetus”.These dedicated spaces are meant to guide expectant parents through prenatal care rooted in traditional Indian practices, from positive thinking and lifestyle discipline to diet and emotional well-being. The idea: shape the mind of the unborn.CM Mohan Yadav announced the initiative Sunday in Indore, placing it under the Ayushman Bharat scheme and linking it to the Union ministry of Ayush.The programme promises “structured prenatal guidance aimed at holistic foetal development”, blending Ayurveda with modern medicine. Speaking at the Divya Santan Prakalp (Divine Child Project) event, Yadav framed Garbh Sanskar as a long-term investment. “This is about nurturing a physically, mentally and ethically strong future generation,” he said. “It combines scientific understanding with India’s traditional knowledge systems. ”Future govt hospital designs will mandatorily include Garbh Sanskar rooms, he said, signalling a shift in how public healthcare approaches pregnancy.Yadav said allopathy practitioners are increasingly recognising the value of comprehensive prenatal care, while the state continues to promote normal deliveries and strengthen maternal and child health infrastructure. To underline the belief behind the project, the CM reached into the epics. Abhimanyu and Ashtavakra symbolise how learning and values can be absorbed in the womb, he said. The pandemic showed the power of integrated healthcare, where Ayurveda and allopathy worked side by side, he added.He also pointed to the scientific relevance of rural lifestyles, indigenous diets and traditional Indian kitchens.Officials said the programme will counsel couples on nutrition, mental health, emotional bonding and prenatal practices, positioning pregnancy as both a medical and cultural journey. There is, however, an unspoken caveat embedded in the very story driving the idea: mothers must stay awake for the full session. Abhimanyu learned how to enter the deadly Chakravyuha while still unborn — but not how to exit. His mother Subhadra fell asleep midway through the lesson. The result was fatal.",Madhya Pradesh is turning that belief into policy with Garbh Sanskar rooms planned across govt hospitals.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday recorded its agreement with a petitioner that mere self-declaration of caste identity by an individual during the proposed caste enumeration in 2027 could not help in accurate determination of SC, ST and OBC population.Appearing for social activist Akash Goel, advocate Mukta Gupta told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the directorate of census operations, which has commenced preparatory work for Census 2027, has not disclosed “any predetermined criteria or standardised methodology” for recording caste identity of people belonging to SC, ST and OBC categories during census.Since caste-enumeration would play a big role in devising and implementation of social welfare measures, reservations in govt employment and admissions to educational institutions, and delimitation of parliamentary and assembly constituencies, it should be scientifically foolproof in gathering data, the PIL petitioner said.The CJI-led bench said, “In principle we agree with you. But it is the job of the experts, and it is for them to devise the mode and the way caste enumeration is to be carried out.”Though SC did not entertain the plea, it asked Gupta to give the petition in form of representation to directorate of census operations for necessary action.

BENGALURU: What should have been an ordinary, even joyful, phase of life has been violently upended for 31-year-old Shalini Kumari Dubey, a Bengaluru professional and mother to a 17-month-old toddler.Days that once revolved around work, cuddles and caring for her breastfeeding child are now spent in a hospital bed, recovering from a brutal dog attack that has left her with more than 80 stitches across her face, throat and head — and scars that go far beyond the physical.Early on Jan 26, Shalini had stepped out for morning walk near home in HSR Layout’s Teachers’ Colony.A neighbour’s pet Rottweiler allegedly released onto the road without a leash or muzzle, lunged at her, pinning her to the ground and attacking her face and neck.CCTV footage shows the dog charging at the woman the moment its owner opened the gate.“There was no chain, no muzzle, no safety measures,” said Shalini’s husband Satya Prakash Dubey. Shalini survived, but only just. She underwent nearly eight hours of surgery. One deep wound, 7cm long, was dangerously close to her airway. “Another centimetre and it could have been fatal,” Satya Prakash said.Doctors have warned that some scars may be permanent. Hospitalised for more than a week, Shalini struggles with flashbacks and anxiety and has begun consulting a clinical psychologist.For Shalini, the big worry is whether her young child will recognise her due to her facial injuries. A police complaint was filed after the hospital flagged it as a medico-legal case. An FIR was registered against the dog’s owner, N Amaresh Reddy, for negligence. Neighbours claim the dog had displayed aggressive behaviour earlier as well. Satya Prakash said a delivery executive was once attacked.“There were warnings. The owners ought to have acted back then. This is not about dogs-versus-humans. This is about irresponsible ownership. My wife’s life changed forever. No family should go through this,” Satya Prakash said.","Shalini Kumari Dubey, 31, is a mother to a 17-month-old toddler.

'Regime Changes In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal Building Cases Of Bad Governance': NSA Ajit Doval

NEW DELHI: Justifying detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk under National Security Act, govt on Monday told Supreme Court that he was trying to create political and social unrest in Ladakh and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.Appearing before a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the activist was appealing to Gen Z to come out on the street against govt to create a problem in Ladakh which is very sensitive as it shares borders with countries that are not very friendly.

He said the order of detention was served upon him which took almost four hours as he was shown all of his offensive video clips which was relied upon to detain him. The entire procedure was videograpped.Reading out Wangchuk’s speech, the SG told SC he was talking about the Arab Spring and what happened in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to instigate people to come out in large numbers against govt. “You are asking Gen Z to come out. You are anticipating or hoping for a riot-like situation in Nepal. It is a clear instigation...

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought responses from Centre and states on a petition by National Council of Churches alleging freedom of religion laws enacted by states violate citizens’ fundamental rights by criminalising voluntary and conscience-based conversions and arguing that prior govt-approval for conversion violates individuals’ right to privacy.One of the laws challenged by the association is the nearly 60-year-old Orissa Freedom of Religion Act, 1967. Madhya Pradesh had enacted Chhattisgarh Dharma Swatantrya Adhiniyam in 1968 to prevent large-scale conversion of tribals.SC had upheld the constitutional validity of the Orissa and MP laws in 1977 in Rev Stanislaus vs State of MP case and said while the right to propagate religion is a fundamental right, it does not include right to convert.Arunachal had enacted a similar law in 1978; Gujarat in 2003; Himachal in 2007; Jharkhand in 2017; Uttarakhand in 2018; MP, UP and Karnataka in 2021; and Haryana in 2022. Given the challenges to state freedom of religion laws in several HCs, SC had transferred all petitions to itself in 2023. Rajasthan passed freedom of religion law in 2025.Challenging all the laws, the churches association, through senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, said the laws presume all conversions happen through allurement, fraud or coercion and hence call for prior intimation and inquiry and permission from a district magistrate, thus compelling individuals to justify personal decisions.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said states have sufficient basis to enact these laws and that a constitution bench of SC has already approved the constitutional validity of these laws. That decision covers the pending cases as well as this fresh one, he held.The petitioner said the laws have deliberately defined conversion, allurement and inducement vaguely to give uncanalised discretion to the authorities, which ‘produces a chilling effect on free speech, religious propagation’. The association said stricter provisions relating to conversion of women in freedom of religion laws “deny women equal decisional autonomy”.The petitioner said, “Implementation of the impugned Acts across states reveals a uniform pattern of misuse. Routine worship, prayer meetings, charitable activities and interfaith marriages are criminalised through expansive interpretations of ‘allurement’ and ‘inducement’.”“Vigilante groups function as de facto enforcers, while police authorities act mechanically on complaints without independent scrutiny. This state-enabled vigilantism legitimises social hostility, instils fear among minority communities, thereby corroding the secular fabric of the Constitution,” it said.","Supreme Court seeks responses from Centre and states on petition by National Council of Churches.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission , in its meeting with TMC president Mamata Bannerjee on Monday, red-flagged the repeated use of abusive and threatening language by party MLAs against the commission and its field officers as well as vandalisation of SIR-related offices in Bengal by party workers and MLAs.While also listing blatant violations of EC’s lawful directions by the Bengal administration, CEC Gyanesh Kumar on Monday firmly conveyed to Mamata that the “rule of law shall prevail and anybody taking law into their own hands shall be dealt with strictly, as per provisions of law and powers vested in the Commission”.“No pressure, obstruction, or interference of any kind by anyone should be exerted on officers engaged in SIR work,” it was underlined.Sources said even though the CEC and the two election commissioners heard Mamata patiently on all her concerns regarding SIR and offered polite explanations, “she raised false allegations, misbehaved, thumped the table and left in a huff”.Earlier during the meeting, EC brought up failure of the Bengal administration to release the honorarium payable to BLOs in a timely manner, and cautioned against any further delay.Only Rs 7,000 out of Rs 18,000 due to each BLO has been paid as of now, by the state. EC also complained about the state’s failure to spare officers at the level of sub-magistrate or tehsildar, for deployment as EROs or assistant EROs.EC pointed out that it had on Jan 20 moved a proposal for appointment of returning officers (ROs) as per the criteria. “At present ROs in only 67 assembly constituencies are of SDO/SDM rank.”Other prickly issues raised by EC on Monday include transfers of three electoral roll observers in Bengal without consultation with EC. It had requested for cancellation of transfer orders on Jan 27 but no action has been reported so far.Bengal govt has, as per an EC source, also defied EC’s instructions dated Aug 5, 2025 to register FIR against four officers (two EROs and two AEROs) and one data entry operator for their failure to perform their statutory duties and for violating data security policies by sharing log-in credentials with unauthorised persons. A stern reminder was sent by EC in the matter on Jan 12 this year.",Election Commission red-flagged the repeated use of abusive and threatening language by party MLAs against the commission and its field officers.

Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta on Monday announced that the Delhi government is expecting to commission a new 105 million gallon per day (MGD) water treatment plant at Chandrawal in 2026.The pending project, aimed at strengthening the capital's water supply system, was originally approved in 2012 but faced years of delays, officials said.Charging a review meeting of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) in preparation for the upcoming summer season, Gupta stated that the new plant is expected to significantly enhance both the quality and reliability of drinking water in the city.""Once commissioned, the Chandrawal water treatment plant is expected to significantly improve the quality and reliability of drinking water supply in the city,"" Gupta said.The project will cover an area of approximately 92 square kilometres, accounting for around 6.2 per cent of Delhi's total geographical area, and is expected to benefit nearly 11 per cent of the city's population, she added further.The chief minister further informed that, constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 599 crore, the project was stalled due to repeated tender cancellations and non-compliance with guidelines of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) during the previous government's tenure.""These delays led to a cost escalation of nearly Rs 400 crore,"" she added.As part of the project, the government is also replacing water supply and distribution pipelines for Rs 1,331 crore.""Of the three distribution projects -- West Chandrawal, East Chandrawal and Central Chandrawal -- two have already been awarded,"" Gupta said further.The pipeline replacement work will span nine Assembly constituencies, covering areas such as Karol Bagh, Civil Lines, Kamla Nagar, Patel Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Naraina, New Rajendra Nagar and surrounding localities.The project also includes strengthening underground reservoirs, installation of water meters, measures to prevent contamination and the establishment of grievance redressal centres.According to the chief minister, the government aims to reduce non-revenue water losses from the current 30-45 per cent to below 15 per cent within three years. Maintenance of the newly laid pipelines will be carried out under a separate 12-year agreement.","The pending project, aimed at strengthening the capital's water supply system, was originally approved in 2012 but faced years of delays.

'Sonam Wangchuk tried to provoke Gen Z': Centre's massive 'Nepal-Bangladesh' charge in Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sonam-wangchuk-tried-to-provoke-gen-z-centre-ladakh-admins-nepal-bangladesh-charge-in-supreme-court/articleshow/127864489.cms,"Sonam Wangchuk (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk attempted to ""instigate"" Ladakh’s youth for protests inspired by regime-toppling movements in neighoburing Nepal and Bangladesh, the Centre and the Union territory administration said in the Supreme Court on Monday.Wangchuk was detained in September last year two days after deadly violence during pro-statehood protests in his native Ladakh. He is detained under the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and has been lodged in a prison in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.The NSA empowers the Centre and states to detain individuals to prevent them from acting in a manner ""prejudicial to the defence of India"". The maximum detention period is 12 months, although it can be revoked earlier.The Supreme Court is currently hearing a writ petition filed by Wangchuk’s wife, social entrepreneur Gitanjali J Angmo, challenging his detention.“Wangchuk carefully crafted his speeches to mobilise Gen Z, urging agitations similar to those in Nepal and Bangladesh, while invoking Mahatma Gandhi’s speeches to mask his true intentions. He also referenced ‘Arab Spring’-style movements that led to the overthrow of multiple governments in the Arab world,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PV Varale.Mehta further alleged that the former educationist sought to create a rift between the central government and the people of Ladakh by framing the government as “them” and the people as “us.” He also claimed Wangchuk called for a “plebiscite” and “referendum.""“There is no ‘them’ or ‘us’—we are all Indians. Ladakh shares borders with China and Pakistan, making it a very fragile region. His speeches must be considered in their entirety. He was allegedly misleading young people while selectively invoking Mahatma Gandhi, who never incited people against their own government,” the SG told the bench.Mehta argued that the district magistrate of Leh—the Union Territory capital where violence erupted on September 24, 2025—had carefully reviewed relevant materials, including videos of Wangchuk’s speeches, before issuing the preventive detention order. “It took four hours for the detention order to be executed. After the district magistrate passed it, a DIG-rank officer briefed him and showed him videos of Wangchuk’s speeches, explaining the grounds for detention,” the SG noted.Addressing the petitioner's contention that the district magistrate relied on “borrowed material,” Mehta maintained that this argument is flawed. “The district magistrate is not required to witness every speech firsthand. Officials who heard the speeches recorded videos and submitted them as evidence. Based on these materials, the order was passed,” he contended.The arguments remained inconclusive and are set to continue on Tuesday.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk was detained in September last year.

"MGNREGA to oppn’s principal issue, could trigger stormy budget session",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mgnrega-to-oppns-principal-issue-could-trigger-stormy-budget-session/articleshow/127756139.cms,"NEW DELHI: MGNREGA will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the Modi govt during the budget session of Parliament, with its demand for the rural job scheme’s restoration likely to trigger stormy exchanges in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Opposition INDIA bloc, which held a coordination meeting in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday ahead of the start of the session, also decided to fully participate in the session which includes the Union budget and the Motion of Thanks to the President’s joint address. The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is another issue on the opposition’s agenda.In the strategy discussions, attended by Rahul Gandhi, DMK’s TR Baalu, RSP’s NK Premachandran, Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Arvind Sawant, SP’s Javed Ali Khan, CPM’s John Brittas, CPI’s P Sandosh, Congress’s KC Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh, Manickam Tagore, RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, among others, the leaders decided to mark their protest over the job scheme as President Droupadi Murmu in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament on Wednesday mentioned VB-GRAMG that will replace MGNREGA. TMC did not attend the discussions.When the President’s speech mentioned the VB-GRAMG scheme, opposition MPs stood up and raised slogans. While the action riled the govt into slamming the opposition, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said, “Today during the President’s address, all opposition parties most respectfully and in a dignified manner protested the bulldozed repeal of MGNREGA. The opposition will use all democratic means to demand the restoration of MGNREGA.If the statement made clear the opposition’s intent to make the job scheme the front and centre of its parliamentary agenda, the same scenes may be witnessed during the presentation of the Union budget.The reason behind the focus on MGNREGA seems to be the upcoming five assembly elections and the unanimity among the parties on the issue. The belief among the opposition parties is that the disbanding of the job scheme poses a serious threat to the availability of distress employment for the poor in the future because of the shifting of a considerable financial burden on the states under VB-GRAMG.Since the subject would automatically become part of the discussion on the Union budget and then also figure in debate on the motion of thanks, it would provide ample opportunity to the rivals to amplify concerns and target BJP.However, there is some uncertainty in the INDIA bloc over its decision to focus on MGNREGA and to participate in the session, in view of what TMC may do after it comes to Parliament in the coming days, after the initial absence. The Mamata Banerjee outfit has in the past forced the hands of other allies with independent action.",MGNREGA will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the Modi govt during the budget session of Parliament.

Rahul seeks early start to talks on TN seat sharing as Kanimozhi calls on him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-seeks-early-start-to-talks-on-tn-seat-sharing-as-kanimozhi-calls-on-him/articleshow/127756164.cms,"NEW DELHI: DMK parliamentary party head K Kanimozhi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence for a discussion Wednesday, where Congress urged the southern partner to start the already delayed discussions on seat-sharing for the coming Tamil Nadu elections.The visuals of Kanimozhi visiting Rahul settled the uncertainty triggered by public chatter on the alliance. During a meeting this month, the Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi had reportedly conveyed to the TN leaders that alliance with DMK was in place and urged them to stop public comments on the issue.According to sources, the talks between Kanimozhi and Rahul were pleasant in which the DMK expressed its respect for Congress. However, Rahul is learnt to have said that the DMK should start talks on seat-sharing with the committee formed by Congress president Kharge.The AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Girish Chodankar on Tuesday said he was waiting for the last two months for the DMK to initiate discussions with the Congress panel, an exasperation shared by the party in general.It is learnt that Congress has presented the DMK with a list of 41 seats, but the lead TN partner is reluctant to concede the demand.Congress had sought 41 seats in 2021 polls but was given to contest only 25.While the stress was on initiating the seat-sharing talks, sources said no numbers were discussed between the Gandhi scion and the DMK emissary.Though staunch allies since 2004, the Congress and DMK ties have witnessed rumblings in recent months, with a section of state Congress seeking more seats and a share in future govt. Some have even touted the newbie TVK of movie star Vijay as an option.But DMK is averse to sharing power, having run a single-party govt in the state despite leading a rainbow alliance of multiple outfits.However, the AICC panel is still likely to broach the demand for power-sharing when it discusses seats with the DMK.The TN polls are set to be an exciting contest, with AIADMK, reportedly under pressure from BJP, agreeing to include its breakaway factions in a grand alliance that includes the BJP. The other political pole is TVK that has created a buzz with the star power of Vijay drawing large crowds. While the DMK has been confident of its prospects after its sweep of 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the emergence of TVK has raised concerns in some quarters.",DMK parliamentary party head K Kanimozhi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence for a discussion Wednesday.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Dhaka: Days after India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh, Dhaka on Wednesday shrugged off New Delhi’s concerns, saying it is their “choice” and “not our concern”. “If they want to take their families back, it is not our concern. There is no security concern. I do not understand what signal is being sent. It is their decision,” Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said.The advisory was issued last week following massive anti-India protests near the Indian high commission in Dhaka and assistant high commissions in other cities — angry protests had come precariously close to the diplomatic facility in Chittagong — as well as a series of attacks on minority Hindus, including killings, since the death of radical Islamist leader and India-baiter Sharif Osman Hadi on Dec 18, six days after he was shot.“There is no situation in the country that would compel diplomats to send their family members back home or where officials or their family members are in danger,” Touhid said, adding he sees “no justification for the reported non-family posting of Indian diplomats”. He told reporters that the Bangladesh govt has not been informed of any security concerns regarding the family members of Indian diplomats.While the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and its missions have suspended visa operations, the Indian high commission in Dhaka and its missions continue to remain open.","India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh.

Delhi High Court Demands DGCA Response on Pilot Duty Regulations Amid Safety Concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-high-court-demands-dgca-response-on-pilot-duty-regulations-amid-safety-concerns/articleshow/127745995.cms,".

New Delhi: Concerns about public safety due to non-implementation of DGCA regulations to prevent pilot fatigue could not be “brushed aside”, Delhi high court said Wednesday, and sought the aviation regulator’s stand on a plea challenging its decision to keep in abeyance the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms.FDTL regulations prescribe minimum rest periods for pilots and flight crew members and aim to strengthen fatigue management to ensure passenger safety.Hearing a PIL against DGCA’s move to pause implementation of the revised FDTL norms till Feb 10 in the wake of a massive disruption in IndiGo operations, a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia orally remarked: “It has a direct link to the safety of passengers. Unless the regulations are challenged, or there is some flaw, they need to enforce it. The regulations were in force for a long time, but they were not being followed. We are not considering the rationale of the regulations. When regulations are in force, they are to be implemented until revised.”The bench listed the matter for hearing on Thursday and asked the DGCA counsel to seek instructions.The PIL submitted that IndiGo had cancelled hundreds of flights across the country in the first week of Dec 2025, as the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight-duty norms for pilots.On Dec 5, DGCA eased the regulations — by allowing the substitution of leave with a weekly rest period — to enable IndiGo to have more pilots on duty to normalise operations.The petitioner alleged that the relaxation was illegally given by DGCA only to IndiGo, and was prima facie mala fide. The court, however, said the relaxation was applicable to all airlines.When the counsel for IndiGo questioned the locus of the petitioner, Sabari Roy, the HC dismissed it saying she was a former aircraft engineer and the issue had a bearing on public safety.“She worked as an aircraft engineer. Her functions are directly connected with passenger safety... The concern cannot be brushed aside,” the court said, noting that once in force, the regulations must be implemented unless decided otherwise by authorities.The bench, however, acknowledged that such petitions created pressure on regulators and they sometimes succumbed to it.",The Delhi high court has sought the aviation regulator's stand on a plea challenging its decision to keep in abeyance the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms.FDTL regulations prescribe minimum rest periods for pilots and flight crew members and aim to strengthen fatigue management.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127745983,imgsize-7708,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-05-14-220545.jpg"

West Bengal SIR Brings Home A Man Presumed Dead For 28 Years In UP’s Muzaffarnagar

New Delhi: RJD MP Manoj Jha on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to classify voters as non-citizens or to delete them from electoral rolls as it can only flag people with doubtful citizenship to the Union govt, which alone can decide citizenship disputes.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jha, told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that EC cannot strike off names of voters from electoral roll by terming their citizenship doubtful and deprive them of their valuable democratic right to choose their representative.Reiterating a point that he has made in almost every case that touched upon elections be it EVMs or constitutional amendments, Sibal said, “The judgment that the court will render in this case will be no ordinary one, for it will decide the future of democracy of India.”Sprinkling his criticism of SIR and the alleged opaque process adopted by EC with repeated refrains of “not fair”, Sibal said once the EC flags a doubtful citizenship case to the Centre, it must not remove the voter’s name from electoral roll till the govt decided the dispute over citizenship.Justice Bagchi said once an objection to a person’s citizenship is raised before the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO), she will seek documentary proof and hear parties to decide the citizenship dispute.How can ERO decide who is an illegal migrant, Sibal asked, adding that crores of voters are being deleted on flimsy grounds.CJI Kant-led bench said a hue and cry was raised over deletion of 65 lakh names from Bihar voters list. Did a single person file an appeal, it asked and said the initial apprehensions about large-scale deletion did not come true. He said the EC has not given a single reason why it is conducting pan-India SIR, as is required under the mandate to EC for carrying out special revision of electoral rolls. Why is such an exercise required to be done near the elections, EC has no answer, he said.Social activist Yogendra Yadav said wherever SIR was conducted, the ratio of female voters has declined. The large-scale deletion of women voters is because of the technically faulty SIR, he said, adding that because only special revision was carried out in Assam the ratio of women voters increased.A tired bench of CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi, which has been hearing arguments on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of SIR spread over the past three months, told the petitioners’ counsel to conclude their arguments in 45 minutes on Thursday.","RJD MP Manoj Jha told the Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to classify voters as non-citizens.

Can someone convert to avail minority quota: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-someone-convert-to-avail-minority-quota-sc/articleshow/127744188.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court suo motu decided Wednesday to examine whether a person born to upper-caste affluent parents can convert to claim minority status and, thus, become eligible for admission to a minority educational institution.A brother-sister doctor duo from an affluent village got through NEET-PG and wanted to pursue their post-graduate medical courses in a particular medical institute in UP, whose claim to be a minority institution belonging to Buddhist community has been challenged. Their counsel argued before a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the UP govt was not granting minority status to the institution and hampering their admissions to the institute.Being from Haryana, CJI Kant found that the brother-sister duo belonged to the affluent Satrod Kalan village in Hisar district. He scrutinised their NEET-PG application forms and discovered that both had applied under ‘general category’, but got minority certificates from sub-divisional officer at Hisar last year after allegedly converting to Buddhism.Raising doubts over the minority certificates, the justices asked the chief secretary of Haryana to inquire into the process adopted by the SDO and dismissed the siblings’ plea.",Supreme Court suo motu decided Wednesday to examine whether a person born to upper-caste affluent parents can convert to claim minority status.

Economic Survey 2025-26: Date, Time

What is the significance of the Economic Survey?

Economic Survey 2025-2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to table the Economic Survey ahead of her Union Budget speech. The Parliament’s Budget session began on January 28, 2026 and the first phase is expected to conclude on February 13, 2026. The Union Budget 2026 will be presented by FM Sitharaman on February 1, 2026 - likely the first time when the Budget is presented on a Sunday.Each year, the Economic Survey is closely seen by economists and policy analysts since it offers a very detailed assessment of the Indian economy’s performance over the past year, along with insights into the future growth prospects across various sectors.The Economic Survey is a very comprehensive annual economic review which is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance. The Economic Survey bears the name of the Chief Economic Advisor, who at present is Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey presents an in-depth analysis of macroeconomic parameters, key fiscal and financial indicators, and forward-looking assessments. The document also serves as an important reference point, often signalling the broad policy approach and priorities that will likely shape the forthcoming Union Budget for 2026-27.The Economic Survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before Parliament on Thursday, January 29, 2026, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, which will be followed by a media briefing by Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey usually takes stock of key macroeconomic trends. This year it may talk about growth resilience despite global headwinds, the threat from Donald Trump’s tariffs, the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market, and the weakening of the rupee against the US dollar.The analysis in the Economic Survey also suggests fresh policy ideas to tackle economic challenges, including poverty alleviation, climate action, improvements in education, infrastructure development, and strengthening the country’s financial system.The Economic Survey was first introduced in 1950-51 as part of the Budget papers, and has since then evolved into a separate document that is tabled ahead of the Union Budget. Each year, its overarching theme draws close attention from policymakers and observers alike.The Survey contains detailed sector-wise reviews along with dedicated chapters on economic concerns.","The Economic Survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before Parliament on Thursday, January 29, 2026, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM.

Smithsonian museum to return 3 bronzes to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smithsonian-museum-to-return-3-bronzes-to-india/articleshow/127733435.cms,"Museums abroad are increasingly confronting the legacy of looted cultural heritage in their collections, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art has become the latest institution to act. On Wednesday, the museum announced it will return three sculptures to India after rigorous research revealed the sculptures had been removed illegally from temples in Tamil Nadu The sculptures 'Shiva Nataraja' (Chola period, ca. 990), 'Somaskanda' (Chola period, 12th century) and 'Saint Sundarar with Paravai' (Vijayanagar period, 16th century) are examples of the rich artistry of South Indian bronze casting.The Indian govt has agreed to place the 'Shiva Nataraja' on long-term loan. This arrangement will allow the museum to publicly share the full story of the object's origins, removal and return. It will be on view as part of the exhibition 'The Art of Knowing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Himalayas.'As part of a systematic review of its South Asian collections, the National Museum of Asian Art undertook a detailed investigation into the provenance of the three sculptures, scrutinizing each work's transaction history.In 2023, in collaboration with the Photo Archives of the French Institute of Pondicherry, museum researchers confirmed that the bronzes had been photographed in temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959. The Archaeological Survey of India subsequently reviewed these findings and affirmed the sculptures had been removed in violation of Indian laws.""The National Museum of Asian Art is committed to stewarding cultural heritage responsibly and advancing transparency in our collection,"" said museum director Chase F Robinson.The Shiva Nataraja belonged to the Sri Bhava Aushadesvara Temple in Thanjavur district, where it was photographed in 1957. The bronze was later acquired by the National Museum of Asian Art from Doris Wiener Gallery in New York in 2002. A researcher at the museum determined that the Doris Wiener Gallery had provided falsified documentation to facilitate the sale to the museum. The Somaskanda and Saint Sundarar with Paravai was part of a gift of 1,000 objects. Research showed that it was from the Visvanatha Temple in Alattur village, Mannarkudi taluk, and the Saint Sundarar with Paravai at the Shiva Temple was from Veerasolapuram village, Kallakuruchchi taluk.","Sculptures were removed from temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959.

New Delhi: Eliminating the need to submit physical copies of Aadhaar for verification or visiting Aadhaar centres for updating personal details, govt Wednesday launched the new Aadhaar app that will let people manage and verify their identities digitally.Aadhaar details will be stored securely on mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry and submit a physical card for the purposes of verification.

Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK: AI171 Crash Survivor Vishwaskumar Ramesh Speaks Out

The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) around the investigation of the Air India plane crash that occurred on June 12 last year. The crash of Flight AI171, which killed 260 people, is being questioned by an NGO for allegedly violating citizens' fundamental rights. The NGO claims the official probe wasn't thorough enough.Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, representing the NGO 'Safety Matters Foundation', told the court that neither the government nor the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) had responded to the petition. He said, ""The entire pilots association are saying there is a problem in the Boeing 787 aircraft which needs to be grounded.""The apex court is currently handling three separate petitions seeking an independent investigation. These include requests from the NGO, a law student, and Captain Sabharwal's father. The pilots' federation has specifically asked for a court-monitored inquiry led by a former Supreme Court judge. While SC agreed to hear the pleas, no date has been given yet. “SIR (hearing on pleas related to special intensive revision of electoral rolls pleas) will be over today, and we will give you a short date,” the CJI told Bhushan.Earlier, on November 13, the court had noted that the AAIB's preliminary report didn't blame Captain Sabharwal for the crash. However, the court criticised the selective publication of this report, calling it ""unfortunate and irresponsible"" as it created a misleading media narrative about pilot error.Bhushan argued that such a major accident requires a more thorough court of inquiry rather than just an AAIB investigation. The Chief Justice has promised to schedule a hearing soon, after completing the current special intensive revision of electoral rolls cases.The Boeing 787-8 aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Captain Clive Kunder, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad while heading to London's Gatwick airport. Among the victims were 169 Indians, 52 Britons, seven Portuguese, one Canadian, and 12 crew members. Only one person, British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh, survived.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) around the investigation of the Air India plane crash that occurred on June 12 last year.

Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine.","Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path.

'Didi Defeated ED, She Will Now Defeat BJP': Akhilesh Yadav After Meeting Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not ""hurt"" her, saying it would make her ""dangerous,"" and alleged that Bengali-speaking people were facing harassment in states ruled by the BJP, the governing party at the Centre.""One person came and said the government supports the Bangla language, but that's not true.

Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”"," decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan.

Parliament Erupts As President Mentions VB-G RAM G Act, Opposition Slams Move To Replace MGNREGA

New Delhi: With acrimony between govt and opposition benches often leading to disruption in Parliament, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said issues like national security and resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’ should be beyond any differences and asked MPs from across the political divide to speak in one voice on matters of national interest.In her address to a joint sitting of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to mark the Budget session’s start, she invoked a number of leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, identified with contesting ideologies to assert that they stood for burying differences for the country’s interest.The resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’, India’s security, self-reliance and swadeshi were the issues over which Parliament should be unanimous as it was accepted that nothing was bigger than the nation despite difference of opinions, she said, while also invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, Sardar Patel and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.Her lauding of the VB-G RAM G law, which replaces MGNREGA, saying it would eliminate corruption and boost rural development, drew protests from opposition members, who called for its rollback while BJP and its allies thumped their desks in praise of the new scheme.The opposition was also heard protesting when Murmu began her speech, prompting parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju to later accuse them of insulting revered figures she mentioned.Congress charged him with spreading lies, saying it was only demanding MGNREGA restoration. The prospect of another showdown looms large as the opposition has sought to revive debate over SIR and VB-G RAM G, with Rijiju ruling out the possibility.In her address, which is prepared by govt, Murmu lauded the governing dispensation for its firm response to Pakistan-linked terrorism with Operation Sindoor, decisive action against Maoist terror, working for the uplift of backward communities, and for ensuring that Indian economy remains the fastest growing major economy despite global challenges.“India has proved that power can be used with responsibility and wisdom. My govt sent a strong message that any terrorist attack on India will receive a firm and decisive response,” she said. Maoist terror, she noted, once affected 126 districts but had receded to eight.PM Narendra Modi described her address as inspiring, comprehensive and insightful, saying it reflected India’s remarkable development journey in recent times. “The emphasis on building a Viksit Bharat was perfectly captured, reflecting our shared aspiration of building a strong and self-reliant nation. The address also covered a wide range of themes, highlighting sustained efforts for farmers, youth, the poor and the downtrodden. It reaffirmed our collective commitment to further speed up the ‘reform express’ and the emphasis on innovation and good governance,” he said.Murmu also referred to the free trade agreement India has signed with EU, saying it would boost manufacturing and service sectors and create new employment opportunities for the youth.","President Droupadi Murmu said issues like national security and resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’ should be beyond any differences.

New Delhi: Noting that most states have not complied with its order to take steps to remove stray dogs from premises of public institutions and implement the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules for vaccination and sterilisation, Supreme Court on Wednesday said these states “will get a proper dressing down”.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria, while going through the affidavit filed by the states, said the information provided was vague, merely an eyewash, and contained fudged figures. The court was shocked after going through Jharkhand’s affidavit which claimed that nearly 1.9 lakh dogs were sterilised in the last two months. SC pointed out that manpower and infrastructure deployed by the state could not result in sterilisation of such a large number of dogs within such a short period of time.After SC passed the order on Nov 7 last year, the Jharkhand govt took action to implement the ABC Rules, and it claimed to have sterilised “1.89 lakh dogs” in contrast to Delhi that takes a year to sterilise around one lakh dogs.“It is all fudged up figures... All states make vague statements. It is an eyewash. They will get a proper dressing down,” the bench said.Senior advocate Gaurav Agarwal, who is assisting the bench as amicus curiae, brought to the court’s notice the deficiencies in the states’ responses after examining each of the affidavits filed by them.The court was also informed that there were 1.66 lakh dog bites reported in Assam in 2024 but the state has only one dog centre. “It is astonishing. In 2024 there were 1.66 lakh bites. And, in 2025 only in Jan, there were 20,900. This is shocking,” the top court said.The responses filed by the states were also silent on many issues, including the number of stray dogs, dog pounds, ABC centres and human resources employed by them to remove strays from institutions.SC in Nov directed that stray dogs be removed from the premises of educational institutions, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands/depots and railway stations.","SC in Nov directed that stray dogs be removed from the premises of educational institutions, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands/depots and railway stations.

New Delhi: Garima Dhruwa, a class 11 student at the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) for tribal students in Kosambuda in Chhattisgarh, in her first ever trip outside of her state to Delhi, stole the limelight at a packed auditorium at Bharat Mandapam on Wednesday as she played a confident ‘sarpanch’ showcasing what a model gram sabha should offer to make grassroots democracy truly participatory.Steering the narrative as a ‘Sarpanch’, Garima as part of a team of around 30 students, brought alive a “Model Youth Gram Sabha” (MYGS) as it would unravel in a village - listening, deliberating and offering solutions.“There was no script here. We, along with our teachers shortlisted the issues affecting the villages and presented what we have experienced through everyday life in our own villages,” the humanities student who aspires to be an IAS officer told TOI on the sidelines of a programme organised by the ministry of panchayati raj where the mock gram sabha presentation received applause and much appreciation.Daughter of a teacher, Garima now feels confident of reaching out to the panchayat pradhan in her own village to take up issues that bothered her as a child. One such issue being difficulty in accessing water due to broken taps in public spaces meant for villagers.From classes 9 and 11 and having their own lived experiences of challenges in their villages, each of the girls and boys in Garima’s team played a role ranging from ‘panch’ to to the panchayat secretary and the village residents of all age groups.Far away from home, Garima and her schoolmates presented before policy makers, representatives from Panchayati Raj Institutions, teachers and youth among others in the audience the aspirations of the villages surrounding Kosambuda in Chhatisgarh and how this was the story of most villages across states.The issues ranged from a girl playing the Self Help Group member appealing to the Sabha to support her by buying the products made by women to residents calling for stepping up sanitation in the area by creating waste water channels and planting more trees around the outlets to put the run-off water to good use.The Panchayat also approved the demand for a dedicated vehicle to ferry pregnant women to the hospital that is far from the village and a fine of Rs 500 to punish those found to be using abusive language in public places. The Sarpanch and other members also reprimanded families for not sending their children to school.From the North of India another group of students - they came from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Himachal Pradesh's Una drew from everyday experiences of village life to highlight how the civic, infrastructure, livelihood, social and cultural issues in villages were best solved through mutual discussion as the sense of community continues to be strong factor.A class 11 science student, Shivam Sharma who played the Sarpanch told TOI that the learnings in the process of putting together the Gram Sabha have given him a new perspective about the village he comes from and the ones that surround his school.“We drew a list of issues affecting the villages with their teachers, went out to visit the village, surveyed the space and met with the gram pradhan and then planned our own gram sabha,” shared Sharma who aspires to be a doctor. Here the roadmap that developed through the discussions included demands ranging from creating a library for children to putting solar lights. Better education, health and more avenues for livelihood were concerns raised through the course of the discussion. Interestingly, the Sarpanch and other members also discussed the transition from Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to the new law Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin).Both these schools - the one from Chhattisgarh among EMRS and the other from Una among JNVs that held ‘Model Youth Gram Sabha’ in their schools across states were conferred with the first prize at the national awards programme as a recognition of their work at Bharat Mandapam. Both schools were given an award money of Rs 1 crore each for development activities.Addressing the gathering, union minister of state SP Singh Baghel said that these model youth gram sabhas ""mark a paradigm shift in civic education by offering students hands-on exposure to grassroots democracy as they get to engage with Panchayati Raj Institutions, strengthen the spirit of gram swaraj and nurture leadership qualities"".Secretary, ministry of panchayati raj, Vivek Bharadwaj added that the “initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of nurturing 1 lakh young leaders across the country” and “demonstrates how youth can contribute meaningfully to solving ground level problems”.A comprehensive compendium documenting the transformative journey of MYGS released at the programme highlighted how over 28,000 students from 619 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas and 200 Eklavya Model Residential Schools successfully participated in simulated gram sabha and gram panchayat proceedings nationwide over the past few months.Going forward the govt plans to institutionalise the ""model youth gram sabhas"" into its scheme - the ‘Rashtriya Gram Sabha Abhiyan’ wherein the states will be asked to weave in this outreach exercise among youth in their plans for the financial year 2026-27.“With over 6.64 lakh villages housing nearly 65-70% of the population, the vitality of rural India lies in the strength of its gram sabhas. As a constitutional body under Article 243, the gram sabha embodies direct democracy, enabling every adult resident of the village to participate in governance, deliberate on development priorities, and ensure accountability of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs),” the ministry said in a statement.It further stated that despite its critical role in rural governance, youth participation in gram sabhas remains low, largely due to limited awareness, insufficient exposure, and a lack of meaningful engagement opportunities.It was in this backdrop to encourage and cultivate civic consciousness among students, the ministry of panchayati raj, in partnership with the department of school education and literacy and the ministry of tribal affairs, conceptualised the “Model Youth Gram Sabha”.","Garima Dhruwa, a class 11 student at the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) for tribal students in Kosambuda in Chhattisgarh, in her first ever trip outside of her state to Delhi.

Scrutiny of disability for govt staff should be based on 'specific suspicion': NHRC chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scrutiny-of-disability-for-govt-staff-should-be-based-on-specific-suspicion-nhrc-chief/articleshow/127732473.cms,".

New Delhi: Following deliberations on human rights violations arising out of re-verification and re-assessment of certificates of govt employees with disabilities, National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) chairperson Justice V Ramasubramanian has suggested that such scrutiny be carried out only in cases where there is specific suspicion, instead of mass re-verification of all employees with disability.The concern emerged at a meeting of NHRC’s core group on disabilities that was chaired by Justice Ramasubramanian. The chairperson noted that, understandably, Centre’s revised advisory and SOP dated Oct 15, 2025, for handling disability verification in govt jobs and education is meant to be applied prospectively only for new applicants and not retrospectively to reassess all existing beneficiaries.He observed that applying the SOP retrospectively for all of them may have legal implications. Thus, instead of mass verification, the scrutiny should be limited to cases where there is specific suspicion.“The Commission will further deliberate upon the suggestions and inputs from different stakeholders to finalise its recommendations to the government for ensuring the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities,” an NHRC statement said.The meeting saw the suggestion being made that blanket or mass medical reassessment of all govt employees with disabilities should be prohibited.Other suggestions included adoption of UDID-based digital verification as the default mechanism, with medical reassessment only being an exception, based on clearly defined and evidence-based suspicion, and elimination of the need to re-issue certificates to employees living with irreversible disabilities.On the issue of reassessment, Rajeev Sharma, joint secretary, department of empowerment of persons with disabilities, ministry of social justice and empowerment, clarified that the primary intent of the department was to ensure due diligence at the stage of admission to higher educational institutions and recruitment for govt jobs.Dr S Govindaraj, commissioner of persons with disabilities, said that verification mechanisms must remain targeted and proportional to ensure that persons with genuine disabilities are not unnecessarily inconvenienced. He said that existing guidelines emphasise validation rather than mass reassessment.Meanwhile, secretary general, NHRC, Bharat Lal said that persons with disabilities (PwD) must be treated with respect and dignity, while ensuring safeguards are in place against misuse of legal provisions. He highlighted that re-assessment of disability can be intrusive and make people feel a loss of dignity. Although the 2016 Act increased reservation for PwD from 3% to 4%, misuse and weak social values result in persons with genuine disabilities facing hardships, he added.",The concern emerged at a meeting of NHRC’s core group on disabilities.

'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the “historic” free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union in Delhi a day before is a “global gamechanger” and will open countless opportunities for lakhs of Indian youths.Addressing a gathering at the annual National Cadet Corps PM Rally at Delhi Cantt here, the PM said the entire world is looking at India's youth with a “lot of trust” and the reason behind that trust is “skill and ‘sanskar’ (culture)”. He underlined that this agreement with 27 countries will benefit Indian startups by easing access to funding and innovation ecosystems, while also boosting India’s creative economy in film, gaming, fashion, digital content, music, and design. He stated that the deal will create new opportunities for Indian youth in research, education, IT, and professional services.Modi underscored it will accelerate the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign and strengthen the resolve of “Make in India, Make for the World”. He explained that under this agreement, tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports will either be zero or very low, benefiting industries such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, footwear, engineering goods, and MSMEs.He said the deal will also bring more investment into India, leading to new engineering, electronics, chemical, pharma, and other manufacturing plants, while creating assured markets for agriculture, food processing, and fisheries, which will be a major opportunity for farmers, fishermen, and rural youth. He said this FTA directly connects India’s youth to Europe’s job market, creating opportunities especially in engineering, green technology, design, logistics, and advanced manufacturing, meaning new avenues are opening for Indian youth across 27 countries.“Before this (EU FTA), India has done FTAs with Oman, New Zealand, Britain, the UAE, Australia, and countries like Mauritius...I had addressed from the Red Fort that ‘Yahi samay hai, sahi samay hai' (this is the time, this is the right time). For the country's youth, it is a time for maximum opportunities,"" Modi said, adding, “this is not just a trade agreement. This is a new blueprint for shared prosperity”.Modi also “noted with grief that the day also brought great sorrow due to the tragic plane crash in Maharashtra this morning, which claimed the lives of Deputy CM,Shri Ajit Pawar ji and some colleagues.” He highlighted that “Ajit Dada made a significant contribution to the development of Maharashtra and the nation, especially by working to improve village life, and expressed condolences to Shri Ajit Pawar ji’s family. ” He stated that in this moment of pain, the nation stands with the families of those lost in the accident.Lauding the impressive tableau on Op Sindoor, Modi appreciated the efforts of NCC cadets during that critical moment for national security. He noted their contributions in supporting the armed forces, organising blood donation camps, and providing first-aid services.Emphasising that Op Sindoor reaffirmed India’s strength and the valour of its armed forces, Modi said it also demonstrated the advancement of indigenous weapons. He stressed that in modern warfare, the role of youth skills has increased significantly, as battles are now fought not only with tanks and guns but also in code and cloud. He warned that nations lagging in technology are weak not only in economy but also in security, and stressed that innovation by youth strengthens patriotism and contributes to national security.Modi called for a new tradition in the country, proposing that NCC, NSS, and My Young India organisation hold a grand event every Jan 25 to honour first-time voters, expressing confidence that this effort will strengthen the sense of responsibility among youth and reinforce democracy.",'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi met on Wednesday for discussions on the Tamil Nadu assembly elections but no agreement was reached on seat-sharing in the state, where the DMK is in power and the Congress is its ally.“It was a pleasant meeting, and no seat-sharing numbers were discussed, but there was an emphasis on showing respect for the Congress,” a party source said, according to PTI.The source added that during the meeting at former Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence in Delhi, her son and Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi told Kanimozhi that the DMK should hold talks with the committee formed by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge to resolve seat-sharing issues.Congress leaders in Tamil Nadu are reportedly seeking a ""substantial increase"" in the number of seats the party contests in the upcoming assembly elections, along with a ""proper share"" in power. However, the DMK is unwilling to offer more seats than it did in the last election.In 2021, the grand old party contested 25 of the 234 assembly constituencies and won 18.Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK supremo MK Stalin shares good relations with the Congress leadership and, therefore, the issue is expected to be resolved soon, sources noted.Some state Congress leaders have also discussed the possibility of an alliance with actor Vijay’s newly formed Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), though the Congress leadership is reportedly keen on contesting the elections with the DMK.The Tamil Nadu assembly elections are likely to be held in April–May.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi met on Wednesday for discussions on the Tamil Nadu assembly elections.

Patient group seeks public scrutiny of India-EU FTA ahead of signing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patient-group-seeks-public-scrutiny-of-india-eu-fta-ahead-of-signing/articleshow/127721979.cms,"'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

NW DELHI: A patient advocacy group has cautioned the government over the free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, urging it to make the full text public and place it before the Parliament for a detailed discussion, prior to its signing.The group said such scrutiny is essential to enable an informed debate on the FTA’s implications for the pharmaceutical sector. Even though the pact does not explicitly talk about patent-related provisions, it provides a high level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights, including copyright, trademarks, designs, trade secrets and plant variety rights.The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.``The govt should clarify and ensure that the final text does not include any TRIPS-plus provisions, particularly patent term extensions and data exclusivity, which would compromise the availability of affordable medicines’’, KM Gopakumar, co-convenor, Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment told TOI.India plays an important role as a supplier of affordable generic medicines to low- and middle-income countries.Any weakening of its patent laws or regulatory framework through FTAs risks having an impact not only on patients in India, but millions worldwide who depend on Indian generic production, the group said.The agreement clearly demonstrates that India has agreed to IP protection and enforcement standards that go beyond the minimum obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). However, notably the press release (by EU) does not mention patent related provisions, nor does it clarify whether the agreement includes controversial TRIPS-plus measures such as patent term extensions, pharmaceutical data exclusivity, or other forms of market exclusivity for medicines, he added.Earlier, when negotiations were relaunched in 2022, the European Union’s proposed IP text explicitly sought patent term extension and data exclusivity protection for pharmaceutical products. In the previous rounds of negotiations, particularly during 2007-2013, India had rejected these TRIPS-plus demands following strong opposition from civil society, patent groups, and public health advocates.``We caution against repeating the approach adopted in the FTAs with EFTA and the UK that risk having a direct or indirect impact on access to affordable medicines’’, a statement from the patient advocacy group said.Further, it is also important to note that the EU–Mercosur agreement, reflects a shift away from the inclusion of patent related TRIPS-plus provisions in FTAs. This precedent should be followed in the EU-India agreement too, it added.","The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.

No more gold-plated silver medals for retiring railway officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-more-gold-plated-silver-medals-for-retiring-railway-officials/articleshow/127721094.cms,"NEW DELHI: The railway ministry on Wednesday discontinued the practice of presenting gold-plated silver medals to retiring officials, days after allegations surfaced regarding their quality and laboratory tests found that they were made largely of copper.In a circular issued to heads of all zones and production units, the ministry said, “...it has now been decided with the approval of the President that the practice of presenting gold-plated silver medals to retiring railway officers may be discontinued. The silver medals, which are already procured/available in stock with railways, may be accounted for and suitably used for other activities, redressing their utilisation concerns. ”Though the circular did not mention any reason for the decision, officials said that there have been various concerns, including the poor quality of medals supplied by outsourced vendors and need for cost-cutting as silver has become expensive.The practice had been continuing since March 2006 when the ministry decided to present all railway employees who seek voluntary retirement or superannuate with a gold-plated silver medal weighing around 20 grams.An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision addresses two issues: one of quality and second of the end of a culture which doesn’t exist in any other ministry or department. Sharing a contrasting view, another official said the national transporter could have fixed the problem and ensured that the quality of medals was not compromised.“Rather than giving the task of procurement of these medals to zones and production units, railways could have tied up with agencies like MMTC for getting them,” said the official.","The practice had been continuing since March 2006 when the ministry decided to present all railway employees who seek voluntary retirement or superannuate with a gold-plated silver medal weighing around 20 grams.

'No security threat here': Bangladesh questions India's move to recall diplomats' families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-security-threat-here-bangladesh-questions-indias-move-to-recall-diplomats-families/articleshow/127717395.cms,".

Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason’ for such a move.

Eyewitness Recounts Explosions, Fire, Chaos In NCP Chief Ajit Pawar’s Fatal Plane Crash At Baramati

Asserting that development cannot be divided based on caste, religion or region, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said the government is committed to carrying out welfare and development works ""without bias or discrimination"".He noted that a discrimination-free approach reflects Ram Rajya (an ideal rule of just, ethical, people-centric governance as described in Ramayana)Addressing a public gathering here after inaugurating and laying the foundation of 229 development projects worth over Rs 1,052 crore, Adityanath said the state government considers the entire population of Uttar Pradesh as one family and works with the spirit of inclusive and sustainable development.""Development cannot be achieved by dividing society. It has to be pursued with a comprehensive outlook and without any discrimination, no 'mine' or 'yours', no caste, religion, language or regional bias. This discrimination-free approach alone reflects the true spirit of Ram Rajya,"" the chief minister said.The programme, marking the inauguration of the Siddharthnagar Mahotsav, was attended by Leader of Opposition in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly and Itwa MLA Mata Prasad Pandey, state minister Anil Rajbhar, Dumariaganj MP Jagdambika Pal and other public representatives.Adityanath paid tributes to Lord Buddha, describing Siddharthnagar as a sacred land that gave the world the message of compassion and harmony.He also expressed condolences over the reported death of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in an airplane crash and extended sympathies to the bereaved families.Calling the inaugurated projects a ""collective effort"", the chief minister said the proposals came from public representatives and were approved on merit.""We are only a medium. When justified proposals come, funds are released without discrimination,"" he said.Highlighting the transformation of Siddharthnagar, once classified as an aspirational district, Adityanath said the region earlier suffered from poor infrastructure, disease and migration. He noted that encephalitis, which had claimed lives for decades, was eliminated within a few years after 2017 through sustained efforts inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Those who lost their lives were not vote banks for us. They were part of our family, and the government fulfilled its responsibility,"" he said.The chief minister said Siddharthnagar now has improved road connectivity, including four-lane highways linking the district with neighbouring regions and Nepal, which would boost investment and employment.He added that the Shamli-Gorakhpur corridor passing through Dumariaganj, Bansi and Itwa would act as a development corridor for the area.Referring to infrastructure expansion, Adityanath cited the establishment of a medical college, the start of a nursing college, the inauguration of a women's hostel and plans for a 1,000-seat auditorium under corporate social responsibility initiatives.He also spoke about welfare schemes, saying benefits such as ration, toilets, housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Ayushman Bharat health cards must reach every poor household without discrimination.""This is the essence of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas',"" he said.Urging farmers to diversify cropping patterns, Adityanath appealed to them to adopt a third crop in addition to the traditional two, citing examples from Kannauj, Auraiya and Kanpur Dehat where maize cultivation has yielded additional income of nearly Rs 1 lakh per acre.The chief minister also called for recognising and honouring artists, sportspersons, traders and others doing exemplary work at the local level during district festivals to foster healthy competition and positive energy.","Yogi Adityanath: Government committed to carrying out welfare and development works ""without bias or discrimination"" He noted that a discrimination-free approach reflects Ram Rajya (an ideal rule of just, ethical, people-centric governance as described in Ramayana) He also expressed condolences over the reported death of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127714701,imgsize-849895,width-400,resizemode-4/127714701.jpg"

West Bengal SIR Brings Home A Man Presumed Dead For 28 Years In UP’s Muzaffarnagar

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday noted that additions and deletions are part of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) conducted by the Election Commission of India (ECI), as it resumed the final hearing on a batch of 19 petitions challenging the exercise carried out in Bihar last year.“Additions and deletions are part of the electoral roll revision exercise,"" PTI quoted Chief Justice of India Surya Kant (CJI) as saying. The CJI made the remark while responding to senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for a petitioner, and alleged “mass deletions” from the final voter list.Sibal countered by arguing that annual revisions already exist and that a wholesale special revision required “strong justification,” which he stressed should be supported by data. He also argued that although the poll body has plenary powers under Article 324 to conduct elections, the determination of citizenship lies exclusively with the Union government under the Citizenship Act.“This is not an ordinary administrative decision. This judgment will decide the future course of democracy in India,” he claimed.Meanwhile, the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi also observed that the mere possibility of forgery cannot be a ground to reject Aadhaar as one of the 12 documents used to verify a voter’s identity for electoral roll revision.“If a document is recognised by statute, it cannot be discarded merely because a private entity is involved in its issuance,"" Justice Bagchi said, referring to the UIDAI, the body that issues Aadhaar cards.He added that even passports are processed through private agencies performing public duties.The top court had commenced final arguments in the matter on August 12 last year, noting that the inclusion or exclusion of names in electoral rolls falls within the constitutional remit of the ECI.The ECI has consistently defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, stating that Aadhaar and voter identity cards cannot be treated as conclusive proof of citizenship. It maintains that ensuring only citizens are included in the electoral rolls is its constitutional duty, and that Aadhaar can at best be used to prevent duplication, not to establish citizenship.The commission has also denied allegations of political motive, emphasizing that deletions occurred across party lines.The hearing is expected to conclude on Thursday.","The Supreme Court noted that additions and deletions are part of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise.

A:

A lot of my books have the personal in them. I think this in some ways is the most personal. And it came about because I had this annus horribilis... And for me that was 2023 when I had this shock breast cancer diagnosis. And just as I was going through the treatment, I lost my mother very suddenly, I spoke to her the night before and then the next morning I got a call saying she's gone. And it left me feeling very unmoored. But it also set me off thinking about how I could traverse some of these inner terrains of illness, of grief, these emotional journeys... I've lived in eight countries, in nine different cities since the late 1990s. Doing so I've learned something about the art of travelling well... And then I thought about applying some of these to other kinds of journeys, more metaphorical journeys... And it helped me a lot because I realised that recasting illness and recasting grief and recasting some of these difficult life journeys as plot really helped me to process them and to bring to them an openness and a curiosity that I normally have in my travels to countries.I have a chapter on passportism, essentially a hierarchy that divides people and determines who can travel and who can't. Just as your caste is determined by birth, your passport is also usually determined by birth. It's a throw of the cosmic dice whether you're born in Sudan or whether you're born in the US. But if you happen to be lucky enough to born in the US or Spain, you have the keys to the world... Although I'm in a family of passport Brahmins, I have hung on to my Indian passport. .. We have a friend in, say, Mexico who invites us to a wedding. Everybody is like, yay, we’re going to Mexico. And being an Indian passport holder, my initial reaction is never unalloyed excitement. But I have hung on to this passport and I've tried to unpack why. There's notions of loyalty to the nation but I think there's also something more than that. It's this kind of sense of guilt almost that I have of being such a privileged Indian... And in some ways, that passport is at least to some extent a leveller... And the very liberal countries of the West for whom supposedly racism would be anathema, sexism would be anathema, casteism would be anathema, passportism is okay — so much so that you have these rankings that are public every year saying which is the best passport and which is the worst passport.I've tried through a lot of my work to break down the barrier between those two aspects. A journalist would be like defining my professional life. And being a mother is supposed to be something very private. And I think that's quite disingenuous... I believe this kind of division between the personal and the professional is spurious and it does not serve the interests of not only women, but men either... I feel like when you are writing anything,. .. it's very important to centre and make obvious your own subjectivity...We've had a tradition in foreign correspondence and travel writing of, normally, a white male writer, essentially pretending to take a kind of objective vantage point. They have this very authorial, universalistic voice which obscures the lenses that they are seeing the world through and is just telling you this is the truth... I think whenever we are talking about something, we are describing a version of the truth. And that version is very much determined by who is telling that story. And so I think it's important to make yourself quite transparent. So you are a female, you are a mother. And that is why you are apprehending the world in that way and interpreting the world in that way... You know, when they say ‘women can do it all’, what they actually mean is when you're at work, you pretend that you don't have kids, and when you are with the kids, you have to pretend that you don't have work. And that's just patently, empirically impossible.In the chapter on pedagogy, I talk about this phase that I go through of being this kind of typical Asian tiger mom. A lot of how I process the world is through books. In this instance, it happened to be a book by a writer called Amy Chua, ‘Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother’... So I went through a very misguided phase, at least as far as I'm concerned, given my personal predilections as a parent, of being this tiger mom... Until I realised that, I was. .. creating misery all around. After a few months, I felt my claws retract and the stripes on my body dissolved into colourful polka dots... The last five years we've spent in Spain and there, sometimes I wish people were more tiger momish. They're only concerned about if the kids are playing sports and if they have girlfriends and boyfriends... There's no conversation about how they're doing in math or what university they might want to apply to. So I think it’s about finding a good balance, and also realising all these things are culture-dependent, context-dependent.I think one of the important parts of travelling is to accumulate a variety of different lenses and perspectives and to expand your sense of self... Supposing you're an Indian. You have various assumptions about the world and you don't even realise that these are assumptions because you just think that they're somehow universal norms... You travel, you learn new languages, you experience new cultures, and you understand there's so many different ways in which you can inhabit the world, in which you can translate the world, and hopefully you can accrue more and more of these lenses so that you become a wider person. .. I just use the metaphor of my Chinese name as a way of talking about an extra lens that I acquired by becoming familiar with Chinese culture and Chinese ways of doing things...I think that when we proselytise about the virtues of travel, we also have to keep in mind what we started this discussion off with — passportism, and that not everybody can travel in the same way... So there are other ways of travelling. You can even become a traveller in your neighbourhood. If you walk around your own colony and you look at it with openness and curiosity instead of allowing what is the quotidian to become banal. .. My name, Pallavi, is distorted in so many ways. I've been called Pullover and Pavlova and Pavali. But instead of complaining, I've embraced each iteration. It's just one more way of being.","Author has lived in eight countries, in nine different cities since the late 1990s.

Desert dust storms ferry disease-causing bacteria to the Himalayan hilltops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desert-dust-storms-ferry-disease-causing-bacteria-to-the-himalayan-hilltops/articleshow/127712955.cms,"Photo credit: IANS

BENGALURU: High in the Himalayas, where thin air and cold temperatures are often believed to offer natural protection against disease, an unseen traveller is arriving on the wind. A new study has found that dust storms rising from the deserts of western India are carrying airborne bacteria to Himalayan hilltops, including pathogens linked to respiratory, skin and gastrointestinal illnesses.Researchers from the Bose Institute, an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), traced this movement through more than two years of continuous monitoring of dust events and atmospheric samples across high-altitude sites in the eastern Himalayas. Their findings have been published in the journal “Science of the Total Environment”.Dust storms are a recurring feature of India’s arid regions, particularly during the pre-monsoon months. The study shows that as these storms rise from desert surfaces, they lift not only fine mineral particles but also bacteria attached to them. Driven by prevailing winds, the dust plumes travel hundreds of kilometres, crossing the densely populated and polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain before settling over Himalayan hilltops.Several of the airborne bacteria identified in the samples are known to be associated with respiratory and skin diseases. The findings are especially relevant for Himalayan populations, who already face heightened health vulnerability due to cold climatic conditions and hypoxia. Until now, there has been limited evidence directly linking long-range airborne microbial exposure to disease risks in high-altitude regions.The research also points to a parallel process shaping the Himalayan atmosphere. Vertical uplift from the Himalayan foothills injects locally sourced pollutants and pathogens into higher layers of the air. These local microbes then mix with long-range bacterial “travellers” arriving with desert dust, collectively altering the composition of the atmospheric bacterial community over the region.This combined effect, the researchers say, may also help explain the occurrence of gastrointestinal infections in high-altitude areas. By quantitatively demonstrating how both horizontal dust transport and vertical lifting of polluted air perturb the Himalayan atmospheric microbiome, the study adds a new biological dimension to the understanding of air pollution.Beyond its scientific contribution, the findings carry clear public health implications. Current air quality monitoring frameworks focus largely on chemical pollutants, often overlooking biological agents. The researchers argue that incorporating microbial surveillance could strengthen national health action plans and support the development of health forecasting systems, in line with the goals of Viksit Bharat by 2047.For regions long regarded as climatically pristine, the study serves as a reminder that even the highest mountain air is shaped by processes unfolding far beyond the Himalayas.","Dust storms are a recurring feature of India’s arid regions, particularly during the pre-monsoon months. The study shows that as these storms rise from desert surfaces, they lift not only fine mineral particles but also bacteria attached to them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127713553,imgsize-58540,width-400,resizemode-4/image-84.jpg"

NEW DELHI: From AI tutors that speak regional languages to smarter campus systems that cut paperwork, India is taking its first big step towards AI-powered higher education — starting with a pilot project at Chaudhary Charan Singh University (CCSU), Meerut.On Wednesday, the ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE) announced a partnership with Google Cloud and CCSU to build India’s first AI-enabled university. The project aims to create a national model that can later be adopted by colleges and universities across the country.The initiative was launched at Google’s AI for Learning Forum in Delhi in the presence of skill development minister Jayant Chaudhary. CCSU has been chosen as the pilot campus, where new AI tools will be tested before being scaled nationally.Under the programme, Google Cloud’s Gemini platform will be used to support both learning and administration. Students will get access to personalised AI tutors that help them study at their own pace and identify skill gaps linked to job requirements. Faculty members will be able to use AI to prepare teaching material, simulations and multilingual content.University offices, meanwhile, will adopt automation to reduce routine paperwork and speed up processes. Placecom will handle the technical rollout.Officials said the larger goal is to make quality education more accessible, especially for students in regional institutions who often lack exposure to advanced learning tools. The focus is on removing barriers linked to language, location and resources.Chaudhary said the project is about preparing students for the future workforce, not just awarding degrees. By giving teachers modern digital tools and campuses smarter systems, he said, students everywhere can be readied for the AI era.Google India’s country manager and VP, Preeti Lobana said CCSU will serve as a testing ground for new learning models, including personalised education and AI-based career guidance.Based on results from this pilot, MSDE plans to develop a National Best Practice Framework that can guide over 50,000 colleges and 1,200 universities in adopting AI. CCSU will also act as a centre of excellence, sharing its experience with other institutions.The outcomes of the Meerut pilot will be used by MSDE to frame national guidelines for wider adoption of AI across higher education institutions.","The project aims to create a national model that can later be adopted by colleges and universities across the country.

Six Sarpanches Booked in Kamareddy for Mass Killing of Stray Dogs Ahead of Elections

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday sharply criticised states for failing to comply with its directions to enhance stray dog sterilisation capacity, saying, “They are all building castles in the air. ”A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta, and NV Anjaria made the remark while hearing the governments’ submissions on their compliance with the court’s earlier directions.“They are all building castles in the air. None of the states have given data on how many stray dog bites happened, except for Assam,” PTI quoted the bench as saying.The judges also expressed surprise over Assam’s dog bite data. “Look at the statistics of bites. It is astonishing. In 2024, there were 1.66 lakh bites. And in 2025, only in January, there were 20,900. This is shocking,” they observed.“States cannot make vague statements, and all vague averments are made on affidavits. We are going to pass strong strictures against states that make vague averments,” Justice Nath warned.The remarks followed submissions by senior advocate Gaurav Agarwal, the amicus curiae in the case, who summarised initiatives taken by different states while highlighting deficiencies.He noted that although some states have taken steps in line with the Supreme Court’s directions, there was still “a long way to go” for full compliance.The governments would need to expand animal birth control (ABC) facilities, increase sterilisation of stray dogs, set up dog pounds, fence institutional areas, and remove stray animals from roads and highways, Agarwal said.Highlighting Bihar’s initiatives, Agarwal stated that the state has 34 ABC centres where it claims 20,648 dogs have been sterilised. However, the state has not specified the daily sterilisation capacity or the period this figure covers.“The state should have done a complete audit of ABC centres. If there are more than six lakh dogs in the state, sterilisation of 20,648 dogs is totally insufficient. Ninety-one dogs are presently lodged in the pounds. The affidavit does not indicate in how many institutional areas the survey has been done to see if there are fences, boundary walls, etc.,” Agarwal submitted.Advocate Manish Kumar, appearing for Bihar, sought three months’ time, stating that the state was putting systems in place and “substantial progress” would be made in that period.The Supreme Court also heard submissions from Goa, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Gujarat, and posted the matter for further hearing on Thursday.The suo motu case, initiated on July 28 last year, arose from a media report on stray dog bites leading to rabies, particularly among children in Delhi.","Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta, and NV Anjaria made the remark while hearing the governments’ submissions on their compliance with the court’s earlier directions. “They are all building castles in the air.

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

NEW DELHI: Proceedings in the Karnataka Assembly were disrupted on Wednesday after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the Congress-led Siddaramaiah government of phone tapping.The house was in total ruckus following law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil remarks who suggested that the governor Thaawarchand Gehlot was acting on instructions received through calls from Delhi.The controversy erupted during the debate on the motion of thanks to the governor’s address to the joint sitting of the state legislature. BJP legislators alleged that the Congress government had accessed details of phone calls received at the Raj Bhavan (Lok Bhavan), raising serious questions about surveillance and misuse of power.Last week, on January 22, governor Gehlot refused to read the full state-prepared address to the joint session of the legislature and concluded his speech in just three lines.The move drew sharp criticism from the Congress government. The governor had objected to certain references in the address that were critical of the Centre, including remarks on the alleged “repeal” of the UPA-era employment guarantee scheme, MGNREGA.Intervening in the debate on Wednesday, BJP MLA Suresh Kumar accused the state government of disrespecting the governor and making unwarranted allegations against a constitutional authority. He observed that there have been earlier instances where governors did not read their full addresses.Citing precedent, Kumar referred to January 2011, when the BJP was in power in the state. He said that then governor Hansraj Bhardwaj had tabled his address to the joint session to be treated as read after the then Leader of the Opposition, Siddaramaiah, urged him not to read it, alleging corruption by the BJP government at the time.Responding to this comparison, law minister H K Patil alleged that the present Governor had acted under instructions received over phone calls from Delhi.“Following calls from Delhi the Governor did not read the full speech, we will also have to speak about it now, as you spoke about the earlier incident (involving then Governor Bhardwaj),” Patil said.The remark triggered strong protests from the BJP benches. Suresh Kumar said that the law minister was making a grave allegation and questioned how the government knew about calls to the governor.“Is the government tapping the Raj Bhavan (Lok Bhavan) phones, to know about the Governor getting calls from Delhi?” he asked.As BJP MLAs rose in protest, the House descended into chaos. BJP MLA Sunil Kumar alleged that Patil’s statement amounted to an admission. “How can this be tolerated? This is the second time the Law Minister has said this in the House. Is phone tapping happening?” he said.IT/BT Minister Priyank Kharge came to Patil’s defence, saying the law minister was only alleging that the Governor was acting like a “puppet in the hands of the central government.” However, the BJP maintained that the statements raised serious doubts about surveillance at the Raj Bhavan.Escalating the exchange, Kharge alleged that the governor was receiving calls from Keshava Krupa, the RSS’s Karnataka state headquarters. BJP members countered the claim by saying the Congress “gets calls from Italy,” further intensifying the verbal sparring.Sunil Kumar and other BJP MLAs reiterated their charge that the state government had stooped to tapping the Governor’s phone. “The Law Minister has repeatedly said that the Governor was getting calls from Delhi. How did they know? If they have records, let them place it in the House,” he said, alleging that both Patil and Kharge were involved in tapping phones at Lok Bhavan.Senior BJP leaders, including Suresh Kumar and Sunil Kumar, continued to accuse the Siddaramaiah government of surveillance and described it as a “phone tapping government.” Leader of the Opposition R Ashoka also backed the allegations.Replying to the charges, Patil questioned why there had been no clarification from either the Governor or the Centre after he first made the allegation last week. “What is the Home Ministry doing in Delhi? Should they not at least issue a press note saying that there is no communication between the Governor and Home Ministry?” he asked.The remarks led to further heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches, with Ashoka claiming that the statements by Patil and Kharge themselves proved that phones at the Lok Bhavan and the RSS office were being tapped. “Are our phones also being tapped? This is a phone-tapping government,” he said.As disorder continued in the House, Speaker U T Khader adjourned the Assembly for lunch.",Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil suggested that the governor Thaawarchand Gehlot was acting on instructions received through calls from Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati on Wednesday ended his sit-in protest and departed the Magh Mela in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj, 10 days after he was ""stopped"" from taking a holy dip at the Sangam.Before leaving, he said he was returning with a “sense of emptiness” and a “heavy heart.”“Today, words are not supporting me, and my voice feels heavy. We come to this sacred land of Prayagraj seeking spiritual peace, but today we are returning with a sense of emptiness and a heavy heart that we had never imagined,” the seer told reporters, PTI reported.“Taking a dip in the Sangam is a path to the satisfaction of the inner soul, but my mind is so distressed today that I am leaving without taking a bath,” he added.Commenting on the developments at Prayagraj, Avimukteshwaranand remarked they had “shaken my inner self” and prompted him to raise questions about “collective faith in justice and humanity.”On January 18, Swami Avimukteshwaranand was travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam—the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati—on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya when a dispute erupted after administrative and police officials asked him to dismount and proceed on foot for the ritual bath, citing heavy crowds.The Mela administration alleged that the seer and his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge and moved towards the ghats, creating serious challenges for the police in crowd management.Following the incident, allegations were exchanged between Avimukteshwaranand and the police administration, after which he launched a sit-in protest.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav attacked the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government following the seer’s announcement, calling his departure from the Magh Mela without bathing in the Sangam an “extremely ominous” incident.“The BJP's arrogance broke a tradition that has continued since time immemorial. Jagadguru Shankaracharya ji leaving the Magh Mela on the sacred land of Prayagraj without taking a holy bath is an extremely ominous incident,” Yadav wrote on X.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister stated that the entire Sanatan community was not only hurt but also gripped by fear. “The global Sanatan society is deeply pained and filled with an uncertain sense of apprehension,” he posted.Yadav alleged that the ruling party could have acted differently but was “blinded by power”.“If the BJP and its associates wanted, they could have shed the arrogance of power, carried him on their shoulders and ensured his sacred bath at the Triveni Sangam, thereby upholding his honour. The BJP is intoxicated with the pride of power acquired through corrupt means, which is stopping it from doing so,” the SP president added.He said hurting saints could never bring well-being. “No one can attain happiness by hurting the hearts of saints. A bigger mistake than committing an error is not seeking forgiveness,” Yadav said, adding that “no political post can be greater than the honour of saints”.Invoking religious texts, he warned of consequences over the developments involving the seer. “Do those who create obstacles in religious rituals need to be told what they are called? Our epics clearly state that no wrongdoer ever escapes the punishment of arrogance,” he said.Yadav concluded his post with the message: “Hurt saints mean the end of power.”","Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati ended his sit-in protest and departed the Magh Mela in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj.

“Deeply Saddened by His Passing”: PM Modi, HM Shah Mourn Ajit Pawar’s Untimely Death

NEW DELHI: Opposition leaders on Wednesday demanded a thorough investigation into the plane crash that killed Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and four others. The calls are being ranged from a DGCA-led probe to a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry.Ajit Pawar (66) was among five people killed when a Learjet 45 aircraft crash-landed near Baramati airport in Pune district on Wednesday morning. The aircraft was operated by Delhi-based VSR Ventures and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said there were five people on board, including crew members.Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh expressed his condolences over the death of NCP leader. Raising concerns over the circumstances of the crash, he said that several questions needed to be answered, including visibility conditions, landing protocol and aircraft maintenance.“The question is, why did this accident happen? From the preliminary information I have received, a similar accident involving the same company occurred in Mumbai three years ago. This incident took place in low visibility. Normally, landing should not be attempted unless visibility is at least five kilometres,” he said.Singh added that the aircraft reportedly attempted to land twice before missing the airstrip.“The DGCA should conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. It must also be examined who was responsible for the aircraft’s maintenance and whether DGCA clearance had been granted,” Singh said.Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also called for a probe, describing Pawar’s death as untimely and deeply shocking.“We will demand an investigation into this accident. It is a very sad incident. Ajit Pawar died a premature death. The passing away of a hard-working man has shocked us all. We are with his family in this hour,” Kharge said.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament House complex, Kharge said Pawar had worked for the people and his death had hurt everyone. “This has hurt everyone, including his family members, and we share their grief and pray that they can bear this loss,” he said.Earlier, in a post on X, Kharge said Pawar’s death was “deeply shocking and profoundly distressing,” calling it an untimely loss of a leader with a long political career ahead. He said Pawar would be remembered as a seasoned politician who served Maharashtra in various constitutional roles.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee demanded a Supreme Court-supervised inquiry and alleging that existing agencies could not be trusted.“We trust only the Supreme Court. All other agencies have been completely compromised,” Banerjee told reporters before leaving for Singur, asserting that only a court-monitored probe would bring out the truth.She also alleged a possible political conspiracy, claiming there were reports that Pawar was considering leaving the BJP days before the crash.“Two days ago, I came to know that someone from another party had given a statement that Pawar was willing to leave the BJP, and now this has happened today,” she said, while adding that Pawar was reportedly preparing to return to the NCP faction led by his uncle Sharad Pawar.“It is truly a great loss. My condolences to his family, the people of Maharashtra, and to Sharad Pawar,” Banerjee said.The Biju Janta Dal also joined other opposition parties in demanding a thorough investigation.BJD VP Debi Prasad Mishra said, “It is shocking news that Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra and a regional party leader, died in a plane crash at Baramati. He was a vibrant leader with a strong reputation as a doer, held important portfolios in Maharashtra, and worked extensively for the people. He was also the cousin of the legendary leader Sharad Pawar. This is very unfortunate, and the matter should be thoroughly investigated. ”",Ajit Pawar was among five people killed when a Learjet 45 aircraft crash-landed near Baramati airport in Pune district on Wednesday morning.

Indian Army Raises Bhairav Special Force With Over One Lakh Drone Operatives For Modern Warfare

BENGALURU: US defence technology firm Shield AI Wednesday said it has secured a contract from the Indian Army to supply its V-BAT unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) along with licences for its Hivemind autonomy software, marking a step in India’s push to field advanced autonomous military platforms.The selection — under emergency procurement — covers the procurement of V-BAT vertical take-off and landing unmanned aircraft and the integration of Shield AI’s Hivemind autonomy software into the platform. The Indian Army will also receive licences for the Hivemind software development kit, which allows armed forces and approved partners to develop and test mission-specific autonomy applications.According to Shield AI, the Hivemind system enables defence platforms to sense, decide and act autonomously in complex and contested environments. It is designed to allow unmanned systems to adapt to changing conditions, avoid threats and complete missions with minimal human input.The software kit included in the deal is intended to support sovereign development of autonomous capabilities within India, with select Indian partners expected to use it to build solutions tailored to local operational needs.“V-BAT itself is a Group 3 unmanned aircraft with a ducted-fan design and vertical take-off and landing capability, allowing it to operate without runways.With an endurance of over 12 hours and a heavy-fuel engine, it is designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions in difficult terrain and high-threat environments,” the firm said.Its enclosed rotor and single-engine configuration, it added, enable launch and recovery from confined locations such as ship decks, rooftops and remote forward areas. Shield AI said the system is suited to operations across India’s varied geography, from high-altitude regions to coastal areas, offering long-endurance surveillance with a lower logistical footprint compared to larger drones.The contract also builds on an existing industrial partnership in India. In Dec 2025, JSW Defence began construction of a facility for next-generation unmanned aerial systems at Maheshwaram near Hyderabad, as part of its collaboration with Shield AI.The facility is intended to support domestic manufacturing of the V-BAT and serve as a global production hub, aligning with India’s broader defence indigenisation goals.","US defence technology firm Shield AI has secured a contract from the Indian Army to supply its V-BAT unmanned aircraft systems.

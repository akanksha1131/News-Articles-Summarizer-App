"‘Just a partner, don’t know anything’: Goa nightclub co-owner’s 1st reaction after detention; hunt on for Luthras",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/just-a-partner-dont-know-anything-goa-nightclub-co-owner-ajay-guptas-1st-reaction-after-detention-hunt-on-for-luthras/articleshow/125882184.cms,"(Photo credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Goa Police have detained Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, after a devastating fire at the Arpora establishment killed 25 people. Gupta, who was held in Delhi on Tuesday, insisted he had no role in the day-to-day running of the club. “I am just a partner. I don’t know anything,” he said soon after being picked up, following a Lookout Circular issued against him.The arrest comes as investigators widen their search for the club’s primary owners, brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, who fled to Phuket hours after the blaze. Interpol has issued a Blue Corner Notice to help trace them, and officers say this was processed unusually quickly. Goa Police are coordinating with the CBI and Interpol, and Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said a team will be sent to Thailand to bring the accused back.The Bureau of Immigration earlier informed police that the Luthras boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 from Delhi to Phuket on Sunday morning. A notice seeking an explanation for why their passports should not be impounded has been issued by the regional passport office. A Blue Corner Notice has also been issued against the property owner, British national Surinder Kumar Khosla.Gupta is expected to be flown to Goa on Wednesday and placed under arrest once formalities are complete.Five others connected with the nightclub — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, general manager Vivek Singh, bar manager Rajiv Singhania, gate manager Riyanshu Thakur and employee Bharat Kohli — have already been arrested.Goa Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte called the fire “a very tragic episode”, saying accountability must be fixed and that an inquiry should deliver a factual report. On Tuesday, the district administration also demolished part of the Romeo Lane restaurant in Vagator, owned by the Luthras, citing illegal construction.","Goa Police detain Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, after a devastating fire at the Arpora establishment killed 25 people.

NEW DELHI: The ruling BJP on Wednesday labelled Congress MP Rahul Gandhi 'Videsh Nayak' and 'leader of paryatan' ahead of his upcoming visit to Germany from December 15 to 20.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla — a former Congress member — also highlighted that the trip will coincide with the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament, which began on December 1 and is scheduled to conclude on December 19.“Once again, Videsh Nayak is doing what he does best — going on a foreign tour! Parliament is on till 19th Dec, but Rahul Gandhi will visit Germany from Dec 15–20! Rahul is LoP — leader of paryatan. During the Bihar elections too he was abroad and then on a Jungle Safari, ” Poonawalla wrote on X.While 'Videsh Nayak' (leader of foreign visits) plays on 'Jannayak' (leader of the masses), a title the Congress uses for Gandhi, 'leader of paryatan' (tourism) is a jab at his LoP initials — leader of opposition, a post he has held since June last year - and also references what the BJP says are his frequent foreign trips The Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) announced on Monday that Gandhi will visit Germany. On December 17, the former Congress president will meet German lawmakers and members of the Indian community in Berlin, the European nation’s capital and largest city.During his overseas visits — first as an MP and now in his official capacity as leader of the opposition — the Raebareli MP has repeatedly raised concerns about what he describes as the ‘weakening’ of India’s democracy and the ‘capture’ of its institutions by the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).In September, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which provides him security, flagged repeated ‘lapses’ by Gandhi in following security protocols — including intentionally skipping mandatory protective measures on multiple occasions despite being a Z+ protectee with an Advance Security Liaison (ASL) team.","The Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) announced on Monday that Gandhi will visit Germany.

Agencies pass the buck after wetland vanishes

PANAJI: Less than two months ago, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, chaired by IAS officer Arun Kumar Mishra, brushed aside a report by its three-member committee on ""gross violations"" against the owner of the property on which the nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane stood, a British citizen named Surinder Kumar Khosla, and dropped proceedings against him. Khosla had leased the land to Birch by Romeo Lane.The committee, which included an expert and two members of the coastal authority, said there were ""alleged gross illegal constructions resulting in violations of CRZ notification 2011"" and recommended that it should be deliberated by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) at its meeting and taken up for ""further discussion"".But without discussing or deliberating, coastal authority turned a blind eye to ""gross violations"" report and dropped proceedings on Oct 9 ""There is no violation of CRZ notification in as much as the structures in question fall beyond CRZ area of the creek/ river,"" the coastal authority said, adding it does not have jurisdiction in areas not declared or notified as CRZ (Coastal Regulatory Zone).After the inspection, the committee had reported that the ""RCC permanent structure is constructed fully into the water body"" and there were neither permissions nor NOCs from authorities concerned for the construction of a concrete structure.The committee found a RCC ground-plus-one structure ""in roughly hexagon shape"", which ""is erected in water body... ground floor is used as kitchen and storeroom area"", and the first floor, with coconut leaf roofing, is used as a restaurant.It was on the first floor that a fire broke out Saturday, killing 25 people, after electric firecrackers hit the ceiling as a belly dancer and her troupe performed.But the coastal authority, chaired by Mishra who is now posted in Delhi, dismissed the report and accepted the argument that ""there is no environmental cause"".The Arpora-Nagoa panchayat had on Oct 31, 1996 issued an NOC to construct a restaurant, staff quarters, compound wall, and later another NOC on Aug 12, 2004 to renovate the restaurant.Despite the committee attaching a Google image and the coastal zone management plan (CZMP) extract, which showed the alleged violations, the coastal authority noted ""that the CZMP for Goa had already been notified. The CZM indicates that the subject matter ground-plus-one RCC structure is outside the CRZ area"".The coastal authority report was the consequence of a complaint by Pradeep Ghadi Amonkar and Sunil Divkar Shetye on Dec 21, 2023, regarding illegal construction of Birch by Romeo Lane.New Delhi: Who is responsible for a wetland near Wazirabad disappearing? The National Green Tribunal is no closer to finding an answer despite the the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Central Pollution Control Board submitting their replies.On July 16, 2025, The Times of India had reported that the wetland had been filled up using inert waste from the Bhalswa landfill. The report highlighted that the Jharoda pond, which supported rich plant and bird life until 2023, had been buried under inert waste allegedly brought from the Bhalswa landfill..Taking suo motu cognizance of the report titled 'Find it if you can. Wetland near Wazirabad vanished under inert waste', the tribunal had issued notice to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the North district magistrate, and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) seeking an explanation on the matter. Only MCD and CPCB have responded so far, with both shifting blame to other agencies.In its submissions MCD said it was the responsibility of the private concessionaire appointed to flatten the Bhalswa landfill to ensure the inert material was disposed of correctly. It also said that the site belongs to DDA.In its reply, MCD said it was not ""dumping any form of waste at any wetland in the Wazirabad and Timarpur areas"". ""The said site, where it has been alleged that waste is being dumped, is owned by Delhi Development Authority,"" it said.The civic body further stated that it was merely following a 2019 order by the tribunal to dispose of 30 lakh MT of legacy waste from the Bhalswa landfill site, while adding that it received a request from DDA to facilitate the supply of bioremediated inert material on May 24, 2023. It added that the agency was neither involved in the process of identification of the site nor in the decision-making process.The DDA order shared by MCD said, ""this office permits to supply inert and C&D material at DDA vacant low-lying area at both sides of the Marginal Bandh at Jharoda Majra, Burari.""CPCB, meanwhile, said it had issued directions in 2021 under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to all the State Pollution Control Boards and the Pollution Control Committees for the enforcement of provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.""DPCC shall monitor and ensure compliance with the directions issued...

107 oppn MPs submit notice to remove Madras HC judge over lamp-lighting order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/107-oppn-mps-submit-notice-to-remove-madras-hc-judge-over-lamp-lighting-order/articleshow/125879677.cms,"Over 100 opposition MPs have submitted a notice to the Lok Sabha Speaker seeking the removal of Madras High Court Justice GR Swaminathan. They accuse him of misconduct and bias in a recent order concerning a lamp lighting at a temple near a dargah in Tamil Nadu.

Oppn accuses Madras HC judge of showing 'undue favouritism'

As many as 107 MPs, including those from Congress, DMK and Samajwadi Party, signed the application which accuses Justice Swaminathan of misconduct, saying his functioning has raised questions over ""impartiality, transparency and secular nature"" of the judiciary.One of the grounds cited in the notice by the opposition against the Madras HC judge is ""deciding cases on the basis of particular political ideology and against secular principles of Indian Constitution"".DMK MP Kanimozhi handed over the notice to Birla. She was joined by Priyanka Gandhi and Gaurav Gogoi of Congress and Akhilesh Yadav of SP, among others.The judge is also accused of showing ""undue favouritism"" to a senior advocate and lawyers from a particular community. Supriya Sule of NCP(SP) and Asaduddin Owaisi of AIMIM were also among the signatories.At least 100 MPs are required to support a motion to remove a judge, and it is now for Birla to study the grounds on which they have sought the motion for his removal and verify the signatories before he decides on admitting the notice.The judgment has sparked a political row, with DMK raising the issue in Lok Sabha last week. Party MP TR Baalu accused BJP of trying to spark communal tensions in the state, where elections are due in a few months.Union minister and BJP MP L Murugan had hit back, accusing the state govt of denying devotees their right to worship.Baalu's criticism of Justice Swaminathan in Lok Sabha for owing allegiance to a ""particular ideology"" had drawn a sharp response from govt, with Union minister Kiren Rijiju emphasising that he cannot cast aspersions on the judiciary.Hearing a plea, Justice GR Swaminathan had on Dec 1 held that Arulmighu Subramania Swamy temple was duty-bound to light the lamp at the 'deepathoon', a stone lamp pillar located on the Thiruparankundram hillock close to the dargah.When authorities did not allow it, the single bench passed another order on Dec 3 permitting devotees themselves to light the lamp and directed Central Industrial Security Force to ensure their protection.However, the state govt did not implement the order and has moved Supreme Court challenging the verdict. The Madurai bench of the high court had last week dismissed an appeal filed by Madurai district collector and city police commissioner.","107 MPs, including those from Congress, DMK and Samajwadi Party, signed the application.

"EC can't determine voter's citizenship, but surely inquire into it: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-cant-determine-voters-citizenship-but-surely-inquire-into-it-supreme-court/articleshow/125879660.cms,"The Supreme Court clarified that while the Election Commission cannot definitively determine citizenship, it can inquire about it if doubts arise regarding voters. The apex court emphasized that Indian citizenship is a constitutional prerequisite for voting, not merely a matter of residence and age. This ruling supports the EC's stance on verifying voter eligibility.

If it has doubts, EC can probe person's citizenship, says SC

The opposition's stand that EC cannot determine citizenship has been a common thread running through the arguments of a large number of politicians and NGOs represented by advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Prashant Bhushan, Shadan Farasat and Md Nizamuddin Pasha.EC has no jurisdiction to engage in determination of citizenship of a voter as that is the task of govt or Foreigners Tribunal. All of them argued that according to Representation of the People Act, if a person has proof of residence and is over 18, and gives a self-declaration that he is a citizen of India, then EC has no power to inquire into citizenship and delete him from the voters' list.On Tuesday, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi responded, saying, ""EC does not claim that it has the power to determine citizenship of a person or declare him as a foreigner. But, if it has doubts about the citizenship of a person registered as a voter or seeking inclusion of name as a voter, it can surely inquire into it.""""The first and foremost pre-condition for inclusion as a voter is that he/she must be a citizen of India. Given the constitutional and statutory powers conferred on EC, can it not undertake an inquisitorial exercise to find out who are doubtful citizens? That is included in the constitutional task of superintendence of elections,"" the bench said, in what marked an endorsement of EC's own stance on the issue.Farasat argued when a statutory procedure was provided for determination of citizenship, EC had no jurisdiction to usurp that process. SC said, ""To argue that a person required only proof of residence and age for inclusion in a voter list without proof of citizenship would be a misnomer. Proof of residence and age are statutory requirements. But citizenship is a constitutional requirement.""""Take a hypothetical example of an illegal migrant residing in India for more than a decade and more than 18 years of age. Will he be counted as a citizen to be included in the voter list? To argue that citizenship is to be presumed when residential and age criteria are met will be wrong ...,"" it said.Farasat said, ""The danger of illegal migrants getting into voters' lists is far less compared to mass exclusion of voters in the name of identifying non-citizens."" SC said, "" Can it be said that by asking for documentary proof, it is attempting to determine citizenship of a person?""",EC has no jurisdiction to engage in determination of citizenship of a voter as that is the task of govt or Foreigners Tribunal.

"Kids as young as 11 dabbling in drugs, shows 10-city survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kids-as-young-as-11-dabbling-in-drugs-shows-10-city-survey/articleshow/125878454.cms,"A nationwide school survey reveals alarming drug experimentation among Indian children, with initiation as early as 11 and an average age of 12.9. One in seven students has tried psychoactive substances, with opioids and cannabis prevalent. Experts warn of easy access and emotional distress driving this trend, urging early intervention and parental vigilance.

NEW DELHI: A major school survey across 10 Indian cities has revealed that children are experimenting with drugs far earlier than expected, with the average age of initiation just 12.9 years and some starting as young as 11. The findings, published in the National Medical Journal of India this month, show that one in seven school students tried a psychoactive substance at least once.The study surveyed 5,920 students aged around 14.7 years across Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Imphal, Jammu, Dibrugarh and Ranchi. It found 15.1% had used a substance in their lifetime, 10.3% in the past year, and 7.2% in the past month. After tobacco (4%) and alcohol (3.8%), the most commonly used substances were opioids (2.8%), cannabis (2%) and inhalants (1.9%), with most opioid use linked to non-prescribed pharmaceutical pills.The multi-city study was led by Dr Anju Dhawan, chief of National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS Delhi, in collaboration with medical colleges in Chandigarh, Dibrugarh, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Srinagar, Imphal, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Ranchi.Substance use rose sharply with age. Students in classes XI-XII were twice as likely to have used substances compared to Class VIII. Boys reported higher tobacco and cannabis use, while girls showed higher inhalant and pharmaceutical opioid use. Over half the students said they would hide drug use if asked, indicating that actual prevalence could be higher.The survey found a clear link between substance use and emotional distress: 31% of past-year users showed high psychological difficulty scores compared with 25% of non-users, with marked differences in conduct issues, hyperactivity and emotional symptoms.Against this backdrop, Dr Achal Bhagat, senior consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, says the early age of initiation is an urgent warning. He notes that easy access and unaddressed emotional distress are driving children toward substances, even as the adolescent brain remains highly vulnerable to lasting harm from inhalants, opioids and cannabis. He points to a worrying rise in substance use among girls, often linked to discreet self-medication, and urges parents to watch for mood shifts, withdrawal, falling grades and secrecy. With only 1% of young users seeking help, he calls for stronger school mental-health support and open family conversations to prevent early experimentation from hardening into addiction.Family and peer influence also played a strong role, with 40% reporting tobacco or alcohol use at home and users far more likely to have peers who consume substances. Researchers say interventions must begin much earlier - ideally before middle school - to delay first use and prevent later addiction.The authors say the findings offer the clearest picture yet of adolescent substance use in India and stress the need for urgent school-based prevention, early identification and structured support before experimentation becomes entrenched.","Survey of 5,920 students across 10 Indian cities reveals alarming trend.

BENGALURU: A 25-year-old Bengaluru resident, Mohammed Ishaq, was among those who lost their lives in the tragedy early Sunday morning.Ishaq, a private firm employee and data analyst at a bank, lived in Ashwath Nagar on Thanisandra Main Road. He was the son of businessman Mohammed Hussain and is survived by his parents and a younger sister.According to relatives, Ishaq had spoken to his father just hours before the tragedy, sharing how he and his friends were enjoying a bachelor-party trip in Goa. He had travelled with five friends, one of whom was getting married.An acquaintance of the family said Ishaq and his friends initially managed to exit the club after noticing the fire, but Ishaq allegedly went back inside to retrieve his mobile phone. He may have died due to the stampede or cardiac arrest; his body showed only minor burns. Police informed the family that Ishaq died in the stampede while exiting the club.Ishaq’s body arrived in Bengaluru on Monday morning via a flight from Goa International Airport in Dabolim.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

Rise of an empire built on speed — and cracks

A tragedy that cracked the façade

GOA: Within three hours of the inferno that tore through Birch by Romeo Lane in Goa’s Arpora — killing 25 people during a packed Saturday-night performance — owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra slipped out of the country through Delhi airport.By 5.30am Sunday, the brothers were airborne, headed to Phuket on IndiGo flight 6E-1073, Goa DGP Alok Kumar revealed on Monday, calling their swift exit “a clear attempt to evade investigation”.Even as Saurabh posted a sombre message on social media expressing “profound grief” and “unwavering solidarity” with victims’ families, the Bureau of Immigration issued a LookOut Circular for both brothers. Goa Police, coordinating with Interpol, says it now wants them in custody “at the earliest”.Also read: The 'burning' Luthra empire Goa police on Tuesday issued a blue corner notice through Interpol, aiming to track, identify, and provisionally detain the brothers while extradition proceedings are considered.A Goa police team reached Delhi on Sunday armed with an arrest warrant, searched the Luthras’ residences and offices — but found nothing. Hours later, immigration authorities in Mumbai confirmed the truth: the brothers had bolted.Delhi Police’s crime branch detained senior Romeo Lane executive Bharat Kohli from north Delhi and handed him to Goa Police on transit remand. Another Delhi-based partner, Ajay Gupta, is now on the radar.Meanwhile, four arrested Birch staffers — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania and general manager Vivek Singh — were remanded to six days' custody. Three suspended Goa government officials have also been summoned.Investigators say electric firecrackers, set off during a belly-dance performance, shot into the club’s wooden ceiling, triggering the blaze that ripped through the first-floor structure packed with 150 guests.To the Luthras, their empire was a decade-long dream that began in Delhi’s Hudson Lane with Mama’s Buoi — a cosy student-favourite.But it was Romeo Lane that turned them into nightlife royalty. What began as a modest Civil Lines spot exploded into a roaring, post-Covid success in Vagator, Goa, drawing tourists with sea views, fire dancers, Bollywood nights and big-budget spectacle.Their brand became so coveted that malls from Indore and Nagpur to Agra and Dehradun queued up to house a Romeo Lane outlet. Developers offered to cover construction. Franchisees paid hefty fees and royalties. Expansion was relentless: 25+ outlets in India, one in Dubai, and nearly 25 more in the works.Behind the scenes, Saurabh was the flamboyant, aggressive face; Gaurav, the quieter engineer-turned-operator. Their paralysed father, Vijay Luthra, remained the family anchor.But rapid growth came with strain. Franchisees complained of being left unattended after signing expensive contracts. Several outlets allegedly suffered losses. Industry insiders say the empire ballooned faster than the brothers could control.Local panchayat authorities have now flagged major violations at Birch — a property the brothers touted as ""India’s first island bar"".The outlet, functional since March 2024, reportedly lacked key safety clearances.Questions rage: Why were these not flagged earlier? Who allowed a kitchen in the basement? Why did enforcement wake up only after 25 people died?In Delhi, murmurs have grown louder. Some franchise partners say they may discard the Romeo Lane brand name entirely. Restaurateurs say the brothers owe the industry — and the families of the dead — an in-person explanation, not a social media statement.From a brand that once epitomised India’s booming nightlife, Romeo Lane now stands at a precipice — its future hostage to an escape in the night, a trail of unanswered questions, and a tragedy that India won’t forget soon.","Romeo Lane owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra slipped out of the country through Delhi airport.

Tom Kohler-Cadmore: ‘If I Middle It, It’s probably a six!’ | Power-Hitting Mindset Explained

NEW DELHI: Smriti Mandhana ’s old motivational words have resurfaced online after she and music composer Palash Muchhal announced that their wedding has been called off. The resurfaced clip, from an interview with Humans of Bombay, shows the India vice-captain speaking about how she deals with difficult phases in life, something fans feel resonates strongly with her current situation.In the interview recorded three years ago, Mandhana opened up about her journey in cricket, navigating expectations and criticism, and building resilience. She revealed that her coping mechanism is rooted in simplicity and routine rather than overthinking setbacks.She explained, “It's pretty easy for me. I have short-term goals. Say if I feel low today, I will just start writing what I have to work on for the next six days or for the next seven days, in my batting or in my fitness. So once I start doing that, I just forget what's happening. I just focus on what I have to do.”Mandhana added that shifting her focus to what lies ahead helps her regain motivation.“So when I change my headspace into what I have to do in the next 6-7 days, I don't know, I just feel like there's so much to look forward to,” she said.Reflecting on her evolution from a young aspiring cricketer to one of the most recognised faces in women’s cricket, Mandhana said the sport has shaped her personality and approach to life.“You have to always start your day as a new day because you start your innings on zero, even if you score a hundred,” she shared.She added, “So that's the biggest takeaway from what I have learnt. Whatever happens in your life the next day is a fresh day.”On Sunday, Mandhana finally addressed the speculation around her personal life, confirming that the wedding with Palash Muchhal had been ""called off."" In her statement, she wrote, ""I need to clarify that the wedding is called off. I would like to close this matter here and implore all of you to do the same.""Calling herself a “very private person,” Mandhana urged fans and the media to ""respect the privacy of both families"" and allow them the space to move on.Looking ahead, Mandhana emphasised her commitment to the sport, saying, ""I believe there is a higher purpose driving us all and for me that has always been representing my country at the highest level. I hope to continue to play and win trophies for India for as long as possible.""She ended her note with gratitude and closure: ""Thank you for all your support. It's time to move forward.""","Smriti Mandhana's old motivational words have resurfaced online. The India vice- captain spoke about how she deals with difficult phases in life.

IndiGo flight cut doubled to 10%; airline may operate even lesser flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indigo-flight-cut-doubled-to-10-airline-may-operate-even-lesser-flights/articleshow/125871645.cms,"Photo: X/@RamMNK

As IndiGo Spirals Into Crisis, PM Modi Stresses Rules Must Ease Citizens’ Lives, Not Burden Them

NEW DELHI: There will be a lot less domestic flights this winter as an under fire aviation ministry Tuesday evening decided to slash IndiGo’s schedule by 10% — doubling it from the 5% cut ordered earlier that day. The airline operated over 2,200 daily flights and this cut translates into about 216 less flights. But in reality IndiGo may actually operate an even lesser number of flights at about 1,800-1,900 — meaning about 500 daily cancelations — to keep operations stabilised, say sources.“The ministry considers it necessary to curtail the overall IndiGo routes, which will help in stabilising the airline’s operations and lead to reduced cancellations. A curtailment of 10% has been ordered. While abiding with it, Indigo will continue to cover all its destinations as before,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on X Tuesday evening.IndiGo “CEO Pieter Elbers was summoned to the ministry (Tuesday) to provide an update…. last week, many passengers faced severe inconvenience due to IndiGo’s internal mismanagement of crew rosters, flight schedules and inadequate communication….inquiry and necessary actions are underway,” Naidu added.Earlier in the day, the DGCA’s 5% cut order had stated the airline has “not demonstrated an ability to operate” the its previously approved winter schedule of 15,014 weekly departures “efficiently”. The airline was directed to reduce operations “across sectors, especially on high-demand, high-frequency flights, and to avoid single-flight operations on a sector by IndiGo.”The airline has to submit a revised schedule by 5 pm on Wednesday. IndiGo’s summer schedule was for operating 14,158 weekly domestic flights which was increased 6% in the winter schedule starting Oct 26. This translated into the airline having an approval to operate 64,346 domestic flights in Nov. “As per operational data submitted by IndiGo, it (actually operated) 59,438 flights during Nov 2025, with 951 flight cancellations recorded during the month,” the DGCA notice issued to the airline about flight cuts on Monday night says.The regulator had increased IndiGo’s winter flights based on an estimated higher aircraft availability at 403 against 351 this summer. “However, it has been observed that the airline could operate only 339 aircraft in Oct 2025 and 344 aircraft in Nov 2025… IndiGo increased its departures by 9.66% in comparison to winter schedule 2024 and by 6% in relation to summer schedule 2025. However, the airline has not demonstrated an ability to operate these schedules efficiently,” the DGCA notice says.The problem essentially happened as the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) that increased pilot requirement came into effect from Nov 1. On the one hand IndiGo did not gear up for that and on the other, its daily flights increased 6%. So November saw modest cancellations but the mismatch snowballed into a major crisis in the first week of Dec with hundreds of flights being cancelled daily.Air India and AI Express, on the other hand, saw their weekly domestic schedule being reduced by 0.8% and 6%, respectively from summer to winter schedule. India's second biggest airline group saw its weekly summer domestic flights 7,685 reduce to overall by 3% to 7,448 in winter. Akasa also saw its weekly winter domestic schedule reduce by 5.7% from 1,089 to 1,027. SpiceJet, which is ramping up operations, saw an increase of over 26% with the number increasing from 1,240 to 1,568.Now questions are being asked of aviation authorities why did they permit IndiGo more flights without checking its crew availability under the new FDTL requirement.On its part, IndiGo has attributed the disruption to a “compounding effect of multiple factors which coincided in lesser or greater measure” in an “unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence.” These are: Minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to the start of the winter season; adverse weather conditions increased congestion in the aviation system, andiImplementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules (FDTL phase II) that came into force on Nov 1, 2025.","The airline operated over 2,200 daily flights and this cut translates into about 216 less flights. But in reality IndiGo may actually operate an even lesser number of flights at about 1,800-1,900.

'No Link To Bengal': Amit Shah's Fiery Speech on Vande Mataram, Blames Nehru, Indira of Sabotage

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday was seen having a meal with his parliament colleagues in the Parliament canteen.Shah was joined by Union MoS Nityanand Rai, Union minsiter Kiren Rijiju and BJP MP Anil Baluni.In the clip, the leaders could be seen having Indian cuisine over some seemingly light-hearted discussion.Earlier in the day, initiating the debate in Rajya Sabha, Amit Shah said the division of ' Vande Mataram ' song for ""politics of appeasement"" led to partition of India.He slammed Opposition for linking the debate on 150 years of the national song with the upcoming West Bengal elections.Shah said Vande Mataram was the ""mantra"" that awakened India's cultural nationalism, and remains as relevant today as it was during the freedom struggle.He stressed that the song will remain relevant in the days to come as well, in taking the country towards Viksit Bharat.Shah also attacked Congress for questioning the need for a debate on Vande Mataram, and accused first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru of ""dividing"" the poem and limiting it to two stanzas.""Yesterday some MPs in the Lok Sabha questioned what is the need to discuss Vande Mataram. The need for discussion...wasas relevant when the song was written, during the freedom movement, today, and will be as relevant in 2047 when the Viksit Bharat would be achieved,"" Shah said.""Some people are saying Vande Mataram is being discussed because elections are coming in West Bengal... They are trying to reduce the importance of Vande Mataram by linking it with Bengal elections,"" he said.The home minister urged members to take the spirit of the message of Vande Mataram to the youth of the nation.He said the song was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in Bengal, but it spread across the nation, and became the chant for India's freedom struggle.The home minister said the song was written years after India tolerated ""Islamic attacks"", and the British tried to impose a new culture on the country.","Union home minister Amit Shah was seen having a meal with his parliament colleagues in the Parliament canteen.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday issued a notice to veteran Congress leader Sonia Gandhi over the wrongful inclusion in the 1980-81 electoral rolls.Senior advocate Pavan Narang, appearing for the revisionist Vikas Tripathi, argued that the matter warranted reconsideration as the material placed on record indicated serious irregularities in the manner Sonia Gandhi's name was entered into the electoral roll before she became an Indian citizen.He submitted that ""certain documents must have been forged and falsified to get the name in the electoral roll of 1980,"" emphasising that her name was later deleted and then re-entered in 1983 on the basis of an application filed in January 1983, both instances, according to him, occurring before she acquired citizenship.After considering the submissions, Judge Gogne issued notice to both respondents, including Sonia Gandhi.The revision petition stems from a complaint filed by advocate Vikas Tripathi, which the Magistrate had rejected at the threshold, holding that it lacked legal foundation and relied solely on uncertified photocopies of electoral records from 1980.The Magistrate had also observed that questions of citizenship and electoral rolls fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Election Commission of India, and cannot be adjudicated through a criminal complaint.Meanwhile, Congress MP and Sonia's daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra defended her mother claiming the allegations to be ""absolute lie""""Do they have any evidence? This is an absolute lie. She voted only after she became a citizen (of India). I don't know why they are after her, even though she is about to turn 80.

'Nonchalant, Lackadaisical Attitude': Ex-AirAsia CFO Breaks Down Indigo Fiasco

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over the chaos caused by IndiGo 's widespread flight cancellations across major airports in the country, saying ""rules and laws are in order to correct the system and not to harass the people.""Speaking to reporters after the NDA Parliamentary Party meeting, the Union parliamentary and minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""during the NDA parliamentary meeting the Prime Minister told NDA MPs that people should not be troubled and face inconvenience.""""Rules and laws are good but in order to correct the system it is not right to harass people,"" he added.Rijiju further said that PM Modi urged MPs to focus on reforms that make life easier for citizens and ensure people do not face unnecessary hardship from the government.The prime minister's remarks come amid IndiGo’s operational crisis that led to the cancellation of over 1200 flights across major airports, leaving thousands of passengers stranded nationwide.The crisis comes from the rollout of revised Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) norms, which mandate longer weekly rest for pilots, stricter night-duty limits and fewer night landings.Airlines, including IndiGo and Air India, had initially opposed the rules, but they were implemented in phases in July and November following Delhi High Court directions.IndiGo has now secured temporary relaxations in the second phase of the norms until February 10.According to the civil aviation ministry, between November 21 and December 7, a total of 9,55,591 PNRs were cancelled and refunded, amounting to Rs 827 crore in refunds. Of the 9,000 delayed bags, around 4,500 have been delivered, while the rest are expected to be returned within 36 hours.Rijiju further asserted that the PM also used the NDA meeting to urge MPs to prioritise reforms and connect with the youth. ""All NDA leaders congratulated PM Modi for the NDA's victory in the Bihar elections. PM Modi guided all the NDA MPs to work for their respective constituencies. The PM emphasised undertaking reforms across all sectors to ease the public's lives and ensure they face no problems,"" he said.""The PM said that laws should help people. He also urged the MPs to connect with the youth. I express my gratitude to the PM for this guidance. It was a very good meeting of the NDA parliamentary party,"" he added.The Union minister further stated that the government intends to counter the Opposition's claims during Lok Sabha discussions on election reforms today.""Today, Lok Sabha will discuss election reform. Opposition will speak. The government will also clear the delusion that has been created. The government will clarify the wrong narrative being set regarding people's trust and their participation in election processes,"" he said.",PM Narendra Modi expressed concern over the chaos caused by IndiGo's widespread flight cancellations across major airports in the country.

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision aimed at facilitating the education of a minor girl, Supreme Court on Monday approved issuance of an SC certificate based on the 'Adi Dravida' caste of her mother, who is married to a non-SC person, even though it is yet to adjudicate a bunch of petitions challenging the norm that a child inherits their father's caste.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi refused to entertain a challenge to a Madras HC order directing grant of SC caste certificate to the Puducherry girl on the sole ground that her academic career may suffer without it.""We are keeping the question of law open,"" the bench said. However, what the CJI said next could lead to a big debate. He said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.The mother had requested the tahsildar to grant SC certificates to her three children - two daughters and a son - based on her caste certificate as her husband had stayed at her parents' house since their marriage. In her application, she had contended that her parents and grandparents belonged to Hindu Adi Dravida community.The presidential notifications of Mar 5, 1964, and Feb 17, 2002, read with instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, say that a person's eligibility to get a caste certificate is primarily based on their father's caste as well as his residential status in the state or UT's jurisdiction.In Punit Rai Vs Dinesh Chaudhary [(2003) 8 SCC 204], a case relating to reservation, SC had said that the decisive factor for determination of caste of a person will be the caste of the father as per customary Hindu Law and that in the absence of statutory law, they would inherit their caste from the father and not the mother.In the 2012 judgment in 'Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika vs Gujarat', a two-judge bench of SC ruled, ""The determination of caste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in complete disregard of attending facts of the case."" It said, ""In an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, there may be a presumption the child has the caste of the father. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or a marriage between tribal and non-tribal, the husband belongs to a forward caste.""""But by no means is the presumption conclusive or irrebuttable, and it is open to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to SC/ST. By virtue of being the son of a forward caste father, he did not have any advantageous start in life but on the contrary suffered the deprivations, indignities, humiliations and handicaps like any other member of the community to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, he was always treated as a member of the community to which her mother belonged not only by that community but by people outside the community as well,"" it said.","CJI Surya Kant said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125853517,imgsize-1051879,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-had-earlier-held-fathers-caste-as-decisive-factor.jpg"

""Instead of defending itself democratically and offering accountability, Congress arrested the Social Media Convener of BJP Telangana,"" they added.Earlier in Hyderabad, the Telangana BJP held a ‘Maha Dharna’, accusing the Congress government of ""betraying"" voters by not implementing the promises made before the state elections.Those who participated included Telangana BJP president N Ramchander Rao, Union minister G Kishan Reddy, MP D K Aruna, Rajya Sabha MP K Laxman, MLAs, MLCs and other senior leaders.

'Leader Is Bulldozing': Kharge, Nadda Lock Horns Over TMC MP's Speech In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: As the Rajya Sabha met on Tuesday for a special discussion marking 150 years of Vande Mataram, the session quickly turned combative. Congress president and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge used the occasion to criticise BJP ’s ideological predecessors, accusing them of “working for the Britishers,” while Congress leaders were fighting for independence.Kharge said the Congress had played a central role in turning Vande Mataram into a rallying call against British rule. “Your (BJP) history is that you were always against the freedom struggle and patriotic songs. When Mahatma Gandhi started the non-cooperation movement in 1921, lakhs of freedom fighters from the Congress went to jail chanting 'Vande Mataram'. What were you doing? You were working for the Britishers,” he said.He also alleged that PM Modi “leaves no chance to insult Jawaharlal Nehru,” adding, “Home Minister Amit Shah follows the same,"" as quoted by ANI.Earlier in the House, Shah rejected Opposition claims that the discussion was politically timed ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections. He said critics needed to “think afresh” about the legacy and significance of the national song.“Some people believe that because there are elections in Bengal, this discussion is being held. They want to link the glorification of Vande Mataram with the West Bengal elections. I think they need to reconsider their understanding,” he said. Describing the song as an “immortal creation that awakens devotion and duty toward Mother India,” he urged members to view the debate beyond electoral politics.Vande Mataram, first composed independently and later included in Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s 1882 novel Anandamath, completed 150 years on November 7, 2025.","Congress president and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge used the occasion to criticise BJP ’s ideological predecessors.

After Delhi Blast, Jaishankar Tells SCO Nations India Has Right To Defend Its People Against Terror

NEW DELHI: National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday arrested Dr Bilal Naseer Malla of Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, for allegedly destroying evidence linked to last month’s car blast near the Red Fort.His arrest in Delhi marks the eighth made in the case as investigators continue to widen their probe into the deadly attack.According to the NIA, Bilal also played a role in the larger conspiracy behind the November 10 explosion, which killed 15 people and injured several others in the busy Red Fort area. “As per NIA investigations, Bilal had knowingly harboured the deceased accused Umar Un Nabi by providing him logistical support. He is also accused of destruction of evidence related to the terrorist attack,” the agency said in a statement.The blast is being treated as a terrorist strike under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, with investigators linking it to a Jaish-e-Mohammed module involving radicalised young doctors and cross-border handlers.Several others connected to the accused have already been arrested, including a Faridabad resident who allegedly sheltered Umar Un Nabi shortly before the incident.The NIA said it is continuing to work closely with central and state agencies to trace every part of the conspiracy and identify all those involved in planning and executing the attack.","Dr Bilal Naseer Malla of Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, arrested for allegedly destroying evidence linked to last month’s car blast near the Red Fort.

Centre pushes PPP medical colleges nationwide; 11 projects get nod under new funding model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-pushes-ppp-medical-colleges-nationwide-11-projects-get-nod-under-new-funding-model/articleshow/125825350.cms,"Representative image (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase, with the Centre revealing in the Lok Sabha that 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model. These colleges will come up by upgrading district hospitals — a shift in strategy aimed at accelerating MBBS seat creation without waiting for full government-backed infrastructure.The projects cleared so far are spread across Jharkhand (Giridih, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Khunti), Arunachal Pradesh (Namsai) and Uttar Pradesh (Baghpat, Mainpuri, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Hamirpur).The government explained that the model will rely on Viability Gap Funding (VGF) — a financial support mechanism designed to make socially important but commercially unviable projects feasible for private partners. Under the scheme, the Centre may fund up to 30% of the project cost, with states allowed to match this amount. For pilot projects, support can go up to 40% of the cost, plus 25% of operations-and-maintenance expenses for the first five years.In return, States must allow full and free access to district hospital facilities for the attached medical colleges and must provide land on concessional terms — conditions aimed at ensuring that medical education does not dilute public-hospital services.The Lok Sabha reply also stressed that faculty norms, curriculum rules, equipment standards and staffing requirements will remain under the National Medical Commission’s Minimum Standard Requirement (MSR) Regulations, ensuring that PPP colleges follow the same quality benchmarks as government medical colleges.Alongside the PPP push, the government also confirmed that the existing Centrally Sponsored Scheme for upgrading district hospitals into government medical colleges has already sanctioned all 157 planned institutions, including 14 in Madhya Pradesh and two in Maharashtra.While the PPP model is still at an early stage, the approval of 11 projects signals the Centre’s intent to create a parallel pathway for strengthening medical infrastructure, especially in districts that have historically lacked teaching hospitals.The next challenge lies in execution — from faculty recruitment to readiness of hospital facilities — but policymakers say the new structure opens a crucial opportunity to expand medical education faster, in areas that need it most.",India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase. 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model.

'No Link To Bengal': Amit Shah's Fiery Speech on Vande Mataram, Blames Nehru, Indira of Sabotage

Partition result of dividing Vande Mataram: Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah asserted Tuesday that had Congress not ""divided"" Vande Mataram , India would not have been partitioned as its concession to the Muslim League over the song in 1937 started the politics of appeasement, which finally led to the country's division.Initiating the discussion in Rajya Sabha on Vande Mataram's 150th anniversary, Shah articulated a muscular concept of cultural nationalism, a founding tenet of BJP and the larger Sangh Parivar, and said Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's composition affirmed the ancient civilisational glory and tradition of worshipping the motherland that suffered from Islamic invasions and British rule.Shah slammed the opposition for belittling Vande Mataram by statements that the discussion was a way to divert attention from pressing issues and gain traction ahead of elections in Bengal.Home minister Amit Shah said it was fitting to pay respect to a song that had stirred patriots for generations and those thinking otherwise needed to revisit their understanding.""For us, India has not just been a geographical entity. We believe it to be a cultural space and treat it as our mother. Lord Ram and Adi Sankara believed in this, and this was what Bankim babu espoused in Vande Mataram,"" Shah said in an apparent refutation of critics of the song's evocation of Goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati as marked idolatry and their refusal to sing it.""We do not fear discussing issues. We do not boycott Parliament. If Parliament is not boycotted and allowed to function, then discussion on all issues will take place. We don't have anything to hide,"" he said, noting that when the song completed its 100th anniversary, the country was in the grip of Emergency. Those singing Vande Mataram were jailed, he said.""Look at the situation of Congress, which used to start its sessions with Vande Mataram. But when the debate started in Lok Sabha, both members of the Gandhi family were missing. The opposition to Vande Mataram is in the blood of Congress leadership, from Jawaharlal Nehru to the present-day Congress brass,"" Shah said in a pointed criticism of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Shah accused many opposition leaders of not according respect to Vande Mataram and submitted a list to the Rajya Sabha chairman after Congress MP Jairam Ramesh asked him to back his claim. A BJP member will never do this, he added. He said it was only after a proposal by BJP MP Ram Naik that Vande Mataram started being sung in Parliament.Shah said the song became the chant of the freedom struggle despite British attempts to ban it. ""Even though the (British) govt tried to ban it, and people were beaten and jailed for chanting Vande Mataram, it touched people's hearts and spread from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,"" he said, recalling Aurobindo who called it the ""mantra"" of India's awakening.Targeting Congress and Nehru, Shah said the song was divided on its 50th anniversary in 1937. ""That is where appeasement politics started. Many like me believe if Vande Mataram was not divided into two for appeasement politics, India would also not have been partitioned,"" he added.","Home Minister Amit Shah said Congress's decision to divide Vande Mataram in 1937, as a concession to the Muslim League, initiated appeasement politics that ultimately led to India's partition.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Tuesday took on Rahul Gandhi over his allegation of electoral malpractices against the govt, saying EVMs were introduced by former PM Rajiv Gandhi to curb poll irregularities, and blamed ""pro-Muslim"" politics of Congress and regional parties for their opposition to SIR, as he cited disproportionate rise in Muslim population in states like West Bengal to back the exercise.Dubey rebutted Gandhi's allegations - including over ""vote chori"" and govt's decisive say in appointment of election commissioners - saying Congress put its favourite bureaucrats in poll bodies and rewarded them with berths and party tickets. As member of the selection committee, the LoP is now part of the process and can file his dissent which was never the case when Congress was in office, he said.Intervening in the discussion on election reforms in the lower House of Parliament, law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said the special intensive revision of electoral rolls has been held multiple times since 1952 & was necessary to clean up rolls, which change due to migration and rapid urbanisation.Meghwal accused Congress of engaging in ""vote chori"" since the first LS elections, including in the defeat of B R Ambedkar. He emphasised that the Modi govt did not change the law regarding appointment of the CEC and fellow election commissioners, but created a framework following a 2023 SC ruling.Nishikant Dubey said former CEC TN Sheshan was given a Congress ticket to contest against BJP's LK Advani, while another CEC, MS Gill, became a minister in the Manmohan Singh govt after ""favouring"" Sonia Gandhi in the ""office of profit"" row.""They talk of transparency. Congress worker Batuk Singh was made UPSC chairman,"" he said.He said Parliament's select committees dating back to the 60s and 70s recommended SIR and voting machines for reforming polling process, while a joint committee that included MPs from Jana Sangh, BJP's forerunner, favoured in 1972 reducing the voting age to 18 from 21. Rajiv Gandhi implemented this in 1988, and Congress is claiming it to be the biggest polls reform, he said.Batting for SIR, he named a number of districts, including Kolkata and Murshidabad, in poll-bound West Bengal and Jharkhand, and cited 2011 Census data to flag disproportionately high rise in the Muslim population compared to their national growth since independence to claim the presence of Bangladeshi infiltrators.BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal said Congress did ""vote chori"" by picking Nehru as PM over Sardar Patel, who was favoured by most party units, while Indira Gandhi did it by imposing Emergency.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey says EVMs were introduced by former PM Rajiv Gandhi to curb poll irregularities.

NEW DELHI: Asking why the prime minister and home minister are so keen on deciding who becomes the election commissioner, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi Tuesday alleged that BJP has captured the Election Commission (EC) which is ""colluding"" with the governing party to help it win polls. He also accused the BJP of ""vote chori"" that, he said, is the worst possible unpatriotic act.Rahul said the Modi govt's decision to remove the Chief Justice of India from the collegium that selects election commissioners has given BJP complete control over who becomes the poll watchdog - as the three members of the collegium are PM, HM and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. The govt had also changed the law to give ""tremendous gift of immunity"" to election commissioners for their actions, he alleged, while EC laid down that CCTV footage be destroyed after 45 days of polling.While election commissioners got immunity, the poll commission changed the rule to lay down that CCTV footage be destroyed after 45 days of polling - decisions that, LoP Rahul Gandhi alleged, were at the root of ""vote chori"".As he targeted RSS, Rahul said the complete capture of EC was the culmination of the ""project"" executed after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, referring to the education sector, intelligence agencies and bureaucracy as some other institutions.Rahul said ""our friends"" don't embrace Godse anymore because he is an ""uncomfortable truth"", but Gandhi's killing was ""not where the project ended"".Rahul presented a four-point wish list to govt for reforming the poll process: provide machine-readable voter lists to parties a month before the election, withdraw the order to destroy CCTV footage after 45 days of polling, provide opposition access to ""architecture of EVMs"" and change the law that ""allows EC to get away with what he wants to do"".

Will you sack the CEO?

In your investigation so far, is there a criminal liability case made up?

Will you compensate them?

The probe into the IndiGo fiasco will also look into regulator, DGCA's handling of the situation, civil aviation minister K Ram Mohan Naidu said in an interview. Apologising for the problems faced by flyers, he added that govt would take strict and appropriate action against the airline, including removal of the CEO, if required.Yes, I'm apologising. I'm also responsible as a minister to ensure that this sector is flying high. When this kind of incidents happen, it puts extra responsibility on me. To ensure things are normalised. To ensure people who are responsible for this are held accountable. And to ensure that such situations don't arise in the future. While keeping safety and passenger rights intact, if not strengthened.Do you believe this was deliberately done by IndiGo?There seems to be some kind of intentional thing. The way they have been operating, the way they have control over their operations, this shouldn't have happened... Why has it come at that specific point of time? How did it lead us into that situation? This is something we are thoroughly investigating. And it will be followed by very strict & appropriate enforcement action.If it comes to that, definitely I will do it. I will charge them with all the penalties that are there. Definitely, I will look into all of those aspects... For past seven days, I have not slept properly.

'Will Set An Example': IndiGo Faces Heat As Aviation Minister Promises Tough Action In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Uncertainty shrouds holiday plans of lakhs of domestic flyers this winter. India's biggest airline, IndiGo, will cut anywhere between 200 and 400 flights daily for the foreseeable future.Which means, don't be surprised if the flight you booked to Goa and back this Yuletide are cancelled. While you will get a refund and domestic airfares are capped, making a new booking won't be easy as other airlines cannot fill in the void created by IndiGo cancellations at such a short notice. Which means, India is staring at a sharp demand-supply gap this winter.""All our resources are fully deployed and we are operating at maximum capacity. Ever since IndiGo crisis happened, our aircraft occupancies have gone through the roof. Also for a short term no one can add capacity just like that. If govt says they are uncomfortable with a single airline having 60% plus domestic market share and are capping the same, we can increase capacity. Otherwise, who will add capacity and be faced with a growing giant,"" said a top executive of another Indian carrier. Govt may permit short term wet leases - something IndiGo has availed off - but finding aircraft at such short notice is not easy, said airline executives.The situation has left holidayers nervous. Multiple people said they have bookings on IndiGo this winter. ""Aviation ministry is in full damage-control mode for themselves. But the uncertainty they have left us with is not funny. This was a completely preventable situation by allowing airlines' schedules based on their actual ability to mount flights,"" said Priya Singh, a Delhi-based writer.","India's biggest airline, IndiGo, will cut anywhere between 200 and 400 flights daily for the foreseeable future.

Their criticisms target the Election Commission, claiming it has lost credibility, especially regarding electoral roll updates and those pesky model code infringements.

NEW DELHI: Accusing EC of being compromised, opposition, led by Congress, SP and DMK, demanded on Tuesday a return to ballot papers and expansion of collegium that selects election commissioners to a five-member body, comprising two LoPs, PM, home minister and CJI, as against the present composition of PM, home minister and LoP in Lok Sabha.Congress MP Manish Tewari, who opened the debate on electoral reforms in Lok Sabha, argued that if such a committee was formed, then ""theek se khela hobe"", and it will remove doubts over the credibility of EC.The all-round attack on EC and BJP was carried out by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, DMK's Dayanidhi Maran, TMC's Kalyan Banerjee, NCP's Supriya Sule, Shiv Sena's Anil Desai, CPM's Amra Ram, RJD's Abhay Sinha, and AAP's Gurmeet Hayer, among others.Tewari and Banerjee said EC has no legal power to conduct SIR across states, and it can order such revision only in specific constituencies after recording complaints and conducting inquiries into them. Tewari also slammed the SIRs done by past govts.Akhilesh described the SIR as NRC with another name, stating the UP CM has declared that ""detention centres"" are being constructed for those weeded out of the electoral rolls.He called the SIR a hasty exercise which was launched without providing training to BLOs, citing their deaths. Training guns at EC, he alleged that the administration was misused to help BJP in past UP bypolls, but SP's complaints to EC went unheeded.Tewari and Maran demanded a return to ballot papers, as done by US and Japan. Tewari said EVMs could continue in case of 100% VVPAT counting. However, Supriya Sule refused to criticise EVMs, saying she has been voted to LS four times through the same machines. Tewari also demanded a ban on cash transfers ahead of polls, saying cash benefits were playing havoc with the exchequer while distorting the electoral landscape in favour of the governing party.Stating that erosion of people's faith in democracy leads to anarchy, he demanded that govt inform opposition if the ""source code"" of EVMs, the motherboard programme, is with EC or with the companies concerned.Trinamool's Banerjee dubbed BJP ""Bengali hater"" and asked if it will expel all Bengalis from India by calling them ""Rohingya"".Maran, targeting EC, said in 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha polls, EC had allowed PM Narendra Modi to meditate at Kedarnath and at Vivekananda Memorial for two days each, helping him dominate TV coverage ahead of voting.Sule said EC's political neutrality is under a cloud because it has failed to curb hate speech and its enforcement of the model code of conduct is inconsistent, and errors in electoral rolls are disproportionately hurting the weaker groups.","Congress-led coalition of opposition parties is making strong demands for the reinstatement of ballot papers alongside a transformed collegium responsible for appointing election commissioners.

NEW DELHI: Key NDA constituents JDU and TDP on Tuesday accused opposition of ""double standards"" on the issue of EVMs, while another ally Shiv Sena (Shinde) made a strong demand for lowering the minimum age to contest Lok Sabha and assembly elections from 25 to 18 years and allow remote voting for migrant voters.Participating in a discussion on election reforms in Lok Sabha, Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde also said EC should introduce a common electoral roll for all elections and usher in simultaneous polls for LS and state assemblies.Union minister and JDU MP Rajeev Ranjan Singh (Lalan Singh) said, ""You won in Bengal, Himachal and Karnataka, then the EVMs were correct. But in Maharashtra, Haryana or Bihar, the machines suddenly became faulty? People do not accept this double standard.""He accused opposition of trying to ""pollute the electoral system"" instead of engaging with EC's repeated clarifications.

This exemption, despite concerns about illegal migrants, has been questioned. Separately, the court ruled that voting rights for persecuted minorities under the CAA can only be considered after citizenship is granted.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday asked Election Commission to respond to a PIL questioning its decision to exempt Assam voters from giving documentary proof along with enumeration forms during SIR - which was mandatory in other states - even though the northeastern state has a large population of illegal Bangladeshi migrants.Appearing for petitioner Mrinal K Choudhury, senior advocate Vijay Hansaria told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that EC, in its Nov 17 notification, had said Assam's electoral rolls were being revised without requirement of any documents or enumeration forms, contrary to the procedure adopted for the pan-India special intensive revision of rolls.SC said it would seek EC's response on why such an exception was made for Assam and what the circumstances requiring such exemptions were. It asked the poll panel to file its response by Dec 16, the next date of hearing.The petitioner said, ""EC in an arbitrary manner directed that electoral roll for Assam will be revised only by way of Special Revision and not by way of SIR even though there is no difference in the ground realities between Assam and 12 other states where SIR is being conducted.""On another PIL seeking interim inclusion of people from minority communities, who were persecuted in neighbouring countries and entered India under Citizenship (Amendment) Act, on the voters' list of West Bengal, the bench said the question of right to vote would arise only after they were accorded citizenship.Senior advocate Karuna Nundy said the applications had been pending for a long time and if they were not decided expeditiously, these people, estimated to be 50,000, would lose out on voting in the Bengal assembly elections. The bench said it would not be legal to grant any interim right to vote. At best, the court could ask govt to expedite scrutiny of their applications, it said, and sought responses from Centre and EC.

Donald Trump's rice tariffs threat unlikely to have severe impact on exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donald-trumps-rice-tariffs-threat-unlikely-to-have-severe-impact-on-exports/articleshow/125877171.cms,"Why Trump Accuses India Of Dumping Rice And What A New Tariff Shock Could Mean For Trade Relations

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on rice is unlikely to have a severe impact on Indian exports.""India exported $392 million worth of rice to the US in FY2025, just 3% of its global rice exports, and already faces tariffs of about 53% in the US market; 86% of these shipments are premium basmati. New duties would scarcely dent Indian exporters, who have strong markets elsewhere, but would make rice costlier for American households,"" said trade research body GTRI.A bulk of the 6 million tonne exported to the US may be headed to kitchens of Indian-origin Americans or those on visas. The only substitute for basmati rice can be from Pakistan but the quantities are much lower. Overall, a bulk of India's rice exports consists of non-basmati rice.Trump's latest threat comes amid a team from the US visiting India with talks on the much-delayed trade deal scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. While the agenda for the latest discussions were not immediately known, the visit was a surprise as govt officials had earlier said most issues had been sorted out and last-mile talks were expected. News about the US delegation's trip came ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India.While Trump has taken unilateral measures on trade since returning to office, India's rice exports are not seen as ""dumping"" as claimed by the US president, who is not seen as someone who always sticks to facts. Given volumes, neither are rice exports causing harm to domestic market, nor are they subsidised. As a result, it is seen as a pressure tactic amid talks for a bilateral deal.India and the US had launched negotiations for a trade deal in Feb and hoped to close talks by Sept-Oct. But with govt refusing to agree to Trump's demand for reducing levies on food and GM crops, the US hit back with 25% reciprocal tariffs and another 25% secondary tariffs, citing India's purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment. In the first phase, which govt is hoping can be clinched by the month-end, India expects the secondary tariffs to be lifted while also seeking concessions on reciprocal tariffs.Trump, in the same event, also threatened high tariff on agriculture imports from Canada and other countries.","US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on rice is unlikely to have a severe impact on Indian exports.

Threats to BLOs during SIR unacceptable: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threats-to-blos-during-sir-unacceptable-supreme-court/articleshow/125877162.cms,"The Supreme Court has mandated all states to provide robust security for booth-level officers during voter enumeration, warning of severe action against any threats or obstructions. The court emphasized that non-cooperation with the Election Commission's work is a serious matter, extending beyond West Bengal to all states, and stressed the need for BLOs' safety to prevent anarchy.

'BLOs Are Dying, Shut Down SIR': Manish Tewari’s Charge Triggers Showdown Over Election Reforms

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday asked all states to provide adequate security to booth-level officers engaged in special intensive revision, and warned that it would seriously view any instance of BLOs being threatened or impediments being placed in their work.The observations were made by a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi after senior advocate V Giri, appearing for NGO Sanatani Sangsad, demanded security for BLOs, alleging that they were being intimidated and threatened during voter enumeration work in West Bengal.EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, said the commission had written a strong letter to WB govt on security of BLOs and assured the court that it had adequate powers under the Constitution to handle the situation. Dwivedi said such situations were arising because EC had no control over state police. The petitioner sought deployment of paramilitary forces in WB for safety and security of BLOs.Giving a pan-India dimension to the issue raised in the petition, the bench said, ""If EC had any grievance about non-cooperation from state officials or police regarding safety and security of BLOs, it should approach the SC. We will pass appropriate orders.It is not only about West Bengal but for all states. Non-cooperation with EC work is a serious issue. BLOs must get full security.""While seeking a response from the Centre and EC, the bench asked the poll panel to assess the situation in all states and move SC for appropriate directives, if needed. ""We will take strong action to protect BLOs. Their safety and security must be ensured, otherwise there will be anarchy,"" the CJI-led bench said and referred to its Dec-4 order directing states to allow BLOs who are stressed or face health issues to withdraw from SIR work and provide adequate replacements.When Dwivedi and senior advocate Maninder Singh said problems were arising in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal because their state govts had made public their opposition to SIR, the bench said BLOs unwilling to carry out SIR work would have to file an application before the district electoral officer, who would inform the state.During the proceedings, Justice Bagchi questioned the material submitted by Sanatani Sangsad to allege intimidation of BLOs in West Bengal. ""Apart from a solitary FIR, there is no other credible evidence to substantiate the allegations. Based on a solitary incident, can it be said that it is done only in West Bengal and not in other states? Is it not a narrative from one side? Should police in all states be put under EC?"" he asked.EC said there had been certain incidents in West Bengal that saw electoral officers being gheraoed and threatened by the public. ""A lot of narratives are being floated by political parties. At present, a BLO is to do enumeration of a maximum of 1,200 voters in 37 days, which is roughly 35 per day. Is it too much work?"" the poll panel said.Justice Bagchi said, ""This is not a desk job where the quota of 35 is met easily. A BLO must go from house to house, verify enumeration forms and then upload it. There could be stress and physical strain. We want to ensure that SIR at ground level is done without a hitch.""EC said the narrative of BLOs being under stress was being spread by political parties. The CJI said that was why the court had directed states on Dec 4 to augment the workforce.","The Supreme Court has mandated all states to provide robust security for booth- level officers during voter enumeration.

Uniform opportunity to become district judges: SC reserves verdict; direct recruits oppose quota for promotional cadre judicial officers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uniform-opportunity-to-become-district-judges-sc-reserves-verdict-direct-recruits-oppose-quota-for-promotional-cadre-judicial-officers/articleshow/125100301.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved a verdict on an issue sensitive to 20,000-odd judicial officers and will decide whether those opting for the promotional route to become district judges need a quota to counter lawyers, directly recruited to the DJ post, from stealing a march over them.While the High Courts have cited constitutional mandate to request the SC to refrain from interfering in the framing of service and promotion rules and conditions, the promotional cadre of judicial officers pitched for a quota complaining that those who start their careers as judicial magistrates seldom reach the post of Principal District Judge (PDJ).The promotional cadre also told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai, CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices Vikram Nath, K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi that while a 35-year-old lawyer with seven years practice can clear a competitive examination to become district judge, the career judicial officers become district judges at an age that varies between 45-52 years in different states.But the direct recruit district judge cadre officers through several senior advocates said that there are three sources of filling DJ posts – promotion (50% of posts), direct recruitment (25%) and through limited departmental competitive examination (25%). The promotional cadre officers outnumber the directly recruited DJs by three to one and the existing ROTA-Quota system has worked well and does not need tweaking by introducing quota for promotional cadre, they said.CJI Gavai said, “In some states direct recruit DJs are in an advantageous position, while promotional cadres enjoy advantage in some other states. SO, is it not necessary that there should be a uniform promotional avenue for judicial officers to DJ post irrespective of their source of recruitment?”When some counsel apprehended that tweaking the system would fuel the existing rivalry between promotional cadre and direct recruits, the bench said, “We are only examining the issue of giving a fair opportunity to each judicial officer irrespective of their source of recruitment. The intention is to improve the efficiency of the justice delivery system.”A counsel pointed out that not even one among the present 34 SC judges have come from the promotional cadre of judicial officers, the CJI-led bench said there have been many instances in the past when judicial officers through promotion to DJ, got selected as HC Judges and then elevated as SC judges, including two CJIs.“We do not perceive it as a fight between promotional cadres and direct recruit judicial officers. This exercise is for improving the efficiency of the system of administration of justice. It is a trial-and-error method. The mechanism had been tweaked in the past. Whatever we may decide in this case may be revisited by the SC a few years later,” the bench said.",The High Courts have cited constitutional mandate to request the SC to refrain from interfering in the framing of service and promotion rules and conditions.

These highways and expressways are transforming India’s transportation landscape and driving economic growth, among others.”What could remind old-timers about then Lok Sabha member Lalu Prasad Yadav’s infamous statement promising to construct highways as smooth as an actor’s cheek, the bench said, “What deserves special note is that the surface of these highways/expressways is smoother than ever before.With the introduction of modern vehicles, operators of stage carriage services have been providing comfort and convenience which are comparable with services available abroad. ”“Switch to electric vehicles for both public and private use has facilitated sustainable transportation. A feature of smart transportation has been integration of technology to enhance efficiency and safety. In fine, with continued innovation and investment, the road transport sector seems to have progressed to attain more efficiency, sustainability and accessibility,” it said.SC said digitisation has been a game-changer and a couple of state road transport corporations have made use of all these IT and infrastructure developments to earn profits. “To adapt to the changing transportation landscape, leveraging technology to improve services and customer experience is the priority for these corporations,” it said.After the praise for the infrastructure development, the SC said the SRTCs of UP and MP have not paid adequate heed to interest of passengers and commuters and asked the two state-run bodies to enter dialogue for commencing playing of buses on inter-state routes.The SC said the principal secretaries of the transport departments of the two states could meet and work out an Inter-State Reciprocal Transport Agreement within three months to enable private operators to ply buses on routes allotted to MPSRTC, which is on the verge of being wound up.",Supreme Court commended the country’s quantum leap in infrastructure development and digitisation.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About





BENGALURU: ""I killed my wife for you."" Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional who had spurned his proposal, weeks after his wife's death.In a desperate bid to give marriage a second start, Mahendra got in touch with women, who had earlier dumped him, and came back from the dead to make renewed proposals to half-a-dozen women.According to police, Mahendra administered anaesthesia and killed his wife Kruthika, 29, on April 24. He was arrested on Oct 14 from Manipal, Udupi district, for his wife's death.Police said Mahendra had messaged ‘I killed my wife for you' to the medical professional — not a doctor — through a digital-payment app after she had blocked him on multiple messaging platforms.Police have seized his mobile phone and laptop and sent them to a forensic science laboratory. The data revealed his messages to the woman.Deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield) K Parashurama confirmed the messages were sent through PhonePe, a digital-payment app. The woman's statement has been recorded, but police are not revealing any details due to the ongoing investigation.The woman reportedly told police that she had blocked Mahendra before his marriage.After learning about his marriage to Kruthika, the woman stayed away from him. However, he messaged ‘a confession' to her a couple of months after killing his wife. Until Mahendra was arrested on murder charges, the woman had assumed he was falsely confessing to the murder only with an intention to talk to her, a senior police officer said, adding the woman has no role in the crime.Investigating officers found that Mahendra was also in contact with a Mumbai-based woman until 2023. He proposed to marry her and met her a few times. Later, he made his father call and inform her that he had ""died in an accident"". After that, he was not in contact with her.However, Mahendra rose from the ashes and called her in Sept to confirm he was not dead. Instead, according to his astrological chart, his first wife was going to die. Since his ""love for her was genuine"", he told her that he had lied to her and got married to Kruthika. As his wife was dead now, he said that he wanted to marry her.","Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional.

Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.","India women secured a historic win at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the ICC.

Significance of Guru Nanak Jayanti

Schools and educational institutions across several Indian states will remain closed on November 5, 2025, to mark Guru Nanak Jayanti, one of the most significant festivals in the Sikh calendar. The day commemorates the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism and the first of the ten Sikh Gurus.However, the holiday observance varies considerably across different states, with some declaring a full closure whilst others continue regular operations. Students and parents are advised to check with their respective state education departments and school administrations for confirmation of holiday schedules in their regions.Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh have declared November 5 as a public holiday for schools and government offices. Being the spiritual heartland of Sikhism, Punjab observes this day with particular reverence, and all educational institutions remain shut. Haryana follows suit with complete closure of schools across the state.Delhi has also announced a holiday for schools on this occasion.The national capital's large Sikh population celebrates the day with considerable fervour, particularly at prominent gurudwaras like Gurudwara Bangla Sahib and Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib.Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have declared holidays for educational institutions. These northern states, sharing cultural ties with Punjab, observe the festival with traditional enthusiasm.Several states including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal have not declared November 5 as a school holiday. Educational institutions in these regions will function normally, though some schools may organise special assemblies or cultural programmes to acknowledge the significance of the day.Uttar Pradesh has left the decision to individual district administrations and school managements. Some areas with significant Sikh populations may observe a holiday whilst others continue regular classes.Guru Nanak Jayanti, also known as Gurupurab, falls on the full moon day of Kartik month according to the lunar calendar. Guru Nanak Dev Ji was born in 1469 in Nankana Sahib, now in Pakistan.

'Will Cut Off Your Tongue': Bihar Poll Campaign Turns Ugly, AIMIM Candidate Threatens Tejashwi Yadav

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday made a striking claim in Bihar, alleging that country's 10 per cent, referring to upper castes, ""hold control over the Army.""Addressing a poll rally in Aurangabad's Kutumba, Rahul said, ""90 per cent of the people come from extremely backward, backward, Dalit, and Adivasi communities."" He went on to assert that these groups - forming the vast majority of India's population - remain largely excluded from power and privilege.""All the wealth goes to them, all the jobs go to them. Look at the judiciary - they have control there, and even in the army,"" Rahul said, in one of his most direct attacks on the country's social and institutional hierarchy.He further added, ""90 per cent of India's population is nowhere to be found,"" suggesting that marginalised communities have been systematically denied access to leadership and opportunity.The BJP hit back at Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on the Army. Party spokesperson Suresh Nakhua, in a post on X, said, ""Rahul Gandhi is now searching for caste in the Armed Forces and says 10% of people control it. In his hate for PM Modi, he has already crossed the line into hating India.""Another BJP spokesperson, Sanju Verma, also hit out at Rahul Gandhi over his remarks, saying, “Rahul Gandhi is shamelessly devious and deviously shameless.Listening to him in this clip leaves no doubt that this failed, forever-in-waiting PM is desperately trying to polarize. Now he is trying to divide the Army on caste lines — what an unhinged wreck this Leader of Opposition is. Disgraceful.”Directing his attack to Bihar government, Rahul painted a picture of unemployment in the state, blaming the Nitish Kumar government for pushing its youth into low-paying, menial labour across the country.""The people of Bihar are doing manual labour across the entire country. In different parts of the country, people from Bihar are building large buildings, roads, tunnels, and factories,"" he said.Accusing the state government of failing its people, Rahul added, ""In other words, the truth is this—that Nitish Kumar has wiped out employment here and turned the people of Bihar into the country’s labourers.""","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi made a striking claim in Bihar, alleging that country's 10 per cent, referring to upper castes, ""hold control over the Army"" Rahul said, ""90 per cent of the people come from extremely backward, backward, Dalit, and Adivasi communities""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125088839,imgsize-652610,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-26.jpg"

‘Trump’s Team In Serious Discussions With India’: White House As India-US Trade Talks Continue





The White House on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump remains committed to strengthening ties with India and is in frequent contact with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as differences continue over trade tariffs and oil imports from Russia.WHite House also called the India-US partnership one that the President values “very strongly,”At a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The President is positive and feels very strongly about the India-US relationship. A few weeks ago, he spoke to the Prime Minister directly when he celebrated Diwali in the Oval Office with many high-ranking Indian-American officials here at the White House.""Leavitt added that the US has ""a great Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor,"" and confirmed that Trump’s trade team is in “very serious discussions” with New Delhi. “I know the President has great respect for Prime Minister Modi and they speak pretty frequently,” she said.Her remarks come days after Trump claimed India had reduced its purchase of Russian oil, describing New Delhi as “very good” on the issue during his five-day Asia tour.Since mid-October, Trump has repeatedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would limit or stop crude imports from Moscow.Trump’s statements are linked to his administration’s efforts to isolate Russia economically through sanctions and energy restrictions amid the war in Ukraine.However, earlier this month, ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded to Trump’s comments, saying that the country’s energy sourcing decisions are driven by national interests and consumer welfare.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.”He added that India’s energy policy aims to ensure stable prices and secure supplies through diversified sourcing. “Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement. This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current Administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” Jaiswal said.Ties between India and the US have come under strain after Washington imposed high trade tariffs on New Delhi in August. The US levied 50 per cent tariffs, including 25 per cent secondary duties, as a response to India’s continued oil trade with Russia.India criticised the move as “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” while Trump described US-India trade ties as a “totally one-sided disaster.”","US President Donald Trump remains committed to strengthening ties with India, White House says.

Watch: Pappu Yadav Gets Angry When Asked Why He Wasn’t Seen with Rahul Gandhi

AURANGABAD: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi stirred controversy Tuesday by claiming ""10% of the country's population"" controls the Army, comments seen as an allusion to upper castes. ""...Only 10% of the country's population get opportunities in corporate sectors, bureaucracy, and judiciary. .. even the Army is under their control. The remaining 90% - backward classes, Dalits, STs, and minorities - are nowhere to be seen,"" Rahul said while campaigning in Bihar's Aurangabad and Kutumba ahead of the first phase of assembly polls on Thursday.The comments echoed calls by Congress's Rahul and other opposition parties over the past year for a national caste census but this was the first time he had referred to the Army while highlighting such demands.Rahul asserted that such a census would identify ""the 90% Indians sitting outside the system"" and help protect their rights and constitutional guarantees. ""If 90% people don't have participatory rights, the Constitution can't be protected. We want the data. How many Dalits, OBCs, women, minorities... are there. We are trying to protect the Constitution through this demand for a caste census,"" Rahul said.Rahul has made controversial comments about the Army earlier, drawing legal censure.He was rapped by Supreme Court in Aug for claiming during his 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' over two years ago that ""Chinese troops are thrashing Indian soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh"". The comment was made in reference to the face-off with China in Arunachal's Tawang in Dec 2022. Earlier in May, Allahabad HC had rejected a plea by Rahul challenging summons in a case, saying freedom of speech didn't include the right to ""defame"" the Army. On Bihar poll trail Tuesday, Rahul lashed out at what he described as PM Narendra Modi's ""digital distractions"" as he accused Centre of using social media to divert youths from the real issues of unemployment and inequality.""They gave cheap data instead of jobs. They told youth to make reels instead of asking questions. Watching and making reels has become an addiction - a distraction to keep young people silent. The money goes to industrialists. Youths are left with entertainment as a drug,"" Rahul said.He accused CM Nitish Kumar of having ""reduced Bihar's youth to becoming nation's labourers"", saying the CM had failed to create opportunities for the young. ""Bihar, once home to the world-renowned Nalanda University, has now been reduced to a land where young people are forced to migrate across India for menial work. Nitish has made the sons of this soil labourers, not builders of Bihar's future,"" Rahul said.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi stirs controversy by claiming ""10% of the country's population"" controls the Army.

Lakhpati Didi Scheme: PM Modi Empowers Over 20 Lakh Women in Bihar with Cash Support Ahead of Polls

NEW DELHI: Direct cash transfers to women have become the norm across states, with 12 now offering them, up from two in 2022-23. This year, the states are cumulatively projected to spend Rs 1,68,050 crore, or 0.5% of GDP, on unconditional cash transfers to women, a study by PRS Legislative Research has said. Just two years ago, the figure was less than 0.2% of GDP.Be it Gruh Lakshmi in Karnataka, Ladli Behna in MP, Ladki Behin in Maharashtra or Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana in Bihar, parties across the political spectrum have been using cash transfers to women as a way to quickly reach out to voters ahead of polls. The beneficiaries are clearly happy, although the state exchequer feels the strain of such bounties.Assam and West Bengal, where assembly elections are due next year, have increased allocation for these schemes. Compared to the revised estimates for the last financial year, Assam has increased the outlay by 31%, while the rise in Bengal is 15%. In Oct 2024, Jharkhand increased the monthly payout under the CM Maiyan Samman Yojana from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500.Parties often have to roll back some of them as state finances do not give them headroom to spend. For instance, the report said, in April, Maharashtra reduced the monthly benefit under CM Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 500 for women receiving Rs 1,000 under another direct benefit transfer scheme for farmers.A trend that started with cash transfers to farmers in Odisha has since been expanded. RBI has already cautioned states on the rising spend on subsidies, farm loan waivers and cash transfers. The PRS report says, ""Among the 12 states implementing unconditional cash transfer schemes, six have estimated a revenue deficit in 2025-26. However, adjusting the revenue balance to exclude spending on UCT schemes shows an improvement in fiscal indicators of these states. That is, all other things remaining constant, these cash transfers result in Karnataka moving from a revenue surplus of 0.3% of GSDP to a revenue deficit of 0.6% of GSDP. Similarly, these transfers reduce Madhya Pradesh's revenue surplus from 1.1% of GSDP to a marginal 0.4% of GSDP.""","This year, states are projected to spend Rs 1,68,050 crore on unconditional cash transfers to women.

Estimated blocs:

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh.

Shutdown 'TURBULENCE' Hits U.S. Aviation; Unpaid Air Traffic Controllers Threaten Flight Ops

NEW DELHI: Air India will operate a relief flight on Tuesday to bring back 228 passengers stranded in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This comes after the airline's San Francisco–Delhi flight was diverted on Monday due to a technical issue.The airline said the special relief flight, numbered AI183, will depart from Delhi on Tuesday afternoon and return with the affected passengers on Wednesday morning. The flight will be operated using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.The diversion occurred after pilots on flight AI174, operating from San Francisco to Delhi via Kolkata, detected a possible technical issue mid-air and made a precautionary landing at Ulaanbaatar. The Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 245 people, including 228 passengers and 17 crew members, landed safely.“Air India will be operating a relief flight to ferry the passengers of flight AI174 (San Francisco–Delhi of November 2), which was diverted to Ulaanbaatar on Monday. The ferry flight AI183 is scheduled to depart Delhi this afternoon and return with the affected passengers on Wednesday morning,” an Air India spokesperson said.The airline added that it has been working closely with local authorities and the Indian Embassy in Mongolia to assist all passengers and crew. Arrangements for hotel accommodation, meals and regular updates have been made for those stranded.“At Air India, the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew remain our top priority,” the spokesperson said.Air India confirmed that the diverted Boeing 777 is undergoing necessary technical checks in Ulaanbaatar. Once cleared by engineers, the aircraft will be flown back separately.This is not the first time an Air India long-haul flight has had to divert due to technical reasons.

PATNA: Heat and dust of cheek-by-jowl rallies fused with war of words on social media as campaigning ended Tuesday for the first phase of Bihar polls on Nov 6 in 121 of its 243 assembly seats. More than 3.75 crore electors are expected to cast their votes at 45,341 polling stations to decide the fate of 1,314 candidates.As campaigning concluded at 6pm, governing NDA and INDIA bloc-led opposition left no stone unturned to reach out to voters. Union minister Amit Shah addressed three rallies, defence minister Rajnath Singh five, BJP president JP Nadda two and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi three. PM Narendra Modi interacted with state BJP women workers virtually, and CM Nitish Kumar addressed meetings, as did INDIA bloc's CM face Tejashwi Yadav of RJD. Adding to BJP's blitz, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and former Union minister Smriti Irani joined the campaign.Prominent seats in this phase include Raghopur, where Tejashwi is hoping for a hat-trick; Mahua, where Tejashwi's elder brother and ex-minister Tej Pratap Yadav is trying his luck with a new outfit; & Tarapur, from where deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP is in the fray.Other key seats are Alinagar, where singer Maithili Thakur is the BJP nominee. In Lakhisarai, another deputy CM, Vijay Kumar Sinha, is trying to save his fort. Mokama has in the fray Anant Kumar Singh of JDU, a don-turned-politician recently jailed over the murder of Jan Suraaj supporter Dular Chand Yadav.Chhapra has a dramatic duel too, with RJD fielding Bhojpuri film star Khesari Lal Yadav against Chhoti Kumari of the BJP, who has won the seat three times earlier.Away from the raucous roadshows and rallies, the campaign is also being waged from silent ""war rooms"" - social media hubs set up by parties to reach out to voters, especially youths and Gen Z. Operating 24x7, these hubs are the unsung architects of electoral fortunes, blending AI-driven voter profiling with old-school booth management.BJP's war room is led by Rohan Gupta, a seasoned strategist from BJP's national IT cell.

Muslim man must notify 1st wife to register 2nd marriage: Kerala HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslim-man-must-notify-1st-wife-to-register-2nd-marriage-kerala-hc/articleshow/125096944.cms,"KOCHI: A Muslim man cannot register his second marriage under Kerala Registration of Marriages (Common) Rules, 2008, without notifying his first wife as long as his marital relationship with her is valid, Kerala HC has held.Justice P V Kunhikrishnan passed this order on Oct 30 on a petition filed by a Kannur man (44) and his second wife (38) from Kasaragod, challenging the decision of the registrar of a local self-govt institution to decline to register their marriage. The petitioners argued that under Muslim personal law, a man is entitled to have up to four wives at a time.HC held that the registrar shall not register a second marriage if the first wife objected on the grounds that it was invalid. Instead, the parties must be referred to the competent civil court to establish the validity of the marriage.Even under Muslim personal law, a man may marry a second time only under specific conditions, HC observed. It noted that neither the Holy Quran nor Muslim law permitted a man to have an extramarital relationship or to contract another marriage without the knowledge of his first wife. HC noted that a Muslim wife could not remain a silent spectator. ""In such matters, religion is secondary and constitutional rights are supreme,"" HC said, adding that ""99.99% of Muslim women will be against their husband's second marriage when their marital relationship is still in existence. ""HC also held that under Muslim personal law, a man may marry more than one wife only if he has the means to maintain them.

Drones are typically used for commercial, industrial, or surveillance purposes, while aeromodelling is a recreational and educational activity that has ""inspired generations of pilots, aircraft engineers, and aviation professionals. ""The present draft of the Drone Bill is overly restrictive and, if implemented as is, will effectively end aeromodelling in India, the association said. It argued that the proposed framework - which mandates registration, licensing, type certification, and flight permissions - is unsuitable for non-autonomous, manually flown model aircraft that pose minimal risk.Under the draft law, no person may own or operate any unmanned aircraft without registration and a unique identification number (UIN).Violation can attract fines up to Rs1 lakh or imprisonment up to one year. The bill also makes violations of restricted airspace rules ""cognisable and non-compoundable,"" punishable by imprisonment up to three years or fines up to Rs1 lakh.""Aeromodelling is a low-risk, high learning activity...,"" the letter said. Almost all of their members design, build, and fly their own model aircraft-not multi-rotor drones. Since these are individually made and not bought from any manufacturers, it would be impossible to register them under the bill's rules, the IAMA said.The IAMA sought clear exemptions and recognition for educational and recreational model aircraft within the bill.

Can the EPA's Pollution Limits Curb Climate Change?

NEW DELHI: The global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission increased by 2.3% in 2024, compared to the previous year, to reach a record high of 57.7 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, with India reporting the highest absolute increase in emissions followed by China, Russia, Indonesia and the US, showed a UN report released on Tuesday. It warned the world is “heading for a serious escalation of climate risks and damages”.It said that the global average temperature is projected to rise 2.3-2.5 degree Celsius by the end of the century above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) even if the climate actions are fully implemented under the new mitigation goals of the countries amid rising carbon emissions. It means the new climate pledges are completely off target and fall short on the warming limit goal.The absolute increase in emissions excludes the emission caused by change in land use and forest cover due uncertainties in estimates of net emission from such factors. It primarily calculates emissions of fossil CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases.Currently, the six largest emitters in terms of total GHG emissions are China, the US, India, EU, Russia and Indonesia. The report noted that among the big emitters, the European Union was the only one to decrease emissions in 2024.“The 2.3% increase in total GHG emissions (globally in 2024) from 2023 levels is high compared with the 2022–2023 increase of 1.6%. It is more than four times higher than the annual average growth rate in the 2010s (0.6% per year), and comparable to the emissions growth in the 2000s (on average 2.2% per year),” said the report.In terms of growth rate, Indonesia showed the highest increase (4.6%) followed by India (3.6%). Emissions growth in China (0.5% in 2024) was lower than the previous year.The report underlined that the contributions by current, per capita and historic emissions differ across the high emitters and world regions. Per capita GHG emissions are above the world average of 6.4 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) in the US, Russia, China and EU, and remain significantly below it in Indonesia and India.Flagging how the growing emission and the countries' low mitigation targets put the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree C of warming at risk in the short-term (within the next decade), the report - UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025 - noted that the rise will go up to 2.8 degree Celsius in the business-as-usual scenario under the ongoing policies.Though the current projected rise of 2.3-2.5 degree C is an improvement over the previous year’s projection of 2.6-2.8 degree C rise, the report noted that the updated pledges are not adequate to get the desired result of keeping the global warming either within 1.5 degree C or 2 degree C. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement 10 years ago, temperature rise predictions have, however, fallen from 3-3.5 degree C — a clear sign that the world can keep it further down with more ambitious emission reduction targets.The report said that the reductions to annual emissions of 35% and 55%, compared with 2019 levels, are needed by 2035 to align with the Paris Agreement 2 degree C and 1.5 degree C pathways, respectively.“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said Inger Andersen, executive director, UNEP.The report comes as a warning signal to governments ahead of the UN climate conference (COP30), scheduled to be held in Belem, Brazil during Nov 10-21.Despite the Paris Agreement requirement to submit new climate action targets - called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - by February, only 64 countries covering 63% of global GHG emissions had submitted or announced new NDCs by the cut-off date of Sept 30. India is expected to submit its target for 2035 in the next few days.“Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target,” said Andersen.The report noted that though NDCs have, overall, become modestly more robust over time, it’s at nowhere near the pace needed, and the new NDCs have done little to accelerate progress.“In addition to the lack of progress in pledges, a huge implementation gap remains, with countries not on track to meet their 2030 NDCs, let alone new 2035 targets,” it said.","The global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission increased by 2.3% in 2024, compared to the previous year, to reach a record high of 57.7 gigatons of CO2 equivalent.

SRINAGAR: Former India all-rounder Parvez Rasool condemned Tuesday social media memes mocking West Indies star Chris Gayle after the abrupt collapse of Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) in J&K, calling the portrayal “irresponsible and harmful for Kashmir’s cricket”.Rasool said Gayle did not flee but left after completing his three-match commitment. “When he left the hotel, everyone greeted him warmly. People must show respect to such a great cricketer,” he said, adding that Gayle’s presence encouraged local players and promoted tourism. Gayle was seen last week enjoying a Shikara ride on Dal Lake, smiling and waving to fans.“An international cricketer of great repute, Chris Gayle, was here. He praised one of our boys and said he played well. It was a rare moment for us,” Rasool said. “He interacted with local players, visited Dal Lake to promote tourism, and now people are making memes saying he ran away. That’s unfair and not good for us or for cricket.”The T20 tournament organised by non-profit Yuva Society collapsed Saturday night after organisers allegedly fled a Srinagar hotel without paying players, staff, or umpires.Turning to the controversy, Rasool said the league was “poorly managed” but not a scam. “I was the biggest sufferer and they didn’t pay me anything,” he said. “The idea was to give local players a chance to share the field with international cricketers. Unfortunately, lack of sponsors and poor crowd turnout ruined it.”","Former India all-rounder Parvez Rasool condemned Tuesday social media memes mocking West Indies star Chris Gayle.

EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Enumeration for Phase II of the SIR exercise spanning a dozen states and UTs commenced Tuesday, with around 5.3 lakh booth level officers (BLOs) undertaking the first round of house-to-house visits to distribute enumeration forms to electors.The enumeration period for SIR in nine states - Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, MP, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - and three UTs (Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep and Puducherry) will last a month, until Dec 4, 2025. Every elector who figured in the electoral roll as of Oct 27, 2025, will be handed a unique EF with partially pre-filled fields.Given the lack of finality on its NRC exercise, Assam has been left out of Phase II of SIR and could see a mere special summary revision ahead of assembly polls in state next year.""Distribution of EFs has already begun in all 12 states/UTs and 100% of EFs have been printed,"" EC said Tuesday.Unlike Phase I of SIR completed in Bihar, no documents will be collected from electors at the enumeration stage. Only electors who fail to furnish details linking them to the electoral roll from the last SIR undertaken in 2003/03/04, will be served a notice by the electoral registration officer after the draft electoral rolls are published on Dec 9.Such an elector will need to furnish one of the 11 documents listed by EC, or an alternative document, to prove their eligibility for enrolment. Aadhaar will be accepted only as proof of identity.Over 5.3 lakh BLOs, 7.6 lakh booth level agents appointed by political parties, 10,448 EROs/assistant EROs and 321 district election officers will come together to implement the SIR spanning 321 districts and 1,843 assembly constituencies.There are dissenting voices against the SIR exercise in opposition-governed West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, but the poll panel has confidence in Constitutional norms that make it obligatory for state govts to place their officials on deputation to the commission and maintain law and order for a smooth roll revision.","EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar.

Iltija launches massive campaign in Budgam as CM Omar holds ‘darbar’ in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iltija-launches-massive-campaign-in-budgam-as-cm-omar-holds-darbar-in-jammu/articleshow/125095962.cms,"Photo/Agencies

SRINAGAR: As the battle intensifies for the November 11 bypoll in central Kashmir’s Budgam assembly seat, Mehbooba Mufti-led Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has placed Iltija Mufti and MLA Waheed Parra at the forefront of its campaign, and their focus remains firmly on cornering J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah.“There are 50 MLAs roaming around Budgam right now, but tell me, where is the one MLA who is missing? It is the CM of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah,” Iltija said while addressing election rallies in Budgam on Tuesday.In the Oct 2024 assembly elections, the first after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, the National Conference (NC) won 41 of the 90 seats, with Omar securing victories in both the constituencies he contested from --- Budgam and Ganderbal.Omar, however, chose to retain Ganderbal, his home constituency, vacating the Budgam seat. This has given PDP a potent weapon to accuse Omar and NC of betraying people.In the bypoll, NC’s Aga Syed Mehmood is pitted against PDP’s Aga Syed Muntazir Mehdi, with BJP’s Aga Syed Mohsin also in the fray.While the NC leaders are reaching out to people, CM Omar is in Jammu following ‘Darbar Move’, a biannual practice of shifting offices to Jammu in winters and Kashmir in summers.Both Iltija and Waheed are also targeting the Omar govt over PDP’s recent land bill that sought to grant ownership rights to residents who have lived for over 20 years in houses built on state land. PDP had dubbed it as “anti-bulldozer bill,” arguing that it would protect residents facing eviction notices. However, the legislation was jointly opposed by NC, BJP and Congress in the recent assembly session, with Omar saying granting ownership of houses illegally built on state land would “reward encroachers”.“When PDP brought a land bill to safeguard your rights and ensure that your land remains yours, what did they do? BJP called it ‘land jihad’, and Omar Abdullah joined them, calling Kashmiris land grabbers,” Iltija told the people. “Tell me, are you land grabbers? You are the rightful owners of your land, your dignity and your future,” she said.Para alleged the Omar govt had failed to initiate any development work. “In the last one year, have you seen your MLA? Have you seen even a single transformer installed, or any developmental activity?” the PDP MLA asked the people.“We have seen the surrender on Article 370, on waqf, and now a complete governance vacuum. He (Omar) has reduced our entire political struggle to mere business rules and tried to depoliticise Jammu and Kashmir,” Parra saidAccusing Omar of failing to deliver on any of his pre-poll promises, Iltija urged voters to support the PDP’s candidate.","PDP has placed Iltija Mufti and Waheed Parra at the forefront of its campaign.

MUMBAI: The 2025 edition of World Nuclear Exhibition (WNE) will witness a global nuclear renaissance, commitment to fusion energy as a long-term solution, and integrated global supply chain for fusion and nuclear energy, Indian Youth Nuclear Society (IYNS) vice-president Samyak Munot has said.India's nuclear achievements are being showcased at the three-day WNE, which began in Paris on Tuesday, by the 11-year-old private youth forum and not an official body for the second consecutive time. Nearly 25,000 participants from about 80 countries are taking part in the event.Speaking to TOI from Paris, Munot said this year's presentation was more detailed compared to 2023. Participation this year will also focus on India's capability in advanced reactor technology such as its first micro nuclear reactor, called SUK-M, a joint co-operation with Indian industries, and a VIP event jointly organised with the Embassy of France in India.IYNS, Munot said, had been contributing to Indo-French collaboration with nuclear and fusion start-ups in the past two years.Since its inception in 2014, IYNS's role has been to make Indian youth aware of the country's nuclear programme and involve them in it, he added."," 2025 edition of World Nuclear Exhibition will witness a global nuclear renaissance.

"Number of road fatalities in 2024 likely to surpass 2023 figure, the highest ever",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/number-of-road-fatalities-in-2024-likely-to-surpass-2023-figure-the-highest-ever/articleshow/125095336.cms,"Number of road fatalities in 2024 likely to surpass 2023 figure, the highest ever

NEW DELHI: The number of road deaths in 2024 is set to surpass that in 2023 with over two dozen states and UTs, including Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Telangana, Assam and Delhi reporting higher number of fatalities last year. As per provisional data compiled from states/UTs, excluding West Bengal, a little over 1.7 lakh people died in road crashes last year.In 2023, road crashes had claimed around 1.73 lakh lives, the highest ever for a year, and West Bengal had reported 6,027 of these fatalities. Sources said that once data from West Bengal is included, the number of deaths would be more than that in the previous year. Data sent by states on crashes, fatalities, injuries and the factors responsible for them are being rechecked and reconciled before the final report is published, they added.While the rise in fatalities despite efforts of the govt to curb them remains a huge concern, there is a silver lining to the provisional data for 2024: nine states and UTs have reported a decline in the number of deaths. For example, Kerala reported 3,846 fatalities in 2024 compared to 4,080 in the previous year, and Gujarat recorded 7,717 deaths last year compared to 7,854 in 2023.Experts maintain that unless there is a significant dip in fatalities in the 10 states that report a large share of the overall figure, achieving the goal to reduce the number of road deaths by half will not be possible.“There is a need for focussed efforts to reduce fatal crashes and deaths on National Highways and state highways, which account for nearly 60% of all fatalities,” said a former Union road transport secretary.Though data on road accidents do not fully represent the magnitude of the problem given that not all such incidents are reported or recorded by police, the provisional data show that 35 states and UTs reported over 4.7 lakh crashes in 2024 compared to 4.8 lakh in the previous year.Meanwhile, the road transport ministry plans to amend the Motor Vehicle Act by introducing stricter norms for issuing driving licence and negative points for bad driver behaviour that can result in suspension and even cancellation of licences.","Number of road deaths in 2024 likely to surpass 2023 figure, the highest ever.

NCW recommends review of cyber laws linked to women to secure their digital rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncw-recommends-review-of-cyber-laws-linked-to-women-to-secure-their-digital-rights/articleshow/125094576.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: National Commission for Women has recommended a comprehensive review of cyber laws relating to women to secure their digital rights, extend privacy protections and hold online platforms accountable.For instance, the NCW report calls for inclusion of cyberbullying, trolling, deepfakes, and privacy violations in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 and protects the complainant’s identity in cyber offences. For protecting children it is recommended that digital manipulation and online grooming should be recognised as offences and penalties must be increased under the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.These are part of the over 200 actionable recommendations in the NCW report aimed at addressing the legal and institutional gaps in India’s response to cyber offences. “Through this report, NCW envisions a cyber ecosystem where laws do not merely punish offenders, but protect dignity; where awareness replaces fear; and where every woman can step into the digital world without hesitation,” NCW chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar said.The recommendations compiled following a year-long exercise of consultations with various stakeholders have been submitted to the ministries of law and justice, electronics and information technology, women and child development, and home affairs.For instance in the Information Technology Act 2002, it is recommended to make room for tougher penalties for offences against women and children, penal action for threats to share private or obscene content and a mandatory victim compensation fund.In case of IT Rules 2021, recommendations range from mandatory account verification and inclusion of AI-manipulated imagery and new provisions for gender-based harassment to cross-border content regulation.With regards to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 it is recommended that “sensitive personal data” and “gender-specific damage” should be defined and there should be stricter consent norms and mandatory removal of non-consensual content within 12 hours. The report also calls for paving the way for tiered penalties for gendered data misuse.To secure women at the workplace under the POSH Act, 2013, it recommended extending protection to digital harassment and remote workplaces. It is also recommended to cover online and OTT content under the Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986.","National Commission for Women has recommended a comprehensive review of cyber laws relating to women.

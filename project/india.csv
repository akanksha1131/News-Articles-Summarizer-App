NEW DELHI: The United States Supreme Court on Friday rejected the extradition stay request of Tahawwur Rana , a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks that killed more than 170 people.Rana had approached the US Supreme Court , seeking an emergency stay on his previously allowed extradition.In the appeal application, Rana contended that his survival chances would be insufficient for facing trial in India, citing multiple factors.His petition specifically mentioned that ""if a stay is not entered, there will be no review at all, and the US courts will lose jurisdiction, and the petitioner will soon be dead.""The 26/11 terror attacks suspect alleged that his extradition to India would likely lead to his torture, given his status as a Pakistani-origin Muslim individual.Rana's extradition was greenlit by US President Donald Trump last month.During a joint press conference at the White House with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump had announced the decision and suggested additional extraditions would follow.""We are giving a very violent man (Tahawwur Rana) back to India immediately. There are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. We work with India on crime, and we want to make things better for India,"" Trump had said while acknowledging the ongoing collaboration between both nations regarding criminal matters.Rana, who holds Canadian citizenship and has Pakistani origins, faces charges in India for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks that resulted in over 174 fatalities. He was found guilty in the United States for providing support to the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).India has been seeking his extradition for an extended period. In connection with the 26/11 attack, Rana is alleged to have assisted his associate David Coleman Headley, also known as Daood Gilani, who possessed US citizenship through his American mother and Pakistani father. US authorities apprehended Headley in October 2009.Rana's involvement reportedly extended beyond being cognisant of Headley's connections to LeT, the Pakistan-based outlawed terrorist group. He actively supported Headley by providing him with false credentials, which enabled Headley to travel to India and scout potential targets for LeT's 2008 operation.","Tahawwur Rana is a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks that killed more than 170 people.

'Will not tolerate Hindi colonialism': Stalin's fresh attack on Centre over language row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-not-tolerate-hindi-colonialism-stalins-fresh-attack-on-centre-over-language-row/articleshow/118772614.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (PTI photo)

What is 3-language formula?



NEW DELHI: Continuing his alleged anti-Hindu imposition tirade, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday called the Centre's three-language formula under the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 a "" Hindi colonialism "".Stalin, in a post he wrote in English, said Tamil Nadu will not tolerate ""Hindi colonialism"" replacing ""British colonialism"".""History is clear. Those who tried to impose Hindi on Tamil Nadu have either been defeated or later changed their stance and aligned with DMK . Tamil Nadu will not tolerate Hindi colonialism replacing British colonialism,"" he wrote.The Tamil Nadu CM also mocked the state BJP's signature campaign in the NEP's favour, challenging the rival party to contest the next year's assembly elections on the same issue.""Now the BJP’s circus-like signature campaign for the three-language formula has become a laughing stock in Tamil Nadu. I challenge them to make this their core agenda in the 2026 Assembly elections and let it be a referendum on Hindi imposition ,"" Stalin wrote on X.The DMK boss also hit out at the Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan ""for reviving a fight he can never win"".""The tree may prefer calm, but the wind will not subside."" It was the Union Education Minister who provoked us to write this series of letters when we were simply doing our job. He forgot his place and dared to threaten an entire state to accept #HindiImposition, and now he faces the consequences of reviving a fight he can never win. Tamil Nadu will not be blackmailed into surrendering,"" Stalin wrote.Highlighting the names of Union government's schemes, institutions and awards, Stalin said Hindi has been ""imposed to a nauseating extent, suffocating non-Hindi speakers, who are the majority in India"".""Men may come, men may go. But even long after the dominance of Hindi is shattered in India, history will remember that it was DMK that stood as the vanguard,"" he wrote.On Thursday, Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai claimed that over one lakh people across the state have supported the BJP's online campaign on the three-language policy. He added that his party would continue its outreach despite police action, questioning how many people the government could ""illegally arrest"".Countering Stalin's ""Hindi imposition"" claims, Annamalai claimed that in the matriculation schools run by Stalin's party men have not even made Tamil a compulsory subject.""Having realised that the opposition to the three-language policy hasn't yielded support from the common people, Thiru @mkstalin has now jumped to the imaginary Hindi imposition,"" he added.The three-language formula under the NEP 2020 promotes multilingualism while ensuring flexibility in language learning. It mandates that students learn three languages, with at least two being Indian languages, though the choice of languages is left to states and schools.The policy encourages the mother tongue or regional language as the medium of instruction at least until class 5, preferably until class 8 and beyond. While it allows English as an option, it does not impose any particular language, emphasising state autonomy in language selection. Despite its flexible approach, states like Tamil Nadu oppose the policy, fearing it could lead to the imposition of Hindi over regional languages.","Stalin says Tamil Nadu will not tolerate ""Hindi colonialism"" replacing ""British colonialism"" DMK boss also hit out at the Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan ""for reviving a fight he can never win"" Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai claimed that over one lakh people across the state have supported the BJP's online campaign.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118773106,imgsize-698492,width-400,resizemode-4/118773106.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Decisive government actions have cleared Naxalism from jungles but the threat of urban Naxals is growing and they have ""rapidly infiltrated"" political parties, PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday. The voices and language of urban Naxals are now heard within these parties, indicating their deep-rooted presence, he said.Naxalism is in its final phase, with affected districts reduced from more than 100 to fewer than 24 in the past decade, the PM said as he credited decisive governance, infrastructure expansion and grassroots development for neutralising the insurgency.Warning of the new challenge posed by urban Naxals, the PM said once on the fringes, they are now ""shaping narratives within parties that were once rooted in Gandhian ideology"". ""Their influence threatens both India's development and heritage,"" Modi said at a media event here. He also underscored that the ideological extremism is also gaining ground in intellectual spaces. Highlighting India's remarkable economic strides, Modi said even 65 years after independence, the country was the world's 11th-largest economy, but in the past decade, it has become the fifth-largest economy and is now rapidly moving towards becoming the third-largest economy.He recalled that in 2007, India's GDP reached $1 trillion annually, whereas today, the same amount is generated every quarter, reflecting the nation's accelerating growth. In addition, he said, 25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty and Rs 42 lakh crore has been directly transferred to beneficiaries through DBT, ensuring transparency and eliminating corruption leakages.Modi also detailed India's rise in global industries. ""From importing rifles, we now export defence equipment 20 times more than before. Solar energy capacity has increased 30 times, and toy exports have tripled,"" he said. Infrastructure investment has seen a five-fold boost, doubling the number of airports and tripling the number of AIIMS institutions. The startup ecosystem has flourished, and India now ranks among the top three in the world for new businesses, Modi said.","Naxalism is in its final phase, with affected districts reduced from more than 100 to fewer than 24 in the past decade, the PM said.

BENGALURU: After Tamil Nadu, voices against ""Hindi imposition"" and the three-language formula proposed under NEP are getting louder in Karnataka, too, with Kannada Development Authority (KDA) writing to chief minister Siddaramaiah to adopt a two-language policy in the state. ""Considering the variety of discussions going on regarding the language issue, it seems Karnataka needs a bilingual formula,"" KDA chief Purushottham Bilimale wrote.Bilimale also forwarded a copy of a letter he had received from Ramesh Bellamkonda, a member of Namma Naadu Namma Aalvike, alleging a language inequity existed in the country, with Hindi being imposed on non-Hindi-speaking populations.Ramesh, too, advocated a two-language formula - with Kannada and English being the two compulsory languages in the state for education, governance, and general interaction. Kannada should have primacy and English should be the second language, he said.As per the Kannada Language Learning Rules-2017, students in the state have to learn Kannada as the second language, irrespective of the board their school is affiliated with.Ramesh also batted for ensuring fairness for sub-regional languages, such as Tulu, in consultation with people in the respective sub-regions. In addition, facilities for those interested in learning any number of other languages, depending on their individual choices or circumstances, should exist, but the burden of learning languages should be kept to a minimum possible level, he said.","After Tamil Nadu, voices against ""Hindi imposition"" are getting louder in Karnataka.

During a drinks break in the 40th over of India's chase, KL Rahul spoke with Virat Kohli , appearing to encourage him to stay at the crease until the end. With India requiring 65 runs from 60 balls against Australia on Tuesday, KL Rahul took on the role of aggressor in this Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.Rahul quickly scored a four and a six in his next five deliveries to ease the pressure on Kohli. He then rotated the strike to Kohli when India needed 40 runs from 45 balls, with Kohli 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.Kohli, despite being in control throughout the chase, attempted an unnecessary slog sweep against Adam Zampa and was caught at long-on. This uncharacteristic dismissal visibly frustrated KL Rahul at the non-striker's end.""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" Rahul told Kohli as he walked past him.In the dressing room, coach Gautam Gambhir was also left visibly upset and mumbled something to the support staff and players seated alongside him.After the match, KL Rahul revealed his conversation with Kohli. ""When I walked in and when I played 10-12 balls I told him that you're the batter that needs to go on and be there till the end. And let me try and hit or let me try and take one chance an over. Because like you said we only needed 6 runs and over. But 6 runs and over on that wicket seemed like 8-8.5. So, you had to take one chance and over, one boundary or one six,"" Rahul told Star Sports.""So, I told him that I will do that and why don't you just rotate the strike and be there because you're the set batter and it might be harder. If you get out another set batter comes it becomes a lot more harder. But yeah, he felt like it was in his range to hit and yeah he didn't time it well.""Rahul maintained his composure and finished unbeaten with 42 runs from 34 balls, securing the victory with a six in the 49th over's first ball. This win advanced India to their fifth Champions Trophy final. Hardik Pandya contributed with a quick 28 runs from 24 balls before his dismissal.Despite the one mistimed shot, Kohli's performance was exceptional. He formed a crucial 91-run partnership for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 runs, after the early dismissals of Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (9).Although Australia were missing key players, India hadn't defeated them in ICC tournament knockouts since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal.Kohli effectively handled leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had previously troubled him. He utilised pull shots and drives between sweeper cover and mid-wicket for consistent scoring.After losing both Iyer and Axar Patel (27) in quick succession, Kohli reached his fifty in 53 balls. Glenn Maxwell dropped a catch when Kohli was on 51 off Cooper Connolly's bowling.Kohli's innings ended when India needed 40 runs to win, as he hit the ball to Ben Dwarshuis at long-on off Zampa's bowling.","Virat Kohli was 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.

Omar to Centre: Reclaim PoK but also get back areas in Chinese grip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-to-centre-reclaim-pok-but-also-get-back-areas-in-chinese-grip/articleshow/118768785.cms,"Photo/ANI

JAMMU: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned Thursday the BJP-led Centre’s “silence” on swathes of the region under Chinese control. The National Conference (NC) mascot did so while referring to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s recent statement about reclaiming Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).“The foreign minister has said they will bring back the portion of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan. Did we ever stop them? If they can bring it back, they should do it now. But why no talks on China? Why does the (Union) govt only focus on PoK while ignoring Chinese control over parts of J&K,” the CM said in the assembly during a debate.Jaishankar had made the comments on Wednesday in London in response to a Pakistani scribe’s query, saying the Kashmir issue would be solved when the “stolen part of Kashmir, which is under illegal Pakistani occupation” was returned.Omar pointed out, however, that “one part is with Pakistan, and another is with China”, asking why the Centre didn’t talk about taking back the portions under Beijing’s grip. The CM mentioned further that the Kargil war of 1999 was a good opportunity for the Centre to take back POK, but was missed. “It’s okay that it could not be done then, but if you can reclaim it today, then who among us will say don’t get it back?” Omar asked.Omar came down heavily on BJP leaders for accusing his NC of insulting J&K’s last ruler Maharaja Hari Singh and challenged them to give just one instance when the ruling party or any other Kashmir-based party insulted the Dogra ruler, even as he accused BJP of downgrading the Muslim-majority state.The CM renewed his criticism of the 2019 abrogation of statehood and division into two parts -- J&K and Ladakh. “Maharaja Bahadur (rulers of Princely State) gave you a map of J&K as a legacy. You (the Centre) divided the map of J&K into two parts and now you say this is what the people of Ladakh wanted. Did you ask the people of Ladakh what they wanted?” Omar asked.The CM explained why return of statehood was necessary. “I am not fighting for statehood for myself, this fight is in J&K’s interest. The things we want to do can be given practical shape only when we get back statehood,” Omar said.",J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned the Centre’s “silence’ on swathes of the region under Chinese control.

Trade deal with India key to Donald Trump's bid to boost exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trade-deal-with-india-key-to-donald-trumps-bid-to-boost-exports/articleshow/118769020.cms,"US President Donald Trump, right, speaks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb 13, 2025, in Washington.

NEW DELHI: A bilateral trade deal is critical not just for India but also for the US as it is seen to be key to Donald Trump's focus on boosting production and exports from America. An across-the-board duty reduction will mean that carmakers, bourbon producers or handset manufacturers will ship goods into India from the most competitive source, likely to be China or south-east Asia, instead of an American factory.Neither Harley Davidson, a favourite with all American presidents, or Tesla, run by Trump aide Elon Musk, source their vehicles from the US.While Harley is importing its bikes from its manufacturing set-up in Thailand, Tesla, which is close to launching its cars in India, is likely to ship its electrics from Germany after authorities requested the company not to import the vehicles from China.Companies find it beneficial to use other manufacturing bases due to locational advantages helping them save on freight or due to economies of scale. Besides, some are taking advantage of India's existing free trade agreements to ship goods at zero duty.For all the noise, Harley, which only makes the 440cc model in India in partnership with Hero Moto. ""There is a mega set-up in Thailand that the company uses to get its bikes to India. Beyond the 440cc that it makes here, all the other bikes - including bigger ones like Pan America, Nightster, Street Glide and Fat Bob - are being imported from Thailand,"" an analyst specialising in foreign trade told TOI.""So even if India reduces the duty on imported bikes from the US to zero, Harley will still find it beneficial to get them from Thailand due to its proximity to India, which lowers the freight cost and makes shipments faster,"" another analyst said.A bilateral trade deal, for which commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal is in Washington, could provide duty advantages to India as well as the US, and enable factories and farmers in both countries to directly export.Government has signalled its lower tariffs by slashing duties on imported bikes and bourbon. Although the move, which saw reduction from all sources of imports, was addressing Trump's repeated attack on India's ""high tariffs"", it did not result in any gains for factories in the US.Of the $2.6 million import of bourbon whiskey, only $780,000 was directly from the US, and the bulk came from other countries, some of which were bottling hubs.","A bilateral trade deal is seen to be key to Donald Trump's focus on boosting production and exports from America.

'Frustrated sarfira': Ashok Gehlot slams Mani Shankar Aiyar for remarks against Rajiv Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frustrated-sarfira-ashok-gehlot-slams-mani-shankar-aiyar-for-remarks-against-rajiv-gandhi/articleshow/118765549.cms,"Ashok Gehlot vs Mani Shankar Aiyar over Rajiv Gandhi.

NEW DELHI: Former Rajasthan chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot on Thursday called his party colleague Mani Shankar Aiyar a frustrated "" sarfira ."" Reacting strongly to Aiyar's remarks questioning the competency of late Rajiv Gandhi, Gehlot said: ""His statements about Rajiv Gandhi reflect the height of frustration. There is so much frustration in him. In such a situation, a person does not know what he is saying. Only a 'sarfira' can say such a thing about Rajiv Gandhi.""Calling Aiyar's comments condemnable, Gehlot said Rajiv Gandhi increased India's prestige abroad as the Prime Minister and claimed that exemplary laws were passed during his tenure.On Wednesday, Congress leader Harish Rawat had called Aiyar a ""frustrated individual."" ""I don't want to comment on someone who is a frustrated individual...I knew Rajiv Gandhi, who gave the country a modern outlook. He took concrete steps for the liberalisation of the economy as well. Unfortunately, a section of the party (Congress) did not stand with him, or else the country's history would have been something else. His speeches as LoP still guide leaders,"" Rawat had said.Nana Patole, former Maharashtra Congress chief had slammed Aiyar for digging out uncomfortable details about the former PM who left the world long ago. “He has lost his mental balance, he should get himself examined,” Patole had said yesterday.Congress leaders have unleashed an offensive against Aiyar after BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video on his official 'X' handle in which former Union minister is heard questioning former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's education.In the video, Aiyar is heard saying that despite failing at Cambridge, where passing is considered relatively easy, he went on to attend Imperial College London, only to face failure again.Also read: 'How could someone who failed twice become PM?': Mani Shankar Aiyar's shocker on Rajiv Gandhi; Cong calls him 'frustrated leader' ""Rajiv Gandhi struggled academically, even failing at Cambridge, where passing is relatively easy. He then moved to Imperial College London but failed there as well. Many questioned how someone with his academic record could become the Prime Minister. Let the veil be stripped"", Amit Malviya captioned his post on 'X.This is not the first time that Aiyar has landed the Congress in trouble with his remarks. There have been several instances in the past when Aiyar has embarrassed the Congress by speaking out of turn. His remarks mocking PM Modi's past as a tea seller in 2014 gave the BJP a weapon to brand Congress as an elitist party. He later made another derogatory remark against the Prime Minister leading to his suspension from the party. However, his recent remarks against the Gandhis don't appear to be unintentional.Aiyar had recently claimed that his career was both made and unmade by the Gandhis. In an interview to news agency PTI, Aiyar had mentioned that aside from one occasion, he had limited meaningful interactions with Rahul Gandhi , and he had only spent time with Priyanka Gandhi on two occasions.“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions. She comes on the phone to me, so I’m in touch with them. So, the irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" he had said.(With inputs from agencies)","Mani Shankar Aiyar questioned the competency of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

NEW DELHI: In a major boost to IAF’s strategic airlift capability to forward areas, a gigantic C-17 Globemaster-III aircraft has for the first time landed at the high-altitude Kargil airfield near the Line of Control with Pakistan.The “trial run” saw the four-engine C-17 take off from its home base at Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi and land at the Kargil airstrip, which is in a bowl surrounded by mountains on all sides and located at an altitude of over 9,700-feet, on Wednesday morning.“The next step will be to conduct a night landing by a C-17 at Kargil. The C-17 can normally airlift a 70-tonne cargo but it’s around 35 tonne at the altitude in Kargil. The much smaller C-130J `Super Hercules' had landed at night in Kargil in Jan last year. The C-17 increases the load carrying capacity by around four times,” a source told TOI .With an eye on both China and Pakistan, India has progressively upgraded the infrastructure at forward air-bases and advance landing grounds (ALGs), including Thoise, Fukche, Nyoma and Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in Ladakh as well as Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh.The ongoing Rs 230 crore upgrade work at the Nyoma ALG, which is located close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in eastern Ladakh at an altitude of 13,710-feet, for instance, includes extending and strengthening the existing airstrip into a 2.7-km `rigid pavement’ runway for all kinds of fixed-wing aircraft including fighters for “defensive as well as offensive operations”, as was earlier reported by TOI.The IAF has inducted 11 C-17s for $4.5 billion and 13 C-130Js for $2.1 billion from the US over the last 15 years to augment its airlift capabilities. One C-130J was lost in a crash near Gwalior in March 2014, which killed the five personnel on board.The rugged C-17s and C-130s, which can even land at makeshift airstrips, have been extensively used to airlift supplies and troops to border areas with China and Pakistan, evacuation of Indian nationals from abroad, and providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief in India and overseas.In Aug 2013, for instance, a C-130J had for the first time landed at the rudimentary airstrip in DBO at an altitude of 16,614-feet, the highest such ALG in the world that overlooks the strategic Karakoram Pass and is just a few kms from the LAC with China.",A gigantic C-17 Globemaster-III aircraft has for the first time landed at the high-altitude Kargil airfield near the Line of Control with Pakistan. The four- engine aircraft took off from its home base at Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi and land at the Kargill airstrip on Wednesday morning.

CHENNAI: Madras HC Thursday directed Union government to unblock Tamil journal Ananda Vikatan 's website, which had been blocked after it published online an offensive cartoon showing PM Narendra Modi.The cartoon was published during Modi's visit to the US and his summit meeting with US President Donald Trump, and coincided with illegal immigrants from India being deported from the US.Justice D Bharatha Chakravarthy granted the interim relief to the magazine with a rider that the cartoon should be removed. Since only the caricature in question appears to be objectionable, the rest of the magazine can remain accessible, the court said.The court's order came on a plea moved by the magazine challenging Centre's action of blocking access to its website. The magazine's counsel, Vijay Narayan, submitted that the website was blocked without giving a proper opportunity to respond to the allegation. Narayan argued that as per Section 69A of Information Technology Act , it will not be sufficient to block access to a website merely because sovereignty is affected; it is also necessary that the integrity of the country is compromised. ""The cartoon published by the magazine did not fall under any of the reasons cited under the law for blocking public access to information,"" he added.No damage was caused to the sovereignty and integrity of the country, and no harm befell the friendly relations between India and the US due to the publication of the cartoon, Narayan said.Opposing the plea, additional solicitor-general of India A R L Sundaresan said the cartoon would affect India's relations with the US. ""Article 19(2) of the Constitution and Section 69A of the IT Act provide for reasonable restriction on content if it is satisfied that such restriction is necessary in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,"" he said.",Madras HC Thursday directed Union government to unblock Tamil journal Ananda Vikatan's website.

"Visually impaired man battles system for 15 years to get UPSC posting, triumphed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/visually-impaired-man-battles-system-for-15-years-to-get-upsc-posting-triumphed/articleshow/118769269.cms,"Shiwam Srivastava

NEW DELHI: For 15 years, Shiwam Kumar Srivastava fought not just for a job, but for the right to be seen. He had cleared the UPSC Civil Services Examination in 2008, ranking high enough for selection. But when the final list came out, his name wasn’t on it. No explanation. No rejection letter. Just silence — a quiet, deliberate erasure.The irony was impossible to miss. Shiwam had lost his vision, but the system refused to see. The Persons with Disabilities (PwD) Act, 1995 guaranteed visually impaired candidates a fair chance in the civil services. However, laws mean nothing when those enforcing them choose to look the other way.For over a decade, the bureaucracy that was supposed to uphold fairness denied him with a different kind of blindness — one that had nothing to do with sight. Vacancies were left unfilled. Legal protections were ignored. His rightful selection was buried in paperwork. Justice delayed wasn’t just justice denied — it was a career erased before it had even begun.He took the fight all the way to the Supreme Court , which, in July 2024, finally ordered the Union govt to appoint him. By then, his batchmates had spent 15 years rising through the ranks. Some were joint secretaries. Shiwam, at 46, was just starting.“The order came seven months ago, but I haven’t celebrated yet. I haven’t even told my relatives,” he said from his third-floor apartment in Rohini, Delhi. For years, every small victory had been followed by another setback. Even now, with his post in Indian Information Service (IIS) finally secured, he remains wary. “This fight was never just about me,” he said. “It was about proving that people like me deserve a place in this system — even when the system refuses to see us.”Supreme Court’s order, invoking Article 142, had directed the Union government to place him in Indian Revenue Service or any other suitable service. He was eventually allotted to IIS, but the victory was bitter. Bureaucratic blindness had cost him the prime years of his career—something no court ruling could restore.His legal battle had begun in 2009, when he and fellow candidate Pankaj Srivastava discovered that UPSC had left vacancies for visually impaired candidates unfilled from 1996 to 2005. They challenged this in Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which ruled in their favour in 2012. Union govt appealed to Delhi High Court, which upheld their case in 2013. Even then, Centre dragged the matter to the Supreme Court, where it remained stuck for a decade. Hearings stretched from 2014 to 2024, while his career stayed frozen in time.“There were three others like me. After the 2008 results, we found that our UPSC scores were higher than those selected for various services. Yet, despite clearing our interviews, we were never recommended,” he said. The authorities never said it outright, but the message was clear—blind officers had no place in government.Before his IIS appointment, Shiwam had worked in the judiciary for two decades, first as a junior assistant clerk at the Rohini court in 2003, then as a senior judicial assistant officer. Even there, he had faced the same structural resistance. Promotions were rare for disabled employees, and he remained stuck in the same pay grade for years — not because he lacked ability, but because the system didn’t believe he deserved more.Now, six months into his new job as an assistant director in Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, he commutes 60 km daily via auto-rickshaw to Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), where he is undergoing two years of induction training. “I will get perks, including a car, only after the training is over and I receive a posting,” he said. Even now, he remains behind his batchmates — not because of merit, but because the system chose to look away.Shiwam had learned early what it meant to be overlooked. Born in Motihari, Bihar, in 1978, he had been a topper, excelling in school, when, at 17, his world collapsed. Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), a rare genetic disorder, took his sight permanently. His father took him to every specialist imaginable, but nothing worked. For five years, he clung to hope—yoga, meditation, alternative medicine—but by 2001, he had to accept reality.Determined to rebuild his life, he moved to Delhi, where he trained at All-India Confederation of the Blinds (AICB) and National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Visual Disabilities (NIEPVD), Dehradun. There, he discovered text-to-speech software like GAWS and NVDA, which allowed him to scan, digitise, and listen to books—a tool that became his lifeline in UPSC preparation.In 2016, he married Pushpanjali Rani, who never doubted his ability to achieve his dreams. “‘Impossible’ is not in his dictionary. Nothing can stop him,” she said. They now have two daughters, aged 7 and 2. His resilience has inspired many, including Sunil Kumar, a judicial officer at Tis Hazari Court, who credits him with pushing for major workplace reforms.“There was no promotion quota for disabled employees in Delhi courts, but thanks to him, I am now a senior judicial assistant. He also ensured we received four days of special casual leave. The only thing I wish is that the Supreme Court had granted him a retrospective appointment—he deserves the same benefits as his batchmates.”For Shiwam, that remains a painful truth. “I fought for my place and won, but I will always be years behind my batchmates. If my appointment had been backdated, I would be in a much better position today,” he said.Beyond the legal battle, Shiwam has fought constant scepticism about his abilities. “From my neighbours in Motihari to my colleagues and even my own relatives, people have never been kind to my condition. I despise the term ‘blind’ because I believe I am more capable than many who have full vision. I had to constantly prove I was disabled—something that should never have been questioned.”In frustration, he even attempted to ride a two-wheeler but met with accidents thrice. He would've continued trying had it not been stolen later. Despite possessing a disability card and undergoing medical examinations at multiple hospitals, people still doubted him.“Since I wasn’t born blind, I have a sense of distance, and my eyes adjust to voices in a certain way. A sliver of light enters from the rim, helping me navigate, but I cannot see straight. How do I make anyone understand this?” he said, his voice laced with years of frustration.Yet, his story is not just one of hardship but of defiance and perseverance. After 15 years of fighting the system, he has finally arrived, though not in the way he once imagined. His nameplate now hangs on his door, his title official, his legal battle over. And yet, as he looks ahead, he cannot shake the feeling that the system is still looking away.","Shiwam Kumar Srivastava, 46, lost his vision at the age of 17. He fought for 15 years for a job and the right to be seen in the civil services. The Persons with Disabilities (PwD) Act, 1995 guaranteed visually impaired candidates a fair chance. But laws mean nothing when those enforcing them choose to look away.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769271,imgsize-1100604,width-400,resizemode-4/118769271.jpg"
Bhagwant Mann vs farmers: Is AAP rethinking its strategy in Punjab?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwant-mann-vs-farmers-is-aap-rethink-its-strategy-in-punjab/articleshow/118759733.cms,"AAP’s political setback and Kejriwal’s absence



NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is taking the farmers head-on, accusing them of ""turning Punjab into a state of protests."" The foiled Chandigarh agitation has now become the latest flashpoint in the escalating standoff.On Wednesday, farmers who had set out in tractors and other vehicles were stopped at multiple entry points, leading to heightened tensions between the protesters and the government.A day earlier, Bhagwant Mann had walked out of a crucial meeting with farm leaders midway, further deepening the confrontation. As protesting farmers were halted, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) issued a direct warning to Mann, stating that his government ""will not have enough jails if the farmers of Punjab decide to court arrest to protect the democratic rights of the people.""The latest showdown has provided fresh ammunition to opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has accused the AAP government of ""insulting the annadatas (food providers).""For a party that rode to power in Punjab with the support of farmers — who protested for months against the Centre's farm bills at Delhi’s borders — this apparent U-turn has been striking. The Mann government now finds its relationship with the farming community severely strained.Speaking to the media, Mann defended his stance, stating that his government had to balance the interests of all Punjabis, not just farmers.""I am the custodian of not just the farmers but of Punjab’s 3.5 crore people. The protests were causing inconvenience to traders, businessmen, students, and employees,"" Mann said.The confrontation with farmers comes just days after AAP lost its stronghold in Delhi, allowing the BJP to stage a major comeback in the recent Delhi assembly elections.Adding to the political turmoil, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has not been seen in public since the election results were announced. Though he traveled to Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation camp, what grabbed attention was his high-profile convoy.The opposition targeted the Punjab government over Kejriwal’s 21-vehicle cavalcade, which included Punjab Police personnel, accusing him of hypocrisy. The BJP, which successfully countered Kejriwal’s ‘aam aadmi’ (common man) narrative in Delhi with allegations of extravagant spending on ‘Sheesh Mahal’ (glass palace),claimed his Punjab retreat was simply an excuse to enjoy a lavish lifestyle.The Delhi assembly results marked AAP’s second major setback, following its poor performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where it won only three out of 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab. This was in stark contrast to its landslide victory in the 2022 Punjab Assembly elections, where the party won 92 out of 117 seats.The Delhi election results were also seen as a reflection of Mann’s popularity. Despite active campaigning by Mann, his cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, the party failed to improve its standing in the national capital.With Punjab assembly elections just two years away, Mann’s tougher stance on farmers will be closely watched, as it may determine AAP’s future in the state.","Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is taking the farmers head-on, accusing them of ""turning Punjab into a state of protests"" The foiled Chandigarh agitation has now become the latest flashpoint in the escalating standoff.

NEW DELHI: 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana on Thursday made another last ditch effort to avoid extradition to India, alleging 'torture' in India.He approached the US Supreme Court , seeking an emergency stay on his previously allowed extradition. In the appeal application, Rana contended that his survival chances would be insufficient for facing trial in India, citing multiple factors. His petition specifically mentioned that ""if a stay is not entered, there will be no review at all, and the US courts will lose jurisdiction, and the petitioner will soon be dead.""Also read: Delhi court seeks 26/11 trial papers from Mumbai court ahead of Tahawwur Hussain Rana extradition The 26/11 terror attacks suspect alleged that his extradition to India would likely lead to his torture, given his status as a Pakistani-origin Muslim individual.This comes as Rana's extradition was greenlit by US President Donald Trump last month. During a joint press conference at the White House with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump had announced the decision and suggested additional extraditions would follow. ""We are giving a very violent man (Tahawwur Rana) back to India immediately. There are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. We work with India on crime, and we want to make things better for India,"" Trump had said whilst acknowledging the ongoing collaboration between both nations regarding criminal matters.Prior to Trump's approval, US Supreme Court had rejected Rana’s appeal on January 21 which was over a ruling by a lower court which also gave it ruling, allowing Ran's extradition to India where he is wanted in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists.Rana, who holds Canadian citizenship and has Pakistani origins, faces charges in India for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks that resulted in over 174 fatalities. He was found guilty in the United States for providing support to the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). India has been seeking his extradition for an extended period.In connection with the 26/11 attack, Rana is alleged to have assisted his associate David Coleman Headley, also known as Daood Gilani, who possessed US citizenship through his American mother and Pakistani father. US authorities apprehended Headley in October 2009.Rana's involvement reportedly extended beyond being cognisant of Headley's connections to LeT, the Pakistan-based outlawed terrorist group. He actively supported Headley by providing him with false credentials, which enabled Headley to travel to India and scout potential targets for LeT's 2008 operation.","26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana on Thursday made another last ditch effort to avoid extradition to India, alleging 'torture' in India.

RSS neta sparks Maha row with remark on Marathi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rss-neta-sparks-maha-row-with-remark-on-marathi/articleshow/118770029.cms,"Photo/Agencies

MUMBAI: Senior RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi 's remark at a function in Ghatkopar that knowing Marathi was not necessary to live in Mumbai stirred a political controversy on Thursday, with the opposition MVA criticising him strongly and demanding to know if the state govt agreed with him. While CM Devendra Fadnavis said in response that Marathi is the language of Mumbai and Maharashtra and anyone who lives here should learn and speak it, Joshi himself said later that his comment had been misconstrued and that ""Marathi is a part of the state's culture and identity, and it is the duty of every citizen to learn it.""Speaking at a programme on Wednesday evening, Joshi said those coming to Mumbai need not learn Marathi. He also said Gujarati is ""the language of Ghatkopar.""The statements invited criticism from the Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress. Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded Joshi be booked for treason for his remarks, and in the state assembly, and the party's MLA Bhaskar Jadhav sought an explanation from the govt. NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said, ""The language of Mumbai is Marathi"" and demanded the govt state its stance on the controversy. In the legislative council, opposition leader Ambadas Danve attacked the govt, asking it, ""Do you endorse Bhaiyyaji Joshi's statement?"" The council was adjourned for ten minutes as opposition MLCs demanded that chairman Ram Shinde accept their demand for a discussion on the issue. When the House reassembled, Congress' Bhai Jagtap slammed the govt, stating it seemed to have forgotten the ""Hutatmas"" who sacrificed their lives for formation of the state on linguistic lines. Later, opposition MLCs staged a walkout in protest.In the afternoon, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray went to Hutatma Chowk with all his MLAs and MLCs to protest Joshi's statement.Following the uproar, Joshi issued a video statement. He said, ""Due to one of my statements, a misunderstanding occurred. There is no question of the language of Mumbai not being Marathi. The language of Maharashtra is Marathi. Mumbai is in Maharashtra, and naturally, the language of Mumbai is Marathi. Different languages are spoken in India. People speaking different languages live in Mumbai as well. So, it is a natural expectation that they should also come here and learn Marathi, understand Marathi, and read Marathi. I think that this is a great example of coexistence, that people speaking so many different languages in India live together. I think that Mumbai is also an ideal example of this. But there is a natural expectation that a person coming to Mumbai should understand Marathi, speak Marathi, learn Marathi, and read Marathi. This is the only expectation. I have nothing more to say than this... My mother tongue is Marathi. But I also respect the existence of all languages... I request everyone to see it from the same perspective.""Fadnavis said in the assembly, ""I haven't heard what Bhaiyyaji said, but the language of Mumbai and Maharashtra is Marathi. Everyone should learn Marathi and should speak the language.""","Senior RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi said those coming to Mumbai need not learn Marathi.

Collegium picks Calcutta HC judge Joymalya Bagchi for Supreme Court post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-picks-calcutta-hc-judge-for-sc-post/articleshow/118769551.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The five-member Supreme Court Collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Thursday decided to recommend to the Union govt to appoint Justice Joymalya Bagchi, a judge of the Calcutta HC, as a judge of the Supreme Court, which at present has two vacancies in its sanctioned strength of 34 judges.The Collegium, also comprising Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath, zeroed in on Justice Bagchi after considering the judgments and judicial acumen of several judges and CJs of HCs, who were in the zone of consideration for elevation to the SC.If the Union government accepts the recommendation, Justice Bagchi would be superseding many judges across HCs who are senior to him and would be the second judge from Calcutta HC in the SC, which at present has sole representation through Justice Dipankar Datta .In his parent HC, Justice Bagchi would be superseding Justices Harish Tandon and Soumen Sen. While Justice Tandon was appointed as a Judge of Calcutta HC on April 13, 2010, Justice Sen was appointed as a Judge exactly a year later on April 13, 2011. Justice Bagchi was appointed as a Judge on June 27, 2011.Justice Tandon could take consolation in the fact that the Collegium on Thursday decided to recommend to the Union govt his appointment as Orissa HC chief justice. Orissa HC at present has an acting CJ in Justice Arindam Sinha, who was transferred from Calcutta HC to Orissa HC on Oct 8, 2021.Justice Bagchi, on appointment to the SC, would also supersede five judges including CJ Alok Aradhe in Bombay HC. Justice Bagchi-led bench has handled sensitive cases relating to R G Kar Hospital rape-murder incident as well as the teacher recruitment scam.Interestingly, Bagchi as a lawyer had argued successfully before a special bench of Calcutta HC against the ban imposed by West Bengal govt on Taslima Nasreen’s book “Dwikhondita’. He was transferred to Andhra Pradesh HC, where he had a stint as a judge from Dec 2020 till Sep 2021.The CJI-led Collegium had on Jan 7 recommended appointment of Justice K Vinod Chandran, then chief Justice of Patna HC. The government had cleared the appointment within a week and Justice Chandran took oath as a Judge of the SC on Jan 16.","The five-member Supreme Court Collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Thursday decided to recommend to the Union govt to appoint Justice Joymalya Bagchi.

KOLKATA: Calcutta HC advised Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose and CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday to have a "" chai pe charcha "" to resolve their differences, saying ""it isn't a good example"" for the public to witness a legal battle involving Raj Bhavan and the state government.Justice Krishna Rao, who was hearing the state's petition challenging an interim directive restraining it from making any statement against the governor, extended the gag order till April 10.The case dates back to July 2023, when Bose filed a defamation case against Mamata and three others - MLAs Sayantika Banerjee and Reyat Hossain Sarkar, and former MP Kunal Ghosh - over what he said was ""personal imputation"" in public. The governor soughtRs 11 crore in damages along with an order barring the respondents from allegedly maligning him. Bose specifically objected to Mamata's purported remark that ""women fear to enter Raj Bhavan"" in Kolkata, alluding to allegations against the governor that he molested a former member of his staff.Later that month, the court restrained the three from ""making any defamatory or incorrect statement"" against the governor. It said Bose had prima facie made a case for an interim restraint order. Mamata challenged this order on the ground that ""justifiable criticism"" wasn't libel, and that the gag order curbed her fundamental right to free speech as a citizen and an elected representative.The matter is slated to come up for hearing next on April 9.","Calcutta HC advised Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose and CM Mamata Banerjee to have a "" chai pe charcha "" The case dates back to July 2023, when Bose filed a defamation case against Mamata and three others.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769554,imgsize-895396,width-400,resizemode-4/118769554.jpg"

Biryani bone stuck in throat triggers 8-hour OT drama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biryani-bone-stuck-in-throat-triggers-8-hour-ot-drama/articleshow/118769427.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: A dinner treat turned into a misadventure for Kurla's Shaikh family. On Feb 3, Ruby Shaikh (name changed), a 34-year-old mother of two, was enjoying a rare treat - chicken biryani from a local restaurant. Little did she know that a chicken bone would take her on a month-long medical journey that would perplex even doctors.The modestly priced biryani left Ruby's husband, a supervisor in a local factory, with an Rs 8 lakh bill, although the hospital later halved it through donations.The 3.2cm bone that damaged Ruby's oesophagus was extracted on Feb 8. But when doctors at Criticare Asia Hospital began the throat procedure, it vanished from its initial position. X-ray and ultrasound examinations couldn't find it in the chest or abdomen. A CT scan, performed while the patient was intubated, revealed its unexpected upward movement to the nasopharynx, the topmost part of the throat. The operation lasted eight hours instead of two.Immediately after choking on Feb 3, Ruby arrived at Criticare Hospital where an X-ray scan showed a foreign object in her neck. She refused CT scans and admission but returned two days later with fever, high blood pressure, and oral infection. This time, through endoscopy and CT scans, doctors found the foreign body in the cervical oesophagus, having caused bilateral perforations.ENT surgeon Dr Sanjay Helale said, ""Scans before surgery revealed the bone was still in the earlier position."" He chose an open surgery as the bone was close to the carotid artery to the brain and the patient's perforated food pipe needed repair. ""Perhaps due to manipulations of the oesophagus during dissection or the effect of anaesthesia, the bone moved upward.""Dr Ajay Bhandarwar, head of the surgery dept at J J Hospital, said the movement from the food pipe back to the throat was unusual.Former KEM Hospital Dean Dr Avinash Supe suggested: ""One can presume the patient coughed immediately after anaesthesia was given and necrosis set in the infected tissues loosened the bone, resulting in upward migration.""Ruby, meanwhile, says she will neither eat nor cook biryani.","The 3.2cm bone that damaged Ruby's oesophagus was extracted on Feb 8.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday exempted Tamil Nadu deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin from personal appearance in any court relating criminal cases on his controversial ‘Sanatan eradication’ remarks and barred lodging of new FIRs for the same comments at TN Progressive Writers Artists Association at Chennai on Sep 2, 2023.Appearing for Staling Jr, senior advocates A M Singhvi and P Wilson told a bench of Chief Justice Sanjeev Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar that the FIRs could be clubbed at one place to avoid multifarious criminal proceedings arising from the same comment.“The statement of Nupur Sharma is far more offensive. Yet, she got relief from the court,” Singhvi said. Appearing for Maharashtra, where one of the FIRs was lodged against the deputy CM, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Does it behove a deputy CM to call for eradication of ‘ sanatan dharma ’ like mosquitoes, dengue and malaria? Hell would have broken lose had a CM of any other state called for eradication of any other religion, say Islam.”CJI Khanna said SC is not going into merits of the alleged words spoken by Stalin Jr as any opinion expressed by it could impact the trial. “We are only on the issue of whether the cases could be transferred to one place for consolidated proceedings,” the CJI said. The SC had earlier suggested transferring all cases to Karnataka.The SG continued, “Merely because a community which is sought to be eradicated does not react violently or threaten violence, should it be continuously targeted?” Wilson said he would take SG to Tamil Nadu as he does not understand the situation there.Mehta said he is not against Tamil Nadu at all but has strong reservations against the irresponsible words used by a deputy CM against “Sanatan dharma’. Singhvi countered saying the SG is speaking for another audience. Mehta said, “I have no other audience than the SC. My friend conducts press conferences for another audience. I do not have that privilege.” Singhvi said, “The SG is holding one in the court.”After the bench barred registration of further FIRs and continued the exemption from personal appearance of Stalin Jr in any court with regard to proceedings relating to his Sep 2023 comments and posted further hearing on Apr 28, the SG said the SC in Shaheen Abdullah case had taken strong exception to hate speeches by certain Hindu organizations and ordered preventive action as well as empowering police to suo motu register FIRs against those indulging in hate speeches.That matter is pending and the petition by Stalin Jr could be tagged with that, Mehta suggested. This was immediately objected to by Wilson, who said the Abdullah case has nothing to do with the petition by Stalin Jr.Mehta said even for something innocuous, the SC had directed registration of FIR . “Petitions cannot always be filed to target one community which does not react violently to hate speeches made against its religion,” he said.Singhvi and Wilson said Mehta is trying to bring politics into law, when there is nothing in common. SC also refused to tag Stalin Jr’s petition with the pending petitions relating to hate speech.","Tamil Nadu deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin exempted from personal appearance in any court relating criminal cases on his controversial ‘Sanatan eradication’ remarks.

NEW DELHI: Observing that preventive detention is a draconian measure whereby a person can be detained without conviction, Supreme Court has held that such orders must reflect an independent application of mind by the detaining authority , and a mere statement that it's ""satisfied on examination of the proposals and supporting documents"" is not sufficient.Quashing a detention order passed by the home department of Nagaland government, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Augustine George Masih said that the detaining authority, special secretary (home department), did not even make separate grounds of detention but merely acted upon the proposals for detention forwarded to her by the additional director general of police, which is not valid.""The cryptic orders of detention passed by her (special secretary) merely recorded that she was satisfied, on careful examination of such proposals and other supporting documents, that sufficient grounds were made out for the detention of Ashraf Hussain Choudhary and Adaliu Chawang. This is not in keeping with the statutory scheme, inasmuch as Section 6 of the Act ( Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act ) specifically refers to the order of detention 'being made' on separate grounds,"" the court said.""Further, Section 3(1) also records that the authorised officer, be it of the central govt or of a state govt, must be 'satisfied' that the person concerned required to be detained so as to prevent him/her from engaging in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Such 'satisfaction' of the detaining authority necessarily has to be spelt out after application of mind by way of separate grounds of detention made by the detaining authority itself and cannot be by inference from a casual reference to the material placed before such detaining authority or a bald recital to the effect that the detaining authority was 'satisfied on examination of the proposals and supporting documents' that the detention of the individuals concerned was necessary,"" it said.","Quashing a detention order passed by the home department of Nagaland government, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Augustine George Masih said that the detaining authority, special secretary (home department), did not even make separate grounds of detention.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769334,imgsize-1371931,width-400,resizemode-4/118769334.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Observing that ""over-solicitous homage"" to the accused's liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice, Supreme Court has said that anticipatory bail should be granted only in exceptional cases, particularly when an accused is alleged to be involved in corruption.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said corruption in the higher echelons of govt and political parties was the biggest menace which could lead to economic unrest and underscored that courts should not hesitate to deny liberty to an accused in such cases in order to ensure a corruption-free society .""The presumption of innocence, by itself, cannot be the sole consideration for grant of anticipatory bail. The presumption of innocence is one of the considerations, which the court should keep in mind while considering the plea for anticipatory bail. The salutary rule is to balance the cause of the accused and the cause of public justice. Over-solicitous homage to the accused's liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice,"" the bench said.The court passed the order while rejecting anticipatory bail plea of a public servant who was alleged to have demanded illegal gratification in connection with audit of development work undertaken by a gram panchayat. It said Law Commission in its 41st report recommended introduction of a provision for grant of anticipatory bail where it said that ""power to grant anticipatory bail should be exercised in very exceptional cases"".""If liberty is to be denied to an accused to ensure corruption free society, then courts should not hesitate in denying such liberty. Where overwhelming considerations in the nature aforesaid require denial of anticipatory bail, it has to be denied. It is altogether a different thing to say that once probe is over and chargesheet is filed, court may consider to grant regular bail to a public servant accused of indulging in corruption,"" SC said.Stating that parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in a serious offence like corruption were required to be satisfied, the bench said, ""Anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where court is prima facie of view that applicant has been falsely roped into the crime or allegations are politically motivated or frivolous. So far as the case at hand is concerned, it cannot be said that any exceptional circumstances have been made out by the petitioner for grant of anticipatory bail and there is no frivolity in the prosecution,"" it said.Highlighting the problem of corruption in society, the court said, ""If one is asked to name one sole factor that effectively arrested the progress of our society to prosperity, undeniably it is corruption.""",Supreme Court said that anticipatory bail should be granted only in exceptional cases. Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said corruption in the higher echelons of govt and political parties was the biggest menace which could lead to economic unrest.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769306,imgsize-1465589,width-400,resizemode-4/118769306.jpg"
L&T introduces one-day menstrual leave per month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lt-introduces-one-day-menstrual-leave-per-month/articleshow/118769276.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: In a first of sorts for the engineering and construction industry, Larsen & Toubro chairman S N Subrahmanyan introduced a one-day menstrual leave facility every month for the company's women staff.The announcement came during Women's Day celebrations at the Powai office in Mumbai where the chairman addressed 350 women employees.The organisation's workforce of 60,000 includes about 5,000 women employees, representing 9% of total staff. The policy excludes L&T's non-construction and non-engineering businesses such as financial and technology services. That's because these businesses have work-from-home and flexible work arrangements, while the main L&T operations have an office-based working policy.The menstrual leave provision is a pioneering step for a progressive workplace policy in the industry that L&T operates in.Thursday's announcement follows Subrahmanyan's earlier contentious statement suggesting a 90-hour work week for employees while also expressing disappointment about the inability to implement working on Sundays.Specific details regarding the implementation of the 12-day annual menstrual leave policy remain undetermined, including its commencement date, and whether it constitutes additional paid leave beyond existing entitlements and the permissible timing within the menstrual cycle.While India lacks national legislation on menstrual leave, several organisations such as AU Small Finance Bank, Orient Electric (part of CK Birla Group), Swiggy and Zomato and states like Odisha, Bihar and Kerala have independently adopted such a policy to support women's health and well-being. A proposed bill addressing women's rights to menstrual leave and free menstrual products awaits enactment.According to KS Legal and Associates' managing partner Sonam Chandwani, despite positive intentions behind menstrual leave policies, practical issues exist. ""While it recognises biological differences and supports workplace inclusivity , it could unintentionally reinforce gender biases. Employers might hesitate to hire or promote women in roles requiring continuous availability, fearing additional leave requirements like maternity leaves. This could set back workplace equality,"" she said.“Misuse is another concern,” she added. “Any leave category specifically designated for a particular group can be difficult to regulate and might be exploited, making implementation inconsistent. Since employees already have access to sick leave, introducing a separate menstrual leave policy may not be necessary. Instead, a more practical approach would be a need based, flexible leave policy where employers accommodate employees based on genuine health concerns without mandating a rigid framework,” Chandwani concluded.","The announcement came during Women's Day celebrations at the Powai office in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: Over 30,000 taxpayers have declared foreign assets of more than Rs 29,000 crore after Central Board of Direct Tax ( CBDT ) launched a campaign nudging taxpayers to come clean. Besides, 6,734 taxpayers have revised their status from residents to non-residents.While the additional foreign income disclosed was Rs 1,090 crore, each taxpayer declared an average asset of around Rs 1 crore overseas.The disclosures are a result of information-sharing arrangements between nearly 125 countries with India being one of the early adopters, which has been since 2018 receiving data, including details of bank accounts overseas and the balance in them, dividends, interest received, and gross payments.Tax authorities, however, found that not everyone was making the required disclosures, resulting in CBDT launching a campaign last Nov urging taxpayers to declare their foreign assets and income through updated tax returns.I-T department sent emails and text messages to 19,500 taxpayers with significant assets overseas and high balances in their accounts, while also conducting outreach sessions with some 8,500 individuals.","Over 30,000 taxpayers have declared foreign assets of more than Rs 29,000 crore.

KOLKATA: A school once listed as a minority institution would continue to enjoy that status, whether or not it obtained a minority certificate from West Bengal Minorities Commission , a division bench of Calcutta high court ruled on Thursday.""Once a minority, always a minority,"" Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam said, as the bench dismissed a public interest litigation filed in 2019, which pleaded that schools run by West Bengal Association of Christian Schools could not claim minority status because the association had not applied to the commission for renewal of minority status.The CJ observed that the petitioner was evidently unaware of the Supreme Court judgments with regard to interpretations of Article 30(1) of the Constitution. He cited a 1988 SC judgment, which ruled that ""a school which is otherwise a minority school would continue to be so. The declaration (by the state) is only an acceptance of a legal character antecedent to the said declaration.""""The settled legal position is that you can't insist on a listed minority body to go to govt and apply for a minority certificate,"" CJ Sivagnanam said.The HC noted that Rule 33 of Management Rules-1969, which provides that such schools may apply for a certificate, was omitted in 2008, and observed: ""The omission of Rule 33 will not in any manner affect the right of the West Bengal Association of Christian Schools. State govt made special rules for the minority-run private institutions conferred to them under Article(s) 26 and 30 of the Constitution.""The respondent schools pleaded that the Christian schools had been set up and administered since 1800, and were listed as minority institutions years before West Bengal Minorities Commission came into being.The bench, also comprising Justice Chaitali Chatterjee (Das), expressed ""serious doubt"" about the bona fides of the petitioner, a social worker engaged in imparting education to the poor and downtrodden in rural areas.","Calcutta high court rules that a school once listed as a minority institution would continue to enjoy that status.

NEW DELHI: The Indian government deplored the misuse of democratic freedoms by pro-Khalistan separatists after a breach of security during foreign minister S Jaishankar's ongoing visit to the UK. While the MEA did not confirm if it has officially lodged a protest with London, the ministry said in a statement that India expects the host government in such cases to fully live up to its diplomatic obligations.""We have seen the footage of a breach of security during the visit of EAM to the UK. We condemn the provocative activities of this small group of separatists and extremists,"" said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Following India's statement, the UK, too, condemned the incident, calling it completely unacceptable. ""While the UK upholds the right to peaceful protest, any attempts to intimidate, threaten, or disrupt public events are completely unacceptable. The Metropolitan Police acted swiftly to address the situation, and we remain fully committed to ensuring security of all our diplomatic visitors, in line with our international obligations,"" said a spokesperson.The freedom enjoyed by anti-India extremists has remained a vexing problem in bilateral ties and Jaishankar raised the issue again in his meeting with UK home secretary Yvette Cooper in a meeting this week.On this occasion, pro-Khalistan protesters had gathered outside Chatham House, where the minister was participating in a discussion, and tried to heckle him while he was leaving the venue in his car. One of the protesters also sprinted towards the car while pulling at an Indian flag, but was quickly restrained by the cops, according to a video that went viral on social media.","Pro-Khalistan protesters had gathered outside Chatham House, where the minister was participating in a discussion.

Listing the revocation of the special status of J&K as one of the steps taken by India to settle the Kashmir issue , foreign minister S Jaishankar said if Pakistan returns the ""stolen part"" of Kashmir to India, the matter would be fully resolved.India has in the past, too, said that the only issue that needs to be resolved is Pakistan's illegal occupation of Indian territory in the UTs of J&K and Ladakh. India's position always has been that Pakistan is in illegal occupation of approximately 78,000 sq km of Indian territory in J&K.""On Kashmir, actually we have done, I think, a good job solving most of it. Removing Article 370 was step number one, restoring growth and economic activity and social justice in Kashmir was step number two, and holding elections with a very high turnout was step number three,"" said Jaishankar, responding to a question during a discussion at Chatham House, an international affairs think tank.""I think the part we are waiting for is the return of the stolen part of Kashmir, which is under illegal Pakistani occupation; when that is done, I assure you Kashmir will be solved,"" he added.India's position, as also enunciated in the 1994 Parliament resolution adopted unanimously, is that the entire UTs of J&K and Ladakh have been, are and shall be an integral part of India. It has regularly called upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal and forcible occupation.In Islamabad, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan rejected Jaishankar's remarks.","India's foreign minister S Jaishankar says if Pakistan returns the ""stolen part"" of Kashmir to India, the matter would be fully resolved.

Trump’s America First policy suits India as it is leading to multipolar world: EAM S Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trumps-america-first-policy-suits-india-as-it-is-leading-to-multipolar-world-eam-s-jaishankar/articleshow/118768782.cms,"Photo credit: X/@DrSJaishankar

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: The world is becoming increasingly multipolar with different centres of power as a result of the Trump administration’s policies, which suits New Delhi very well, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said at Chatham House here.“If I were to look at the big priorities of this president, many of them work for us,” he said. “He seems to be committed to keeping energy prices reasonably affordable and stable — we welcome that. He is putting a lot of emphasis on tech and on the use of tech as a game changer in global politics. That offers a lot of possibilities for us. When I look at our interests and our expectations of the relationship, there is a lot of promise. We see a president and an administration moving towards multipolarity and that is something which suits India,” he said.“Just because there is multipolarity, it doesn’t have to translate into currency multipolarity,” he explained. “There is no policy on our part to replace the dollar,” he stressed. “The dollar, as the reserve currency, is the source of international economic stability and we want more economic stability, not less. The assumption that, somehow, there is a united BRICS position against the dollar is not borne out by facts,” he said. “We have no interest in undermining the dollar. On the contrary, a lot of problems in our region are due to the lack of availability of the dollar,” he said.“Since 1945, one tends to think and talk about the USA as ‘USA and the Western world’ so it’s more like a bloc rather than a nation. What is quite clear is that the US’s own self-perception is now more as a nation; and perhaps a little less as a bloc.” India has spent the past decade developing relations with big players, and non-big ones, he said. “If we can do that successfully with all major powers and groupings, that puts you in a much better position in a world which we could see was heading towards multipolarity,” he said, adding that both India and the Global South would benefit from this new world.Jaishankar also defended India’s human rights record from foreign press criticism. “We have been, for political reasons, at the receiving end of a lot of expressions and sometimes even campaigns on human rights. We listen to it. We are not perfect, but I would argue if one looks around the world, we have a very strong human rights record.“As a credible democracy where people have growing faith in that democracy, where representation has broadened in every conceivable way, where the state has been very fair in terms of treatment of its citizens, I think any sweeping concern on human rights is misplaced.”He also batted back against a question from Bronwen Maddox, chief executive of Chatham House, referring to British media and “parts of UK govt” claiming that minorities such as Tamils, Sikhs and Muslims do not feel as comfortable in India. “I am a Tamil and I feel perfectly comfortable,” he said.“There is a certain politics prevalent in some parts of the world, very driven by a kind of vote bank consideration, driven by creating identity lobbies, actually pandering to them and stoking a certain attitude, and we don’t think that is a very healthy politics,” he said.“That kind of tokenism is very disruptive politics and so I would dispute the idea that that is an ideal to which we should all aspire. That is a model which we reject. Good politics is about treating your citizens equally,” he added.","The world is becoming increasingly multipolar with different centres of power, S Jaishankar said. “We see a president and an administration moving towards multipolarity and that is something which suits India,” he said.

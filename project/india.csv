NEW DELHI: Indian students on Thursday protested outside the Oxford Union in the United Kingdom over a debate titled 'this house believes in the independent state of Kashmir.'The debate, hosted by the Oxford Union, Oxford University's debating society, contested the political status of Kashmir, a region historically disputed by India and Pakistan.The protest was held against the Oxford Union's selection of panelists. The panel for the motion included Dr. Muzzamil Ayyub Thakur, a Kashmiri leading the Justice Foundation and the Kashmir Freedom Movement, who opposed Indian control of Kashmir, Professor Zafar Khan, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Diplomatic Bureau.Speakers against the motion were Prem Shankar Jha, former media advisor to former Prime Minister V P Jha with experience at the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Hindustan Times, Yusuf Kundgol and Siddhant Nagrath.The Oxford Union, in an Instagram post, wrote, ""The Kashmir question, a parting gift of British colonial rule, has troubled the subcontinent since 1947 resulting in multiple wars. The continued push for Kashmiri independence has sustained a long-standing struggle, rooted in the region’s quest for self-determination and autonomy. This has led to persistent unrest, human rights concerns, and renewed demand for autonomy among the Kashmiris. While nuclear-armed neighbours vie for control and geopolitical influence, the desire for peace among the population remains strong. Could an independent Kashmir be the answer to this enduring crisis?""INSIGHT UK, a British Hindu group, formally objected to the debate. In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), they wrote, “We have sent a formal letter to Oxford Union expressing deep concerns over their decision to host the debate. The invitation of speakers with alleged links to terrorism is particularly alarming and raises serious questions about the integrity of this debate.”","Indian students protest outside Oxford Union over debate titled 'this house believes in the independent state of Kashmir' The debate contested the political status of Kashmir, a region historically disputed by India and Pakistan.

Cash-starved civic bodies struggle to take up public works; generate only 32% revenue from own sources: CAG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-starved-civic-bodies-struggle-to-take-up-public-works-generate-only-32-revenue-from-own-sources-cag/articleshow/115319029.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Multiple audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General have revealed that urban local bodies (ULBs) across states are struggling with weak financial management, generating only 32% of their revenue from internal sources. This heavy reliance on Union and state govt funding has left ULBs in a state of persistent financial crisis. On average, only 29% of current expenditures by ULBs is allocated to development works and implementation of civic programmes.These findings have been highlighted in the Compendium of Performance Audits on the implementation of the 74th Constitutional Amendment by the CAG in 393 ULBs across 18 states, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu between 2014 and 2021. The landmark amendment of 1992 gave constitutional status to these self-govt entities and had laid down the provisions for devolution of 18 functions — including urban planning, regulation of land use and construction, water supply, planning for economic and social development and public health — to the urban local bodies.The auditor has highlighted that the states had shown weak compliance with the “in-spirit reading” of the amendment and only four of the functions devolved to urban local bodies were with “complete autonomy” even 30 years after the law came into force.As per the compendium, which was released this week, the federal auditor observed unrealistic budgeting across the ULBs in 13 states, with maximum budget variance of 403% in receipts and a high 274% budget variance in expenditure in Himachal Pradesh. The other states that have high variance include Odisha, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana.The CAG has also found that in 11 states, civic bodies were facing a 42% gap between their own revenue and expenditure. It said the ULBs are largely dependent on grants as they are unable to generate adequate funds. On average, grants constituted about 56% of the total revenue of the 17 states analysed by the CAG. It found that the share of grants to the total municipal revenue of states such as Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Tripura has been more than 85%. “A higher share of municipal own revenue can make a significant impact on the financial sustainability of ULSGs (read ULBs),” it said.As per the report though property tax on land and buildings is the mainstay of ULBs own revenue, the audit observed that while municipal laws have authorised these entities to collect taxes like property tax, powers pertaining to the fixation of rates and revision, the procedure of collection, method of assessment, exemptions and concessions are vested with state govts. They also have limited autonomy over profession tax, water charge, solid waste management cess/ charge and entertainment tax.“The lack of complete autonomy for ULSGs with respect to taxes and user charges limits their ability to adequately raise revenues commensurate with the cost of operations and maintenance,” it said.The report mentioned that limited financial autonomy and weak financial management of UBLs appear to result in low fund utilisation and on average, ULBs in 11 states have utilised only 61% of the funds made available to them, potentially impacting municipal service delivery.“The CAG’s compendium is a very timely reminder to us of the urgency to strengthen urban local governments. Hopefully these audit reports which have been placed in state legislative assemblies will finally make the agenda of decentralisation politically salient, in a positive way. Our cities cannot be effectively governed by state governments and parastatals alone. ULSGs are our first mile govt. Globally too, no city in the world offers ease of living and ease of doing business without autonomy and empowerment,” said Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO of Janaagraha, an NGO working on urban governance.","Only 29% of current expenditures by ULBs is allocated to development works.

"‘When seen from space, there’s a sense that Earth is everything we have’: Booker winner",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-seen-from-space-theres-a-sense-that-earth-is-everything-we-have-booker-winner/articleshow/115318703.cms,"Samantha Harvey

Our lives here are inexpressibly trivial and momentous at once, it seems he’s about to wake up and say. Both repetitive and unprecedented. We matter greatly and not at all.”Thus goes one of the lines in Samantha Harvey ’s Booker Prize winning novel ‘Orbital’, a fictional story about six astronauts in the International Space Station (ISS) that is peppered with hope and wonder for our home planet, along with solemn takes on conflicts and human-led struggles for power. In a conversation with Jaya Bhattacharji Rose for the TOI Bookmark podcast, the British author spoke about the process of stringing together the prose, which almost appears to be an ode to life on earth.“When you look at the Earth from low Earth orbit, you can’t see the entirety of the Earth. You can just see a flank of it. You can see the atmosphere and the stars… There seems to be a kind of tenderness somehow about the view of it from low Earth orbit. There’s a sense that this is our home, this is everything we have, that it’s real, and it’s something to be protected,” Harvey said.The writer, who has previously been shortlisted for the James State Black Award, the Women’s Prize, the Guardian First Book Award, and the Walter Scott Prize, also highlighted the research that went into adding the visual details about Earth as seen by the astronauts. From following immersive ISS’ live transits of the Earth to pouring over images captured by lunar astronauts — all were key to building a fictional world that almost seems like a painting. Bringing together different aspects of science and engineering, including astronomy and physics, didn’t come easy, Harvey admitted, adding that she began to feel confident once the process of “alchemising” them all into prose began.Was it disorienting to juggle these images, and then come back to the physical reality of her surroundings? In response to the question, Harvey highlighted the symbiotic link between the two. “You look at these images for hours and then you look out of your window at the garden and it’s a strange jolt of reality… it seems that the continents themselves are gardens,” she said. Interestingly, Harvey has no social media accounts, and has admitted in the past that she doesn’t own a mobile phone either.Harvey, a student of philosophy, has often drawn from her the field to dwell upon questions about human existence — both big and small — in her fiction. Her debut novel, ‘The Wilderness’, is written from the point of view of a man struggling to hold on to his personal memories as Alzheimer’s takes over, while her second novel, ‘All Is Song’, deals with themes of moral and filial duty, and about the choice between questioning and conforming. ‘Orbital’, on the other hand, deals with themes of how miniscule human-made conflicts can appear in the larger scheme of things, albeit from a perspective that’s centred miles away. One of the discoveries that fascinated her the most, the author said, was the existence of a well-lit border between India and Pakistan, one of the few that can be sighted from space at night.“During day time, you can’t see any borders at all, except natural borders of land and sea. But by night, the border between these two countries can be seen. Even then, the filigree of those lights is delicate and seems so harmless… That is the friendliness of the planet. It’s quite difficult to reconcile the knowledge of the conflict with the fact of what you’re seeing.”","Samantha Harvey has won the Booker Prize for her novel ‘Orbital’ It is a fictional story about six astronauts in the International Space Station.

More than a year after the National Dental Commission Act was passed in Aug 2023 and nearly eight months after the rules for implementing it were notified in March 2024, the commission itself is yet to be constituted. The Dental Council of India (DCI) has written to the health ministry seeking its intervention as the tenures of the council’s president and vice president are coming to an end.The letter to the health secretary dated Nov 13 pointed out that the DCI was still working as per the Dentists Act, 1948 to regulate dental education in the country. The council regulates 323 dental colleges with over 27,600 BDS seats and over 280 colleges with 7,000 post graduate seats.The current president of the DCI, Dr Dibyendu Mazumder, will complete his five-year membership term on Nov 28 and that of the current vice-president, Dr Satheesh Kumar Reddy is set to expire on Dec 10. As per the existing law, the two will continue on an extended term of six months from the date of completion of their membership term.The letter pointed out that “as per the directives of the ministry vide its letter dated Dec 26, 2023, the Council has been restrained from entertaining any new membership and accordingly a circular was issued to all constituencies to not nominate/elect new members under section 3 of the Dentists Act, 1948”.“The executive committee of the DCI under chairmanship of president is the main technical body which looks after the primary work of the council to evaluate proposals and applications of dental colleges and make appropriate recommendations to the central govt. The DCI Regulations, 1956 provides various key administrative powers to the president of the council for smooth functioning of the council,” stated the letter.The letter stated that the DCI office would soon become headless on completion of tenure of the president and that it would not be possible to run the office smoothly. It urged the central govt to entrust the charge of president to any DCI member until the commission is formed or give the necessary directions to ensure uninterrupted functioning of the DCI during the transition period.","The Dental Council of India (DCI) has written to the health ministry seeking its intervention.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday will set off the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Birsa Munda from a public outreach programme in Bihar’s Jamui, days ahead of the Nov 20 second phase of assembly polls in the tribal hero’s home state, Jharkhand.Munda’s birth anniversary on Nov 15 is marked as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas since 2021 to recognise contributions of all tribal heroes and tribal communities, especially in India’s freedom struggle.During the programme in Jamui, which comes amid model code of conduct being in effect in Jharkhand, preventing announcements and launches, the PM will also be inaugurating and laying foundation stone of development projects worth Rs 6,640 crore focused on infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood generation in tribal regions.Last year, PM Modi had visited Munda’s birthplace — Ulihatu village in Jharkhand’s Khunti — & launched Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyay Maha Abhiyan for particularly vulnerable tribal communities and set off Viksit Bharat Abhiyan.Meanwhile, in her message for Janjatiya Gaurav Divas, Prez Droupadi Murmu said she has observed that a new consciousness is being spread across country for tribal pride and the ideals of the Constitution. “This consciousness is being transformed into action. This spirit will become the foundation of the bright future of the country, including the tribal society,” she said.Opportunities for economic development are increasing for tribal communities and the present govt is taking forward the journey of tribal development and welfare at a fast pace, she added. “Our country will become truly developed only when our tribal people also become developed. Fast-paced progress of people of tribal communities is our national priority,” she said.","Munda’s birth anniversary on Nov 15 is marked as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas since 2021 to recognise contributions of all tribal heroes and tribal communities.

BAKU: Giving much needed talking points around nature and quality of new post-2025 climate finance at UN climate conference, an independent high-level expert group on the issue on Thursday suggested that negotiations should be focused on mobilising $1 trillion per year by 2030 in “external (public and private) finance from all sources” for investments in emerging market and developing countries (EMDCs), other than China, and about $1.3 trillion by 2035 to deliver the Paris Agreement goals . It also argued that private finance can meet about half of these needs given the changing nature of investment opportunities.Simply put, the investment needed from external sources for climate action would just be 1% of annual global GDP ($100 trillion) and only half of global defence spending ($2.4 trillion). Observers, who are following the negotiations, believe that the post-2025 climate finance goal will probably be around that figure as it likely matches the annual figure of $1.3 trillion calculated by developing countries. The share of public and private finance in the overall bouquet will, however, be a big sticking point.The 33-member independent group, tasked by the presidencies to help develop and put forward policy options and recommendations to encourage and enable the public and private investment and finance necessary for delivery of the commitments and targets of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, also pitched for mobilising the finance at the earliest to save costs.One of the lead authors of the expert group report and its co-chair, Amar Bhattacharya, however, emphasised that bulk of investment for climate action would, in any case, be domestic finance. “Different kinds of investment need different kinds of finance... Largest in terms of amount is for energy transition. It is also clear that a lot of that investment would come from the private sector,” said Bhattacharya.The report, released on sidelines of COP29 Thursday, estimates that global projected investment (both external and domestic) requirement for climate action is around $6.3–6.7 trillion per year by 2030, of which $2.7–2.8 trillion is in advanced economies, $1.3-$1.4 trillion in China, and $2.3-2.5 trillion in EMDCs other than China.""For 2035, we estimate global investment requirements for climate action to be around $7–8.1 trillion per year, with advanced economies needing $2.6–3.1 trillion, China $1.3–1.5 trillion, and EMDCs other than China requiring $3.1–3.5 trillion. These needs are our estimations of what is required for delivery on the Paris Agreement, and the investments will also make a vital contribution to sustainable growth and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,"" said the authors in the report.They said, ""External finance from all sources, international public and private, along with others, will need to cover $1 trillion per year of the total investment needed by 2030 and around $1.3 trillion by 2035. We argue that cross-border private finance can meet about half of these needs given the changing nature of investment opportunities.”","An independent high-level expert group on the issue on Thursday suggested that negotiations should be focused on mobilising $1 trillion per year by 2030.

If we admit this petition, it’ll open floodgates: SC

NEW DELHI: After passing pan-India directions to police to act suo motu against those making hate speeches and harming the social fabric, Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a petition seeking similar action to arrest the trend of seditious speeches openly encouraging anarchy and separatism.A PIL by ‘ Hindu Sena Samiti ’ before a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar had sought SC’s urgent intervention to prevent what it called the growing menace of political leaders , especially those from the opposition, making allegedly provocative public speeches and giving media interviews “prejudicial to national integrity and openly extending threats to the security of the state”.“Members of different political parties, prominent leaders from the opposition, spokespersons and members of organisations have been making public assertions for creation of conditions for secession akin to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, calling for resorting to subversive activities and armed rebellion,” the PIL said.However, SC said that “there is a striking difference between hate speech and wrong or false assertions or false claims made by people.”The CJI Khanna-led bench said, “SC had entertained pleas for curbing hate speech as that was harming social harmony . Guidelines have been laid and the court has issued contempt notices for violation of guidelines. What you want is very wide. You have gone all over the place. If we entertain this petition, there will be a flood of such petitions and it will become impossible to deal with the issue.”The bench dismissed the PIL saying it could not entertain it. “In case the petitioner has any specific grievance, it can approach the appropriate forum,” it added. SC in April 2023 had given pan-India sway to its Oct 2022 order directing Delhi, UP, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand police to take suo motu action against those making hate speeches irrespective of the religious community they belonged to.The court had warned that any hesitation on part of state police to act against hate speech will be viewed as contempt of SC and appropriate action will be taken against erring officers.“Hate speech is a serious offence affecting the fabric of the nation and goes to the heart of our republic and about dignity of people. What we have in our mind is a larger public good and are trying to ensure establishment of rule of law so that things do not go out of our hands,” an SC bench of Justices K M Joseph and B V Nagarathna had said in April last year.",Supreme Court refuses to entertain a petition seeking similar action to arrest the trend of seditious speeches openly encouraging anarchy and separatism.

They have made my job easier when I see them bat like that.""Tilak Varma was the star of the match, playing a sensational knock of 107 off 56 balls, guiding India to a formidable total of 219/6. Varma's blistering century included eight fours and seven sixes. His innings came after a personal request to the skipper to bat at No. 3. Suryakumar revealed, ""He [Tilak] came to my room at Gqeberha and said, 'Give me a chance at No. 3, I want to do well,' and I said, 'Go out there and express yourself.' He asked for it and he delivered.""Abhishek Sharma also contributed with a quick-fire 50 off 25 balls, but the rest of India's batting lineup faltered as South Africa's Andile Simelane and Keshav Maharaj took two wickets each.South Africa's chase was powered by Marco Jansen 's explosive 54 off 17 balls and Heinrich Klaasen's 41 from 22, keeping the Proteas in the game. But India's bowlers, led by Arshdeep Singh , held their nerve. Arshdeep picked up three crucial wickets and restricted South Africa in the death overs, while Varun Chakaravarthy claimed two wickets, sealing India's victory.Tilak Varma was named Player of the Match for his exceptional performance, and Suryakumar couldn't be prouder of the youngster.

BJP condemns Kanhaiya's remarks

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis , and his wife, Amruta. The remarks, made during a rally in Nagpur on Wednesday, have drawn sharp condemnation from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Kanhaiya, while addressing the crowd, took aim at Fadnavis' recent comments referring to the upcoming elections as a ""Dharamyudh"", suggesting that the protection of religion should be a collective effort. He said that the job of ""saving religion"" should not be reduced to political rhetoric while the Deputy CM’s wife engages in ""making Instagram reels.""""Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that this is a 'Dharamyudh'. This is a good thing. It is our Dharam to protect the democracy and the constitution for which I am standing and giving a speech today. Whichever leader talks about saving religion, you have to ask only one thing to that leader who is giving you speech about saving religion that will your son or daughter join us in this fight to save religion?"" he questioned.""Will this happen that the responsibility of saving the religion will be ours and your children will study in Oxford Cambridge universities. If we want to save religion, let us save it together. It can't be like we save religion and the deputy chief minister's wife makes reels on Instagram. It can't be like that. Everyone will save the religion together,"" Kanhaiya added.The remarks were a direct response to Fadnavis' recent statement during his campaign for Mahayuti candidates, where he had called for a ""Dharma-Yuddha"" to counter what he described as ""vote-jihad"" in the state.The BJP was quick to condemn Kanhaiya Kumar’s comments, with party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla leading the charge. Poonawalla labelled Kanhaiya as a ""Naxali Afzal Guru supporter"" and accused him of disrespecting Marathi women by targeting""How dare you insult a daughter of Maharashtra, Kanhaiya Kumar? Your words are an insult to every Marathi woman,"" Poonawalla wrote on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). ""Amruta Fadnavis is a proud daughter of Maharashtra, and those who use such derogatory language will face the consequences from the people of Maharashtra.""Poonawalla's statement referred to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant's statement who in late October faced backlash for calling Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC ""imported maal"" during the Maharashtra Assembly election campaign. In his defence, Sawant denied mentioning Shaina’s name, clarifying, ""I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here."" He emphasised respect for Shaina, calling her a friend.The Maharashtra assembly elections are set for November 20, with the counting of votes scheduled for November 23. In the 2019 state elections, the BJP secured 105 seats, while the Shiv Sena won 56, and Congress claimed 44 seats, out of 288. However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the MVA coalition saw a strong showing, winning 30 of the 48 available seats, while the Mahayuti could only secure 17.","Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis.

5.6 lakh Indians migrated to rich OECD countries in 2022,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-6-lakh-indians-migrated-to-rich-oecd-countries-in-2022/articleshow/115315069.cms,"Representative photo

Citizenship Trends:

MUMBAI: Each year, Indians continue their journey overseas, with many drawn to rich nations like the US, UK, and Canada — countries within the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that have historically opened doors to them. Whether as new immigrants, international students, or those acquiring citizenship, Indians dominate the charts in immigration flows to OECD nations. However, recent protectionist policies hint that the open path may be narrowing.2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries — a substantial 35% jump over the previous year. India maintained its lead as the top source of new migrants, with China following at 3.2 lakh. Indians made up 6.4% of all new immigrants to OECD countries, while China contributed 3.8%.A notable shift was Russia’s rise in the migration ranks. With 2.6 lakh Russians migrating to OECD nations in 2022, Russia surged from 18th place to displace Romania.The International Migration Outlook 2024, released on Thursday in Paris, detailed these shifts. In 2022, the UK welcomed 1.12 lakh Indians, nearly double the figure from 2021, while 1.25 lakh Indians migrated to the US, marking a 35% increase. Canada, however, saw a dip with 1.18 lakh Indians, an 8% decline from the previous year. In these countries, Indians predominantly migrated through labour pathways, often as principal applicants or as accompanied family members.China, too, resumed significant migration following two years of Covid-related restrictions. In 2022, over three lakh Chinese immigrants to OECD member countries, up 13% from the previous year. Particularly in the US, migration flows from China jumped by 37%, returning to pre-pandemic levels with 68,000 new arrivals.Russia and Romania, which contributed 2.7 lakh new immigrants each, were the next top origin countries. Meanwhile, Türkiye, Israel, and Germany emerged as the primary OECD destinations for Russian migrants. Romanians, on the other hand, largely headed to Germany, Spain, and Italy.Yet, the welcome for new immigrants is visibly less enthusiastic. Under the incoming Trump administration, immigration to the US may face tighter scrutiny, including on work visas. Canada, too, recently announced a planned cut in immigration targets for the next three years, and the UK has introduced protectionist policies, such as raising wage thresholds and reducing the list of shortage occupations.In 2022, over 1.9 lakh Indians took the nationality of an OECD country, marking a 40% increase and securing India’s place as the top origin country for new OECD citizens. This record was largely driven by a threefold increase in Indians acquiring Canadian citizenship, totalling 60,000. The report anticipates a further rise in 2023.Syria ranked second in 2022, with 1.34 lakh nationals gaining OECD citizenship—a 28% increase from 2021—followed by Morocco, with 1.21 lakh Moroccan nationals becoming citizens in Spain, Italy, and France. Mexicans largely acquired American citizenship, in 2022 their numbers dipped slightly.","2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Police said on Thursday that it had arrested an Indo-Canadian man, Rajinder Kumar, in connection with the murder of a Khalistan supporter named Rabinder Singh Malhi.The killing, which yet again amplified the tension between the two communities in Canada, was reported in Ontario on Nov 9.Police also arrested Kumar’s wife, Sheetal Verma, on charges of obstruction of justiceThe local police have not yet revealed the motive behind the murder but stated that Kumar and Malhi were acquainted with each other. However, what has raised questions and made the issue murky is the involvement of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) in the case which has been insisting that “Hindutva elements” were involved in the killing. Others have called the arrest motivated, alleging that Kumar was held as part of Trudeau regime’s policy to appease Khalistanis.SFJ chief and pro-Khalistan terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun claimed on Wednesday that Kumar had been involved in heated exchanges with Malhi on WhatsApp after a Hindu Sabha temple priest, Rajinder Parsad, made inflammatory calls for violence on Nov 3. “The verbal argument on the group culminated in Kumar luring Malhi to his home and fatally stabbing him in a premeditated attack,” Pannun said, while insisting that Canadian Police should also have arrested Parsad.Malhi (52), a resident of Brampton, was found injured at a residence on Deer Ridge Trail, north of Highway 410 and Hurontario Street, around 10pm on Nov 9, according to local media reports.On Wednesday, Peel Regional Police announced the arrest of two persons, Rajinder Kumar (47) and Sheetal Verma (35), both of Caledon. Kumar has been charged with second-degree murder, while Verma is facing a charge of obstruction of justice. Kumar is in custody and scheduled to appear before the Ontario Court of Justice in Orangeville on Nov 18.Meanwhile, a video posted on X by a Canadian journalist has led to an uproar on social media showing a group of Khalistani elements marching around Surrey BC and shouting slogans such as “we are the owners of Canada”, “Canada is Khalistan” and “white people should go back to Europe and Israel”. The sloganeering attracted a sharp response from Canadian citizens who questioned how such elements were being allowed to frame policies in their country. People have tagged Canadian Police demanding action.",Khalistan supporter Rabinder Singh Malhi was killed in Ontario on Nov 9.

DEHRADUN: Members of a right-wing group scaled the boundary wall of a prestigious residential school in Dehradun and demolished a structure that they claimed was a mazaar that was being built inside the campus.The group, claiming they took permission from govt officials to raze the structure, also streamed the act live on social media on Wednesday evening. Even as the group’s members justified their action, the episode has put in focus the security breach at the school, where children of a number of prominent personalities study.The Dehradun district administration denied issuing any orders for the structure’s demolition. “Our team visited the site when we were informed about the incident. After speaking to locals, it was clear that the structure was on the school’s campus. The administration, however, had no role in its destruction. We have taken steps to ensure law and order remains unaffected by the incident,” DM Savin Bansal said.Radha Dhoni, president of Sanatan Sanskriti , the organisation responsible for the act, claimed that the ‘mazaar’ was recently built on the campus of the school, and was “violating the chief minister’s orders prohibiting religious structures in public institutions”.Dhoni told TOI, “When we approached the school authorities, they claimed it was an old structure, previously damaged during civic work, and that they were simply repairing it. But it was clearly newly built, just a few days old. I could see the site from my home’s terrace across the road. The construction had started only recently. It was unmistakably a grave-like structure for prayers, resembling a mazaar. Why was this allowed on the school campus? And when we questioned them, the school staff wouldn’t even let us enter.”Though the act has raised serious questions about security at the elite boarding school, officials said the school has not filed a formal complaint.","Right-wing group claims they took permission from govt officials to raze the structure.

He, however, added that Adani hosted the dinner but “was not participating in the political discussions.”Pawar Senior made these remarks in an interview with The News Minute-Newslaundry . He said that apart from him, those present were Adani, Amit Shah , and Ajit Pawar. The power-sharing talks took place before Ajit Pawar’s early morning swearing-in as deputy chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis as CM, to form a govt that lasted barely 80 hours.Pawar Senior was quoted by the news portal as saying that his NCP colleagues, many of whom faced cases from Central agencies, told him they had been assured that if they joined hands with BJP, the cases would go away. Pawar, according to the report, said he pushed back as he was not convinced that BJP would keep its promise, but his colleagues said “why not hear it from the horse’s mouth” and that was how he found himself at a dinner at Adani’s residence, with Amit Shah present.Referring to the meeting, Ajit Pawar had said, “It has been five years, everyone knows where the meeting happened, it was in Delhi at a businessman’s house, everyone knows it. Yes, there were five meetings… Amit Shah was there, Gautam Adani was there, Praful Patel was there, Devendra Fadnavis was there, Ajit Pawar was there, Pawar Saheb was there… All were there... Everything was decided.” He had further said, “Blame for it has fallen on me, and I have taken it. I took blame and made others safe.”When he was asked why Pawar Senior had later hesitated and not gone with BJP, Ajit had said he didn’t know. “Pawar Saheb is a leader whose mind no one in the world can read. Not even our aunty (Sharad Pawar’s wife Pratibha) or our Supriya (Sule),” he had said.Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar on Thursday visited Chinchwad assembly constituency in Pune district to campaign for his party’s candidate, Rahul Kalate, who is contesting against BJP’s Shankar Jagtap in the Maharashtra elections on Nov 20.

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has announced the implementation of GRAP 3 (Graded Response Action Plan) in Delhi NCR starting tomorrow from 8am as air quality deteriorates to the 'severe' category.The central body said that unfavorable meteorological conditions, including dense fog condition and North-Westerly winds moving the pollutants to Delhi are the major causes for sudden spike in AQI.The GRAP comprises specific measures to tackle deteriorating air quality in Delhi and NCR regions. GRAP is announced when Air Quality Index (AQI) reaches 'severe' category, implementing various limitations on activities that contribute to pollution in addition to the restrictions implemented under GRAP 1 and 2.1. A complete halt on construction and demolition activities, along with suspension of non-essential mining operations.2. Restrictions on interstate buses that are not electric, CNG-powered or BS-VI diesel compliant.3. Educational institutions at primary level will shift to virtual learning platforms.4. Water sprinkling operations on roadways.Delhi chief minister Atishi announced that all primary schools in Delhi will be shifting to online classes due to rising pollution levels until further directions.Additionally, petrol vehicles from the older emission norms BS-III and diesel vehicles of BS-IV category are not allowed on the roads in Delhi and parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) such as Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, and Gautam Budh Nagar.Meanwhile, Delhi Metro Rail Corporations (DMRC) announced that 20 extra trips will be inducted into services on weekdays starting tomorrow from 8 am after the announcement of GRAP 3.

AGRA: A bride walked out of her wedding after the groom refused to perform the main rituals unless his demand for Rs 30 lakh dowry was met at the venue. Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride’s father, a sub-inspector posted in Ghaziabad.The dowry demand was allegedly made shortly after the groom’s party arrived and the garland exchange (varmala) ritual was performed. When the bride’s family expressed their inability to give such a huge amount, an argument ensued between the two parties.Realising that her knight in shining armour wasn’t what he had initially shown her to be, the bride refused to marry him, terming his actions unacceptable. Khandauli SHO Rakesh Singh Chauhan said a case under BNS section 352 (intention insult) and sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was registered against Ravi Kumar.“The groom was arrested, but released on bail later after being served a notice,” said SHO Chauhan.A member from bride’s side said, “Her father had already spent lakhs of rupees on the wedding. Also, household goods and other appliances worth several lakhs of rupees were given. Still, the groom demanded Rs 30 lakh in cash on the wedding night.”","Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride's father.

In the lead-up to

Jharkhand assembly elections

, BJP veteran and former CM

Babulal Marandi

spoke to TOI on key issues shaping the state’s political discourse. Excerpts:

BJP has emphasised the issue of alleged illegal immigration from Bangladesh in regions like Santhal Pargana and Kolhan. Do you think it will impact the polls?

But opposition parties say it is another polarisation ploy of BJP, similar to slogans like ‘batenge to katenge’ and ‘ek hain to safe hain’.

You were the first chief minister of Jharkhand. How do you assess the current situation in the state? Has the separation from Bihar helped the state?

BJP is contesting state polls under you for the first time. But you were out of the party for a long time. How has been the ‘ghar wapsi’ and are you in the race for the CM’s chair?

BJP has accused the

JMM-Congress alliance

of corruption. Do you think it is a factor in polls?

The opposition says that CM Hemant Soren’s arrest was politically motivated. It might harm BJP, by rousing tribal sentiment in favour of Soren.

Congress released its manifesto a day before the first phase of polls. Your reaction?

The demographic changes in Jharkhand, leading to the decline in tribal population, are alarming. From 1951 to 2011, we’ve seen a 10% decrease overall, and a 16% drop in Santhal Pargana.This issue resonates deeply with tribal communities, since it affects not just their cultural identity but also their political and land rights. BJP stands firm as the protector of these rights. The opposition did not just fail to address the issue, it even challenged legal directives for investigation and that speaks volumes about their stance or lack thereof.The call for unity should not be misconstrued as polarisation. Unity among any community, be it for political, social or cultural reasons, is a fundamental right and necessity. BJP advocates unity not to divide but to strengthen our resolve against any form of external influence that could dilute our cultural fabric. The selective outrage towards Hindu unity while ignoring attempts to consolidate other communities, is a confirmation of double standards.Bifurcation has undeniably been advantageous for Jharkhand. It has brought about political empowerment and a focused approach to development. The state has seen significant infrastructural growth, which was severely lacking under the combined governance with Bihar. This has not only uplifted Jharkhand but also influenced development in surrounding regions.Returning to BJP was like coming back to family; despite my absence, the party embraced me with open arms. I was given significant responsibilities, reflecting the trust in me. My aim is to make BJP win, not to fulfil personal political ambitions.Corruption is undoubtedly a central issue in these elections. People are tired of a govt riddled with corruption at every level. The electoral trend so far suggests a yearning for change, which corruption certainly seems to fuel.The arrest was based on corruption charges, not political vendetta. The evidence, including significant cash recoveries and financial irregularities, supports this.The timing and location of the manifesto’s release by Congress seem designed for maximum media attention and possibly to provoke BJP into a reaction. This strategic move, while within the legal bounds, breaches the norms of ethical campaigning, potentially exploiting the model code of conduct for political gains.","Babulal Marandi is a BJP veteran and former chief minister of Jharkhand.

AIZWAL/GUWAHATI: Tribal groups upped the ante Thursday for the bodies of 10 Hmar “militants” killed by forces in Manipur’s Jiribam to be taken back from Silchar Medical College in south Assam’s Cachar to their native village through Mizoram, where their Kuki-Zo brethren intend to honour them as “fallen heroes”.Uncertainty over when the bodies would be handed to their families and how they would be ferried to Manipur added to the restiveness of protesters milling outside the medical college since the previous afternoon, alleging a deliberate delay in completing autopsies on the slain men.Sources said the autopsy process ended Wednesday evening, but Manipur Police was now insisting on “DNA matching” before handing over the bodies to their kin.“Matching the DNA of a deceased with his or her relatives is not part of any post-mortem formality unless the body is beyond identification,” said a former director of health and medical education in Mizoram.Unconfirmed reports said the authorities were planning to take the bodies of the deceased, who the Hmar community claims were “village volunteers” from Jakhradawr in Jiribam, to Manipur’s Churachandpur by helicopter.Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum issued a statement, saying any attempt to bypass Mizoram while taking the bodies to Manipur would be resisted. “Following talks, it was decided the martyrs must be transported by road through Mizoram and then to Lamka via Tipaimukh. Any other transportation modes won’t be accepted.”","10 Hmar ""militants"" killed by forces in Manipur’s Jiribam. Protesters allege a deliberate delay in completing autopsies on the slain men.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has dismissed a plea by a man challenging his arrest and prosecution in a case related to the March 2023 protests by Khalistani groups at the Indian high commission in London. The protesters had shouted anti-India and pro-Khalistani slogans, and pulled down the Indian flag, with some trying to tear it.Inder Pal Singh Gaba of Hounslow in UK was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on April 25 this year while entering India through the Attari border in Punjab. Booked under the stringent UAPA and other laws, Gaba had contended in his plea he was not given a copy of the FIR, making his arrest unlawful.HC found no infirmity in the trial court’s remand orders allowing NIA Gaba’s custody. “The contention of the counsel for the petitioner (Gaba) that non-furnishing of the FIR would be fatal cannot be accepted because, as rightly pointed out by the additional solicitor-general (ASG), CrPC and UAPA do not mandate a copy of the FIR to be supplied by the investigating officer to any other person other than the complainant,” said Justice Subramonium Prasad.The HC said Gaba was arrested and produced before a magistrate the same day. A copy of the remand application was supplied to him, containing both the reasons and grounds of arrest.“The safeguard enshrined under Article 22(1) of the Constitution has been followed and the impugned remand orders do not contain any infirmity,” the HC said.The Indian flag was targeted in the protests on March 19. NIA said audio-video evidence showed Gaba’s presence and active involvement in the protests on March 22. He was seen raising anti-India slogans , associating with key protest organisers, and engaging in activities that undermined the sovereignty of India. A lookout circular was issued against Gaba on Dec 9 last year. Attari immigration officials had detained him and seized his passport, subsequently handing him over to NIA.","Inder Pal Singh Gaba of Hounslow in UK was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on April 25 this year while entering India through the Attari border in Punjab.

BENGALURU: Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy emphasised Thursday need for India to reclaim its historical prominence in scientific innovation , saying invaders and colonisers scuttled Indian science for almost a thousand years from 1000 to 1947 and youths were “held back in pursuits” of critical & analytical thinking, invention and innovation.Murthy made the observation during a virtual address at the announcement ceremony for 2024 Infosys Science Prizes . “In Israel, we learned to appreciate our greatest national advantage: Our minds.

Thus, youth were held back in their pursuits of these areas, including observation of nature, curiosity, inferencing, critical and analytical thinking, invention and innovation, and problem definition & problem-solving.”He said the drive to revive power of STEM to solve the nation’s problems began after Independence, though the task remains a significant challenge.",Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy emphasised the need for India to reclaim its historical prominence in scientific innovation.

NEW DELHI: Within weeks of the Madras high court validating the Enforcement Directorate ’s money laundering probe against India’s biggest political donor Santiago Martin , better known as ‘lottery king’, the agency on Thursday carried out searches at 20 premises of the accused and his associates across Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Haryana and Punjab.Martin and his company had donated Rs 1,368 crore of electoral bonds to different political parties.The searches were carried out at the premises of Martin and his close family members in Chennai and Coimbatore and at other associates in Faridabad, Ludhiana and Kolkata as the agency probes the ‘proceeds of crime’ generated from illegal distribution and sale of lotteries.The money laundering probe had come to a halt after the Tamil Nadu police withdrew its FIR, which was the basis for the ED to register its investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The Supreme Court, too, had later ruled that though the ED is free to challenge the withdrawal of the FIR, but in absence of a predicate offence, the PMLA probe cannot be continued against the accused.The agency then moved the Madras HC, which in an Oct 28 judgement ruled that the withdrawal of the corruption case , “predicate offence” in ED’s parlance, was illegal and validated ED’s case under the PMLA while also asking the state authorities to revive the corruption case.Martin and his Future Gaming and Hotel Services (P) Ltd are accused of committing fraud in distribution of lotteries in Sikkim. After a search operation in Chennai and Coimbatore in May last year, the anti-money laundering agency had claimed that Santiago Martin and his family allegedly made “unlawful gain” of more than Rs 900 crore, which was a loss to the Sikkim government.Soon after the last year’s searches, the ED had seized assets and bank deposits of the accused worth Rs 457 crore in connection with the lottery scam during the 2009-10 period. The agency had then said that Martin’s Coimbatore-based Future Gaming, the master distributor of Sikkim Lotteries in Kerala, made illegal gains by allegedly inflating the prize-winning tickets. The seized assets included Rs 158 crore in fixed deposits and mutual funds, and Rs 299 crore worth of properties.","Martin and his company had donated Rs 1,368 crore of electoral bonds to different political parties.

NEW DELHI: With Canada reported to have arrested the de-facto chief of Khalistan Tiger Force , Arsh Singh Gill alias Arsh Dalla , the Indian govt said Thursday it will pursue his extradition and expressed hope he will be deported to face justice in India.Dalla, apparently an aide of slain Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , is among the 27 individuals whose extradition had been sought by India. Ottawa has blamed Indian govt agents for the killing of Nijjar.Canada’s CTV News reported on Wednesday that India-designated terrorist Dalla along with an associate had been arrested and charged in connection with a recent shooting in Ontario. He’s said to be awaiting a bail hearing. “In view of the recent arrest, our agencies will be following up on an extradition request,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Given Arsh Dalla’s criminal record in India and his involvement in similar illegal activities in Canada, it is expected that he will be extradited or deported to face justice in India,” said ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, acknowledging media reports circulating since Nov 10 about the Dalla’s arrest in Canada.Canadian print and television media have widely reported the arrest and the Ontario court has also listed the case for hearing. The Canadian govt had earlier refused to act on India’s request for his arrest.India has repeatedly stated that its main issue with Canada is the impunity enjoyed by Khalistan separatists targeting Indian interests. The official said that Dalla is a proclaimed offender in over 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion and terrorist acts, including terror financing .“In May 2022, a red corner notice was issued against him. Dalla was designated in India as an individual terrorist in 2023. In July 2023, Govt of India had requested the Canadian govt for his provisional arrest. This was declined. Additional information was provided in this case,” he said.According to MEA, a separate request was also sent to Canada under Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) to verify Dalla’s suspected residential address, his financial transactions to India, moveable/immovable properties, details of mobile numbers, etc — all of which were provided to Canadian authorities in Jan 2023.“In Dec 2023, the Department of Justice of Canada sought additional information on the case. A reply to these queries was sent in March this year,” said Jaiswal. India had sought Dalla’s extradition in Jan 23.","Canada declined India’s July 2023 request to arrest Dalla, says MEA.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday restored the ‘disturbed area’ status of six police stations across Manipur’s five districts — Imphal West, Imphal East, Jiribam, Kangpokpi and Bishnupur — under the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, amid the recent spurt in ethnic strife in these areas.The grounds cited were continuing “volatile situation” and “ongoing ethnic violence” in the state and “intermittent firing... with several instances of active participation of insurgent groups in heinous acts of violence”.The move to withdraw Afspa from Sekmai and Lamsang in Imphal West district; Lamlai in Imphal East district; Jiribam in Jiribam district; Leimakhong in Kangpokpi district; and Moirang in Bishnupur district is unusual in many ways.Firstly, this is the first time since Modi govt assumed office in 2014 that the area under Afspa within a state is being expanded; in fact, the area in the North-East under Afspa has remarkably shrunk over the past decade. Secondly, rather than Manipur govt which has been regularly issuing Afspa extension orders for the state, Centre chose this time to revisit the state govt’s notification.A home ministry official explained that Afspa grants concurrent powers to Centre and state govt to do so; and it helps that BJP is in office at both levels. Interestingly, all the areas where Afspa has been brought back are in the Valley, which is dominated by Meiteis. The move to reimpose Afspa in jurisdiction of six PS is also unusual as it comes midway through validity of the last notification, which was effective from Oct 1, 2024 to March 30, 2025. An officer said that a detailed assessment regarding Afspa applicability in Manipur, despite recurrent ethnic violence since May last year that has claimed around 230 lives so far, was not made earlier due to preoccupation of security agencies with restoring peace.“But with the ethnic violence failing to resolve, there was no option but to bring back Afspa in violence-prone areas to facilitate coordinated operations by the security forces, including the Army, and rein in armed miscreants active in ‘fringe’ areas,” an officer told TOI.",The Centre on Thursday restored the ‘disturbed area’ status of six police stations across Manipur’s five districts.

Congress can’t stand OBC like me being PM: Modi

Mumbai is a city of dreams, and Mahayuti will fulfil your dreams, said PM Modi in his last rally for the 2024 Maharashtra polls in Dadar, report Clara Lewis, Prasad Joshi & B B Nayak. He attacked Uddhav Thackeray, saying without naming his party that it had “given its remote control to the Congress”.Modi contrasted the character of the city with what he described as the nature of the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Mumbai was forward-looking and synonymous with development, and Mumbaikars were honest and hardworking, he said, but the MVA was corrupt. He said BJP and Mahayuti have seen a dream — to make Mumbai great. Addressing a mammoth crowd, Modi said, “Give me an opportunity to serve Maharashtra again.”PM Narendra Modi contrasted the character of Mumbai with what he described as the nature of MVA. Mumbai was forward-looking and synonymous with development, and Mumbaikars were honest and hardworking, he said, but MVA was corrupt. He said BJP and Mahayuti have seen a dream — to make Mumbai great. He said that in order to rid the city of connectivity problems, work on projects worth lakhs of crores such as Metro, airport, highways and bridges is happening rapidly.“For decades, Congress govt at the Centre and state did not bother to do forward planning, with the result that Mumbai started regressing. Congress’ signature is corruption, which pushed the country backward and created hurdles in the path of progress. They opposed the Atal Setu as well as the Metro,” he said, adding that while Mahayuti speaks of joining people, Congress speaks of “breaking” people.Addressing a mammoth crowd, Modi said, “I say it with responsibility and humility, aapke sapne hi hamare sankalp hain (Your dreams are our resolutions). Modi aapke sapnon ko jeeta hai, jagta hai unko pura karne ke liye (Modi lives your dreams, stays awake to fulfil them).”“Give me an opportunity to serve Maharashtra again. To fulfil your dreams, I need Mahayuti govt so there are no hindrances,” he added.Mumbai, he said, has for long suffered from terrorism, and people have not forgotten the wounds. “People would travel in fear in trains and buses, unsure if they will return home. In past many years, there is a sense of security. It was the same police but a different govt. Today there is Modi. You need to think why terror acts were regular. There would be announcements on abandoned bags & tiffins. Handlers of terrorists know if they do anything, Modi will not let them go scot free, will get them even from the ends of the world,” he said.He further said, “The Congress’ royal family hates Dalits and backward communities. They want to end SC, ST, OBC unity and cause fights within the communities. The SCs, STs, OBC unity will be destroyed by Congress once it comes to power. It will snatch away your reservation. ‘Ek hain toh safe hain (You are safe if you are one).”In Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Modi said Congress cannot tolerate an OBC like him being PM for the past 10 years. “Congress believed reservation was against the country. It considered reservation against merit. The party’s mentality and agenda remain unchanged,” he said.In Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, he accused Congress of deliberately keeping the poor in deprivation to maintain political control over them.","Mumbai is a city of dreams, and Mahayuti will fulfil your dreams, said PM Modi in his last rally for the 2024 Maharashtra polls in Dadar.

Midnight bullock cart races drive chaos across highways in western UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/midnight-bullock-cart-races-drive-chaos-across-highways-in-western-up/articleshow/115317237.cms,"HIGH STAKES: Organisers set cash prizes up to Rs 2.5 lakh fuelling rivalries

MEERUT : As the midnight hour casts shadows across the state highway to Garh Mukteshwar, an ancient tradition pushes modern boundaries, escalating from celebration to confrontation. Bullock cart races , held to celebrate Kartik Purnima , see rival villages from across the region clash in a frenzy of speed and pride. By day, the fairgrounds are teeming with pilgrims; by night, they’re punctuated by drumbeat of hooves and roars of bikes as bullock carts charge through the state highway — illegally, and often fatally.Despite a police ban, these races surge forward, drawing crowds and disrupting traffic on what would otherwise be a sleepy road. Here, bullocks are forced to race up to 40km at speeds as high as 80kmph, goaded with sharp rods and pointed sticks that inflict pain to propel them to peak pace. The stakes are high: organisers set cash prizes up to Rs 2.5 lakh, fuelling fierce rivalries. For some, it’s about preserving village pride; for others, the prize money is worth the risk to life and limb — both human and animal.“These races have been around for generations, but the aggression was never this extreme,” says Madan Pal from Naanpur near Meerut. “In the past, they used wooden rods; now, pointed sticks and spurs drive the animals. Earlier, link roads in rural belt were used; now, they have spilled over to state roads.” The consequences are tragic, with exhausted bulls collapsing mid-race and overturned carts injuring bystanders who gather to cheer their village champions.For animal rights advocates , the spectacle is an appalling display of cruelty. “Pointed rods jabbed at sensitive areas cause unbearable pain, pushing animals to run harder,” says Anshumali Vashishth of Animal Care Society. “The constant running shoots up their blood pressure to dangerous levels. Often, we get calls to rescue animals, but the aggression on these roads makes it hard even to pass with an ambulance.”Meanwhile, the police remain on high alert, though enforcement is no easy task. “We urge villagers to stop these races and have taken action against violators with a larger force deployed this year and continuous patrolling,” says IG (Meerut Range) Nachiketa Jha. “Our vigilance is all that keeps things from spiralling. Over the years, we’ve managed to curb this menace to a large extent,” adds Jha.Villagers, however, see the races as a test of endurance and honour, with organisers setting routes, pooling prize money, and readying the animals for months ahead. “Our 28km race from Meerut to Hapur, which we completed in 1 hour, 28 minutes, was a matter of pride for village,” says Kale Naval, whose village emerged victorious in this year’s most intense competition. “It was a huge event, with over a thousand bikes riding alongside.”And in Bulandshahr, the passion takes on a more personal pride. Villagers feed their bulls a rich diet of ghee, milk, and gram, preparing them for the gruelling contest, even outfitting them with horseshoes for traction. Pauli Singh, a proud owner of a champion bull, boasts, “Raja is our village’s honour. No other bull can match his speed.”","Rival villages from across the region clash in a frenzy of speed and pride.

"First rhino born in Guwahati zoo in a decade, name game on",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-rhino-born-in-guwahati-zoo-in-a-decade-name-game-on/articleshow/115316926.cms,"It is the third rhino born at the zoo’s breeding centre after the birth of Pori in 2002 and Sanatan in 2013

GUWAHATI: Gaonburha & Pori became proud parents on Nov 7, and Guwahati zoo got its first baby rhino in a decade. For those who can’t get enough of the ball of wrinkled grey joy toddling around on stumpy legs, there’s now a call to help select a name for the playful calf.The name game, on Assam CM Himanta Sarma’s call, has sparked excitement and a variety of suggestions online — including Ratan, after industrialist-philanthropist Ratan Tata. Others making the rounds include Durga, Prachand, Priya, Bella, Goldie, a hip-hoppy “R-Zoo”, and one that has a streak of black humour running through it: “Nibonuwa” (meaning unemployed in Assamese). Officials said the name will be drawn through a lottery.Born to Gaonburha (meaning “village head”) and Pori (fairy), the calf represents a major milestone for the zoo’s conservation and breeding efforts. It is the third rhino born at the zoo’s breeding centre. Gaonburha, a slow-moving male, was rescued and brought to Guwahati from the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation at Kaziranga National Park in 2017. Thrilled by the new addition, zoo authorities underscored the challenges in breeding rhinos, including the unavailability of “breedable” pairs at the same time.“Before planning the birth of a rhino, bloodline of the parents has to be checked as mating within families is not possible,” said DFO Ashwini Kumar. “Also, the potential breeder rhinos might not be ready for mating at the same time. Keeping them together for a long time can be dangerous as it increases the risk of fights that can turn fatal. All these reasons have delayed the birth.” The zoo’s breeding centre first saw the birth of Pori in 2002, followed by Sanatan in 2013. The current birth, they hope, will continue to boost conservation efforts for the vulnerable species.Zoo veterinarian Dr Panchami Sharma described the care given to breeding pairs, ensuring they are provided a natural environment, complete with water bodies, grasslands, herbs, shrubs, and artificial showers. “The pairs are kept away from zoo visitors,” Sharma added.","Guwahati zoo got its first baby rhino in a decade on Nov 7.

NEW DELHI: In a move that could affect eye banks across India, government issued a directive making it mandatory for institutions responsible for collecting and processing donor corneas to have a minimum 100 collections in a year or they could risk losing licence to operate.India has 726 registered eye banks but, sources said, only 200 are operational. “Many eye banks are opened for govt aid or as a prerequisite to start PG courses in ophthalmology . But they aren’t maintained optimally,” the source added.The directive by National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation, the nodal agency for distribution of organs and tissues in the country, said state authorities should examine data on eye/cornea collection annually by registered eye banks and in case of less performance, they can consider issuing a warning notice to the eye bank for augmenting their eye donation activities.“... otherwise in case of under-performance their renewal may not be considered for the next term,” the order says.Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye. It allows light to enter and performs two-thirds of the focusing tasks. For people suffering from vision loss due to irreparable damage of the tissue, transplant is the only option.","India has 726 registered eye banks but, sources said, only 200 are operational.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday stayed a Jharkhand HC order directing CBI probe into an alleged recruitment scam in state assembly during tenures of various Speakers since 2003 & admitted a plea by Vidhan Sabha secretariat questioning legality of HC order.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan admitted the appeal of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and stayed HC’s Sept 23 order directing CBI probe into decades-old recruitment of assembly staffers after a brief argument from senior advocate Kapil Sibal.Appearing for petitioner S S Sharma, advocate Ardhendumouli Prasad told SC that HC bench had no option but to order CBI probe because of consistent non-cooperation from assembly secretariat to throw light on the scam and complete inaction on the fact-finding report on recruitment scam sent to the assembly in 2018 by then governor Droupadi Murmu , now the President of India.The petitioner claimed before HC that as many as 274 staffers were recruited during the tenure of Speaker Namdhari Singh, of which 70% allegedly belonged to one district. Similarly, during the tenure of Speaker Alamgir Alam, 324 more were allegedly recruited irregularly while it was alleged that arbitrary promotions were given to many during the tenure of Speaker S S Bhokta.In its appeal, assembly secretariat said, “HC erred in directing CBI to inquire into irregularity of appointments and promotions made in Vidhan Sabha, in absence of criminality or cognisable offence, that too in a civil matter...”",Supreme Court stays a Jharkhand HC order directing CBI probe into alleged recruitment scam in state assembly.

SHAMLI: A 20-year-old woman, Bhuriya Singh , was arrested for allegedly killing her 50-year-old father, Satyawan Singh, a month ago as she was against his attempts to sell their ancestral three-bigha land.Police said the victim was found dead outside his residence on Oct 15. They initially believed it was a natural death but Satyawan’s mother, 70, expressed suspicion that he was strangled by someone. Police sent the body for postmortem and the autopsy report confirmed death by strangulation. Following this, police registered a murder case in the matter and started a fresh investigation.During questioning of the family members, the accused gave inconsistent answers and eventually broke down and confessed to the crime. Officers said she confessed to strangling her father with a scarf, claiming that he constantly ill-treated her as she was against his attempts to sell the family land.Shamli superintendent of police (SP) Ramsevak Gautam said Bhuriya was arrested two days ago and sent to jail.","Bhuriya Singh, 20, was arrested for allegedly killing her 50-year-old father, Satyawan Singh, a month ago.

NEW DELHI: Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) is set to significantly bolster social science research in India through expanded funding and inclusivity. With a projected budget of Rs 235 crore for the current financial year (excluding UG and PG research projects), ICSSR plans to support studies focused on vulnerable indigenous tribes, women-led research initiatives , and college and university student-led projects. The selected projects are expected to be announced by Jan next year.Under Centre’s new directive, ICSSR will take a multi-pronged approach, including research on particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) in India, longitudinal studies, and projects specifically for women scholars. PVTG studies, scheduled to begin early next year, aim to create a detailed database to inform research and policy and to document social, cultural, and environmental practices unique to these communities. This initiative will also investigate economic and social vulnerabilities faced by PVTGs.ICSSR member secretary Prof Dhananjay Singh said, research will prioritise understanding cultural practices, sustainable living techniques, & climate adaptation strategies of these communities, which hold insights relevant to modern challenges of equity, social harmony, & environmental sustainability.ICSSR’s focus on PVTGs reflects a growing governmental interest in data collection on marginalised groups. The research, open to faculty and researchers across India, especially those near tribal populations, will include surveys, interviews, & case studies to develop comprehensive datasets, which are lacking.In addition to PVTG studies, ICSSR will introduce a research initiative for UG and PG students, aligning with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020’s emphasis on early-stage research. Expected to launch in Feb 2025, this programme will allow up to 500 students to conduct independent research on topics like development, health, agriculture, technology, and culture, supported by ICSSR funding.Another key initiative is ICSSR’s women-specific research project, which aims to increase women’s participation in India’s research ecosystem, particularly for those from marginalised backgrounds. With a funding range of up to Rs 30 lakh for major projects and Rs 15 lakh for minor projects, the council plans to support 150–200 women-led research projects, in alignment with PM Modi’s vision of an inclusive India.Finally, it will expand its longitudinal studies programme, following success of its initial round earlier this year. These studies, spanning five years with funding up to Rs 3 crore per project, address critical policy and development areas like disaster management, climate change, agri-tech, and social health.","ICSSR plans to support studies focused on vulnerable indigenous tribes, women- led research initiatives, and college and university student-led projects.

The issue has united Punjab’s rivals BJP, Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal with governing AAP against the BJP-run Haryana.“In an attempt to heal wounds of the past, PM Modi has taken steps for upliftment of Punjabis. Giving 10 acres of land to Haryana for a separate assembly in Chandigarh will hurt the closeness built with Punjab due to these efforts,” Jakhar said. Speaking separately, Jakhar disclosed said he had told the BJP top brass he wanted to step down as state unit chief over the party’s poor performance in this summer’s LS polls when it failed to win any of the 13 seats.AAP warned Chandigarh was not merely a land but a matter of “emotions” for Punjabis. Congress urged Modi to “hand over Chandigarh to Punjab” before New Year.","Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar seeks PM Modi's intervention to reconsider allotment of 10 acres for a new Haryana assembly building in Chandigarh.

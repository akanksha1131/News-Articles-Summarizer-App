Under this system, eligible individuals can secure permanent residency by paying a one-time fee of AED 1,00,000 (approximately Rs 23.3 lakh).The UAE Golden Visa is a long-term residence visa allowing foreign nationals to live, work, or study in the UAE.Previously, Indian citizens could access the Golden Visa primarily through property investments of AED 2 million (₹4.66 crore) or large business investments. Under the new nomination-based system, applicants can now be approved without investing, based on:This pilot phase is currently available to applicants from India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months.Also read: UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit Applications are being handled by Rayad Group, in partnership with VFS and One Vasco centres across India and Bangladesh.

He added that applicants will undergo anti-money laundering, criminal background, and social media checks, but the final decision rests with UAE authorities.Approved individuals receive permanent residency, can bring family, employ staff, and pursue business or professional work. Unlike earlier investment-linked visas, the nomination-based Golden Visa does not expire, even if assets are sold.The ‘One Touch’ Golden Visa service simplifies the entire process of visa application, identity documentation, renewals, and status changes—conveniently bundled into a single step.This new initiative reflects the UAE’s growing strategic and economic ties with India, particularly after the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022.

NEW DELHI: In a strong show of support for the Tibetan cause, a cross-party forum of MPs has passed a resolution urging the government to confer the Bharat Ratna on the Dalai Lama and allow him to address a joint sitting of Parliament -- a move that’s likely to irk China once again.The all-party Indian parliamentary forum for Tibet, which includes MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and Janata Dal (United), adopted the resolutions during its second meeting this month. The group had drawn sharp criticism from Beijing following its inaugural sitting in December last year.Led by BJD Rajya Sabha MP Sujeeth Kumar, the 10-member committee has also launched a signature campaign supporting the Dalai Lama's Bharat Ratna nomination.“We have initiated a signature campaign to award Bharat Ratna to His Holiness Dalai Lama. Many MPs have come forward and some of them have sent video messages supporting the campaign. We will be writing to the Speaker of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to convene a joint sitting which will be addressed by His Holiness,” Kumar, who is also the convenor of the forum said, according to ET.Members of the forum, which includes BJP MPs Ashok Bajpai, Lahar Singh Siroya, Vinay Dinu Tendulkar, Tapir Gao and Rajendra Agrawal, strongly opposed China’s interference in the spiritual succession of the Tibetan leader.They emphasised that the people of Tibet alone have the right to decide on the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama.Taking the campaign a step further, Arunachal Pradesh MP Tapir Gao proposed a mass rally in support of Tibet to raise public awareness.""He further suggested that the Dalai Lama address the Central Hall of the Parliament on topics such as peace and compassion,"" stated the resolution.The forum has also expressed admiration for a recent pro-Tibet bill passed by the US Congress and encouraged similar legislation to be introduced in India's Parliament. Additionally, members discussed the implementation of the 2014 Tibetan Rehabilitation Policy, urging fellow MPs to visit Tibetan settlements and press local administrations for basic amenities.""We have requested all the MPs to reach out to the district administration and respective state governments so that land and amenities such as roads, electrification and drinking water are ensured for Tibetan rehabilitation,"" Kumar added.As per the 2014 policy guidelines issued by the Union home ministry, state governments are required to lease land occupied by Tibetan refugees for 20 years, issue rent tenancy certificates, and ensure welfare benefits and infrastructure support in settlements.""The land under the occupation by the Tibetan refugees should not be disturbed and welfare benefits of state government schemes should be extended to them. The state authorities have been advised to extend the infrastructural facilities and basic amenities like roads, electrification, drinking water schemes in or around the Tibetan settlements,"" said the home ministry’s directive.The forum’s assertiveness marks a renewed political engagement with the Tibetan cause -- one that continues to test India's diplomatic balancing act with China.",A cross-party forum of MPs has passed a resolution urging the government to confer the Bharat Ratna on the Dalai Lama.

You have spent a year with the current portfolios in the current Modi dispensation. There was focus on the North-East. How do you view the progress during your tenure in the ministry?

How far have you expanded the 5G coverage?

BSNL is seen as the next Air India. What is being done to ensure that it remains financially viable and a relevant player in the market?

You spoke about avoiding duopolies…

Vodafone Idea is very fragile. Is there a plan for fresh support?

You have a plan to make the postal department a profit centre. Is it really possible?

How do you take on competition from couriers?

Is there a plan to monetise prime real estate?

What is the department doing to improve the telecom services?

■ PM has identified the North-East as the area with maximum focus. Since Independence, it was consistently neglected. PM has changed the paradigm and decided to make the North-East the growth engine of our development paradigm. Over the last 11 years, he has himself visited the North-East more than 70 times, which is more than all PMs together in the previous 65 years. He has ensured that the Cabinet continuously keeps in touch with the grassroots of the NorthEast. Cabinet ministers have visited the NorthEast over 700 times. Around Rs 5 lakh crore is being invested in plug and play infrastructure. There is a massive build-up in road, railway and airport infrastructure. Private companies are putting in investment. At the NorthEast Investment Summit, they committed to invest Rs 4.2 lakh crore, and I am not counting investments such as the Rs 27,000 crore for a semiconductor facility being set up by the Tata Group in Assam.■ There has been a phenomenal change. PM had the foresight and capability to not only assess the revolution that was coming but also ensure that India leads it. It is evident from the rise in subscribers, the cost has come down for consumers.India can become the data capital of the world. We have the fastest 5G rollout with 99.6% of the districts now covered and 82% population. We have built our own 4G stack. BSNL has installed 94,500 towers and 80-85% are commissioned. We are working towards leading the world on 6G.■ After 18 years BSNL has done a turnaround, posting a quarterly profit for the first time since 2007. In the Dec quarter, it posted a profit of Rs 262 crore and in the March quarter, the profit was Rs 280 crore. For the full year, losses have come down 55% to Rs 2,415 crores; operating profit has more than doubled to Rs 5,395 crore. It has done the largest capex, of Rs 25,000 crore in FY25, which will be amortized over 10 years. It has rolled out 4G. We have grown our customer base, focusing on all areas and all segments.■ India is not a duopoly. We are the only few markets in the world with four players. My responsibility as the minister is to ensure that customers have choice, whether it’s internet or telecom.■ There will be no more conversion of equity. It’s the company’s management to look at their business strategy, profitability, just as the BSNL management.■ We have undertaken a business process reengineering and converted the department into six verticals and four horizontals looking at mail, international mail, parcels, Postal Life Insurance, post office savings bank and citizen centric services. Every transaction now has a cost structure and we are mapping the revenue. We are looking at six strategic business units with profit and loss for each. We are then determining the path to profitability for each of them. We are working on IT 2.0 and for the first time we have hired a chief technology officer with deputy CTOs for each vertical. I look at it turning into a logistics organization with a huge reach of 1.6 lakh crore post offices. The restructuring and capex by govt will hopefully turn it into a profit centre in five years. Today, our cost structure is Rs 27,000 crore and revenue is around Rs 12,000 crore.■ No one has the breadth and depth of India Post, even internationally. The point is how much can you push through this pipe and increase different products. We are now providing governmental services such as Aadhaar and passport. We are bringing new mail and parcel products; we will deliver within 24 hours. We are approaching mutual funds to distribute their products. There must be a mindset change and for that I am meeting the ground level staff.■ Whether it’s telecom or department of posts, we must sweat our assets. Therefore, if you have a large piece of land, you can have the post office on the ground floor and build the whole building and lease out space. First thing we are doing is understanding how many properties do we have, we are checking where are the title papers, the mutation details and identifying the major potential properties before we get a developer.■ Improving the quality of service (QoS) is one of my top priorities. Trai monitors performance, issues showcause notices, and imposes penalties for non-compliance. New regulations introduced in Aug mandate Six Sigma practices and graded penalties for repeated lapses. In coordination with service providers, new sites are being added and existing infrastructure upgraded to boost internet speed and reduce congestion.","PM has identified the North-East as the area with maximum focus.

We reached out to Nainar Nagendran, and he arranged for our return,"" he said.Anto, another fisherman, recalled, ""We went to Iran in February, but the situation became tense and we couldn't go fishing for two months. We informed the BJP leadership, and they made arrangements for food and shelter. Tamil Nadu government officials did not reach out to us at all. All 15 of us from our group are now back, though another group on a different island is still stranded.""Mfrom Tirunelveli shared the hardships they faced: ""The war zone was intense. We needed GPS equipment to fish, but it wasn't provided. Our boat owner offered no help. We remained stranded on the boat since June 13. No one came to rescue us except Nainar Nagendran, who responded within a week of our plea. We haven't received any wages, and the trauma remains. Seeing my wife and children will help me recover. He saved us like a god. ""The Tamil Nadu BJP has promised to continue rescue efforts to bring back the remaining fishermen from Iran.Nagendran also commented on actor Vijay's recent statement about not aligning with any party. ""While Vijay now says he prefers to stand alone, the common goal between us and Vijay is that DMK should not remain in power. I had suggested unity based on that shared view,"" he stated.""Ever since the BJP and AIADMK reunited under the NDA alliance, DMK leaders have been visibly anxious.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has announced the CA May 2025 results for Foundation, Intermediate, and Final exams today, July 6. This year, Rajan Kabra from Mumbai has emerged as the CA Final topper with an AIR 1, and an impressive score of 516 out of 600.At a time when test prep culture often celebrates rote learning and relentless grind, Rajan Kabra’s story stands out for its clarity, curiosity, and quiet confidence. But behind the score is a journey shaped by questions, not just answers, but by interests that range from balance sheets to, and a mindset that values the process as much as the prize.This isn’t Rajan’s first moment in the spotlight. He topped the CA Intermediate exams in May 2022 with AIR 1 and had earlier scored 378 out of 400 in CA Foundation (July 2021). Each stage of his journey has reflected discipline, focused preparation, and a calm, grounded mindset.Also See: ICAI CA May 2025 Toppers check list of top scorers in CA Foundation, Inter, and Final exams here Rather than being driven purely by competition, Rajan’s consistent performance has stemmed from a genuine sense of curiosity and a steady approach, even under the intense pressure of the CA course.Rajan has taken on a role as an industrial trainee at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), where he is developing his strategic thinking abilities through real-world business experience.His learning approach emphasizes practical, hands-on experience rather than purely theoretical studies. The position at BCG provides him with direct exposure to business challenges in an industry setting.Beyond his academic and professional pursuits, Rajan identifies as a cheerful and curious individual with a deep love for fiction, especially the Harry Potter series. He has also been an active participant in debates, quizzes, extempores, and elocutions throughout his school and college years, showcasing his confidence and communication skills.In recent years, Rajan has developed a strong interest in geopolitics and global finance - fields that bridge the gap between numbers, policies, and real-world impact. He views these subjects as essential to understanding the broader context of financial decision-making. For him, learning is not limited to achieving ranks or results; it is a continuous process rooted in growth, awareness, and intellectual curiosity.The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has announced the CA May 2025 results for Foundation, Intermediate, and Final exams. Rajan Kabra secured AIR 1 in the CA Final with 516/600 marks, followed by Nishtha Bothra and Manav Rakesh Shah.

Poll Should more resources be allocated to support victims of sexual assault during investigations? Yes, absolutely No, current resources are sufficient

Law College Gangrape Case- BJP's 'Fact-Finding' Team Reaches Kolkata, Slams Mamata government

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





PUNE: The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Pune on Saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent in her rented Kondhwa flat on Wednesday evening. Police said they produced the complainant before the court as she kept changing her statements during questioning.Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI: ""We produced the woman before the CJM, Ms T M Ahmed, and the process of recording her statement under provisions of Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) was completed."" The section empowers a magisterial court to record the confession of an accused or the statement of a witness.Shinde said the FIR the woman, who has a BE degree and works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar, had filed with the Kondhwa police on Thursday and her subsequent statements had numerous discrepancies. ""She continuously changed her statements during questioning,"" he said.On Thursday, the Kondhwa police had registered a case of rape, voyeurism and criminal intimidation based on the woman's complaint stating that a ""delivery agent"" stepped into her house on the pretext of delivering a parcel and getting a delivery sheet acknowledged, sprayed some chemical on her face to render her unconscious and later sexually assaulted herCity police commissioner Amitesh Kumar on Friday said investigation into the alleged rape revealed that there was ""no forced entry into the woman's flat, no chemical was sprayed to render her unconscious and the selfie on her cellphone was taken with her consent before she cropped the image"".Police had detained her friend (24), an IT professional with a firm in Baner, after evidence like his cellphone location showed that he was around the flat at the time of the alleged incident. The DCP on Saturday said the police released the woman's friend for now, but served a notice on him with a direction to join the investigation.Shinde said the process to record the complainant's statement by a magisterial court was crucial under the provisions relating to rape or sexual assault of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) ""to ensure voluntariness and reliability of such statements"" during investigation. ""It ensures transparency. Since her statement is recorded, the investigating officer can continue the investigation based on her voluntary disclosure before the CJM,"" he said.A senior police officer privy to the investigation said: ""We questioned the complainant on material points. She gave multiple oral and written statements, but they were found contradictory and misleading during verification. Her statements are not consistent with the FIR. A call to take action against her would be taken based on the outcome of the investigation. She would be referred to a counselling session.""Sources in the sessions court said the investigating officer took the CJM's permission for securing the woman's presence to record her statement because of the complexity of the case. The court considered the officer's request and recorded her statement in camera. The woman's statement was sealed in an envelope soon after it was recorded. The sealed envelope has been kept in the safe custody of the court ‘nazir' (assistant superintendent).The investigating officer will now have to secure a certified copy of her statement by seeking the court's permission. The purpose of recording her statement before the court under Section 183 of BNSS is to create a reliable record of a witness. This process aims at detering witnesses from subsequently changing their testimonies, minimise perjury and provide more trustworthy accounts of events, especially when compared to statements taken during the investigation, sources said.The CJM court's assistant public prosecutor, Priyanka Vengurlekar, confirmed that the woman's statement was recorded, but said its contents could not be made public.",The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Pune on Saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent.

The showers helped lower temperatures and ease the lingering humidity.However, the persistent rain also led to waterlogging in some parts of the city, including the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. Vehicles were seen navigating through the flooded streets, causing traffic disruptions in affected areas.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Monday, warning of thunderstorms, lightning, and squalls across all districts of Delhi.The advisory covers north, north-east, north-west, south, south-west, south-east, and west Delhi, where storm activity is expected today.As of now, no weather alerts have been issued for the coming days.In a press statement released on July 6, IMD Delhi said, “Generally cloudy skies. Light to moderate rain with thunderstorm/lightning likely in the next 48 hours.”Earlier on Sunday morning, parts of Delhi experienced rainfall.The IMD also noted that the monsoon trough at mean sea level currently stretches from Suratgarh, Sirsa, Delhi, Lucknow, Varanasi, Daltonganj, Bankura, Digha, and extends southeastward to the northeast Bay of Bengal. Additionally, an upper-air cyclonic circulation has formed over Himachal Pradesh and adjoining Punjab at approximately 1.5 km above sea level.In light of the weather conditions, Delhi airport issued a passenger advisory at 06:51 hours, urging travelers to use the metro or other public transport options to reach the airport.Meanwhile, Himachal Pradesh continues to reel under a severe monsoon spell, with the cumulative death toll reaching 75.

Special days and observances in July 2025

Holidays offer both fun and learning opportunities

As schools across India reopen after the long summer break, students step into the new academic session in July 2025 with excitement, fresh books, new classrooms, and a sense of renewed enthusiasm. Along with the resumption of the school routine, July also brings a series of upcoming holidays and celebrations. It’s a month filled with opportunities—not just to study, but also to enjoy breaks, explore new interests, learn new skills, and spend quality time with family and friends.Questions are emerging about whether July 7, 2025, will be declared a holiday due to its coincidence with Muharram, a significant Islamic festival celebrated across various parts of the country. The month's calendar already includes regular Sunday breaks and various regional holidays, potentially affecting school schedules. The timing of these observances, which include both national and international events, could have implications for academic calendars and educational planning. .According to the school calendar for July 2025, Muharram is expected to fall on Monday, July 7, 2025.On this day, many schools across different Indian states are likely to remain closed. However, the final declaration of holiday may vary from state to state depending on local government guidelines.In addition to Muharram, some regions may also observe monsoon or rain-related holidays between July 10 and 15, particularly in areas that are prone to heavy rainfall. These local closures are typically declared by district administrations to ensure student safety during adverse weather conditions. Students will also benefit from four regular Sunday holidays this month.Apart from school holidays, several important national and international observances fall within this month. These include:• July 1 – National Doctor’s Day• July 6 – World Zoonoses Day• July 10 – Bakrid / Eid-ul-Azha• July 11 – World Population Day• July 15 – World Youth Skills Day• July 18 – Nelson Mandela International Day• July 22 – Chandrayaan-2 Launch Day (commemoration)• July 26 – Kargil Vijay Diwas• July 28 – World Hepatitis Day• July 29 – International Tiger DayWhile holidays are a welcome break from academics, they also provide a chance for students to pursue new skills. This year, children are showing interest in short-term courses like storytelling, painting, robotics, and coding. The monsoon, fresh beginnings, and the joy of learning make July a truly memorable month for school children.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

The building lacked a fire safety certificate, and a negligence case has been registered





NEW DELHI: Two people, a 25-year-old civil services aspirant and a 30-year-old lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday. According to the fire service, the building lacked a valid fire certificate and a case of negligence has been registered by police.The deceased were identified as Kumar Dhirender Pratap Singh and Pawan Gautam. Singh, originally from Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh, was found dead inside the elevator, where he is believed to have suffocated after getting trapped, while Gautam, an ITI graduate from Aligarh who worked as a lab technician, was found on the second floor.According to Delhi Fire Service, the blaze was reported at 6.44pm on Friday. Minutes later, Singh's brother, Vikram, received a desperate message from his trapped sibling. ""At 6.51pm, my brother texted me about being stuck in the lift,"" Vikram revealed to TOI. ""He pleaded, ‘Kisi tarah se bachalo, main lift mein fasa hua hoon. Bohot suffocation ke kaaran saans lena mushkil ho raha hai' (Please save me however you can, I'm trapped in the lift.I feel suffocated and cannot breathe)'.""Vikram, who was in Sonbhadra, immediately contacted his brother's friend to rush to Karol Bagh. ""She went and requested authorities to check the lift around 7pm. They told her they had done it and hadn't detected anyone inside,"" he claimed. His body was eventually recovered at 2.30am on Saturday. ""He was unconscious when we saw him. He was shirtless and in his vest, maybe because he used his shirt to cover his face to avoid the smoke,"" said Vikram. ""I wish I had been there to go into the building and save him,"" he added.Before the tragedy, Singh had been studying in a library nearby for 4-5 hours, according to his friends. Vikram remembered his younger brother, ""He had a good nature. Our mother is a govt schoolteacher in UP and he often volunteered to teach the students whenever he visited our village.""The fire broke out in the multistorey building that housed Vishal Mega Mart, gutting its basement, ground, first, second and third floors. The structure had only two staircases and one lift, with no ventilation except the entrance. Preliminary investigations suggest the fire was caused by a short circuit on the second floor.Firefighting operations were severely hampered due to the lack of ventilation in the building. Fire officers had to use JCB machines to break open the front-facing parts of the upper floors to extinguish the flames, with 15 fire tenders and 90 firefighters engaged in the fierce struggle to control the massive blaze.TOI reached out to Vishal Mega Mart for a response, but the company had not replied at the time of filing this story.","Two people, a civil services aspirant and a lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday.

PUNE: Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said on Sunday that a fake narrative about the city's ""collapsing law and order"" situation was being built based on an ""entirely false and misleading complaint of a very serious nature"" authorities had received recently.Kumar did not specify the nature of the complaint while speaking at the inauguration of a new police chowkey under the Sinhagad Road police station. However, his observation came against the backdrop of a 22-year-old woman's complaint that an unidentified delivery agent entered her 11th-floor flat in Pune last Wednesday, sprayed some chemical to render her unconscious, and raped her.

The woman called her friend to her house. The selfie was clicked with her consent, which she later edited. The woman complained to the police about an unknown courier delivery person, which is not the case.Secondly, she stated that there was forceful entry and use of spray before she was raped, and that too turned out to be misleading.

This was also after she and her friend were made to sit in front of each other and questioned. She has also been referred to counselling. Referring to these events as ""a very serious complaint"" received by the authorities, Kumar noted that a fake narrative was being constructed, one alleging that Pune's law and order systems were ""collapsing"".Officials from Kondhwa police on Saturday also recorded the statement of a woman professor with a private engineering college who was in touch with the woman before the registration of the rape complaint, they said.""The professor is the complainant's friend and guide and was in touch with the complainant on Wednesday.

PM Modi joins BRICS leaders for family photo at 17th BRICS Summit in Rio

'Iran Won't Stop': Khamenei Aide's JAW-DROPPING Speech At BRICS Sends Shockwaves In Israel & U.S.

NEW DELHI: The 11-member BRICS comprising key emerging economies condemned in “the strongest terms” the Pahalgam terrorist attack, seeking concerted action against UN-designated terrorists and terrorist entities, and unambiguously backed a comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC), in 2 significant takeaways for India from the Rio Summit.Among other highlights was India joining BRICS in condemning attacks on Iran since June 13 (without naming Israel), expressing grave concern about the situation in “Occupied Palestinian territory” with the resumption of “continuous Israeli attacks” against Gaza, obstruction to humanitarian aid and use of starvation as a method of warfare – something which Israel has rejected.According to the Rio Declaration, BRICS nations expressed serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules.While this was an obvious message to the Trump administration, the declaration stopped short of naming the US because some members were not comfortable with it. The declaration also said that the imposition of unilateral coercive measures are contrary to international law and measures like unilateral economic sanctions have far-reaching negative implications.At India’s behest, there was ample focus on terrorism in the declaration that urged zero tolerance for terrorism and rejected double standards in countering terrorism. India uses the same language to counter Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism and also China’s shielding at the UN of UN-banned terrorists based in Pakistan.“We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025, during which at least 26 people were killed and many more injured. We reaffirm our commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens,” said the declaration, while calling for an expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UN framework.According to Indian government officials, the Rio summit also adopted “strongest-ever language” for UN reforms by calling for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council with a view to making it more democratic, representative, effective and efficient, and toincrease the representation of developing countries. Recalling the 2022 Beijing and 2023Johannesburg Declarations, China and Russia, as permanent members of the UNSC, reiterated their support to the aspirations of Brazil and India to play a greater role in the United Nations, including its Security Council. Interestingly, the Beijing declaration had only said in the UN, and not 'including in UNSC'. The Rio Declaration also said a reformed UNSC will amplify the voice of the Global South.While condemning the attacks on Iran – and expressing concern over “deliberate” attacks on “peaceful” nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards – the declaration was also littered with references to the Israel-Palestine issue, something which continues to test India’s balancing exercise. In the case of Iran, there was no mention of Israel like in an earlier statement by BRICS last month, which too was endorsed by India, but on this occasion the declaration didn’t just express concern but also condemned the military strikes.In the case of Gaza, the declaration explicitly mentioned “continuous Israeli attacks” calling for adherence to international law and recalling that the Gaza Strip is an inseparable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It also called for full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip while seeking talks for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.However, while the Rio summit cranked up the pressure on Israel by mentioning allegations like the use of starvation, this is not the first time that India has joined BRICS in condemning some of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It did so in a meeting of the foreign ministers in June last year and again at the Kazan summit where BRICS denounced Israel’s attacks against humanitarian operations and facilities.",The 11-member BRICS comprising key emerging economies condemned in ‘the strongest terms’ the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

He also questioned Bhutto's credibility, alleging that his family has a history of towing the Western and Indian narrative against Pakistan.During the interview with Qatar-based Al Jazeera on Friday, Bhutto had asserted that his country had no objection to extraditing terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar to India as a ""confidence-building measure"".Pakistan is ready to extradite ""individuals of concern"" to India provided New Delhi showed ""willingness"" to cooperate in the process, Bhutto had said while responding to a question about extraditing LeT chief Saeed and Jaish-e-Muhammed kingpin Masood Azhar as a gesture of good faith.In a video issued on Sunday, Talha claimed that Bhutto's statement about his father had brought shame to Pakistan globally. ""Bilawal Bhutto's suggestion to hand over his father to India, a hostile country, is unacceptable and will be opposed by us and our community,"" he said.Both Saeed and his son Talha are listed as global terrorists by US treasury department.Shortly after Talha's video, Pakistan Markazi Muslim League, political offshoot of LeT/Jamaat-ud-Dawa, released a statement claiming India was involved in terrorism in Pakistan and Indian State was the mastermind of vicious terror campaigns in Pakistan and around the world.","Bilawal Bhutto's comments on offering extradition of wanted Pakistani terrorists to India seems to have hit a raw nerve with Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed's son Talha.

However, it's learnt that Pakistan had refused to accept his body that was found on Tiger Hill in the Dras sub-sector.According to a press release issued by the Indian embassy in Washington on July 15, 1999, Pakistan authorities adamantly refused to acknowledge the involvement of Pakistan army regulars in the misadventure in Kargil and as a part of that process did not initially acknowledge Khan's identification by India through correspondence found on him.""It is clear that Pakistan is fully aware of the identities of these bodies but they do not wish to acknowledge this fact as it would immediately expose their army's involvement in Kargil. Hence, their persistent and callous refusal to do so, they are doing great disservice to the families of their soldiers and to the traditions of armed forces everywhere,"" the embassy had said in its statement.India had approached Pakistan on July 12, saying it would like to hand over the body to the Pakistan army.Subsequently, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) approached India on July 13, stating that the Pakistan govt had requested them to contact India for handing over the bodies of the two officers about which they had heard.""The Pakistani request did not specify the names and identities of the two officers, despite the information being available to them.

Officials hopeful they won't need to serve ex-CJI eviction notice



With Supreme Court taking an unusual step of asking the govt to take back the official bungalow of CJI at 5, Krishna Menon Marg, officials are hopeful of the situation sorting out itself sparing them of an unpleasant task of serving eviction notice to a former CJI. Media reports quoted ex-CJI D Y Chandrachud as saying they (he & family) are set to move out in a few days.Amid media reports quoted ex-CJI D Y Chandrachud saying they (he & family) are set to move out and it was only a matter of a few days, officials in the housing and urban affairs ministry said they are hopeful that there would be no need for serving an eviction notice. Officials said this is perhaps for the first time when the SC administration has asked it to get a bungalow vacated from a former CJI and return it to the SC housing pool for fresh allotment.They added that for them it was a peculiar situation since the bungalow is placed under the SC housing pool and it is the apex court which takes a call on allotment. In a July 1 letter to the housing and urban affairs secretary, the SC administration had pointed out that the time allowed for the former CJI to vacate the official accommodation had expired, and hence, the bungalow must be vacated without delay.Sources said SC authorities wrote to the ministry as all govt accommodations, including those meant for judges and belonging to the SC pool, fall under the ministry's jurisdiction and it is the ministry that is responsible for carrying out any eviction.SC is in need of official accommodation for four judges, sources said.Rule 3B of the SC Judges Rules, 2022, allows retired CJIs to retain their bungalow for up to six months after retirement. Justice Chandrachud, who retired as CJI in Nov 2024, has been staying there. In Dec, he wrote to his successor and former CJI Justice Sanjiv Khanna, seeking time until April 30, 2025, to retain the bungalow, and this was allowed.Again in April, he wrote to the then CJI, Khanna, seeking time until June 30, citing difficulty in finding a suitable accommodation.","Officials hopeful they won't need to serve ex-CJI eviction notice.

""Condemning terror should be our principle, not just a convenience. If we first see in which country an attack took place and against whom, it will be a betrayal of humanity,"" he said.Modi said the attack in Pahalgam was a blow not only to India but ""entire humanity"", adding there should be no hesitation in imposing sanctions against terrorists, and that victims and supporters of terror couldn't be weighed on the same scale.Brics condemned in ""the strongest terms"" the Pahalgam attack, and backed a comprehensive reform of UNSC - two key takeaways for India from the Rio summit.PM Modi also called upon Brics to adopt a clear and unified stance on overcoming terrorism . ""On a subject like terrorism, there is no room for double standards. If any country provides direct or indirect support to terrorism, it must pay the price for it,"" the PM said.""For personal or political gain, giving silent consent to terrorism, supporting terror or terrorists, should not be acceptable under any circumstances. There should be no difference between words and actions regarding terrorism,"" said the PM.""If we cannot do this, then the question naturally arises whether we are serious about the fight against terrorism or not,"" he added.While describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a cause of great concern, Modi said India firmly believes that no matter how difficult the circumstances are, the path of peace is the only option for the welfare of humanity.""India is the land of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi. There is no place for war and violence for us. India supports every effort that takes the world away from division and conflict and leads it towards dialogue, cooperation and coordination, and increases solidarity and trust,"" he said.On reforms, he said with Brics having included new members the same determination must be shown to reform institutions like UNSC, WTO, and multilateral development banks.He sought to drive home his point on reforms by stating in his address that in the age of AI, where technology evolves every week, it's unacceptable for global institutions to go 80 years without reform. ""You can't run 21st-century software on 20th-century typewriters,"" said the Prime Minister.The PM said two-thirds of humanity still lack proper representation in global institutions built in the 20th century. ""Many countries that play a key role in today's global economy are yet to be given a seat at the decision-making table. This is not just about representation, it's also about credibility and effectiveness,"" he said, adding that with the Global South, these institutions are like a mobile phone with a SIM card but no network.They're unable to function properly or meet the challenges of the 21st century, said Modi, adding that the Global South has often faced double standards.""Whether it's about development, distribution of resources, or security related matters, the interests of the Global South have not been given due importance,"" he said, adding that whether it's ongoing conflicts, the pandemic, economic crises, or emerging challenges in cyber or space, global institutions had failed to offer solutions.","PM Modi calls on Brics to adopt a clear and unified stance on overcoming terrorism. Brics condemned in ""the strongest terms"" the Pahalgam attack, and backed a comprehensive reform of UNSC. India firmly believes that the path of peace is the only option for the welfare of humanity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122286712,imgsize-1039012,width-400,resizemode-4/122286712.jpg"

Police say woman's mental health 'not good'

NEW DELHI: Pune Police on Sunday ruled out a rape claim by a 22-year-old data scientist, calling it a ""false complaint"" that misled cops. Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said the woman's report, which included allegations of assault by an unknown man posing as a delivery agent, was fabricated.The woman had alleged that a stranger, pretending to be a courier delivery man, entered her Kondhwa flat on Wednesday, bolted the door, sprayed a chemical to knock her unconscious, and raped her. She claimed the assailant took a selfie using her phone and left behind a threatening message.But within 24 hours, police uncovered inconsistencies in her statement.""It was found that the woman had filed a false complaint. Her complaint misled the Pune Police,"" Kumar said.He added, ""Just two days ago, an incident came before Pune City Police, which was used to create a narrative that law and order concerning women in Pune has completely collapsed, and efforts were made to portray Pune as unsafe for women. By deploying the full resources of the police administration, we solved the case within 24 hours. No one should try to defame Pune, a city known to be one of the safest, through fake narratives.According to the investigation, the man in the selfie was known to the woman. ""They have known each other for years and belong to the same community,"" Kumar said a few days back, as quoted by PTI. ""The selfie was taken by the woman herself and later edited to partially hide his face. The threatening message was typed by her too.""The man, reportedly a highly qualified professional, was detained and questioned. Forensic analysis found no evidence of a chemical attack, and CCTV footage showed no unknown visitor entering the housing complex. The apartment's digital entry system also recorded no delivery agents at the time.Kumar said, ""No chemical spray was used. The girl’s mental state is not good at present. The rape part is still under investigation.""The case had initially been registered under sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism), and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Forensic teams collected samples from the crime scene, and her phone was seized for digital analysis. The selfie and text message were central to the original claim.The woman, an IT professional living in Pune's Kalyaninagar area with her younger brother, was alone at the time of the alleged incident.","Pune Police rule out rape claim by 22-year-old data scientist, calling it a ""false complaint"" Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said the woman's report was fabricated.

""India's consistent push to address terrorism in all its forms led to the creation of the Brics counter-terrorism working group, and under India's leadership at the 13th Summit in 2021, the group adopted a Counter Terrorism Action Plan, marking a shift from broad declarations to concrete institutional mechanisms for intelligence sharing, capacity building and preventing the misuse of financial and digital networks by terror networks,"" according to the sources.They also said India was instrumental in using the forum to support its pitch for democratising multilateral institutions - a theme PM Modi articulated in his address to the Summit on Sunday.Sources also mentioned India's initiatives, including the call for the launch of Brics Startup Forum and inclusion of digital public infrastructure in the core agenda, to argue that India has moved from the sidelines to the centre stage of the group. ""India has become a voice that is heard. It isn't easy to imagine that 12 years ago, many seriously debated whether to replace India, with the lowest growth rate and high inflation, with Indonesia as a member,"" said sources.","India went into the Brics summit feeling confident it would be able to negotiate the duelling pressures from members of the grouping.

Poll Do you believe stricter enforcement of traffic rules will reduce road crashes in Delhi-NCR? Yes, absolutely No, it won't help

NEW DELHI: Concerned over unabated violation of traffic rules by two and three-wheelers entering the main carriageway of expressways and access-controlled stretches in Delhi-NCR, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has asked the Delhi Police to “strictly enforce” the ban on such vehicles on high-speed corridors.Gadkari has also directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to remove hoardings and illegal advertisements on national highways and expressways, as these can distract drivers and become the cause of a crash.The issues had come up for discussion at a meeting chaired by Gadkari and attended by Delhi Lt Governor V K Saxena and CM Rekha Gupta on June 4.As per the minutes of the meeting issued this week, NHAI and highway ministry officials highlighted that the entry of two and three-wheelers has been prohibited on the main carriageway of the Badarpur Elevated Highway as per a Feb 16 notification. Similarly, a Jan 2021 notification prohibits these vehicles on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway.Similarly, a notification was issued in Jan 2024 prohibiting these vehicles on UER-II, Delhi-Gurgaon and Dwarka expressways. “The traffic police were instructed to ensure strict enforcement of these restrictions across all these stretches,” reads the minutes of the meeting.Gadkari’s direction comes amid growing concerns over crashes caused by the unauthorised entry of these vehicles. Officials said, despite signage and regulations, enforcement has been lax, leading to widespread disregard for rules. “The minister had said that maintaining discipline on high-speed roads is crucial for reducing road crashes and ensuring smooth traffic flow. Only the fear of getting caught every time for violations can be a deterrent and police have to enforce this,” said a highway ministry official.TOI last week had highlighted how almost 63% of traffic rule violations on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and the newly opened Dwarka Expressway were due to illegal entry of two and three-wheelers on these access-controlled stretches.",Union minister Nitin Gadkari asks Delhi Police to ‘strictly enforce’ ban on 2 & 3 wheelers on high-speed corridors in Delhi-NCR.

Ahmedabad crash fallout: DGCA directs AI & IndiGo to conduct post trauma workshops for 'worried' crew members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahmedabad-crash-fallout-dgca-directs-ai-indigo-to-conduct-post-trauma-workshops-for-worried-crew-members/articleshow/122284059.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed India’s major airlines — Air India and IndiGo — to hold post trauma mental health workshop for their flight crew. The directive comes after witnessing a significant massive impact of the tragic June 12 AI 171 crash in which 260 people lost their lives on the mental health of both pilots and cabin crew. AI even saw mass sick reporting by them soon after the crash on a few days as the many of the crew members were too stressed to report to work in the right frame of mind.“The DGCA has asked AI to hold the workshops and offer support. AI despatch now often has a psychologist in case some crew members wants counselling before operating their flight. IndiGo, which has a very wide network, has been asked to conduct e-modules of this workshop,” said officials across airlines.Pilots are especially on the tenterhooks as there has been no preliminary report even 24 days after the accident that could indicate what caused the crash just 30 seconds after take off. No one knows who all are investigating the crash, apart from AAIB chief. That suspense is taking its toll on everyone, but more so airline crew. Now it is common for crew to say a silent prayer first when an aircraft gets safely airborne and then when it completes its journey.The DGCA has even directed the major airlines “not to push” crew to come to work if they are not feeling upto it to operate a flight. “Mental health affects physical health, which in turn affects the ability to operate flights safely. Till the cause, even a preliminary one, is known of AI 171 crash, the feeling of jitteriness among crew members is likely to continue,” they said.“One of the two major Indian carriers has been putting crew members on standby duty whenever it wants, thereby inducing more stress among pilots even though there are required number of standby crew when the flight programme is published. Then there are continuing pay issues with the fix pay being reduced to 40 hours from 70 earlier. Our weekly offs are not printed on the rosters. As it is this was causing both mental and financial stress among pilots. The crash has made things even worse for us,” said pilots.Multiple pilots, especially of the Boeing 787 that crashed in Ahmedabad last month, have been reporting trauma after the accident. “The conversation in cockpits these days is mostly limited to what could have caused the crash. What is it that went wrong. That is really eating us up. With no guidance from the probe panel so far, we are all in the dark and jittery,” said multiple pilots.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has guidelines on how aviation medical examiners should assess and evaluate pilots for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The European, Australian and International Civil Aviation Organisation also have guidelines for the assessment of PTSD in aviation. PTSD is known to compromise aviation safety.",The directive comes after witnessing a significant massive impact of the tragic June 12 AI 171 crash in which 260 people lost their lives.

China 'deployed' embassies to undermine Rafale: French intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-deployed-embassies-to-undermine-rafale-french-intel/articleshow/122286606.cms,"PARIS: China deployed its embassies to spread doubts about the performance of French-made Rafale jets after they saw combat in India and Pakistan's clashes in May, French military and intelligence officials have concluded, implicating Beijing in an effort to hammer the reputation and sales of France's flagship fighter.Findings from a French intelligence service seen by Associated Press say defence attaches in China's foreign embassies led a charge to undermine Rafale sales, seeking to persuade countries that have already ordered the French-made fighter - notably Indonesia - not to buy more and to encourage other potential buyers to choose Chinese-made planes. The findings were shared with AP by a French military official .Four days of India-Pakistan clashes in May were the most serious confrontation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and included air combat that involved dozens of aircraft from both sides. Military officials and researchers have since been digging for details of how Pakistan's Chinese-made military hardware - particularly warplanes and air-combat missiles - fared against weaponry that India used in airstrikes on Pakistani targets, notably French-made Rafale fighters.Sales of Rafales and other armaments are big business for France's defence industry and help efforts by govt in Paris to strengthen ties with other nations, including in Asia where China is becoming the dominant regional power.Pakistan claimed its air force downed five Indian planes during the fighting, including three Rafales. French officials say that prompted questions about their performance from countries that have bought the fighter from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation.India acknowledged aircraft losses but didn't say how many. French air force chief Gen Jerome Bellanger said that he's seen evidence pointing to just 3 Indian losses - a Rafale, a Russian-made Sukhoi and a Mirage 2000.It was the first known combat loss of a Rafale. French officials have been battling to protect the plane from reputational damage, pushing back against what they allege was a concerted campaign of Rafale-bashing and disinformation online from Pakistan and its ally China. They say the campaign included viral posts on social media, manipulated imagery showing supposed Rafale debris, AI-generated content and video-game depictions to simulate supposed combat. French military officials say they haven't been able to link the online Rafale-bashing directly to Chinese govt.But the French intelligence service said Chinese embassy defence attaches echoed the same narrative in meetings they held with security and defence officials from other countries, arguing that IAFRafales performed poorly and promoting Chinese-made weaponry.Asked by AP to comment on the alleged effort to dent Rafale's appeal, ministry of national defence in Beijing said: ""The relevant claims are pure groundless rumours. China has consistently maintained a prudent approach to military exports, playing a constructive role in regional and global peace and stability.""

Draft electoral roll that will be issued on Aug 1, 2025, will contain the names of persons whose enumeration forms are received by July 25.The electors can submit their documents any time before July 25. After publication of draft roll, if any document is deficient, EROs can obtain such documents from electors whose name appears in the draft roll during scrutiny in the 'claims and objections' period,"" CEC Gyanesh Kumar told TOI on Sunday.Importantly, a senior EC functionary clarified that the list of 11 documents specified by EC to prove one's eligibility for inclusion in the roll - as per Article 326 of the Constitution and provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 - is indicative and not exhaustive, and that the ERO has powers under the law to satisfy himself about the eligibility of a person to be enrolled as an elector on the basis of any other document or local inquiry if he deems fit. However, the ERO must make a ""speaking order"", recording in writing the reasons for such inclusion or exclusion. Even the ERO's decision is subject to a two-stage appellate process after publication of final roll, first at the level of district magistrate and then the chief electoral officer (CEO).A reading of the SIR guidelines dated June 24 confirms this. The text above the list of 11 documents mentioned in the declaration form to be signed by the elector not included in Bihar's 2003 electoral roll clearly states that the list is ""indicative (not exhaustive)"".""The advertisement (issued by Bihar chief electoral officer in some newspapers on Sunday) is in conformity with the SIR instructions issued by EC on June 24,"" the CEC told TOI.Meanwhile, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday accused BJP of conspiring to deprive the people of Bihar of their voter rights through the SIR. People will surely respond to ""this BJP attack on democracy and the Constitution in the upcoming assembly elections"", he said. Citing the advertisement, he alleged that ""when the pressure from the opposition, the public, and civil society increased, EC hurriedly published advertisements, which state that now only a form needs to be filled, and showing documents is not necessary"".The EC's clarification came even as nearly 1.7 crore enumeration forms, accounting for 21.5% of Bihar's electorate, are already collected and over 7.2% uploaded on ECINET.Meanwhile, responding to the criticism directed at EC for rushing with the SIR without prior consultation with political parties, CEC Kumar said, ""During the past four months, all 4,123 EROs, all 775 district election officers and all 36 CEOs have held nearly 5,000 meetings with 28,000 political party representatives. EC has also invited all recognised political parties for interaction. No one was satisfied with the current status of electoral rolls for one reason or the other. ""","Electors can add documents after submitting their enumeration forms, till July 25 and even during the 'claims and objections' period. Electoral registration officers can rely on field inquiry or alternative proof to decide on an elector's inclusion. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused BJP of conspiring to deprive the people of Bihar of their voter rights through the SIR.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122286002,imgsize-1152954,width-400,resizemode-4/122286002.jpg"

The parties are likely to mention the case before SC on Monday for urgent hearing.Moitra, in her petition, submitted that the impugned order unlawfully shifted the burden of proving eligibility from the State to the individual elector and arbitrarily excludes commonly accepted identity documents such as Aadhaar and ration cards. Shifting of the burden of voter authentication onto the citizens, and to view every citizen with suspicion until proven otherwise, is a breach of the constitutional spirit, and also is in direct contravention of the statutory scheme to which EC is bound, she said.

India has expressed its reluctance to lower import duty on agricultural products while controlling the entry of genetically modified maize and soybean.Goyal said govt has prescribed a minimum import price of Rs 50 a kg and there is also a 25% import duty, translating into a protection of around Rs 75 a kg and a selling price of at least Rs 125-150 a kg. With domestic prices linked to the cost of imported goods, Goyal argued that a sharp increase in protection will raise retail prices further, making them unattractive to consumers and hurting overall demand.""To give the taste of Kashmir apples to the country, price has to be affordable. We need to balance between the interests of producers and consumers. We will see if MIP and other protection can be increased,"" he said.With production not keeping pace with growing demand, India imports 4.5-5 lakh tonne of apple, with Turkiye being among the largest sources. The US is seeking to topple Turkiye by seeking preferential duty access.Goyal told local businessmen govt was making efforts to step up exports of Indian goods through free trade agreements. While asserting that the Modi govt kept the country's interests paramount, he also said trade liberalisation cannot be a one-way street and as part of trade deals, both countries needed to open markets.He said the new rail link from Kashmir will help move goods faster to the rest of the country and assured businesses that development work will be pushed by the Centre.Noting that the Pahalgam terror attack was meant to hurt tourism and the economy in Kashmir, the minister said that business is returning to normal and tourist flow has also increased.", commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said govt will review protection for homegrown apples.

‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

EC uploads 2003 rolls, says most voters need not worry

Opposition says revision targets the poor, migrants

EC Trying To Push NRC 'Through Backdoor'- TMC Blasts Poll Body, Alleges 'Nazi' Action | Bihar Polls

Massive on-ground push by all parties

NEW DELHI: A fresh controversy has erupted in poll-bound Bihar over the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls, a process the Election Commission of India (ECI) insists is legally mandated, even as opposition parties allege it could end up deleting ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially the poor, migrants, and those on the margins.While the EC said that the revision, happening after 22 years, is in line with the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, opposition parties claim the timing is suspiciously close to the assembly polls and could ""skew the voter base"".""There is nothing more transparent in a democracy than the law. “Despite apprehensions of some persons, SIR will ensure that all eligible persons are included,” Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI.As part of the roll-revise process, voters may be asked to submit documents to support their claims, not just for themselves, but also for their parents if their names are mentioned. Each document must be self-attested and submitted separately for the individual, father, and mother.However, there's one major relief: If a person's name appears in the Bihar electoral roll dated January 1, 2003, that alone will be treated as sufficient proof, no additional documents will be needed in that case.Highlighting the exclusion of Aadhaar from this voter revision process, Congress's in charge of Bihar Krishna Allavaru accused the EC of ""acting under government pressure"".""Whenever the government faces a crisis, its agencies begin such actions,"" he said.""It is strange that the very voters who elected this government are now being asked to prove their identity. By excluding Aadhaar from this voter revision process, eight crore people are being asked to submit documents they don't have,"" the Congress leader added.Trying to calm nerves, the EC clarified this week that 4.96 crore out of Bihar's 7.89 crore registered voters won't need to submit parental documents during the revision. This includes those already listed in the 2003 electoral rolls or born to such electors.To make things smoother for booth level officers (BLOs) and voters alike, the EC has uploaded the 2003 Bihar rolls on its website for easy access.On Wednesday, leaders from 11 opposition parties, including Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, and Left parties, met the Election Commission, calling the revision ""disastrous"". They warned that the EC’s guidelines on verifying if someone is ""ordinarily resident"" in a constituency may disqualify large sections of migrants, who form a major chunk of Bihar’s electorate.The opposition argued that a revision this close to elections casts doubt on the EC’s intentions. But interestingly, despite their public opposition, these parties have joined the ground-level process, appointing thousands of booth level agents (BLAs) to keep watch.Contrary to their protests, opposition parties have gone all in. The RJD has deployed 47,143 BLAs, second only to BJP's 51,964. Congress has appointed 8,586, while Left outfits like CPI(ML), CPM, and CPI have sent in their own agents. On the NDA side, JDU, LJP, and RLSP have mobilised more than 30,000 BLAs in total.The election commission claimed it was determined to follow Article 326 of the Constitution, which mandates that only Indian citizens aged 18 or above and ordinarily resident in a constituency should be enrolled.“SIR is in line with Article 326. It’s a straight question (to the parties criticising SIR): Do you agree with Article 326 or not?"" a senior EC official said.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) is revising Bihar's electoral rolls.

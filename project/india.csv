New licensing framework for Hajj season 2026





How the Hajj accommodation licensing process works





Register via the Nusuk Masar platform, the centralized system for pilgrim service coordination.

Apply through the Ministry of Tourism’s electronic platform at https://tlg.mt.gov.sa/, ensuring all requirements are met.

Goals and benefits of the seasonal licensing model for Hajj





Improve service quality by enforcing seasonal standards that must be met by all participating accommodations.

The Ministry of Tourism, responsible for regulating hospitality services.

The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing, contributing to urban planning and infrastructure readiness.





To streamline the accommodation process for Hajj 2026, Saudi Arabia has rolled out a seasonal licensing system for pilgrim housing in Makkah and Madinah. The initiative, developed through inter-ministerial collaboration, focuses on enhancing service standards, ensuring compliance, and organizing bookings through official digital platforms.The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has formally introduced a temporary hostel licensing service for accommodations specifically catering to pilgrims in Makkah and Madinah during the upcoming Hajj season of 1447 AH (2026).

Existing hotel establishments with active, year-round licenses issued officially by the Ministry of Tourism are exempt from this seasonal licensing process entirely.To obtain a license under the new system, applicants must complete two steps:The deadline for securing the necessary license is 13th Sha'ban 1447 AH, corresponding to February 1, 2026.All licenses must be finalized before this contracting period closes.

Recruiter timeline and tracking

Significance and pressure points

The University of Delhi (DU) will conduct a large-scale job fair on 8 October 2025, bringing recruiters to campus for placements and internships across disciplines. The clock is tight: student registrations shut on 5 October and the portal auto-closes after 5,000 submissions—whichever comes first. The drive is organised by the Central Placement Cell (CPC) under the Dean of Students’ Welfare. The fair will run across the Indoor Stadium, Multipurpose Hall and Gate No. 2 facilities on the university campus. Candidates who receive a confirmation email must report by 9:00 a.m. on 8 October.Participation is open to regular undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students, as well as DU alumni. However, School of Open Learning (SOL) students are not eligible, a line of exclusion that leaves a large distance-learning cohort outside the ambit of this placement exercise.Registration is free and can be completed via a Google form. It requires:The form’s 5,000-entry cap means late applicants can find the portal locked before the date, and incomplete/incorrect entries risk disqualification.All participating students are required to carry multiple hard copies of their CVs for direct submission to employers. Digital uploads alone will not suffice.Recruiting organisations are expected to complete their own sign-ups by 6 October, allowing the CPC to finalise schedules.Students have been advised to regularly check the official placement site (placement.du.ac.in) and the registration form page for job descriptions and the evolving list of participating companies in the run-up to the fair.The job fair arrives in a demanding labour market where entry-level roles are fiercely contested. For final-year students and recent graduates, the event is a decisive springboard; for DU, it is a public test of employability readiness—from logistics and recruiter mix to actual offers made. Pressure points are clear: the exclusion of SOL candidates, the compressed registration window, and the strict documentation regimen. Each will influence both student experience and outcomes.","The University of Delhi will conduct a large-scale job fair on 8 October 2025.

Kids’ cough syrup deaths trigger multi-state checks

BHOPAL/NEW DELHI: As the number of children dying of renal failure in MP’s Chhindwara district after consumption of cough syrup rose to 11, with two more fatalities reported on Saturday, a laboratory test report of Coldrif — the cough medicine taken by some of the victims — has revealed it contained a poisonous industrial chemical, prompting the state to ban its sale.The report received by MP government from Tamil Nadu drugs control department on Saturday said the sample tested was “found adulterated, since it contains 48.6% diethylene glycol”. DEG, used in anti-freeze and brake fluids, is known to cause acute kidney failure and death when ingested.The state government immediately ordered a crackdown on Coldrif, manufactured by TN-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals, with the Food and Drugs Administration issuing urgent instructions to all drug inspectors to seize existing stocks, prevent further sales and draw samples from other batches for testing. The government also extended the prohibition to all other medicines made by the pharma company.MP CM Mohan Yadav, in an X post, said: “Death of children in Chhindwara caused by Coldrif syrup is extremely painful.” Late Saturday evening, he announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh for the families of each of the deceased children. The state government would also bear the cost of treatment for the children still under care, Yadav said.The cough-syrup-linked deaths in MP and Rajasthan have sounded alarm bells across the country, with several states announcing probes and taking precautionary measures.The Central Drug Standards Control Organisation has initiated risk-based inspection of drug manufacturing units in six states — Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, MP and Maharashtra. The inspections are focused on companies manufacturing cough syrups, antipyretics & antibiotics, samples of which were picked up by the drug regulatory authorities from regions from where the fatalities were reported.The deaths in Chhindwara have taken place over a period of one month. All the kids were aged below five years, and renal failure was reportedly caused after taking cough syrups, including Coldrif, were prescribed by local doctors at private clinics. Five kids are recuperating at Government Medical College & Hospital in Nagpur.The deaths, first reported in late Aug, were largely concentrated in villages in Parasia tehsil of Chhindwara. The children initially showed symptoms of cold and mild fever, and were treated with cough syrups and routine medicines. However, their condition worsened soon with reduced urine output and acute kidney complications.Union health ministry sources said a multidisciplinary team comprising experts from the National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical Research, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CDSCO and AIIMS-Nagpur, among others, were still analysing various samples and factors to assess the cause of deaths in and around Chhindwara.The ministry on Friday stated six samples tested by CDSCO and three by MP Food and Drugs Administration were found to be free of DEG and ethylene glycol. On Saturday, ministry sources clarified that the six “samples that have been tested so far by CDSCO were not of the two suspected cough syrups, including Coldrif, that have been under scanner”.The analysis of the samples of Coldrif and other suspected cough syrup by MP drug authorities is still underway.","The number of children dying of renal failure in MP’s Chhindwara district after consumption of cough syrup rose to 11, with two more fatalities reported on Saturday.

Nirav Modi case: India may give 'no arrest' pledge to get him extradited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirav-modi-case-india-may-give-no-arrest-pledge-to-get-him-extradited-cbi-ed-to-forego-new-cases/articleshow/124312839.cms,"File photo: Nirav Modi

NEW DELHI: ED and CBI, besides other agencies like the income tax , have together decided to make a joint submission before the Westminster court in London pledging that the agencies here in India will not file any fresh case against fugitive PNB scam accused Nirav Modi, and if at all it is necessitated anytime in future, it will be with the concurrence of UK court.The assurances include giving a blanket protection from any arrest once the fugitive is extradited to India, not to be booked in any other case, or interrogated by any other agency in any other case other than facing trial in pending cases of money laundering and corruption in which chargesheets have already been filed against him before special courts here.A few years ago the UK high court had turned down his appeal seeking to stop his extradition to India on the ground that his mental condition had deteriorated and that he might end his life.The court had then also accepted the assurances given by Modi govt about the conditions at Arthur Road jail — where the fugitive diamantaire would be lodged once he comes back, noting that India is a “friendly country”. The submission before the Westminster court will be made against an appeal filed by the incarcerated diamantaire seeking to reopen his extradition trial with prayers to stay his deportation cleared by the UK high court.The case has been scheduled for hearing on November 23.For the past several years, India has been fighting a tough legal battle in the UK courts seeking the extradition of the diamantaire, who was arrested in London in 2019 on an Indian extradition request, and has been behind bars for the last six years. In May this year, his bail application had been rejected for the eighth time, citing concerns of his disappearance and influencing witnesses.In July, his brother Nehal Modi, another accused in the PNB scam case, was arrested in the US by American authorities on charges of laundering the proceeds of crime. In multiple chargesheets filed in the PNB case during 2018 and 2019, ED had levelled serious charges against Nehal Modi, of destroying evidence and laundering proceeds of crime on behalf of his brother.“Nehal Modi was personally overseeing that all the accounts, records were destroyed and was influencing the employees/witnesses to conceal money trail and proceeds of crime,” sources said. The ED’s evidence against Nehal Modi includes his footprint in laundering huge stockpiles of gold, diamonds and cash consignments from Dubai and Hong Kong based entities of Nirav Modi."," ED and CBI, besides other agencies like the income tax, have together decided to make a joint submission before the Westminster court in London.

Ease of immigration to make Navi Mumbai airport a 'true hub',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ease-of-immigration-to-make-navi-mumbai-airport-a-true-hub/articleshow/124314029.cms,"NMIA will have an initial annual capacity to handle 2 crore passengers

NEW DELHI: Unshackling India's financial capital from its decades-old aviation infra crunch with the inauguration of the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), Modi government is all set to fulfil its vision of giving the country true hubs.From more slots for more aircraft including long range wide bodies, and a revamped immigration and security set up, the government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure Indians from across the country use the Navi Mumbai airport with an initial annual capacity to handle two crore passengers as a hub to fly an Indian carrier to rest of the world. The airport is scheduled to be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on October 8, with the first commercial flight in about a month.Soon, passengers travelling from at least seven cities in south and west India like Ahmedabad, Surat and Hyderabad to Mumbai's NMIA or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to take connecting international flights from there will be able to clear immigration at the first airport itself.This will enable them to fly into Mumbai, clear security and board their next flight - a seamless transit like that currently offered in Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi or Singapore Changi.Only difference: 'Atma Nirbharta' with a majority of them increasingly flying from an Indian hub on an Indian airline and not being ""feeders"" for foreign carriers via hubs abroad.For Delhi, the government is working on at least five cities in north and east India like Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow and Varanasi, where people will be able to clear immigration on their way to Delhi for taking a connecting international flight. NCR is also going to get its second international airport before the end of this year when Noida International Airport (NIA) is expected to become operational.NIA, however, will have almost 95% domestic traffic, and the capital's IGIA still has spare capacity and scope for further growth.So the main focus in Delhi for seamless domestic (D)- international (I), I-D & I-I transfers is on IGIA. NIA will see D-D transfers, just like IGIA does.""NMIA will be a game-changer as CSMIA was for years operating beyond capacity. The travel demand of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is immense. Navi Mumbai, which was only talked about as the site of a second airport since 1997, is now getting an airport and preparatory work has already started for MMR's third airport at Vadhawan. We see the dual airport system positioning Mumbai as the primary gateway for India travellers to the world while connecting the globe with Tier II & III cities here,"" said an official.""We are working to set up a true hub-and-spoke at NMIA, CSMIA and Delhi's IGIA with domestic networks of big and upcoming airlines, including Air India group, IndiGo and Akasa, flying in passengers who then take connecting flights on them to the rest of the world. Ditto on the way back,"" the official added..Officials say the Modi government has been working to strengthen the country's airline ecosystem as it foresaw the country's travel demand in coming years - which would have otherwise been continued to be met by foreign airlines via their hubs abroad.From 2014, India's guiding principle for granting flying rights (bilaterals) to foreign countries was keeping the interests of Indian airlines and passengers foremost. This allowed IndiGo, Air India and AI Express, after their successful divestment in 2022, and young Akasa to increase Indian carriers' share in international traffic to and from India to 46% in 2024 from the low 30s about a decade back.The simultaneous push on airport infrastructure is seeing Delhi NCR and MMR getting their second airports along with major expansion in other places like at Hyderabad and Bengaluru. With the right combination of strong airports and airlines, the focus is now on seamless transfers.""Supply chain constraints have meant IndiGo, AI Group and Akasa, among others, have not been able to get planes at the required pace from Boeing and Airbus. The government has eased the policy of leasing aircraft to help airlines overcome this challenge. IndiGo has been able to grow its international network due to that. AI has also started showing some aggression in the past month. The IndiGo long range Airbus A321s will start arriving from next Jan that will allow the airline to fly to Europe and the far east"" said an official.He said the government is the enabler and it is upto private players in the aviation ecosystem to make the most of India's massive potential.",Navi Mumbai International Airport set to be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on October 8.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will hear a plea filed by Ladakh-based climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife against his detention on October 6, ANI reported.The habeas corpus plea, filed by social entrepreneur Geetanjali Angmo, will be taken up by a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria.Wangchuk, a former educationist, was detained by police on September 26, two days after violent protests erupted in Ladakh’s capital Leh over demands for statehood and inclusion under the 6th Schedule of the Constitution of India. He was transferred to a jail in faraway Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).Authorities allege that Wangchuk “incited” the violence.

India’s Growth And Resilience Unshaken Despite Global Tariff Pressures, Says Nirmala Sitharaman

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness. ""These unclaimed amounts are not government property but belong to individuals and families,"" Sitharaman said. ""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness.

Poll Have you or someone you know ever fallen victim to online investment fraud? Yes No

Some transactions layered via ‘fake import of services’

New Delhi: Its promoters are based in Russia, technical support in Georgia, its India operations are handled from Dubai and the servers are in Barcelona.Illegal online trading platform OctaFX, being investigated by Enforcement Directorate for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens, has become part of a unique study by the agency into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into cryptocurrencies and use services of international payment gateways.A multi-agency probe has revealed that over the past few years OctaFX, which deals in forex, commodities and cryptocurrencies and is incorporated in Cyprus, made Rs 800 crore of alleged proceeds of crime from its India operations in just nine months.Some of the transactions were layered through ""fake import of services"" from Singapore to launder duped funds generated in India. In a particular case, ED has attached Rs 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa in Spain, Rs 36 crore in banks, 39,000 cryptocurrency (USDT), land and Demat holdings of Rs 80 crore.OctaFX, being investigated by the ED's Mumbai zonal unit, is not the only illegal online platform indulging in investment frauds.The others under probe include Power Bank, being investigated by the Bengaluru zonal unit; 'Angel One', TM Traders and Vivan Li, being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit; and Zara FX, being investigated by the Kochi unit.The ED's cases are based on several FIRs registered by police in different cities.""Angel One is a SEBI-registered, publicly listed, and fully compliant financial services entity, and is not under any investigation by the Enforcement Directorate or any other regulatory or enforcement agency,"" a company spokesperson said. The reference in the article is to an illegal website which is spoofing many legal entities and committing frauds.""Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,"" the ED study revealed.The probe further found that in the Birfa case ""remittances of Rs 4,818 crore were sent to Hong Kong and Canadian entities controlled by scammers, under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, escrow services, etc"" on fake invoices.The ED document estimated that Indians have lost more than Rs 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024 - a more than 206% jump in estimated losses from Rs 7,465 crore in 2023 and an over 50% jump in number of cases from 24.4 lakh in that year.Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud found that the masterminds, operating from Laos, Hong Kong and Thailand, hired agents in India to set up shell entities with forged papers and issued fake IPO allotments, stock market investments and indulged in fake digital arrests. PoC was collected in shell companies, converted into cryptocurrencies and remitted overseas as payment for fake ""import of services"". While global payment gateways act as intermediaries, a part of the booty is laundered using hawala channels.","Illegal online trading platform OctaFX is being investigated by Enforcement Directorate for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens.

NEW DELHI: Those who violate traffic and other motor vehicle (MV) rules will soon be required to either accept and pay challans or contest them with supporting evidence within 45 days, says a draft notification proposing amendments to the MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.As per the proposed changes notified by the road transport ministry, regional transport offices (RTOs) won’t process any applications related to the licence or vehicle registration of such offenders until the dues are cleared. Such vehicles and driving licence holders will also be flagged as “not to be transacted” on Vahan and Sarathi portal.Sources said these changes have been proposed to nudge violators to clear their dues.However, experts cautioned that, before implementing the changes, the govt must ensure that systems are in place for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) holders to raise objections against challans, and for their names to be promptly removed from the pending payment list once the dues are cleared.“The draft rules specify that anyone receiving a challan may contest it on the portal with supporting documentary evidence before an authority designated by the respective state govt.There is a need to clearly define the responsibilities of this authority, and there should be a penalty provision in place if the authority fails to remove a vehicle or individual from the defaulter list after dues have been cleared,” said a veteran from the transport industry.The ministry has proposed that police officers in uniform or any other official authorised by state govts be allowed to issue challan physically. They could also auto-generate challans. These challans must be delivered either in person within 15 days or electronically within three days.If a person does not contest a challan before the designated authority, it will be deemed accepted 45 days after issuance.According to the draft rules, if a challan is contested and the authority fails to resolve it within 30 days, or if it decides to quash the challan with recorded reasons, the penalty will no longer be enforceable.The petitioner may either accept the order and pay the fine within 30 days of it being uploaded on the portal or file an application before a court after depositing 50 per cent of the penalty amount. If the individual neither pays the fine nor contests the challan in court within 30 days of receiving the order, the challan will be deemed accepted.",Road transport ministry proposes changes to MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.

Of 796 convicted foreigners in Bengal’s prisons, 204 are women

KOLKATA: West Bengal houses the highest number of foreign prisoners in the country. As many as 2,508, or 36%, of India’s 6,956 foreign prisoners are lodged in the state’s correctional homes, according to ‘Prison Statistics of India 2023’, released by the National Crime Records Bureau.As many as 89% of the foreigners detained in Bengal’s prisons, mostly Bangladeshis, have been prosecuted for illegally entering India.Foreigners make up 9% of Bengal’s total prison population of 25,774. Of the Bangladeshis lodged here, 778 are convicts and 1,440 undertrials. Myanmar takes second spot. Most undertrials are between 18 and 30 years of age.With more than half of the 4,906-km-long India-Bangladesh border falling in Bengal, the state has had to lodge a large percentage of foreign prisoners. While there were 796 foreign convicts in the state’s jails in 2023, there were 1,499 undertrials.In fact, NCRB data points to the fact that the country’s prisons have been housing more and more undertrials.According to a legal aid counsel, the rise in undertrial numbers has multiple reasons, including being unable to afford a counsel, absence of jurisdiction benches, and already overburdened trial courts.“Illegal Bangladeshi detainees are pushed back on the orders of the Foreigners Regional Registration Office.In Bengal, however, deportation remains abysmally low, despite our repeated pleas,” a senior state official said.Bengal’s prisons are overcrowded, with the occupancy rate being 120% in 2023. As many as 60 prisons, with a total capacity of 21,476, housed 25,774 inmates (nationals and foreigners). The only women’s jail in the state had an occupancy rate of 110.2%. Of the 796 foreign national convicts in Bengal’s prisons, 204 are women and 12 transgender persons.In the case of undertrials, there were 371 women and nine transgender persons out of 1,499 inmates.","As many as 2,508, or 36%, of India’s 6,956 foreign prisoners are lodged in the state.

NEW DELHI: Statistics ministry Saturday floated a discussion paper and invited views from experts, academicians, government bodies, states, financial institutions and other stakeholders on treatment of items distributed free of cost through PDS in the consumer price index compilation framework.The ministry is currently undertaking a revision of the CPI with the objective of updating item weights, revising the consumption basket and incorporating methodological improvements to strengthen the index. At present, the CPI is compiled every month on the basis of price data collection from 1,181 rural markets and 1,114 urban centres across the country.With the release of household consumption expenditure survey 2023-24, the ministry has also kicked off the exercise to revise the CPI base year from 2012 to 2024.Including items distributed through the PDS in the retail inflation basket is a crucial issue as it could have a bearing on the actual headline inflation outcome.In the existing CPI series, items that are distributed free of cost do not carry any expenditure share, since households incur zero out-of-pocket spending on them. This is consistent with international practice, according to the discussion paper which asked stakeholders to send in their comments by Oct 22. The paper states CPI serves a dual purpose in India.It is not only the principal indicator for monetary policy formulation by RBI , but also widely used as a proxy for tracking changes in cost of living and for indexation of wages, pensions and formulation of social welfare schemes.","The ministry is currently undertaking a revision of the CPI with the objective of updating item weights, revising the consumption basket and incorporating methodological improvements to strengthen the index.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

SP MP: Police trapping innocents in false cases, seizing their properties

BAREILLY: A Samajwadi Party (SP) delegation led by leader of opposition in UP assembly Mata Prasad Pandey was on Saturday stopped at multiple locations across the state while on its way to Bareilly to meet families affected by the communal clashes that broke out following the recent 'I love Muhammad' row in the town.Earlier in the day, Bareilly Development Authority demolished a marriage hall linked to Dr Nafees Ahmed, an aide of Ittehad-e-Millat Council chief Tauqeer Raza, who has been arrested for alleged involvement in the violence that broke out following Friday prayers on Sept 26. A house where Raza was reportedly sheltered during the unrest was also sealed.Bareilly SSP Anurag Arya said 83 people had been arrested so far in connection with the incident.The SP delegation — which included Barq, Kairana MP Iqra Hasan and Muzaffarnagar MP Harendra Singh — was part of a fact-finding team that had planned to meet victims’ families and speak with local officials. Barq questioned the rationale for stopping them. “When the police and administration claim everything is normal, why are we being stopped? We have been getting complaints that police are trapping innocents in false cases and seizing their properties.We want it to be stopped.”Hasan alleged that the MPs were treated like criminals instead of elected representatives. “We were pushed and shoved. This undeclared emergency has led to the collapse of law and order in the state. Today or tomorrow, we will reach Bareilly, and UP govt’s wrongdoing will be exposed,” she said. “Today, law is being run by issuing diktats.”In a video posted by SP on X, Pandey said an SHO told him to remain at home, and that the district magistrate warned his visit could disturb peace. “We do not disturb the atmosphere; the administration is not allowing us to go there to cover up its own shortcomings,” he said.SSP Anurag Arya said, “We are currently reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved in the incident. Ten FIRs have been registered, and a SIT will conduct the probe.” Meanwhile, the demolition action by Bareilly Development Authority drew criticism from legal experts. Senior Allahabad high court lawyer SFA Naqvi told TOI that the bulldozer action violated a Supreme Court ruling from November 2024, which held that demolishing the homes of accused persons without due process infringes upon the fundamental right to shelter under Article 21 of the Constitution.Bareilly Development Authority officials said the demolition of the Raza Marriage Hall and the sealing of four shops linked to Dr Nafees Ahmed were carried out due to “building norm violations.” Joint secretary Deepak Kumar said that“legal action is also being taken against the Raza marriage hall.”","A Samajwadi Party (SP) delegation led by leader of opposition in UP assembly Mata Prasad Pandey was stopped at multiple locations across the state.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: The Ladakh government said on Saturday that the Centre “stands committed to holding a dialogue and addressing the aspirations of the people of Ladakh, especially of the younger generation, and would be keen to start the dialogue process soon”.Talks between a high-powered Union home ministry committee and Ladakhi groups, including Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), were scheduled for October 6. But after the Sept 24 incident in which security forces allegedly fired at protesters seeking Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh, killing four and injuring dozens, both groups called off the talks and demanded an inquiry by a retired Supreme Court judge.“The people of Ladakh are known in the country for their peace-loving nature, their fierce patriotism, and for their overall contribution to nation-building and in securing its frontiers,” Pawan Kotwal, chief secretary, UT of Ladakh, who is also adviser to the Ladakh L-G, said at a press conference in Leh. He added that the government has always expressed its desire for an open and constructive dialogue and has never avoided any meetings.Kotwal said that the land, resources, jobs, and livelihood of Ladakhis would remain protected.“Govt would continue to work with the people of Ladakh to protect the ecosystem as well as its cultural identity. As regards to the increase in Lok Sabha seats, the same was discussed during the high-powered committee (HPC) and it was observed that it would be taken up at the time of delimitation,” Kotwal added.“Our policies are not just guided by population. Even with a small population, Ladakh would remain govt’s priority,” he said.“Regarding the issue of solar park industrialisation, and environment degradation, it is reiterated that we are moving on a firm path of developing a carbon-neutral Ladakh,” Kotwal added.“Nothing will happen without consultation and the consent of the local community. There has been no mining activity in Ladakh at all. There is no commercial exploitation of resources at all. Politically motivated organisations should not mislead the people,” Kotwal said.“There is no absolutely no sign of demographic change or cultural homogenisation. By using the words ‘demographic flooding’ and ‘cultural genocides’, the organisations are misleading the people and creating a smoke screen,” he added.He said that regarding land all powers continue to rest with the respective Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDCs), and the government has already commenced making land laws more people-friendly. “No power of LAHDCs has been taken away.”","Talks between a high-powered Union home ministry committee and Ladakhi groups were scheduled for October 6.

Supreme Court Says Flaws In Bihar SIR Can Nullify Exercise; Ruling To Extend Across The country

PATNA: BJP and JD(U), two key NDA partners in Bihar, have differed on the upcoming assembly election schedule. While BJP has urged the Election Commission (EC) to conduct polling in a maximum of two phases to reduce expenditure and disruption, JD(U) has called for a single phase, citing the good law and order situation in the state and the return of Bihar migrants during the Chhath festival, which could boost voter participation.A majority of frontline political parties in Bihar on Saturday suggested the EC to hold the assembly elections in a maximum of two phases, saying that minimal phases would be less tiring and reduce election-related costs.The suggestions came during an interaction with the full team of the Election Commission, comprising chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, at a hotel here. The team arrived Friday night for a two-day visit to review preparations for the elections and oversee the implementation of electoral measures. The EC is expected to announce election dates after returning from Patna.While parties such as BJP, RJD, CPI-ML and LJP (Ram Vilas) favoured a maximum of two phases, the JD(U), led by CM Nitish Kumar, proposed a single phase, citing no law and order issues and stressing voter participation.They highlighted that many Bihar migrants return home for Chhath and their involvement could be crucial.“We have suggested conducting elections in a single phase since the law and order situation in Bihar is good. Naxalism is also not an issue in the state. If elections can be held in a single phase in Maharashtra, why not in Bihar?” JD(U) national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha told reporters. He also recommended holding elections around Chhath and advised the EC to ensure adequate paramilitary deployment at sensitive polling booths.The BJP argued for a maximum of two phases. “The elections should be completed in a maximum of two phases since conducting this task in multiple phases increases poll expenditure and also affects development works,” state BJP president Dilip Kumar Jaiswal said. He also demanded proper checking of identity for burqa-clad women voters and sufficient deployment of security forces to ensure full participation.RJD called for two-phase polling but sought video recording of postal ballot counting and action against officials favouring any party. “But what is serious is that the Bihar govt is crediting money to the bank accounts of women and farmers ahead of the announcement of polls, which is equivalent to bribing the voters. The EC must instantly take cognizance and initiate action,” RJD leader Chitranjan Gagan said. He also asked for details of 21.53 lakh new voters added to the list.“We demanded that the polling should be conducted in minimal phases, but at the same time, adequate deployment of security forces be made for free and fair elections,” LJP (RV) spokesperson Rajesh Bhatt said, adding the EC should provide potable water and toilet facilities at polling booths for female voters.The Congress said the number of phases was immaterial. “What matters is transparency during the voting process,” national spokesperson Abhay Dubey said, requesting details of 21 lakh new voters, as well as dead voters and women removed from the list.CPI-ML also supported two-phase polling but urged sufficient security deployment in booths dominated by Dalits, OBCs, extremely backward classes and weaker sections. “Conducting polling in multiple phases allows the ruling parties to transport fake voters to their destination centres. So polling must be held in a maximum of two phases only,” party functionary Kumar Pervez said.The EC team is in Patna for two days to assess poll preparedness. The term of the 243-member Bihar assembly ends on Nov 22. The last assembly elections in 2020 were held in three phases under Covid restrictions while 2015 and 2010, polls were held in five and six phases, respectively.","BJP and JD(U), two key NDA partners in Bihar, have differed on the upcoming assembly election schedule.

Assam Police Slaps Murder Charge On Zubeen Garg’s Manager & Festival Organiser

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday announced that he will provide all future updates on the Zubeen Garg case and make all statements regarding the singer’s death only through Facebook Live to prevent “miscommunication. ”The Assamese cultural icon, 52-year-old Zubeen Garg, passed away on September 19 in Singapore, where he had travelled to participate in the North East India Festival. In response, the Assam government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate his death and, separately, appointed a one-member judicial commission to examine the “facts and circumstances” surrounding his demise.“When I address the press, selected portions are often cut and taken. It may create unnecessary tension among the public,” Sarma told reporters. “If there is anything to be said regarding Garg’s death and investigation, I will say it only on Facebook Live. In the complex environment of the state, communication with the public should also be direct.”The CM assured that he would address all questions from journalists, but responses will be given only on the social media platform, allowing the public to see an “unedited” version.Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in Singapore. The Assam Police CID, which is probing the case, has so far arrested his manager Siddharth Sharma, festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, and two members of the singer’s band—Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and Amrit Prabha Mahanta.In a shocking allegation, Goswami claimed that Sharma and Shyamkanu Mahanta had “poisoned” Garg in Singapore.More than 60 FIRs have been filed across Assam against nearly 10 people, including the festival organiser, manager, and the two band members, and others.","Zubeen Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in Singapore.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

Govt using police to silence victims, oppn: Bhim Army chief

MEERUT/BAREILLY: Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon amid fears of unrest on Friday when people will gather to offer juma namaz. According to a govt notification, internet services will remain suspended in Bareilly from 3 pm on Oct 2 to 3 pm on Oct 4.Security has been tightened across four districts in Bareilly division, with heavy deployment of forces on streets and drones in air. Some sensitive areas in the city looked like fortresses, and many roads and lanes in localities remained deserted.City magistrate Alankar Agnihotri said, “Internet will remain suspended for 48 hours, considering the sensitivity of the situation.” The precaution follows last week’s clashes during a procession after Friday prayers over ‘I Love Muhammad’ row. Police resorted to lathi charge to control the situation. So far, over 80 people, including local cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Tauqeer Raza Khan, his close associates Dr Nafees Khan and Nadeem Khan, have been arrested.On Thursday, Ala Hazrat Association urged the people to offer Friday namaz peacefully and return home promptly.From the Sunni Markaz at Dargah Ala Hazrat, Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa national vice-president Salman Hasan Khan appealed to imams and the public to maintain peace, avoid rumours and cooperate with authorities. He also requested special prayers during Friday sermons for harmony.In Muslim-majority areas fears of impending action by the administration prevailed. Teams from Bareilly Development Authority are surveying properties to identify violations. Structures without approved maps or violating building regulations will face notices, sealing and demolition.The authority’s vice-chairman Manikandan A said, “Action is being taken at every level against those accused of rioting and their supporters. Every illegal brick will be accounted for. This drive will serve as a lesson to accused and a warning to others who break the law”.In Saharanpur, Chandrashekhar Azad was put under house arrest as he was planning to meet families of those affected in last week’s violence. Azad accused govt of “using police to silence victims and opposition voices” and demanded an impartial probe into the violence.“Following a letter from Bareilly district magistrate, police force from Fatehpur and Dehat police stations were deployed outside Azad’s house in Chhutmalpur area of Saharanpur. His presence in Bareilly might lead to law-and-order issues in that city,” Saharanpur SSP Ashish Tiwari told TOI.On Wednesday, two Congress leaders — Saharanpur MP Imran Masood and former MP from Amroha Kunwar Danish Ali —were put under house arrest to stop them from visiting Bareilly.","Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon.

'Pakistan Could Not Kill Him But...': Father On Kargil War Veteran Killed In Ladakh Clashes

Poll Do you think Ladakh should have more local governance powers? Yes, more autonomy is needed No, current administration is sufficient

LEH: At Martyrs’ Park, about 1km from the Ladakh Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) office, the gate stood open during curfew relaxation. Inside, chairs were stacked and a tent was dismantled. Labourers were quietly loading chairs, tent covers and iron rods into a vehicle, their faces grim.It was here that environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh. “We provide tents on rent. They called us to take it back,” a worker said. Startled at the sight of a reporter, he said, “Please go away, cops will come and we will be in trouble.”A woman entered with her child. “I was on hunger strike on Sept 24 when the situation worsened outside,” she said. “Out of fear, some of us ran in different directions. My husband later picked me up. I came back to collect my belongings.”On Sept 24, security forces opened fire on protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status, killing four and injuring dozens. Wangchuk called off his hunger strike hours later. Authorities said the police fired in self-defence after protesters tried to set ablaze a vehicle carrying security personnel.Police also claimed that without CRPF deployment, “the whole of Leh would have burnt”.Outside the park, another woman voiced her anger. “Why were people fired upon? Four people are dead. Will they give us Sixth Schedule?”About 1km away BJP’s Ladakh office, which was set on fire, was under heavy guard with spools of concertina wire around it. Cops prohibit photography of the building.At the LAHDC-Leh office, the main gate was open but there was no one there. “Since Sept 24, chief executive officer Tashi Gyalson and others haven’t come to office. In fact, no one comes,” a peon said.Mustafa Ladakhi, 36, a PhD from JNU, is among a growing number of Ladakhis at the country’s top universities concerned about home. At a hotel near Leh airport, he said the region is still in shock.“On Sept 24, my mother was on a hunger strike led by Wangchuk. There was chaos when she called me. I found her in the middle of the road. I will never forget the pain that day brought to Ladakhis,” he said. “No official has stepped down. There is no empathy. There is no apology. Instead, we are accused in the national media of destabilising the central govt... How can we be a threat when we have paid with our lives for the nation?”He argued that UT status without statehood had buried local governance under bureaucracy. “Instead of empowering local govt, we have the lieutenant governor’s office and its bureaucracy, commissioner secretaries, the DC’s office, and the police bureaucracy. They have nothing to do in Ladakh. All we see is pomp and a show of bureaucracy... Allow us to govern ourselves,” he said.“When we were part of J&K, AFSPA was never extended to Ladakh because govt knew we were Indian nationalists. Why this labelling now?” he asked.Ladakhi’s friend, a hotel owner, said, “I don’t want to talk about tourism. This is a colossal tragedy. Four deaths in a place like Ladakh are like 400 in Delhi. Sept 24 will remain etched in our memory.”In Upper Tukchal area of Leh, Rigzin Wangmo Lachic, president of All Ladakh Hotel and Guest House Association, echoed similar sentiments and demanded a judicial inquiry. “The events have shattered us and left a wound on our collective soul,” she said.At a hotel serving Kashmiri wazwan on Oct 1, during curfew relaxation, the receptionist from Doda said he no longer felt safe. “I’ve been here 10 years and never faced hostility. But after the lieutenant governor described workers from Doda and Nepal as ‘external forces’ responsible for the crisis, we are not stepping out much.”As curfew returned, shops shut ahead of the 6 pm deadline. “We comply with every direction. But govt must fulfil our four demands, including Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Gelek Punchok, 42, a member of Leh Apex Body, said. Punchok was outside the district jail, with many others, to receive around 26 prisoners released Thursday after they were given bail. Many of the released detainees said they had nothing to do with the Sept 24 violence but stated that they were with the “peaceful” struggle for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region.

NEW DELHI: Assam Police on Thursday filed murder charges against late Assamese singer Zubeen Garg ’s long-time manager and the organiser of the festival in Singapore where he died, a senior officer said.Garg’s manager, Siddharth Sharma, and Shyamkanu Mahanta, the chief organiser of the North East India Festival, were arrested on Wednesday. Mahanta was apprehended at Delhi airport upon arrival from Singapore, while Sharma was taken into custody in Gurugram, Haryana. Both were flown under tight security to Guwahati, Assam, and a court remanded them to 14-day police custody.“The investigation is ongoing, and I cannot share much detail. We have added Section 103 of the BNS in the FIR now,” Munna Prasad Gupta, Special DGP of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Assam Police, told reporters, according to PTI.Section 103 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) pertains to the punishment for murder, prescribing either death or life imprisonment along with a fine. Sharma and Mahanta have also been booked under sections relating to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, criminal conspiracy, and causing death by negligence.Zubeen Garg, a cultural icon in Assam, passed away on September 19, a day before the North East India Festival was scheduled to begin. He was in Singapore to mark the 60th year of India-Singapore diplomatic relations and celebrate the India-ASEAN Year of Tourism through the festival. The incident occurred at St. John’s Island, where Garg was pulled out of the water unconscious and rushed to a hospital, but succumbed the same day.Meanwhile, his wife, Garima Saikia Garg, told reporters she was ""satisfied"" that Sharma and Mahanta had been brought to Assam, adding, “We are all waiting to know what happened to him in his last moments.” She expressed ""full faith"" in the investigative team, hoping they would soon establish the exact sequence of events.The BJP-led Assam government has constituted a 10-member team to probe the singer’s death. The opposition Congress had also called for an investigation, suggesting it be conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation.","Assam Police on Thursday filed murder charges against late Assamese singer Zubeen Garg ’s long-time manager and the organiser of the festival in Singapore where he died.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.

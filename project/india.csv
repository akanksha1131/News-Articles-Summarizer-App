NIA courts

must be set up with proper infra: SC

NEW DELHI The Supreme Court has said the Centre, along with the judiciary, must devise a plan to complete trials in NIA cases within six months to prevent ""hue and cry"" over prolonged bail denial.A bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh said on Tuesday, ""We want a system committed for expeditious completion of trials, preferably in six months, so that a hue and cry over non-grant of bail (for long periods to accused) is not raised, especially in cases involving crimes against nation and public at large.""For this, dedicated NIA courts must be established with proper infrastructure, including wi-fi services, to enable appearance of accused through virtual mode and prevent unnecessary adjournments, Justice Kant said after additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati handed over a status report framed by ministry of home affairs on setting up of exclusive NIA courts. After studying the status report, the bench commended the initiative but said the process must be expedited. It told Bhati that a firm decision on the proposed plan of action must be taken on or before Dec 16, the next date of hearing.Justice Kant also told Delhi HC not to saddle the exclusive NIA courts with regular cases. The HC informed the SC that there are 50 NIA cases pending in Delhi, two in Karkardooma courts and 48 at Patiala House courts.Additional solicitor general S D Sanjay told the court that the govt is planning to set up 10-12 exclusive courts but finding space for them immediately has been difficult. The bench said the authorities must explore govt buildings for temporary accommodation of the courts till a permanent building is constructed for them.","NIA courts must be established with proper infrastructure, including wi-fi services, says CJI-designate Surya Kant.

NEW DELHI: While dissenting with CJI B R Gavai on the court's recall of the May 16 judgment of the SC authored by Justices A S Oka and him directing demolition of all structures which were granted post-facto environmental clearance, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan trained his criticism on the CJI and said the majority opinion of the court had overlooked the very fundamentals of environment jurisprudence.It was natural of Justice Bhuyan, who was part of the bench that penned the May 16 judgment, to defend the sanctity of that verdict in the face of many errors pointed out by CJI. But his statement that the CJI's judgment was ""an innocent expression of opinion"" overlooking fundamentals of environment jurisprudence raised many eyebrows, as it is widely known that Justice Gavai, as head of the green bench, has passed many judgments for the protection of environment and forests while advocating the concept of 'sustainable development'.In his 97-page counter to the CJI's 84-page recall judgment, Justice Bhuyan said, ""Precautionary principle is the cornerstone of environmental jurisprudence. 'Polluter pays' is only a principle of reparation. Precautionary principle cannot be given a short shrift by relying on the polluter pays principle. The review judgment is a step in retrogression.""After pronouncing his judgment, CJI Gavai recalled that there was a precedent in Court room no.1 for a dissenting judgment to criticise that of the CJI and the CJI responding to the dissenting view (as happened between Justice S R Bhat and CJI D Y Chandrachud in the same-sex marriage issue).""I am departing from tradition. I have not changed a single word in my judgment even after receiving the dissenting judgment (of Justice Bhuyan),"" CJI Gavai said.When Justice Bhuyan skipped reading paragraphs in his judgment criticising the CJI's view and said he ""didn't want to read certain undercurrents"", Justice Gavai encouraged him to read it and said, ""Anyway this would be in public domain. So read it.""But Justice Bhuyan was not persuaded.Justice K Vinod Chandran said he had written a separate judgment concurring with CJI only because ""the (Justice Bhuyan's) opinion rejecting the review denounces the one permitting it."" Justice Chandran said dissent is part of a healthy judicial process, but it must be practised by distancing oneself from an overbearing allegiance to one's own beliefs of right and wrong.Giving a step-by-step counter to Justice Bhuyan's judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""The judgment under review, with due respect did not look into the aspects of the power conferred under the Environment Protection Act and the legal principles regarding an undertaking given in derogation of the statutory provisions.""He added, ""I fully concur with the opinion of the Learned Chief Justice of India and find the review to be not only warranted, but imperative and expedient.""","Justice Ujjal Bhuyan said the majority opinion of the court had overlooked the very fundamentals of environment jurisprudence.

Hidma's death may help forces end Naxalism by Amit Shah deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hidmas-death-may-help-forces-end-naxalism-by-amit-shah-deadline/articleshow/125423773.cms,"The Ghost Of Bastar Falls: What Madvi Hidma’s Death Means For India’s War Against Maoist Insurgency

Was he ready to surrender when he was shot?

NEW DELHI: The neutralisation of Madvi Hidma, the youngest CPI (Maoist) central committee member and yet its most dreaded military commander, came 12 days ahead of the Nov 30, 2025 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah for the counter-Naxal forces to end his terror run. Hidma's exit may have brought the security establishment realistically close to achieving the March 31, 2026 goal set by home minister Amit Shah for eliminating left-wing extremist violence from the country.As on date, the CPI (Maoist) central committee's strength stands eroded to seven, including the three politburo members Thippiri Tirupathi alias Devji, Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy and Misir Besra. Ganapathy is in his seventies and Misir Besra confined to a small area in Jharkhand with little cadre strength. The remaining four 'active' CC members are Ganesh Uikey, Anal Da, Malla Raji Reddy alias Sangram and Ramder.Sources told TOI that after Shah declared last year that Naxalism shall be uprooted by March 31, 2026, he has been giving the security forces mini-goals or milestones to be achieved along the way. These milestones could be freeing a certain area from Maoists' hold or tackling the top CPI (Maoist) leadership by getting them to surrender or, where unwilling, neutralising them in intelligence-based operations. Sources said Shah, while chairing recent reviews on left-wing extremism, had directed the forces to neutralise Hidma latest by Nov 30.Hidma, who had commanded the dreaded Battalion No 1 of the Peoples' Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) before passing on the baton to Barse Deva, was the only Bastar tribal to be anointed to CC.The forces had been on his trail for years but Hidma remained elusive. Though Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma had on Nov 10 approached Hidma's mother to appeal to him to surrender, he did not respond.The killing of Hidma, given how crucial he was to CPI (Maoist)'s operational capabilities, ""is a historic milestone in the fight against left wing extremism,"" IG, Bastar Range Sundarraj P told TOI. He said the remaining Maoist leaders of concern are Devji, Sangram, Ganesh Uikey, Ramder as well as Barse Deva and Pappa Rao. The assessment is that no more than 100-150 uniformed, armed, full-time Maoist cadres may be active, possibly in the National Park area, Gariyaband or inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh-Telangana and Andhra-Odisha. ""Some may surrender after Hidma's killing. But those who don't, shall be confronted by the security forces,"" he said.The year 2025 has dealt a debilitating blow to the Maoists, with many top leaders killed or having surrendered. The most prominent PB leader to be eliminated was general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao, while Mallujola Venugopal Rao alias Sonu surrendered. The CC members neutralised this year include Kadari Satyanarayan Reddy, Katta Ramchandra Reddy, Chalapati, Gajrala Ravi, Vivek Chandri Yadav and Thentu Laxmi. Other CC members who surrendered are Sujata, Chandranna and Rupesh.Telangana cops said Hidma had dropped enough hints about a possible surrender and they were working on it. Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma had met his mother, after which she strongly urged Hidma to give up arms. A Bastar journalist said Hidma wrote to him last week that he was considering surrender and sought help to negotiate with the govt.","Madvi Hidma was the youngest CPI (Maoist) central committee member and yet its most dreaded military commander.

Narayana Murthy Sparks Fresh Storm By Urging to Adopt China’s 996 Model, Work 72 Hours Every Week

When hard work turns into hard living

India Work-Life Balance Survey 2024

India is already working long weeks

A moment where social media spoke for the workforce

There is another way to work

Why balance matters to young professionals

Fair pay

Predictable hours

Time to rest

Mental stability

Supportive management

Opportunities to grow without losing personal time

A new direction for corporate India

India has been arguing about work life balance for years. Long hours, late-night calls, weekend emails, and the pressure to stay reachable have become routine across workplaces. Many workers say the system drains energy and leaves no room to disconnect. Each time the debate begins to slow down, a familiar voice pushes it back into the spotlight. Infosys founder N. R. Narayana Murthy has done that more than once. His views on discipline and long work hours often trigger responses because they cut close to what young professionals experience every day.His latest comment has renewed the debate. In an interview with Republic TV, Murthy said, “There is a saying in China, 9, 9, 6. You know what it means? 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week. And that is a 72-hour work week,” and added that young Indians should follow the same routine. The pushback was immediate. For Indian workforce, Murthy's remark does not match the conditions they live with. Through various social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, they pointed to long commutes, rising expenses, uneven salaries, and a growing culture of after-hours communication. Many argued that extending the workday is not a solution for a system that already stretches people beyond capacity.The reaction showed how clearly the workforce understands its limits and what it wants from the future.Working long hours has not translated into better results. Many young professionals already spend most of their day working or travelling. The strain shows up in energy levels, mental focus, and motivation.Indeed'sfound that 88 percent of Indian employees receive work-related messages outside official hours. It also showed that 85 percent are contacted during sick leave or holidays. These interruptions have blurred the line between personal time and office responsibilities. The report linked poor balance to burnout, with 52 percent of workers identifying it as a major cause. The findings highlight a pattern where effort is rising but recovery time is shrinking.This is not about a workforce avoiding responsibility. It is about workers who feel stretched because work follows them everywhere.International Labour Organisation (ILO) data from early 2025 shows that Indian employees work an average of 46.7 hours a week. More than half work beyond 49 hours. These numbers are higher than the working hours in Western Europe. The ILO report notes that extended schedules affect mental health, family time, and long-term well-being.For many workers, a large part of the day is already taken up by long tasks and traffic. The idea of increasing hours feels out of sync with how people live and work today.Murthy’s statement moved quickly across social platforms. The responses offered a clear view of how workers interpret the reality of their jobs and personal lives.Before the first wave of reactions, many young Indians drew a comparison they often make when this topic reappears. They pointed to regions where work is structured around life, not the other way around. This led into one of the first viral posts.Many young workers pointed out that other regions structure work in a way that leaves space for life.As the discussion intensified, the next theme surfaced. Workers said compensation shapes how much time they are willing to put in. A longer workweek, some argued, might be negotiable if pay matched global standards.Others said they would consider longer hours if pay matched the effort and global benchmarks.A third set of comments focused on everyday economic realities. Many said expectations must reflect the infrastructure, wages, and costs that define life in India today.Some reactions reminded leaders that work expectations must match the wider economic reality of everyday life in India.There was also pushback to the China comparison. Users noted that China itself has taken steps to limit extreme hours.Many users also corrected the narrative by pointing out what Murthy left out about China’s work culture.Taken together, these reactions reflected a collective voice. Workers spoke about pay, time, and the need for a system that respects boundaries.Many comments compared India to Europe. In several European countries, a shorter workday and a fixed workweek help people maintain stability. Evenings are available for rest, and weekends are not extensions of office hours. The idea is not to replicate another country’s model. It is to recognise that balance supports better performance than exhaustion.Work life balance is a core expectation for this generation. It helps build sustainable careers and supports learning, decision-making, and long-term growth. High stress leads to errors, low engagement, and higher attrition.Young workers are asking for conditions that let them contribute without feeling worn out. They want:They want careers that push them forward, not lives that run on empty.If India wants stronger growth, it needs to focus on how work is structured. This includes reducing inefficiency, setting clear expectations, and respecting personal boundaries. Companies need systems that allow workers to stay productive without sacrificing their well-being.India’s young workforce is ready to contribute with purpose. What they need is a culture that supports both work and life.This debate is not about resistance. It is about sustainability. Young workers want a future where effort produces progress, not exhaustion.","Infosys co-founder N. R. Narayana Murthy urged India to adopt China’s 996 Model, Work 72 Hours Every Week.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial- killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli. The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125365659,imgsize-46652,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

No dispute, just different points of view: NDA neta

NEW DELHI: BJP and JDU are resisting their ally LJP(RV)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new Bihar govt, which will be sworn in on Thursday.Leaders of the two main NDA parties held long discussions on Tuesday, with sources indicating that BJP may retain the post of assembly Speaker. There is also a buzz that JDU, too, is interested in having the Speaker's chair, but sources said it was more an expression of aspirations as the two allies worked out the details of the new govt.It is learnt that Union minister Chirag Paswan-led LJP(RV), which has 19 MLAs and brings crucial Dalit votes to the alliance, is keen on having a deputy CM from its quota.BJP has two deputy CMs in the outgoing govt and is expected to keep the post to itself in the new dispensation as well. The name of Arun Bharti, the member of Lok Sabha from Jamui and Chirag's brother-in-law, was doing the rounds in political circles as LJP's choice for the position of deputy CM.Home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda held talks with JDU working president Sanjay Jha and Lalan Singh, the regional party's presence in the Modi cabinet, as the composition of the new govt is likely to be somewhat different from the outgoing one due to the rise in JDU's numbers and entry of two new parties - LJP(RV) and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha.It is natural for allies to have different points of view in thrashing out the details of a govt with five parties. But there is no dispute,"" a key functionary said.National Democratic Alliance won a thumping majority by bagging 202 seats in the 243-member assembly. BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, while JDU is close behind with 85. This contrasts starkly with the outgoing assembly in which BJP had 80 MLAs and JDU 43. This reflected in the power equation in the current govt in which BJP has 21 ministers as against 14 from its allies, including Nitish and an Independent MLA.This is for the first time that BJP and JDU have nearly equal strength. Until its number declined sharply in 2020, JDU was the dominant partner since they won their first state poll together in 2005. However, BJP has always endorsed Nitish's leadership.HAM(S) and RLM, having five and four MLAs each, are expected to get one berth in the new govt, while Paswan's party may bag two to three ministerial positions.BJP has two deputy CMs, one Kushwaha (OBC) and one Bhumihar (upper caste), in the outgoing govt. The party on Tuesday named an observer and two co-observers for the meeting of its legislature party to elect their leader. The choice of its three central leaders is rich on social messaging with Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, a prominent OBC face of the party in the state, being joined by Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, a Dalit, and former Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, who comes from most backward Nishad caste.Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, who has seen as a rapid rise in BJP, is current legislature party leader and is being seen as a frontrunner for the position again.A joint meeting of NDA parties is expected to elect Nitish as their leader on Wednesday. PM Narendra Modi and Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah besides other NDA heavyweights will be joining the oath-taking ceremony to be held in Patna's sprawling Gandhi Maidan in the presence of a big crowd.","BJP and JDU are resisting their ally LJP(RV)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new Bihar govt.

Bad deal: Donald Trump may sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia; why India is worried,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bad-deal-donald-trump-may-sell-f-35s-to-saudi-arabia-why-india-is-worried/articleshow/125414045.cms,"‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal

President Donald Trump has confirmed that the United States will sell advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, marking a major policy shift that has raised alarm among Israeli and Indian officials over regional security implications.“I will say that we will be doing that, we’ll be selling F-35s,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on November 17, one day before hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. The announcement came despite concerns from Pentagon intelligence officials and key regional allies about the potential consequences of the sale.Saudi Arabia has requested to purchase as many as 48 F-35 fighters in what would be a multibillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin, making it the first Arab military to acquire the fifth-generation stealth aircraft.Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East operating F-35s.The Israeli Defense Forces delivered a formal position paper to political leadership on November 17 objecting to the sale, warning it could undermine Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region. The document stated that Israel’s air superiority depends on maintaining exclusive access to fifth-generation stealth aircraft, with long-range covert operations relying on that exclusivity.“Israel’s air superiority in the Middle East depends on maintaining exclusive access to fifth-generation stealth aircraft,” according to the IDF assessment obtained by Ynet. The military also warned that Saudi F-35 purchases could occupy production lines and delay Israeli orders for additional squadrons.Under US law, Israel is guaranteed weapons needed to maintain its qualitative military edge over Arab nations, though Trump administration officials have indicated they can provide assurances without specifying what additional capabilities would be offered to Israel.A Defense Intelligence Agency report warned that China could acquire the F-35's advanced technology if the sale proceeds, citing Beijing's defense ties with Riyadh. China is now Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner, and the two countries conducted joint naval exercises in recent years.India has also expressed concern about the potential transfer, particularly given a recent defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan stipulating that an attack on either nation would be considered an attack on both. Analysts warn the deal could enable Pakistan to gain indirect access to advanced US military equipment through Saudi Arabia.One Indian defense analyst told media outlets, “A Saudi F-35 fleet would strengthen Saudi Arabia’s air dominance, compelling regional rivals and other near-neighbors, including India, to reassess air and missile defense postures”. The introduction of such technology could trigger a fresh arms race across the Middle East and South Asia.",Saudi Arabia has requested to purchase as many as 48 F-35 fighters in what would be a multibillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

NEW DELHI: Lalu Prasad Yadav 's daughter Rohini Acharya, who disowned the family after RJD's Bihar poll debacle, took another potshot at brother Tejashwi Yadav , saying those who called her kidney ""impure"" should first ""donate their kidneys in his (Lalu's) name"" to the needy.Rohini said those who claim to do things in Lalu Yadav's name should ""stop offering false sympathy and instead step forward to donate their kidneys to the lakhs of poor patients in hospitals who are counting their final breaths for want of one"".""If they truly care about Lalu Ji, they should donate their kidneys in his name,"" she said in a dig at Tejashwi, who is RJD's heir apparent. Rohini also challenged Tejashwi to ""gather the courage to debate her openly on a public platform"".""Those who criticised a married daughter for donating her kidney to her father should gather the courage to debate her openly on a public platform,"" she said.Lalu's daughter also lashed out at Tejahswi's close aide, Sanjay Yadav, whom she called ""Haryanvi Mahapurush"" and accused ""Haryanvi troll armies"" of endlessly abusing her.""Let the act of this supreme donation, giving a kidney to someone in need, begin with those who called the daughter’s kidney ""impure.”Then let the so-called 'Haryanvi Mahapurush' come forward, followed by the pliant journalists and the Haryanvi troll armies who endlessly abuse me.

They are the ones who have expelled me from the family because they don’t want to take responsibility,” she told reporters.“The whole world is saying that we will ask questions to whoever becomes Chanakya. The party workers are asking Chanakya why the RJD has reached this state. If Sanjay, Rameez’s name is taken, you will be thrown out of the house and defamed. You will also be hit with slippers,” she added.Her remarks echoed the frustration she had earlier expressed in a social media post announcing that she was quitting politics and “disowning” her family.Hours after announcing publicly that she had severed ties with her family, Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claimed she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav, and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.Speaking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal 's (RJD) humiliating defeat in the Bihar assembly polls, Rohini said she was ""disgraced, abused, and even hit"" when she questioned Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.Later, Tej Pratap Yadav launched a strong attack on individuals within his family and RJD, accusing them of acting like “traitors” and warning that he would not accept any insult directed at his sister.In a post shared on his Janshakti Janta Dal party’s Instagram account, Tej Pratap warned those he described as “traitors” and made a heartfelt appeal to his father, Lalu Prasad Yadav.“Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances,” he wrote, adding: “Listen, traitors— If you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away.”The RJD, which was the largest party in the Mahagathbandhan, saw its tally collapse from 75 to just 25 seats -- one of its most disappointing performances since 2010. The dramatic slide, which resulted in the loss of over 100 seats to NDA allies, came despite the coalition uniting behind Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face.","Rohini Acharya says those who called her kidney ""impure"" should first ""donate their kidneys in his (Lalu's) name"" to the needy.

About the terror-tainted University

What happened on 10/11

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday arrestedThe prime accused, Dr Umar Un Nabi, was a former student of the university located in Haryana's Faridabad.The arrest comes, hours after the ED launched raids against the Al-Falah University along with its office in Okhla and the university's promoters as initial probe had revealed discrepancies regarding UGC and NAAC recognition.The central agency conducted raids at 25 different places across the national capital, intensifying the Delhi car blast probe. Nine shell firms connected to the group, each registered at the same address, are now under scrutiny.Preliminary inquiries found out several red flags typical of shell operations, such as: No actual office space or noticeable utility usage at their listed locations; the same phone number and email ID being used for multiple companies and accounts.It was found that there had been no EPFO or ESIC filings despite the scale of business they claim; repeated overlap in directors or authorised signatories with poor KYC documentation; very limited salary payments made through formal banking channels and no HR records; and a pattern of companies being incorporated in a coordinated manner using identical contact details.Al-Falah University, which started as an engineering college in 1997 in Faridabad's Dhauj, is run by Al-Falah Charitable Trust registered in Delhi's Okhla.It became a university in 2014 after UGC recognition.The trust is headed by Jawahar Ahmed Siddiqui, who is also chancellor of the varsity. The first medicine batch began in 2019, and it now has 200 MBBS seats and 50 MD seats.Over the years, the varsity has expanded its campus from 30 acres to over 70 acres through land acquisition from local villagers.University staffers, speaking anonymously, claimed the institution receives donations from Arab countries. ""Foreign fundraisers from Arab nations visit the campus once a year. Though the college is run by a charitable trust, it has donors outside the country,"" a staff member said.The varsity charges Rs 16 lakh annually for MBBS courses, while fees for MD programmes range from Rs 2.5 lakh for anatomy to around Rs 30 lakh per year for pediatrics.At least 15 people were killed and several others injured after a powerful explosion ripped through a Hyundai i20 car near the Lal Quila Metro Station on November 10.According to preliminary post-mortem findings, the victims sustained severe injuries, including multiple fractures and head trauma.The blast wave caused extensive internal damage, rupturing lungs, eardrums, and abdominal organs, while many victims showed deep wounds and heavy bleeding, suggesting they were thrown against hard surfaces by the force of the explosion.","ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked to Al- Falah University.

Anmol Bishnoi wanted for murders, extortion

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Fugitive Anmol Bishnoi, who is wanted for the murder of NCP neta Baba Siddique, has been deported from the US. Though there was no official confirmation, sources said that he was already en route to India late on Tuesday and was likely to land in Delhi around 10am on Wednesday. The NIA is coordinating the deportation.Anmol may be one of the passengers of a special chartered flight carrying around 200 'illegals', a source said, adding two other wanted fugitives from Punjab may also be on the flight. Confirming his deportation, Zeeshan, son of late Baba Siddique, told TOI he got an official notification from US Department of Homeland Security through email, informing him that Anmol had been ""removed"" from the US.The email was sent to him through DHS-VINE, a confidential web-based system that provides notifications to registrants who have been affected by crimes committed by an illegal immigrant in US custody.With no communication from US authorities to Mumbai police about his whereabouts, Zeeshan Siddiquie had sought information from US officials. The email from the Department of Homeland Security sent to Zeeshan Siddiqui and shared with TOI said, ""This email is to inform you ANMOL BISHNOI has been removed from the United States by the federal government.The offender was removed on Nov 18, 2025.""Anmol was held in Sacramento last Nov for illegal entry after which the FBI had confirmed his identity through a DNA and voice sample match. He had sought asylum there while he was lodged at the Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa. The prison facility's website, accessed by TOI at the time, had his details uploaded and mentioned his name as Anmol Bishnoi. It said he was being investigated by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which deals with cross-border crime and undocumented immigration in the US.It was the firing incident at actor Salman Khan's house in April last year that had put Anmol under spotlight. A facebook account, purportedly of Anmol, had in April last year claimed responsibility for the shooting. Subsequently, cops chanced upon an audio recording of a conversation purportedly between Anmol and Vicky Gupta, one of the shooters involved in the incident .Subsequently, Baba Siddique was shot dead on Oct 12 last year outside the Bandra (East) office of his MLA son, Zeeshan. Anmol was named in the chargesheet filed by Mumbai police in this case. Anmol was also accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Sidhu Moosewala, who was killed on May 29, 2022. Anmol had left the country on a forged passport in the name of Bhanu Pratap in April 2024, a month before the Punjabi singer was targeted. He had since been living in California along with his associates Goldy Brar and others.In Oct 2024, National Investigation Agency had announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh on Anmol, shortly after his alleged role in Siddiquie's murder. Mumbai police had subsequently approached a court to initiate the process for Anmol's extradition and also sent a communication to the MEA through MHA. Anmol's notoriety extends to a litany of crimes, with a staggering 18 cases registered against him for a range of offences, including extortion.A resident of Fazilka in Punjab, Anmol is named in two chargesheets filed by NIA in cases registered in 2022. Last year, NIA had filed a chargesheet against a dozen individuals, including Lawrence and Anmol. The chargesheet alleged the accused were part of a larger conspiracy aimed at unleashing a reign of terror and carrying out targeted assassinations of prominent social and religious leaders, film personalities, singers, and businessmen.","Fugitive Anmol Bishnoi, who is wanted for the murder of NCP neta Baba Siddique, has been deported from the US.

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishor on Tuesday said he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party’s poor performance in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. This was his first reaction after the poll verdict.Interacting with reporters in Patna, Kishor admitted: “We made an honest effort, but it was completely unsuccessful. There’s no harm in admitting this. Forget about systemic change; we couldn’t even bring about a change in power. But we certainly played some role in changing Bihar’s politics… There must have been some mistake in our efforts, in our thinking, in the way we explained that the public had not elected us. If the public did not show faith in us, then the responsibility for that is completely mine. I take that responsibility 100% on myself, that I could not win the faith of the people of Bihar.”Kishor has also vowed to observe a ‘maun upvas’ (vow of silence) for “failing to change the government”. As an act of atonement, he announced that he will undertake a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better. I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th,"" Kishor said.The Jan Suraaj Party got 0 seats in the election, a stunning outcome for a new entrant once pitched as the “third force” in the bitterly contested battle between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured 202 seats and the Mahagathbandhan (MGB), which won 35.Responding to questions on whether he would resign after the defeat, Kishor dismissed the idea. The Jan Suraaj chief said that he was not holding any official post to step down from.“What position am I holding that I should resign? I had said that if (JDU) gets more than 25 seats, I will retire. From which position should I resign? I did not say that I will leave Bihar. I have left politics. I do not do politics, but I did not say that I will stop speaking for the people of Bihar,” he said.Kishor also vowed to continue his campaign in Bihar with greater determination despite the setback. He said he would intensify his efforts on the ground and not retreat from his mission to reform the state.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better,” he said.He further acknowledged shortcomings in communicating his message to voters and said he would atone for it with a symbolic gesture.“I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th... We may have made mistakes, but we have not committed any crime. We have not committed the crime of spreading caste-based poison in society. We have not played Hindu-Muslim politics in Bihar. We have not committed the crime of dividing people in the name of religion. We have not committed the crime of giving money to the poor, innocent people of Bihar and buying their votes,"" Kishor added.For years, Prashant Kishor was regarded as one of India’s most successful political strategists and was known as the man behind a string of high-profile electoral wins.But his most anticipated venture, Jan Suraaj, has turned into a spectacular failure. Launched after an extended “padyatra” in Bihar, the party fielded 236 candidates, drawing heavily on social-media outreach and promising a new brand of politics focused on meritocracy, youth migration, jobs and improved governance.Despite the high-profile campaign, the party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats it contested. While Jan Suraaj had staked much on converting social-media traction into votes, the strategy evidently faltered in a state where caste affiliation, local networks and long-standing alliances retain deep influence.The Bihar Assembly elections were conducted in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the results declared on November 14.","Prashant Kishor says he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party's poor performance in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections.

She claimed she had been “driven out” of her parents’ home by associates of Tejashwi Yadav following the RJD’s poor showing in the Bihar assembly polls.Rohini, who donated a kidney to Lalu Prasad a few years ago and unsuccessfully contested the Saran Lok Sabha seat last year, expressed anguish over being accused of exploiting her medical sacrifice. In an emotional post, she said she had acted “without caring for the approval of my husband and my in-laws or for the well-being of my three children”.","Janshakti Janta Dal founder Tej Pratap Yadav on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to investigate allegations of ""mental and physical pressure"" on his parents.

Calm And Radical: Dr Umar’s Pre-Blast Video Exposes Educated New Face Of Terror Behind Delhi Attack

NEW DELHI: BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on the Congress after its MP Imran Masood referred to suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi as a “misguided youth”.Accusing the Opposition party of prioritising “vote bank niti over rashtra niti”, he said the Congress had repeatedly attempted to soften the perception of terror acts for political gain.Reacting to Congress leader's remarks, Poonawalla wrote on X: ""On a day that a chilling new video of suicide bomber Umar Nabi has emerged where he is seen justifying his act of terror before carrying out the attack near Delhi's Red Fort, Congress MP Imran Masood calls him “bhatka hua yuva” (misguided youth).""The Congress MP has described suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi as a “misguided youth”, stressing that his actions were against both Islam and the nation.“The video that has come (of accused Umar Ul Nabi), I do not agree with that video at all. Suicide is not permissible in Islam under any circumstances. By killing innocent people along with yourself, you are acting against the country. These are misguided people whose words cannot present the picture of Islam,” he said speaking to reporters.Investigators recovered the footage during the probe, in which Umar Un Nabi is seen calmly defending what he calls a “martyrdom operation,” an attempt to justify the suicide blast he would later execute near the Red Fort.In the undated video, he argues that suicide attacks are “misunderstood” and claims such operations are carried out with absolute certainty of death as an act of religious duty.Sitting alone in a room, he speaks without hesitation, insisting that the act he is preparing for should not be viewed as suicide, but as a form of martyrdom. Officials believe the video was created to brainwash others and radicalise more educated youth into joining the terror module.Poonawalla also alleged that other Opposition leaders had done the same in the past by downplaying terror and defending those involved in such acts.“Earlier Hussain Dalwai, Chidambaram, Mehbooba Mufti, Tariq Anwar, Abu Azmi of SP labelled the terrorists as innocent or justified their acts by saying ‘circumstances’ were responsible,” Poonwalla further wrote in his post.Poonawalla alleged that the Congress has a long history of downplaying terror for political gain and pointed to past instances to support his charge.He further wrote on X: “This is nothing but keeping Votebank Niti above Rashtra Niti. Congress has become Muslim League Maowadi Congress. From defending Afzal & Yakub & Batla terrorists to shielding Naxals and justifying Umar’s actions.”Last week, former home minister P Chidambaram had questioned the Centre over what he called the rising threat of “homegrown terrorism” following the arrests linked to the blast.Similarly, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti had alleged that the government was projecting “false normalcy” in Jammu & Kashmir and claimed the national security situation had worsened, citing the Red Fort incident as an example.The Red Fort blast on November 10 killed 15 people and injured several others. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has taken over the probe, has so far arrested multiple accused linked to a terror module inspired by groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and ISIS and is investigating the full conspiracy behind the attack.",Congress MP Imran Masood called suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi a'misguided youth' Shehzad Poonawalla said the Congress has a long history of downplaying terror for political gain.

NEW DELHI: In a huge relief to Union and state govts, Supreme Court on Tuesday recalled its May 16 judgment in which it had directed demolition of public projects worth Rs 20,000 crore as these were granted ex-post facto environmental clearance (EC) after payment of penalty.Steel Authority of India, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, and Karnataka govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, had sought recall of the SC judgment, which had said that despite the payment of penalty, all projects - those being executed and even those operationalised - must be stopped and demolished.A bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ujjal Bhuyan by a 2-1 majority agreed to recall the judgment. CJI Gavai, in the majority view, said if the judgment is not recalled, it will result in demolition of buildings or projects constructed with Rs 20,000 crore of public exchequer money. AIIMS in Odisha, and a greenfield airport in Karnataka were among the projects cited by the CJI.The Chief Justice cited three such projects - AIIMS in Odisha, a greenfield airport in Karnataka, and a huge effluent treatment plant. Apart from this, CREDAI had pointed out that several of its projects also faced a similar fate.CJI Gavai said the May 16 judgment suffered from a dichotomy as, on the one hand, it had allowed mining companies to suspend their operations and seek post-facto environmental clearance (EC) and resume operations after paying compensation, while, on the other, it faulted ex-post facto EC to public projects and ordered their demolition.The solicitor general placed before SC details of 24 central projects worth Rs 8,293 crore pending for approval and another 29 projects worth Rs 11,169 crore in states languishing for lack of approval. Mehta said all these projects have got EIA (environmental impact assessment) clearance and are awaiting final environmental clearance.Because of an SC stay on Jan 2, 2024, environmental clearance could not be granted to these projects. If these projects, nearing completion, are demolished just because they were given ex-post facto EC, it would have a devastating impact on public interest and the exchequer, he said.CJI Gavai weighed the question: ""Whether it would be in the public interest to demolish all such projects and permit the money spent from the pocket of the public exchequer to go in the dustbin?""Justice Gavai said, ""If the judgment under review is not recalled, it will have serious consequences in terms of demolition of projects which are either completed or about to be completed soon and which are of vital public importance constructed out of the public exchequer... and thousands of crores of rupees would go in waste."" Demolition of a large number of buildings would also create more pollution, he added.Justice Bhuyan, who was part of the bench presided by Justice A S Oka which had authored the May 16 judgment, dissented and said the verdict does not warrant interference.Criticising CJI Gavai's opinion as an innocent one overlooking the fundamentals of environment jurisprudence, he said, ""Precautionary principle is the cornerstone of environmental jurisprudence. 'Polluter pays' is only a principle of reparation. Precautionary principle cannot be given a short shrift by relying on polluter pays principle. The review judgment is a step in retrogression.""","Supreme Court on Tuesday recalled its May 16 judgment in which it had directed demolition of public projects worth Rs 20,000 crore.

New Delhi: India’s celebrated astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla said with a smile on Tuesday that the “homework given by PM Narendra Modi 'pura hua hai, chal raha hai, aur badta hi ja raha hai' (has been completed, yet it is still going on as the scope of the homework is increasing by the day)”. On a serious note, Shux said that results of the seven Isro-devised microgravity experiments conducted by him on ISS during his 18-day stay there are being analysed after samples of his work have come back to Earth in batches, and that learnings from his ISS mission are being used for Gaganyaan planning.Speaking on the sidelines of India International Space Conclave organised by Indian Space Association (ISpA) here, Shukla told TOI, “For me, bigger learning from the seven experiments has been how to conduct these tests in space because it is easy to conduct such experiments on Earth, but difficult to do them there. Whatever experience I gained on ISS, we have made a template of that. We are now comparing what we were doing earlier (in Gaganyaan programme) with what is happening now, to identify the gaps. ”On progress on India’s spaceflight mission, Shux said, “Gaganyaan is a developmental programme — training and development are happening together. As per my knowledge, Gaganyaan-G1 (uncrewed mission) will be conducted early next year and Gaganyaan-G2 (uncrewed mission with humanoid Vyommitra) will be in early 2027.”Shux said he has shared his ISS experiences with three other Indian astronaut-candidates — Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, Ajit Krishnan and Angad Pratap — as they have been training together. Shux, who is also a seasoned IAF test pilot, said, “As part of our training, I have to go back to flying fighter jets, which I will do in December.”He said, “When you cross the boundary of space (Karman line), you are given a number, and I was No. 634, which is not a top number to remember”. But when I came back, kids told me: “We didn't know that there was an ISS in space before you went. We cared because you were there.”Urging the youth to dream big, he added, “We are in the golden age as far as space exploration is concerned. I want all youngsters to be focused and contribute to the space sector actively. Every boy or girl of India who dreams of becoming an astronaut can realise their dream in today's India. We have established extremely ambitious goals — Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035, human landing on Moon by 2040 and Viksit Bharat by 2047 — but for us to achieve that, all of us have to be active participants. Sky was never the limit. Not for me, not for you and not for Bharat.”Space minister Jitendra Singh, who was the chief guest at the conference, said, “Space reforms in the last five years have been a turning point. Earlier, our space economy was dispersed and was not even considered a part of the economy. Today, the Indian space economy is worth $8 billion and the pace at which it is moving, the projection is that in the next 10 years, it will go up to $44-45 billion. In times to come, space is going to be an important contributor to the growth of India's economy as we move up the ranks. ”",Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla said results of the seven microgravity experiments conducted by him during his 18-day stay there are being analysed.

J&K Police Confirm 9 Killed in Nowgam Blast After Explosives Recovered From Faridabad Blows Up

SRINAGAR: A thunderclap of fire, concrete, and smoke tore through Nowgam police station in Srinagar’s upscale Sheikhpora neighbourhood close to 11.30pm on Nov 14. While sirens lagged behind, a hospital guard and a cook were already on the move.Ulfat Dar, a young guard at Ujala Cygnus Hospital nearly a km away, saw the orange flare crest the skyline after the explosion. He thought it was a cylinder blast. He still ran. “Drive,” he told Waseem, a hospital cook. They swung an ambulance towards the station.“They were among the first to reach,” Ujala Cygnus manager Dr Parvez Sofi said Tuesday. In their first dash they hauled eight wounded policemen out of debris and flame. More followed in two additional runs. On the last, they pried free a trapped officer whose legs were pinned under a slab. He lived.Sofi rushed from his Hyderpora home, 10km away. When he arrived, Ulfat and Waseem had already crowded the emergency floor with casualties. “Blood everywhere. Screams,” he said. He triggered internal WhatsApp alerts. CT technicians, trauma teams, emergency physicians — everyone surged in.Doctors treated lacerations, fractures, splinter wounds, and multiple head traumas. One officer arrived with massive brain bleed. Four went to ICU. Others were stabilised. Psychologists and psychiatrists were later pressed into service as several officers sat mute for hours, some suffering ear injuries from pressure waves.Senior officers visited and offered backup beds in govt hospitals. “We told them we could handle it,” Sofi said. By dawn, the count stood at 23 patients. Most are expected to be discharged in coming days.Sofi has worked mass-casualty wards before — he recalls 2008 at Govt Bone and Joint Hospital in Srinagar — but said nothing equalled the force of Friday night. “I’m used to trauma,” he said. “This was horrifying.”Ujala Cygnus has stepped into crises before. In April, when a CRPF bus skidded near Doodhpathri in Budgam, the hospital received every injured trooper and referred none. On Tuesday, J&K CM Omar Abdullah stopped by to meet the wounded policemen.What Sofi remembers most this time is not the rubble, or the blood, or the screams. It’s the scene that came before all that: a guard and a cook steering an ambulance straight towards a blast.","A powerful explosion rocked Nowgam police station in Srinagar, prompting an immediate response from a hospital guard and cook who rushed wounded officers to Ujala Cygnus Hospital.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah said Tuesday he was hopeful an ongoing probe would explain how a late-night blast tore through Srinagar’s Nowgam police station Friday, killing nine and wounding 30. Police earlier described the explosion as accidental.“It is sad so many lost their precious lives — police personnel, FSL staff, civil administration workers, and even people with no link to govt, like a tailor,” Omar told reporters after visiting a private hospital treating the wounded. “How did it happen? Why did it happen? The investigation has begun. I hope people will get answers, because this should not have happened.”The police station had recently probed alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed posters in Nowgam’s Bonpora locality on Oct 19, a case that exposed an alleged interstate terrorist module involving doctors and others. That network is linked to the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast.Omar pressed for clarity on the explosives. “How was such a large quantity brought here? Under what circumstances was it brought? In what conditions was it kept? Under what circumstances was it being handled? Slowly, we will get answers,” he said.The blast levelled the station, killing a special investigation agency officer, three forensic science laboratory personnel, two revenue officials, and a tailor attached to the premises. Thirty others — 27 policemen, two revenue staffers, and three civilians — were wounded.Omar also visited families of those killed. “This tragedy has taken away people who served with sincerity and courage. Their loss is a loss for all of Jammu & Kashmir,” he said. He promised full support to the families “in this hour of unimaginable pain.”On Monday, LG Manoj Sinha ruled out any alleged terrorist plot or outside interference. Sinha praised J&K police for dismantling what he called “a pan-India terrorist module” and said their work had “saved countless lives by preventing a series of planned attacks across the country”.He expressed “profound grief” over the Nowgam deaths. “Tragically, we lost brave J&K police personnel and officials.

He added that once the entire Ahmadabad-Mumbai bullet train corridor is operational, the train will cover the stretch in less than two hours.The announcements came barely days after PM Narendra Modi visited Surat station.Earlier, Vaishnaw had said that the inaugural run would be on a 50 km stretch between Surat and Billimore. The minister’s new statement is being seen as an indication of the increased pace of progress.Vaishnaw told reporters, “The bullet train will cover the distance between Mumbai and Ahmedabad in one-hour-and-58 minutes while stopping at four stations. However, if it stops at all 12 stations, the entire distance will be covered in 2 hours and 17 minutes.” The entire project is likely to be completed in 2029.Despite the new commitment to the bullet train’s inaugural run, there is a lack of clarity on whether a Japanese Shinkansen or Indian made high speed train will operate on its first run.The country’s first 508-km long high-speed rail corridor is being constructed between Sabarmati (Ahmedabad) and Mumbai to operate a bullet train at 320 kmph. The foundation stone for the project was laid in 2017 and was initially planned to be ready by Dec 2023. However, land acquisition, forest clearance and other issues delayed the project.On Modi’s recent visit, the minister said the PM was happy with the pace of progress. “He said that whatever we have learnt from the project must be used elsewhere, not only in railways and other high speed projects, but in other different sectors as well. We have done one innovation after the other in this project. It is a complex project and the biggest challenge was its design,” Vaishnaw said.","India’s first bullet train will now cover a 100-km distance between Surat and Vapi in Gujarat during its inaugural run in August 2027.

"India slips 13 ranks, figures at 23rd position in latest Climate Change Performance Index",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-slips-13-ranks-figures-at-23rd-position-in-latest-climate-change-performance-index/articleshow/125419895.cms,"EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?

NEW DELHI: India slipped 13 ranks to figure at the 23rd position in the latest Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), which was released by environmental think tank Germanwatch on the sidelines of the ongoing UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil on Tuesday.It’s the biggest fall of India on the CCPI ranking in the recent past even as it remained in the top 10 high-performing countries for six years in a row till 2024. India, which ranked 31st in 2014, entered the top 10 list for the first time in 2019.The annual CCPI uses a standardised framework to compare the climate performance of 63 countries and the EU, which put together, account for over 90% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The performance of countries is assessed in four categories — GHG emission, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy.India, in fact, is one of the biggest fallers in this year’s ranking despite performing well above global average in terms of increasing its renewable energy footprints. The country has, for instance, made substantial progress, achieving nearly 14% share of renewables in its total energy mix from 2015 to 2023.Besides, its non-fossil sources of energy now account for more than half of the country’s total electric power installed capacity (currently around 256 GW).What’s the reason behind India’s fall in the ranking? One of the authors of CCPI, Jan Burck of Germanwatch, attributed the decline to a combination of factors, including the steadily rising trend of the country’s GHG emissions in recent years. India, in fact, ranked last in terms of emission trends.“At the same time, energy consumption is increasing. India has also lost many places in climate policy rankings mainly due to its lack of a plan to phase out coal or even a concrete phase-out date. If India will reduce the building of new coal power plants and continue the promising trend for renewables, the country can achieve a much better ranking again next year,” said Burck.Denmark, the UK and Morocco took the lead in this year’s CCPI as fourth, fifth and sixth rankers in the list with the top three ranks remaining vacant like the previous years in absence of a perfect score to any country.China (54th), Russia (64th), the US (65th) and Saudi Arabia (67th) are the G20’s worst-performing countries, receiving an overall very low score. With Iran at 66th rank, Russia, the US and Saudi Arabia are the four last-placed countries in CCPI.Published annually by the Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network since 2005, the CCPI tracks countries’ efforts to combat climate change. It serves as an independent tool that tracks the climate mitigation performance of 63 countries and the EU. “It aims to enhance transparency in international climate politics and enables comparison of climate mitigation efforts and progress made by individual countries,” said the CCPI 2026 report.","India slipped 13 ranks to figure at the 23rd position in the latest Climate Change Performance Index.

Simultaneously, the govt on Tuesday launched an online platform that allows beneficiaries to share their feedback on ration distribution through AI-enabled calls in their preferred language.Confirming the deletion of ineligible beneficiaries, food secretary Sanjeev Chopra said the exercise has been undertaken to ensure better targeting of “rightful” beneficiaries while eligible beneficiaries are being added to the scheme by state govts.Officials said the food and public distribution department at the Centre identified the ineligible beneficiaries on parameters such as deceased, income tax payee, govt service, four-wheeler ownership and directors of entities. The list was shared with state govts for verification and then deletion of names.To ensure that beneficiaries are getting the right quality of foodgrain and are not being charged, food and consumer affairs minister Pralhad Joshi launched the Anna Sahayata Holistic AI Solution (Asha) to collect direct beneficiary feedback on ration quantity, quality and payment-related issues.The system uses multilingual translation, sentiment analysis, automated grievance categorisation and real-time dashboards for administrators.The platform will “enable us to get granular sentiment insights up to the ration shop level for strengthening data-driven decision-making under the food security scheme,” said an official.The food secretary said Rs 5 lakh will be spent every month for this operation and added that the cost would have been much higher if done through call centres.","Over two crore ineligible beneficiaries have been weeded out from free foodgrain scheme PMGKAY.

He said that despite several offers from the erstwhile rulers, the Guru refused to bow before tyranny and chose the path of martyrdom to defend freedom of religion.Kejriwal said Guru Tegh Bahadur is remembered across the world as the first martyr who sacrificed his life for the protection of human rights.CM Mann said Guru Tegh Bahadur's sacrifice for the protection of faith and righteousness transformed the course of India's history.He said that on this occasion, homage and deep respect are paid to Pandit Kirpa Ram, who had unwavering faith in the Sikh faith.Mann said Pandit Kirpa Ram was a resident of the town of Mattan, located about 65 kilometres from Srinagar. Kashmiri Pandits sought refuge with Guru Tegh Bahadur under Pandit Ram's leadership to protect their religion.The chief minister said it is a matter of immense pride and satisfaction that Kashmiri Pandits will also participate in the 'Nagar Kirtan' (religious procession) being organised from Srinagar, a beautiful reflection of communal harmony and brotherhood.He said the sacrifices of Guru Tegh Bahadur were not for personal gain but for the welfare of all and for truth and justice.Mann said the Khalsa was born on the sacred land of Sri Anandpur Sahib in 1699 -- 24 years after Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji's martyrdom.The chief minister said the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, sacrificed his entire family for the honour of the faith, an unparalleled example in world history.The objective of commemorating this great occasion is to spread the philosophy of Guru Tegh Bahadur throughout the world so that ideals of peace, harmony and secularism for which the Guru sacrificed himself may be preserved.Mann said those who take inspiration from their past and walk in the light of martyrdom can find rays of hope even in darkness.","Kejriwal exhorted the people to follow Guru Ji's universal message of love, secularism, religious tolerance, freedom of faith and peaceful co-existence.

EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?

NEW DELHI: Turning the pressure back on rich nations ahead of making its new 2035 climate action pledges, India has urged developed countries to demonstrate their own greater climate ambition and honour their commitments, underlining the need to reach ‘net zero’ emission by them earlier than 2050.India will submit its new climate action pledges — nationally determined contribution (NDC) — to the UN body next month. So far, more than 100 countries, including the US, China and the EU, have already submitted their NDCs with many stakeholders, asking India to deliver an ambitious mitigation target.“Developed countries must reach ‘net zero’ far earlier than current target dates, fulfil their obligations under Article 9.1 (providing climate finance by developed countries to assist developing ones) of the Paris Agreement, and deliver new, additional, and concessional climate finance estimated to be in trillions of dollars,” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday while delivering India’s national statement at the ongoing UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil.Yadav articulated India’s consistent position where it wants wealthy nations to be ambitious in their climate action as they, being the historical emitters, are responsible for climate change whereas the countries in the Global South suffer more.His remarks on “trillions of dollars” reflect the Global South’s demand to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 by rich nations to assist developing countries instead of what was agreed ($300 billion annually by 2035) amid serious concerns during COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, last year.Asking rich nations to deliver, the minister, on the occasion, flagged how India has already demonstrated successfully that development and environmental stewardship can advance in tandem, and fulfilled all its climate action promises much in advance.“India’s emission intensity has declined by over 36% since 2005. India’s non-fossil fuel based energy capacity, currently around 256 GW, accounts for more than half of its total electric installed capacity — an NDC target achieved five years ahead of the schedule,” said Yadav.He also noted that the country’s newly launched Nuclear Mission and Green Hydrogen Mission further accelerate its journey towards ‘net zero’ by 2070.The Brazilian Presidency, meanwhile, on Tuesday released a new set of draft texts — Mutirao Mobilization/Belem Package — incorporating all suggestions on the negotiation table on contentious issues, including finance, mitigation and unilateral trade measures, and an overall COP30 decision mechanism. Negotiators will try to thrash out their differences over the next three days to come out with a final decision of COP30.","India will submit its new climate action pledges to the UN body next month.

PM Modi dismissed claims that he and the BJP operate in a “24×7 election mode”, saying the party wins because it is driven by an emotional commitment to public welfare. “After winning the Bihar election, some people, including some Modi admirers in the media, have once again started saying that the BJP and Modi always remain in a 24×7 election mode. I believe that to win elections, being in election mode is not necessary; what is necessary is to remain in an emotional mode 24×7,” he said.He added that governance must be rooted in empathy and urgency. “When there is restlessness within the heart then not even a single minute should be wasted and one must keep working to reduce the hardships of the poor, to provide employment to the poor, to give healthcare to the poor, to fulfil the aspirations of the middle class. One should work tirelessly.” According to him, such emotion ensures that “the results become visible on the day of the elections,” a lesson he said was evident in the Bihar mandate.PM Modi said that the Bihar results underline the public’s rising expectations. “The results of the Bihar elections have once again taught a lesson on the high aspirations and ambitions of the people of India. The people of India today trust those political parties who have good intentions and fulfil the aspirations of the people and prioritise development,” he said.He urged states to treat development as their primary responsibility and engage in healthy competition. “I strongly encourage state governments to foster a spirit of healthy competition by attracting investments and promoting growth. Organising competitions to improve the ease of doing business could be a great step in this direction,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also framed India’s economic resilience as a source of global optimism. “Our GDP is growing at nearly seven per cent despite global instabilities; India is not just an emerging market but an emerging model too,” he said, adding that “India is restless to become a developed nation”.",Narendra Modi says leaders must work with genuine emotion rather than remain in a permanent political campaign.

NEW DELHI: In a big diplomatic win for India, Anmol Bishnoi, a key accused in the Baba Siddique murder case has been deported from the United States and is scheduled to arrive in India on Wednesday, news agency PTI reported citing officials.Anmol Bishnoi is the younger brother of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.This comes a year after the Mumbai police initiated the process for Anmol's extradition, a suspect in the killing of NCP leader and former minister Baba Siddique in October 2024. Bishnoi is also wanted in a case related to firing on Bollywood star Salman Khan's residence in April last year.NCP leader and Baba Siddique’s son, Zeeshan Siddique said that he has received an email stating that Anmol Bishnoi had been “removed” from the United States.""My family has registered as a victim family in the United States. From the victim notification, we get updates about Anmol Bishnoi. Today, we've got a mail that the federal government has removed Anmol Bishnoi from the United States as of November 18. The question arises whether he is being deported to India? My strong request to the central government is to bring him back if he's removed from America, and for the state government as well, to bring him back to Mumbai and to make sure that he's interrogated and arrested,"" Zeeshan Siddique told ANI.""He's a threat to society. He was named in my father's murder. In Salman Khan's case, his name has been arising frequently. It's very important for us to know who has asked Anmol Bishnoi to do this. For that, they need to bring Anmol Bishnoi back to Mumbai, and if he's been removed from America, then it's a very good opportunity for the Indian government to intervene and make sure he's deported back to India,"" Zeeshan Siddique added.Bishnoi's arrest comes after he was reportedly detained in Canada, where he was found in possession of a Russian passport obtained through fraudulent means.Baba Siddique, a former Maharashtra minister, was shot dead on October 12, 2024 in Bandra.

'I Did Not Say...': Prashant Kishor Takes U-Turn On Vow To Quit Politics If JDU Wins Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday reportedly raised concerns about the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process during a meeting with AICC office-bearers from 12 states and Union Territories where electoral roll revision is ongoing. He emphasised that the party needs to counter this 'politically, organisationally and legally, as per sources, quoted by PTI.Rahul noted that while the Election Commission should ensure accurate electoral rolls, it appeared to be shifting responsibility to political parties, according to the PTI sources. He questioned the implementation of the procedure, alleging it could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.Other Congress leaders also expressed their opposition to SIR, invoking their 'vote-chori' claim again or calling it a 'sinister attempt to destroy Democracy"".The review meeting included Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , Gandhi, and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, along with state unit chiefs, CLP leaders and secretaries from the regions undergoing Special Intensive Revision.Congress has intensified its 'vote chori' stance, criticising the Election Commission's handling of the SIR process as ""deeply disappointing"" and called for the commission to prove its independence from BJP influence.Kharge, who led the meeting, accused the BJP of using the process as a tool for ""vote chori"". He said on X, ""We held a comprehensive strategy review with AICC general secretaries, AICC in-charges, PCCs, CLPs and AICC secretaries from the states/UTs where the SIR process is underway. The Congress Party is unequivocally committed to safeguarding the integrity of the electoral rolls.""AICC general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal also took jab at EC, with regards to SIR. ""We are going to the streets. During the first week of December, the Congress party is organising a massive rally in Ramleela Maidan with lakhs of people attending it,"" he told reporters, adding that the Congress will expose the Election Commission by organising the protest event, as quoted by PTI.Venugopal further said while purification of electoral rolls is an undeniably necessary objective, it must be carried out in a bona fide manner.""The ECI's conduct thus far has been to further the BJP's 'vote chori' agenda, setting aside its Constitutional obligation of impartiality. We will relentlessly fight against their attempts to manipulate voter rolls through unfair deletions or the insertion of bogus voters to create space for the BJP to carry out its nefarious activities,"" he said on X.""It is our democracy at stake, and we will stand up to every attempt - big or small - that threatens our Constitutional framework,"" he further claimed. He said that the general feeling of the Pradesh Congress Committees was that the Election Commission was purposefully trying to delete votes of some sections of the society. ""The design of the SIR itself is to delete targeted votes. This is what we experienced in Bihar also and now they are going to start it in 12 states,"" he said, adding they announced a different 'Special Revision' for Assam.""This is a sinister attempt by the Election Commission to destroy democracy in this country. It is completely unethical and completely undemocratic,"" he alleged, as quoted by PTI.Following their significant defeat in Bihar, where the NDA secured 202 seats compared to Mahagathbandhan's 35, the Congress questioned the Election Commission's conduct during the electoral process. During his Bihar campaign also, Gandhi consistently raised the allegations of ""vote chori"".As the opposition stays firm on opposing SIR, the Election Commission reported that over 50.25 crore enumeration forms have been distributed across the 12 states and UTs, reaching 98.54 per cent of the 50.97 crore eligible voters.The first phase of the process includes regions such as- Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.Four of these regions - Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal - will hold elections in 2026. Assam, also due for elections in 2026, received approval for a 'special revision' of electoral rolls on Monday.The second phase of SIR began on November 4 and continues until December 4.Last week, Rahul described the Bihar results as ""surprising"" and questioned the election's fairness. He indicated that the Congress and INDIA bloc would analyse the results thoroughly.The party alleged that the results demonstrated ""vote chori on a gigantic scale -- masterminded by the prime minister, the home minister, the EC"".","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi raised concerns about the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process.

Congress delegation stopped



What led to clashes?



NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh police on Wednesday heightened security in several districts after state Congress chief Ajay Rai announced that Rahul Gandhi along with 5 other Congress MPs will visit Sambhal.Meanwhile, prohibitory orders are in place in the district until December 10. Curbs under section 163 (power to issue order in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) were set to expire on Sunday in Sambhal and have now been extended till December 31.Earlier on Tuesday, Sambhal district magistrate Rajendra Pensia wrote a letter to e police commissioners of Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad and the superintendents of police of Amroha and Bulandshahr districts, urging them to stop Rahul Gandhi at the borders of their districts.A Congress party delegation, however, slipped into Sambhal and met some families of those who died in Nov 24 violence and were about to leave the district.The delegation included the general secretary of UP Congress Committee (UPCC) Sachin Chaudhary and its vice-president Rizwan Qureshi along with the national secretary of All India Congress Committee Pradeep Narwal and a few members of Gandhi's team.They also facilitated a phone call between Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and the victims' kin. A delegation from Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind (JUH) also visited the violence-hit town and provided ""financial assistance, cheques of Rs 5 lakh each, to the families of the deceased later at a local madrassa"".This comes two days after a Congress delegation led by Ajay Rai was prevented from leaving for Sambhal, which has been out of bounds for parties after the Nov 24 violence.As soon as the Congress functionaries came out of the party headquarters, UP police stopped them on the grounds that the party's request for visit had been denied by the Sambhal district administration .At least 5 people were dead and several others, including over 20 police personnel, were injured in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal after violent clashes erupted following a court-mandated survey of the Mughal-era Jama Masjid.The survey was ordered following a petition filed by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain, claiming that the mosque was originally a temple.The tension started after a large group of people gathered near the mosque and started shouting slogans as the survey team began their work in the Shahi Jama Masjid.The protesters tried to torch vehicles and pelted stones at the police who used tear gas and batons to disperse the mob.""Gunshots were fired by the miscreants and some pellets struck our policemen. We are investigating where the shots were fired from, particularly in the Deepa Sarai area,"" an officer said.Tension has been brewing in Sambhal over the past few days after the Jama Masjid was surveyed last Tuesday on the orders of a local court following a petition that claimed that a Harihar temple stood at the site.""Some miscreants in the crowd threw stones at the police team. The police used minor force and tear gas to bring the situation under control,"" Superintendent of Police Krishna Kumar Vishnoi said.""We are in the process of registering an FIR in the incident. The accused will also be booked under the NSA,"" the police officer added.Petitioner Vishnu Shankar Jain had said the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) ordered the constitution of an ""Advocate Commission"" to survey the mosque. The court has said that a report should be filed after conducting a videography and photography survey through the commission, he had said.",Congress chief Ajay Rai announced that Rahul Gandhi along with 5 other Congress MPs will visit Sambhal. prohibitory orders are in place in the district until December 10.

MUMBAI: Offering a climbdown from his demand of being allowed to continue as the head of the Mahayuti govt, Sena chief Eknath Shinde asked BJP brass at a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi last week that if it wasn't possible to give him the post for govt's full term, he should be made the CM for at least the first six months, a veteran politician has revealed. But BJP leadership rejected this proposal outright, saying it would set a bad precedent, he said.""There is no system of appointing a CM for six months; it would be a bad decision and would have an adverse impact on the administration,"" he said, citing BJP functionaries.The meeting was held on Nov 28 a day after Shinde said he would not be an obstacle to formation of govt and would accept any decision taken by BJP brass as ""final"". It was also attended by BJP functionary Devendra Fadnavis , NCP president Ajit Pawar, its working president Praful Patel and its state chief Sunil Tatkare.According to the politician, Shinde initially reminded BJP brass of the purported promise made after the Lok Sabha election and in the run-up to the assembly polls that if the alliance secured a clear majority, he would be retained as the chief minister. This request was rejected outright on the grounds that it would be wrong to give him the post when BJP secured ""a near clear majority"" in the 288-member House. BJP won 132 seats, Sena 57 and NC. In 2014, BJP had secured 122 seats and Fadnavis was then elected as CM with NCP's outside support.In response, Shinde was asked to put himself in the shoes of the BJP president, the politician said. ""The BJP leadership told Shinde: 'Will you give up the claim to the CM post if you secured a clear majority?' Shinde was left speechless,"" he said.Shinde reportedly began advocating for himself strongly since the assembly poll results but Fadnavis had made it clear there was no scope for him to be made the chief minister again. The politician said no call has been taken on how big the cabinet will be. It may be decided after BJP's legislature party meeting on Wednesday.Shinde had left for his native village in Satara a day after the Delhi meeting owing to ill health and returned to Mumbai on Sunday. On his return, he reiterated that he would support any decision BJP brass takes on the next CM and that he, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar would meet and resolve ""a lot of issues regarding power sharing"".","Sena chief Eknath Shinde offered a climbdown from his demand of being allowed to continue as the head of the Mahayuti govt.

Foreign students in India at record high after Covid tumble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foreign-students-in-india-at-record-high-after-covid-tumble/articleshow/115951966.cms,"NEW DELHI: A flagship initiative towards internationalisation of Indian education , Study in India (SII) Portal, received a record 72,218 students from 200 countries for the academic year 2024-25. After a significant jump in numbers which started in 2014-15, followed by a significant decline due to Covid, the renewed multi-pronged effort of govt seems to have made its impact this year.In 2011-12, the number of foreign students in India was 16,410, which rose to 34,774 in 2014-15. In 2016-17, it recorded 47,575 and in 2019-20, the pre-Covid numbers were over 49,000. However, according to govt sources, during Covid-19 and after the pandemic, the numbers declined to around the 2014-15 mark.Launched in 2018 by ministry of education as a flagship project, the Study in India programme sought to project India as a prime education hub for international students. However, these initiatives appeared to have had limited success and the scheme appeared to be falling short of its goals. ""Covid had its major impact on education worldwide. Impact on India was no different,"" said a senior official with the MoE. Thereafter, the Centre in Aug 2023 launched Study in India (SII) Portal, a centralised platform for foreign students to apply for admissions and visas.""India is actively reclaiming its historic role as a global education hub, reminiscent of ancient institutions like Takshashila and Nalanda. With National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 at its core, govt is driving the internationalisation of education by aligning curricula with global standards, fostering research collaborations, and facilitating academic exchanges to position the country as a global knowledge leader,"" said Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to TOI.Thereafter, the Centre in August 2023 launched the Study in India (SII) Portal, a centralized platform for foreign students to apply for admissions and visas.“India is actively reclaiming its historic role as a global education hub, reminiscent of ancient institutions like Takshashila and Nalanda. With the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 at its core, the government is driving the internationalization of education by aligning curricula with global standards, fostering research collaborations, and facilitating academic exchanges to position the country as a global knowledge leader,” said union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to the TOI.According to the official, the portal has attracted over 72,218 students from 200 countries for the academic year 2024–25. Featuring more than 8,000 courses across 638 institutions, including 310 public universities, “it represents a significant step toward making India a preferred global education destination. Students registered on the portal are also facilitated with an e-Student Visa, streamlining their transition to Indian HEIs.”Apart from the portal, a multi-pronged approach was taken to build an ecosystem. To bolster India’s appeal, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has enacted regulations to allow foreign universities to establish campuses in India which resulted in three foreign universities -- Deakin University and University of Wollongong from Australia and University of Southampton from England starting their India operations.Simultaneously, Indian HEIs are making their presence abroad. In November 2023, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras inaugurated a campus in Zanzibar, Tanzania, and IIT-Delhi opened a campus in Abu Dhabi in September 2024. These developments align with UGC regulations permitting Institutions of Eminence (IoEs) to establish offshore campuses.Pradhan led India’s educational diplomacy which resulted in key partnerships including the Australia-India Education and Skills Council, India-US Working Group on Education, and numerous bilateral agreements with nations like Germany, Singapore, and the UAE. Latest of which include Pradhan recently holding discussions with officials from India Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, USA, on establishing its campus in India.As part of the other academic collaboration between Indian and foreign HEIs, UGC’s 2022 guidelines have also enabled joint, dual, and twinning degree programmes, with 49 Indian universities now partnered with international institutions. Additionally, the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) has approved 787 research proposals across 28 countries, focusing on 12 strategic themes such as artificial intelligence, disaster management, and sustainable cities.","In 2011-12, the number of foreign students in India was 16,410, which rose to 34,774 in 2014-15.

NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality remained in the 'poor' category on Tuesday morning, with a thin layer of smog enveloping several parts of the city as reported by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 274 as of 8am.As per the data collected by CPCB at 8am, the Air Quality Index (AQI) reported in Anand Vihar was at 294, 235 at ITO, 256 at IGI Airport (T3), 250 at Chandani Chowk and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, 277 at Okhla Phase-2, and 298 at both Punjabi Bagh and Wazirpur, all falling under the 'poor' category.The AQI scale categorises readings as follows: 0-50 as good, 51-100 as satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 as poor, 301-400 as very poor, and 401-500 as severe.On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to ease GRAP-IV measures aimed at reducing Delhi's air pollution, scheduling the next hearing on this matter for a later date.Justices Abhay S Oka and AG Masih highlighted that NCR states—Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh—failed to compensate construction workers as directed. They mandated virtual attendance of these states' Chief Secretaries at the next hearing, noting that action typically begins only when top officials are summoned.The court stated it would consider relaxations only after seeing consistent improvement in air quality, scheduling the next hearing for Thursday to discuss potential GRAP IV modifications.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati presented AQI data and suggested GRAP IV relaxations, but the court remained unconvinced due to unstable AQI readings.The court instructed CAQM to communicate mitigation measures to relevant authorities and coordinate implementation efforts. It noted concerning findings from court commissioners' reports, highlighting poor coordination between MCD, Delhi police, DPCC and other authorities, emphasising CAQM's responsibility in coordinating these entities.The court also ordered Delhi police to ensure protection for court commissioners who are members of the bar.","The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 274 as of 8am.

PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""",Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

Changed Mahayuti dynamics? Ajit Pawar's NCP seeks parity with Shinde's Shiv Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/changed-mahayuti-dynamics-ajit-pawars-ncp-seeks-parity-with-shindes-shiv-sena-citing-partys-strike-rate/articleshow/115939740.cms,"Ajit Pawar (left) and Eknath Shinde

NEW DELHI: Has the dynamics within Maharashtra's ruling Mahayuti changed? Ajit Pawar 's NCP , which had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS, after Mahayuti's dismal performance in Lok Sabha elections, seems to have moved closer to the BJP after the assembly elections.With the Shiv Sena playing hardball over the CM's post attributing the spectacular 'Maha' results to Eknath Shinde 's performance as chief minister, Ajit Pawar threw his weight behind Devendra Fadnavis and helped the BJP counter Sena's pressure games.The NCP has openly sought parity with Shiv Sena arguing that their strike rate in assembly elections is better than Shinde Sena and hence they deserve the same number of seats in the new government.""If we look at the strike rate in our alliance, the BJP is number one, followed by Ajit Dada's group in second place and the Shinde group in third place. So, our strike rate is also good and we demand that we get as much representation as they do,"" senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said as the three allies sit together to decide power sharing in Mahayuti 2.0.Bhujbal's claim is contrary to the facts as Shiv Sena's strike rate of 70.4% (57/81) is slightly better than NCP which owns 41 of the 59 seats it contested at a strike rate of 69.5%. The BJP, meanwhile, was way ahead of its allies with a strike rate of 88.5% - winning 132 of the 149 seats it contested.The BJP and the Shiv Sena had come together in 2022 - after Eknath Shinde led a successful revolt against Uddhav Thackeray leading to the fall of the opposition's MVA government. The BJP then gave the CM's post to Shinde and made Fadnavis work as his deputy in a move that surprised everyone.Ajit Pawar joined the NDA government almost a year later after leading a successful revolt against his uncle Sharad Pawar and became the second deputy chief minister of the Mahayuti government. Both Shinde and Pawar eventually got complete control of their parties, including the official names and symbols.However, after the Lok Sabha elections, Ajit Pawar, who could win only one seat, stared at a tense future in Mahayuti while Eknath Shinde consolidated his position as a Hindutva ally of the BJP. The RSS openly attacked the BJP for including NCP in the alliance.The assembly elections marked the reversal of fortunes for Ajit Pawar as he decimated rival Sharad Pawar's faction of NCP and won an impressive 41 seats. When the Shiv Sena, with 57 seats, demanded the chief minister's post again for Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar played the spoilsport as he openly backed BJP's Devendra Fadnavis who led the saffron party to a record performance of 132 seats.In the last 10 days, while Eknath Shinde sulked and his Shiv Sena bargained hard, Ajit Pawar, who is sure of deputy CM post again, played his cards well and backed the BJP. One of the Sena leaders admitted that Ajit Pawar's NCP had reduced his party's bargaining power vis-à-vis the BJP.The BJP has given Shinde Sena a long rope despite being only 13 seats short of majority in the 288-member assembly. When it comes to a numbers game, the BJP perhaps could do without either of the two allies.However, the BJP, which made a bold statement in 2022 by making junior partner Shinde the chief minister, may not want to do away with the accrued gains by riding roughshod over its Hindutva ally in the state. By unilaterally announcing December 5 as the oath-ceremony date, the BJP has already given a strong signal that it will be calling the shots in Mahayuti 2.0.","Ajit Pawar's NCP had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned the Indian high commissioner Pranay Verma in the capital Dhakha in connection with the breach of premises at the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala.Pranay Verma arrived at the foreign affairs office just before 4.00 pm, where he was summoned to the office of the acting foreign secretary, M Riaz Hamidullah.After meeting Bangladesh's interim government acting foreign secretary, envoy Pranay Verma said, ""This (meeting) was a part of our regular exchanges. We have such a wide-ranging and multi-faceted relationship with Bangladesh that you cannot reduce it to one issue or one agenda. We really want to build a positive, stable and constructive relationship moving forward. There are so many inter-dependencies we have and we want to build on those to mutual benefit,"" he told mediapersons.""We have maintained a lot of positive momentum in the relationship. We are willing to engage with the interim govt of Bangladesh and we remain interested in working with Bangladesh to fulfil our shared aspirations for peace, security and development,"" he added.Moreover, a Bangladeshi official said that all consular services at the assistant high commission in Agartala will ""remain suspended until further notice because of security reasons"".""Given the security situation, all visa and consular services at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission, Agartala, will remain suspended until further notice. This comes into effect immediately,"" said Md Al-Ameen, the first secretary to the Bangladesh mission told news agency PTI.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Monday condemned the breach of the Bangladesh assistant high commission premises in Agartala, describing the incident as ""deeply regrettable"" and stressed that diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstance.""The incident earlier today of the breach of premises at the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala is deeply regrettable. Diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances,"" MEA said in a statement.Demonstrators allegedly broke into the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala to protest atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country.The high commission breach comes after an Agartala-Kolkata bus traveling via Dhaka on Saturday reportedly faced an attack in the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh after being involved in an accident on Vishwa Road.The breach comes amid escalating tensions between India and Bangladesh, exacerbated by rising attacks on Hindus and their places of worship in Bangladesh following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier this year.The political instability in Bangladesh has coincided with a series of mob attacks, intensifying concerns for the safety of the Hindu minority community.The tension rose further after the arrest of prominent Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, a vocal advocate for minority rights. Das was detained at Dhaka airport in October on charges of allegedly disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag during a rally. The specifics of the allegations remain vague, and Das has been denied bail.","Bangladesh summons Indian high commissioner Pranay Verma in connection with the breach of premises at the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala.

LUCKNOW: On Tuesday morning, the cargo bay authorities of Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport intercepted and halted the shipment of a fetus destined for Mumbai via flight.The fetus was dispatched by a city-based IVF centre for a Mumbai-based laboratory. However, the IVF centre had not disclosed the presence of the fetus in the consignment package to the courier company who had sent the package to cargo bay for expedited delivery.Upon scanning at the airport cargo bay, the fetus was detected, prompting immediate notification to the courier company representatives.Speaking to TOI, the courier company staff, requesting anonymity, said, ""The fetus consignment has been returned to the IVF centre, as they never informed us about it.""According to specialists, a deceased specimen must be properly embalmed before air transport, otherwise it risks substantial deterioration during transit, predominantly due to swift decomposition triggered by fluctuations in pressure and temperature during flight, potentially resulting in fluid seepage and subsequent damage to the container or coffin.","The fetus was dispatched by a city-based IVF centre for a Mumbai-based laboratory.

'What a joke!': Congress snubs TMC for suggesting Mamata as INDIA bloc face,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-a-joke-congress-snubs-tmc-for-suggesting-mamata-as-india-bloc-face/articleshow/115933138.cms,"Mamata Banerjee

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Tuesday rejected the idea of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee becoming leader of the INDIA bloc terming the suggestion a ""joke"".""That's a good joke,"" Tagore quipped when asked about TMC leaders' remarks.This comes after TMC MP Kirti Azad asserted that Mamata was a better face to lead the opposition bloc adding that she had a perfect record against BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Mamata Banerjee has a perfect record. Whenever Narendra Modi has faced defeat, it has always been in West Bengal. Even in the recent by-elections, where the BJP had one seat and we had five, Mamata Didi hit a six and threw Narendra Modi out of the West Bengal boundary. Every time he comes to Bengal intending to insult, his vote count increases, and she, a very senior leader, continues to clearly express her views,"" Azad said.""While the Indian government has said nothing despite the serious situation in Bangladesh, she has stated that if the Indian government does not act, the United Nations should step in to protect minorities wherever they are. Mamata Banerjee is not just a leader but a movement present in every household in West Bengal,"" he added.The TMC MP further said that Mamata takes everyone along with respect.""Mamata Didi is someone who takes everyone along. She prepares thoroughly before calling people for meetings. There are times when emergency meetings are held, but she ensures that all her people are invited with respect and engages in dialogue with her allies,"" Azad said.Mamata Banerjee's party is working out its own space within the INDIA bloc, essentially to have its own say within the group, even while Congress remains the largest party and hence gets to lead the opposition charge. Congress’ recent electoral defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra and TMC’s victory in the Bengal bypolls have pushed the regional party into taking its own line, rather than following Congress, while remaining within the opposition bloc.Earlier, referring to the MVA's poor performance, TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee said that the whole alliance failed to meet expectations in the absence of a leader.""Today, if we genuinely want to fight against the BJP and Narendra Modi, the INDIA alliance must be stronger. To achieve that, one decisive leader is necessary. The key question now is: who will that leader be?""

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges.

Kharge cites widening inequalities

Party spokesperson flags economic concerns

Inflation and savings under pressure

'Real challenges ignored'

NEW DELHI: The Congress intensified its criticism of the government on Tuesday, blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "" voodoo economic policies "" for India's GDP growth hitting a near two-year low of 5.4% in the July-September quarter. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of creating a ""vicious cycle"" of low growth, high unemployment, shrinking incomes, and rising prices.In a post on X, Kharge said, ""The growth rate is declining. There are no jobs for the youth. Inflation has drained the pockets of the common people. The gap of economic inequality is widening."" He also highlighted the rupee's depreciation to 85 against the dollar, calling it the ""second weakest currency in Asia,"" and accused the government of favoring billionaires over small businesses.Kharge shared an old audio clip of PM Modi criticizing GDP trends during Congress' tenure, remarking, ""You will not listen to the voice of the people; listen to your own voice!""At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate described the GDP figure as a warning of economic distress. She emphasized that GDP reflects jobs, investments, consumption, and trade, all of which have suffered.""Private consumption growth has slumped to 5.9%, exposing weak demand in both urban and rural India. Manufacturing growth is at a mere 2.2%, undermining the 'Make in India' narrative,"" Shrinate said, adding that government expenditure fell from Rs 4.15 lakh crore in Q1 to Rs 4.01 lakh crore in Q2.Shrinate pointed out that inflation remains stubbornly high, with vegetable prices soaring by 42%—the steepest rise in five years. ""Amid high unemployment, stagnant wages, and back-breaking prices, families are forced to dip into their savings, which have nearly halved over the past five years,"" she said.""Thanks to Narendra Modi and his voodoo economic policies, India is in the middle of a vicious economic cycle -- low growth, no jobs, low income, high prices, drop in savings and rise in loans,"" she said.The rupee's depreciation, coupled with declining foreign reserves, signals deeper issues, Shrinate argued.

NEW DELHI:A soldier, who was part of ' Operation Rakshak ' and deployed near LOC in J&K lost his life in extreme climactic conditions, while discharging his duty in the wee hours of a chilly Jan morning in 2013 but his widow was denied Liberalised Family Pension (LFP) despite getting order in her favour from armed forces tribunal in 2019 as Centre moved SC and the litigation went on for five more years.Rejecting the plea of Centre and defence ministry and ordering them to grant her LFP, SC Tuesday took strong exception of govt for not taking a sympathetic view and dragging the widow in court for protracted legal proceedings to deny her rightful and imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 to be given to her.LPF is given in case of death of an armed forces personnel under certain circumstances and eligible family is entitled to pension equal to reckonable emoluments last drawn. Govt denied LFP on grounds that it was a case of 'physical casualty' and not ' battle casualty ' where LPF is granted to the family. The commanding officer in this case had categorised the death as a 'battle casualty', and later it was changed to a 'physical casualty' which was challenged by the family.After examining records and rules, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said govt had wrongly denied the widow the pension as the death happened as a result of war-like situations and it comes within the ambit of 'battle casualties'.""Thus, the death can be attributed to illness caused by extreme climatic conditions. Hence, as per clause 1(g) of Appendix A of the Army Order 1 of 2003, the case will fall in 'battle casualties'. The reason is that the deceased was operating near LOC in extreme climatic conditions. He was part of 'Operation Rakshak'. The casualty caused by illness due to climatic conditions is covered by clause 1(g). In this case, the respondent's husband was a victim of illness caused by extreme climatic conditions,"" the bench said.","A soldier, who was part of'Operation Rakshak'and deployed near LOC in J&K lost his life in extreme climactic conditions, while discharging his duty in 2013.

Midday meal cooks' pay stuck at 2009 level in 10 states/UTs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/midday-meal-cooks-pay-stuck-at-2009-level-in-10-states/uts/articleshow/115949348.cms,"The 'honorarium' for working six to eight hours as cooks-cum-helpers in the midday meal programme has remained unchanged at Rs 1,000 per month since it was fixed in 2009. Adjusted for inflation, the value of Rs 1,000 now is just over Rs 540 per month 15 years back. The actual money they get depends on how much the state govt is willing to enhance this. While Kerala pays Rs 12,000, in many like Delhi, Goa and several northeastern states it remains just Rs 1,000.National Floor Minimum Wage, below which no state can fix its minimum wage, is Rs 5,340 per month, about Rs 178 per day. However, since cook-cum-helpers (CCH) are not recognised as workers, govt is not bound to pay minimum wages. The honorarium of Rs 1000 works out to be just Rs 33 per day. "" CCHs are honorary workers who have come forward for rendering social services,"" govt has repeatedly maintained in answers to questions in Parliament.The honorarium expenditure of Rs 1,000 is shared between the Centre and states and UTs as per an approved sharing pattern of 90:10 in Northeastern states, Himalayan states (Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh) and Jammu & Kashmir, 100% in UTs without legislature and 60:40 for other states as well as Delhi and Puducherry. In effect, for most states the Centre pays just Rs 600 towards the honorarium of each CCH.""With the price of everything rising, how can you possibly survive on Rs 1,600 per month? Just a kilo of daal costs Rs 150 and a kilo of onion costs Rs 80. They don't even pay it regularly. They pay after four to six months,"" said Kiari Dev, who has been working as a CCH for over 12 years in Sapthiahi village in Saharsa district, Bihar. Hundreds of them from several states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh gathered in Jantar Mantar on Tuesday under the banner of Mid-Day Meal Workers Federation of India demanding increase in wages, regularisation of their work, social security benefits, extension of the scheme to all children up to class XII and to protest privatisation of the scheme.To put the 15-year freeze in perspective, consider this: The salary of members of parliament went up thrice in 12 years, from Rs 16,000 in 2006 to Rs 1 lakh plus in 2018 and that of bureaucrats went up twice. The entry level pay for govt employees went up from 2,550 to Rs 7,000 by the sixth pay commission in 2008 and then to Rs 18,000 by the seventh pay commission in 2015.Though govt treats CCH's work as part time, they actually work almost eight hours or more. ""Headmasters or teachers ask us to make tea for them, wash utensils, do sweeping and mopping along with cooking for 150-200 students and so we end up being in the school all day. If we refuse, they threaten to sack us as we are not regular employees and have no job security,"" said Naseema Bano who has been working as a CCH for over 20 years in Bihar's Supaul district. An estimated 25 lakh work as CCHs across India.

"4 NE cities among 7 safest for women in India; Ranchi, Srinagar get lowest scores: NARI survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-ne-cities-among-7-safest-for-women-in-india-ranchi-srinagar-get-lowest-scores-nari-survey/articleshow/123575452.cms,"PTI file photo

NEW DELHi: Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women in the ‘Index on Women Safety (NARI) 2025’ — based on a survey conducted in 31 major cities covering all states. Ranchi and Srinagar have the lowest scores on the index.Among metropolitan cities, Mumbai figures among the top seven cities, while the set of seven cities with the lowest scores also includes capital Delhi and Kolkata.Besides Kohima, the northeastern cities of Aizawl, Gangtok and Itanagar figure among the top cities in the safety rankings, often correlating with higher gender equity, infrastructure, policing or civic participation.Faridabad, Patna and Jaipur are the other cites with the lowest score, correlating with poorer infrastructure, patriarchal norms or weaker institutional responsiveness, according to the survey, which captured perceptions and lived experiences of 12,770 women to generate the index.As far as the national average is concerned, the mean score is 65%, and cities in the index have been categorised as “much above”, “above”, “below”, and “much below” this benchmark.The ‘National Annual Report & Index on Women’s Safety (NARI) 2025’ conceived by data science company Pvalue Analytics was released by National Commission for Women chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar at a programme here.The NCW chief said a safe environment was crucial for building a developed and inclusive India and assured that the commission will build on the suggestions in the survey report to bridge the gaps to strengthen women safety.The report highlights that National Crime Records Bureau data presents only the tip of the iceberg —crimes actually registered. NARI shows that two out of three women do not report — meaning NCRB could miss two-thirds of events experienced by women.The report showed that while 60% of women surveyed felt “safe”, a significant 40% felt “not so safe” or “unsafe” in their cities. Perceptions of safety drop sharply at night, highlighting ongoing concerns about public infrastructure (lighting, patrolling) and societal factors, it said.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.Prevalence of harassment remains high with 7% women reporting at least one incident of harassment in public spaces in 2024. The highest risk group is women under 24 years of age (14% reported harassment). Verbal harassment was most common (58%), with physical, psychological, economic and sexual harassment reported less frequently.Neighborhoods (38%) and transport (29%) were the main hotspots for harassment. In terms of response 28% of women confronted harassers, 25% left the scene, 21% sought safety in crowds and 20% reported to authorities.The survey measured overall city safety, infrastructure, incidence and reporting of harassment, domain-wise safety (neighbourhood, transport, education, work, health, recreation, online), and confidence in authorities, among others.","Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women.

'Unfortunate occurrences can be avoided': BSF-BGB talks flag border row; vow zero tolerance on insurgents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unfortunate-occurrences-can-be-avoided-bsf-bgb-talks-flag-border-row-vow-zero-tolerance-on-insurgents/articleshow/123575179.cms,"ANI file photo

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Border Security Force (BSF), at the DG-level talks with Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in Pilkhana, Dhaka, took up the recurrent border attacks, assault and stone-pelting incidents against its personnel and Indian nationals by the Bangladeshi miscreants, saying that these had left 68 BSF personnel injured last year and another 35 until June 30 this year.BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary and his BGB counterpart Major General Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui, during the talks held from Aug 25 to 28, discussed the issue of construction of single-row-fence (SRF) within 150 yards of the international border (IB) on the Indian side. While BGB DG raised concern over what he termed as “illegal construction work within 150 yards of IB”, Chawdhary underlined that SRF has no defence potential and is purely aimed at curbing and preventing trans-border crime.“Both sides mutually agreed to constructively engage the respective higher authorities for concurrence on the pending work within 150 yards of IB....(they) agreed to follow the laid-down procedure while erecting SRF,” said the joint statement issued by BSF and BGB at the end of the biannual talks, the last leg of which was held in February 2025 in New Delhi.At their joint press conference in Dhaka, Siddiqui objected to the use of lethal weapons by BSF against Bangladesh nationals intercepted on the international border.Chawdhary however clarified that a BSF personnel fires only in self-defence, that too as a last resort in the face of “imminent threat” to his life. “Such unfortunate occurrences can be avoided if a proper fence is put up in place on the border from both the sides,” he said.To maintain transparency in any such retaliatory action by BSF, the force will be providing around 5,000 body-worn cameras to its border personnel, a source told TOI.Another official said BSF response to attacks by border misadventures by Bangladeshi miscreants is always graded, and added that BGB must control potential intruders and trans-border criminals on its side, to prevent these mishaps.BSF and BGB chiefs meanwhile agreed to step up coordinated border patrols and undertake joint efforts to bring down the incidents of assault by intensifying public awareness about the sanctity of international border.Chawdhary elaborated on his concern regarding the delay on part of BGB and Bangladeshi authorities in taking back illegal Bangladeshi intruders apprehended by BSF. As per data shared with TOI, 2,404 incoming and 3,102 outgoing Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended by BSF within a year of the regime change in Dhaka.As regards trans-border insurgent groups and their camps, both sides agreed to adopt a zero-tolerance approach and take concurrent action based on real-time information.The next DG-level conference is provisionally scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2026.","Border Security Force (BSF) held talks with Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in Pilkhana, Dhaka.

Trump Greenlights Over 3,300 Cruise Missiles For Ukraine To BOMB Russia, But There’s A Catch

US President Donald Trump was ""not happy"" but ""not surprised"" by Russia’s latest missile and drone strikes on Kyiv that killed at least 19 people, the White House said on Thursday, while urging “both sides” to move toward ending the war.“He was not happy about this news, but he was also not surprised. These are two countries that have been at war for a very long time,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during her daily briefing.Leavitt added, “Russia launched this attack on Kyiv, and likewise, Ukraine recently dealt a blow to Russia's oil refineries.”The Russian barrage hit residential apartment blocks, a European Union mission, and a British government cultural centre in one of the largest attacks since the war began in February 2022, reported AFP,Trump, who had pledged to end the Ukraine conflict “within 24 hours” of taking office, has since acknowledged the situation is more complex than anticipated. A summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month in Alaska failed to yield any breakthrough.Leavitt said the president may issue further remarks on the Kyiv attack and reiterated Trump’s stance on seeking a negotiated end to the war.“Perhaps both sides of this war are not ready to end it themselves,” she said. “The president wants it to end, but the leaders of these two countries... must want it to end as well.”Leavitt also claimed Trump had worked “harder than anyone” to secure peace, echoing recent remarks from the administration pointing to diplomatic efforts as ongoing.Meanwhile, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, warned that the latest strikes could set back the president’s peace efforts.“These egregious attacks threaten the peace that @POTUS is pursuing,” Kellogg posted.","US President Donald Trump was ""not happy"" but ""not surprised"" by Russia's latest missile and drone strikes on Kyiv that killed at least 19 people.

After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint

Workforce demand fuels migration

Expansion of consular services in Yekaterinburg

Growing presence in high-skilled sectors

Russian visa categories and application process

Indian embassy issues visa fraud advisory

Indian community continues to grow

As traditional destinations like the UK, US, and Canada adopt more restrictive immigration policies and tighten work visa norms, Russia is emerging as a new opportunity hub for Indian workers. Russian companies across key sectors such as construction, electronics, manufacturing, and heavy machinery are actively recruiting skilled Indian professionals to address a growing domestic workforce shortage and support ongoing industrial and infrastructure development.According to India’s Ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, the demand for Indian workers is rising, prompting an increase in consular workload. He noted that consular services are expanding to meet the needs of the growing Indian community in Russia, as reported by the TASS.The Russian labour market is facing a critical shortage. According to Russia’s Ministry of Labour, the country is projected to experience a workforce deficit of 3.1 million by 2030. In response, the government plans to increase the quota for qualified foreign workers by 1.5 times in 2025, allowing for 230,000 individuals.Companies are currently hiring Indian nationals under existing Russian regulations, quotas, and laws. As quoted by the TASS, Kumar said, “At a broader level, there is a manpower requirement in Russia, and India has skilled manpower. So at present, within the framework of Russian regulations, laws and quotas, the companies are hiring Indians.”The initial wave of Indian workers began arriving in Russian regions in 2024, starting at the Za Rodinu fish processing complex in Kaliningrad, which was facing a labour shortage.Andrey Besedin, head of the Ural Chamber of Commerce and Industry, stated that by the end of the year, around 1 million Indian specialists are expected to come to Russia, including the Sverdlovsk region, as reported by the TASS. He also announced the opening of a new Consulate General in Yekaterinburg to handle increasing consular requirements.Sverdlovsk, with Yekaterinburg as its capital, is home to major heavy industries and military-industrial facilities such as Uralmash and Ural Wagon Zavod, the latter known for producing the T-90 tank. Besedin noted that many positions in these factories are vacant due to deployment of workers in military operations in Ukraine and a decline in local youth participation in industrial jobs.While early Indian arrivals were mainly in the construction and textile industries, the demand is now rising in electronics and machinery sectors. Vinay Kumar told the TASS that “most of the people who have come are in the construction and textile sectors,” but highlighted a growing need in high-end sectors like machinery and electronics.Russia offers various types of employment visas, including single-entry visas for short-term assignments, multiple-entry visas for long-term jobs, and Highly Qualified Specialist (HQS) visas for professionals. There is also a work patent option for self-employed individuals. Visa processing durations range from 5 to 30 business days depending on the type and consulate. Applicants are required to submit a completed form, valid passport, passport-sized photographs, a work invitation, a medical certificate, proof of qualifications, and sometimes an employment agreement. Expedited services are available at an additional fee.The Indian Embassy has issued a warning about fraudulent job offers. It cautioned Indian nationals against agents who offer tourist or business visas with job promises in Russia, stating that such visas do not permit employment and cannot be converted to work permits. The advisory was issued due to multiple incidents reported to the embassy.Currently, approximately 14,000 Indians reside in Russia, along with 1,500 Afghan nationals of Indian origin. The community includes skilled workers, professionals, and students. About 4,500 Indian students are pursuing medical and technical courses, with nearly 90 per cent enrolled in medical universities. Other fields include engineering, computer science, aeronautical design, transport technology, agriculture, and business management.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

CBSE announces major reforms for LOC submission ahead of Class 10 and 12 board exams 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/cbse-announces-major-reforms-for-loc-submission-ahead-of-class-10-and-12-board-exams-2026/articleshow/123547542.cms,"CBSE LOC details 2025

Two-board examination policy for Class 10



Integration of APAAR IDs in LOC submissions

Stringent data requirements for schools

Dedicated portal for children with Special Needs (CWSN)



Implications and outlook

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has unveiled sweeping reforms in the submission of the List of Candidates (LOC) for the Class 10 and 12 board examinations of 2026, signalling a marked shift in the board’s examination management framework. The LOC, a cornerstone in the preparation of board exams, now carries additional layers of accountability and technological integration aimed at ensuring accuracy, transparency, and inclusivity. These changes include stricter validation of student data, enhanced digital verification processes, and a more streamlined interface for school administrators, all designed to minimise errors and improve efficiency across affiliated institutions.For the first time, CBSE is implementing a two-board examination policy for Class 10. Under this new paradigm, the Main Examinations, scheduled for mid-February, remain mandatory for all students. Schools are instructed to submit LOC data for all candidates appearing in this primary examination. In addition, a Second Board Examination will be conducted subsequently, with LOC submissions to be completed post the conclusion of the first exam.This dual-examination framework reflects the board’s emphasis on providing students multiple opportunities for academic validation, while simultaneously imposing stricter procedural compliance on affiliated schools.Explained: What Tele-MANAS offers students and why CBSE wants schools to act now In a significant technological upgrade, CBSE has mandated the linking of Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) IDs with LOC data for both Class 10 and 12 students. Schools within India are now required to submit LOC data only for candidates possessing an APAAR ID, which the board will validate at the time of submission. Affiliated schools abroad, however, are exempt from this requirement due to administrative and legal constraints. This integration is expected to streamline student records, reduce errors, and enhance the robustness of academic data management.CBSE has underscored the importance of meticulous data preparation. Schools must collate comprehensive details for each candidate, including personal identifiers, parent/guardian information, date of birth, APAAR ID (for Indian schools), correct subject codes, subject combinations as per the scheme of studies, and the category under which the candidate is applying—be it First Sitting (FS), Improvement, or Compartment. The board has issued a strict advisory, emphasizing that only error-free data will be accepted, and reiterated that students not listed via the online LOC submission will be ineligible to sit for the 2026 board examinations.In a progressive move towards inclusivity, CBSE has launched a dedicated portal for Children with Special Needs (CWSN). The portal is designed for schools to submit records and information pertaining to CWSN students, thereby ensuring the implementation of appropriate relaxations and accommodations during examinations. This initiative reinforces CBSE’s commitment to equitable assessment practices and systematic support for differently-abled learners.These reforms mark a transformative phase in the CBSE’s examination ecosystem. By combining procedural rigour with technological sophistication, the board aims to reduce administrative lapses, enhance data accuracy, and broaden the accessibility of its examination system. For schools, the emphasis on precise LOC submission and APAAR linkage imposes a heightened responsibility, while for students, these measures promise a more transparent and structured examination process.With the 2026 board examinations poised to implement these reforms, CBSE’s latest notification underscores a deliberate shift toward operational efficiency, digital integration, and inclusivity, redefining the contours of India’s largest school-level examination body.Candidates can click on the link provided here to download the official notice regarding CBSE's LOC guidelines.","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has unveiled sweeping reforms in the submission of the List of Candidates (LOC) for the Class 10 and 12 board examinations of 2026.

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy on Thursday said that ""almost all the people who we call ‘antinationals’ are the ones who care"" while those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.""Almost all the people who we call 'antinationals' are the ones who care. And then the people who call themselves great nationalists, I can bet you that 99 per cent of them are dodging taxes, have sent their kids to America, or are doing everything to make sure that what goes on in this country doesn't affect their personal wealth or their whatever bullshit,"" Roy was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.She was speaking at the launch of her memoir. The book is centred on her relationship with her mother, Mary Roy, a women’s rights activist who fought the landmark inheritance case for Syrian Christian women in Kerala.Roy said she wrote the memoir after Mary’s death in 2022, describing it as ""born out of the onrush of memories and feelings provoked"" by her mother’s passing. ""I wrote this book because I feel that my mother is someone who deserves to be shared with the world,"" she said, as quoted by PTI.The 63-year-old, who won the Booker Prize in 1997 for, said her writing has always come from ""a place of love and caring about something"".""I write when it becomes harder to keep quiet than to write,"" Roy told PTI in an interview. She added, ""People don't understand why one gets so upset? Why do I write? Because it comes from a place of love. It comes from caring about something. Otherwise, why should I bother? Like, why shouldn't I enjoy my Booker Prize or whatever it was.""She said she does not see herself as both a writer and activist. ""It’s a label I find absurd, something like the clunky term sofa-bed,"" she remarked.Roy described writing itself as a risky pursuit. ""The most dangerous place in the history of time has been writing. I've never been under any illusion that it was a safe place. So I'm okay here. Because it's the safety that suffocates me,"" she said.The memoir details her difficult relationship with her mother, who, she recalls, insisted her children address her as “Mrs Roy” like other students at her school in Kerala. “It was almost as though for her (Mary) to shine her light on her students and give them all she had, we — he (the brother) and I (Roy) — had to absorb the darkness,” Roy writes.She added, “She was rough, and that roughness was what put some steel into my spine... So when all those people were around me — protesting and calling me names — I’d just be going like, 'Do you know whose daughter I am?' Like, my needle isn't moving at all.”Over the years, Arundhati Roy has faced cases, protests, and even a day in jail for supporting the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Her bookwas banned in Jammu and Kashmir this August along with 24 other titles for allegedly promoting ""false narrative and secessionism"".","Arundhati Roy says those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.

NEW DELHI: AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday alleged that the Gandhi family has not faced jail in the National Herald case despite what he called clear facts, and claimed there is a wider perception that the Congress has ""compromised"" with the BJP.""Politics of compromise doesn't work. If you think that a compromise will happen behind closed doors and the public won't find out, that's not the case. Everything becomes known.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” He said no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.

India–Canada Relations Set For Reset; Modi And Carney Seek To Mend Broken Ties | G7 Summit

NEW DELHI: After an ugly diplomatic spat over the killing of a Khalistan separatist that saw bilateral ties hit rock bottom last year, India and Canada took a significant step forward Thursday to normalise the relationship as they announced appointments of high commissioners in each other's capitals. This followed the agreement in June, when PM Narendra Modi met his counterpart Mark Carney, to take ""calibrated and constructive"" steps to stabilise ties.India announced the appointment of senior diplomat Dinesh Patnaik as the new high commissioner to Canada. Patnaik is presently India's ambassador to Spain and is expected to take up his new assignment shortly, according to the ministry of external affairs. Shortly after that, Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand announced the name of veteran diplomat Christopher Cooter, who has experience of having served in India earlier, as the new high commissioner to India.Modi had met Carney on the margins of the G7 summit in Alberta in June, agreeing to take steps to rebuild the relationship based on shared democratic values, respect for the rule of law, and commitment to upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The two sides had then agreed to pursue a balanced partnership grounded in ""mutual respect for concerns and sensitivities, strong people-to-people ties, and growing economic complementarities"".Official sources said India will continue to pursue with Canadian authorities the need to act against Khalistan separatists who seek to hurt Indian interests.India had expelled dozens of diplomats earlier, as the relationship took a nosedive over the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar for which Ottawa blamed the Indian govt. India always maintained that the govt led by Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau never provided any evidence to back its claim. While Canada expelled Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma and five other Indian diplomats accusing them of running a campaign of violence in Oct last year, India had said Verma and others were withdrawn because Canadian authorities had failed to ensure security for him and other Indian diplomats in an ""atmosphere of extremism and violence"".Ottawa Thursday described the fresh appointments as an important step towards restoring necessary diplomatic services to citizens and businesses in both countries.""The appointment of a new high commissioner reflects Canada's step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India. This appointment is an important development toward restoring services for Canadians while strengthening the bilateral relationship to support Canada's economy,"" said Anand. In line with the understanding reached in the Modi-Carney meeting, the two sides are also considering restarting talks for Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) that could clear the path for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).According to Canada, Cooter has 35 years of diplomatic experience, having served most recently as Canada's charge d'affaires to Israel and as Canada's high commissioner to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Mauritius and Madagascar. He has also served as first secretary in the Canadian high commission to India, Nepal and Bhutan, in New Delhi, from 1998 to 2000.","India and Canada announce appointments of high commissioners in each other's capitals.

New Delhi: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat Thursday said families should ideally have three children, calling it necessary for balance in society and future stability. Speaking on the final day of the '100 Years Journey of RSS: New Horizons' series, Bhagwat said demographic changes always have serious social and political effects, emphasising that both extraordinary rise and dips in birth rates can have problems. ""All scriptures say that societies with very few children gradually disappear. So, this balance must be maintained. Having three children is the right thing. Not less than three, not much more either,"" the RSS chief said.He also quoted doctors to say that three children, their births rightly spaced, are good for families as well as for their younger members as growing up with siblings helps in tempering egos.""To keep a civilisation alive, India's population policy suggests 2.1 (average number of children), which basically means three children. But resources have to be managed too, so we must restrict it to three,"" he said during a question-answer session on the last day of the RSS centenary lecture series.He said while Sangh is not leading an Ayodhya-kind movement for the ""reclamation"" of sites like Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque and Mathura's Shahi Idgah, its members were free to join agitation for restoring the places to Hindus.Stressing India's Muslims are citizens who deserve livelihood and respect, Bhagwat added that people must value their mother tongues while also using English as a language of communication.Responding to a question, Bhagwat asserted that religion is by individual choice and there should be no allurement or force in this matter. ""Religion is an individual's own choice. No one should be forcefully converted. We have to stop it. The second issue is infiltration. Every country has their own rules and regulations, limited resources. So, infiltration should be stopped and the govt is making efforts to stop this. .. We should give jobs to our own people, including Muslims,"" he said.On the issue of changing names of roads and towns bearing Muslim names, he said his insistence was that roads or towns should not be named after invaders.",RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said families should ideally have three children.

A bench of Justices Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh asked Sharma to move Delhi HC for dismissal of FIR.It, however, agreed to hear his plea challenging constitutional validity of Section 152 of BNS which is akin to sedition provision but turned down repeated pleas to hear his petition against the FIR. The bench was initially not inclined to entertain the plea, leading senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the journalist to argue that another bench of SC had agreed to hear a similar plea filed by another journalist - a reference to a petition filed by Siddharth Varadarajan and Karan Thapar's petition which was entertained by the court.Sibal insisted that SC must maintain uniformity and Sharma's plea be also heard. The bench however refused the plea and granted interim protection to Sharma to enable him to approach HC. Sharma told the court that the alleged offensive video posted by him stems from a recent Guwahati HC proceeding with respect to such allotment.Refuting the allegation of ridiculing and denigrating the govts, the petitioner said his statements are not fabricated assertions but grounded in verifiable facts which were supported by original video clips of political speeches made by the Assam CM available in the public domain.","Abhisar Sharma accused state govt of 'communal politics' and questioned allotment of 3,000 acre of tribal land to a private entity.

Supreme Court raised the question - its refrain through the hearings on presidential reference over the court's decision to fix timelines for governors and the President to take calls on bills - again at the end of arguments from the Centre and NDA-led states canvassing wide discretionary powers for the state executive head.Leading the arguments on behalf of opposition-governed states that are diametrically opposite to those advanced by the Centre, senior advocate A M Singhvi, on behalf of Tamil Nadu, told the bench that a governor is merely an ornamental head of the state and bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister on every option to be exercised by him with regard to a bill.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narsimha and A S Chandurkar said, ""The Constituent Assembly deleted the six-week timeline for a governor to take a decision on a bill and replaced it with 'as soon as possible'. Does it not mean at the earliest and not later than six weeks? As the framers of the Constitution expected a governor to act expeditiously, can SC not examine if a governor indefinitely sits over a bill passed by assembly to frustrate law-making?""This question came from the bench when solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that a state govt is precluded from invoking Article 32 to seek a writ against a governor, who as per the Constitution is not answerable to a court for the decisions he takes while holding the constitutional post.Singhvi said a governor has no discretionary power to negate a bill passed by an assembly. Making a governor's decisions non-justiciable would make him, not the will of the people through an assembly, the supreme law-making authority as he can scotch a validly passed bill null and void by simply consigning it to his cupboard and forgetting about it, he said.The bench said if a governor finds a bill to be repugnant to central law, he had the option of reserving it for the President's consideration.",Can a governor keep a bill passed by the assembly pending indefinitely to frustrate the will of the people exercised through the legislature?

Teachers cross 1 cr mark even as school enrolment falls to 7-year low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/teachers-cross-1-cr-mark-even-as-school-enrolment-falls-to-7-year-low/articleshow/123570200.cms,".

New Delhi: India has, for the first time, crossed the milestone of having more than one crore school teachers in a single academic year. This happened in 2024–25, even as the number of children enrolled in schools fell to its lowest in seven years.According to the Ministry of Education’s Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+), the total enrolment in schools stood at 24.68 crore in 2024–25, which is about 11 lakh less than the previous year. Officials said the fall in enrolment is mainly because of declining birth rates, though some states have shown a different trend. They added that the enrolment calculation is based on the 2011 Census population, which inflates the denominator in Gross Enrolment Ratio projections, and that the upcoming Census in 2026 will provide a clearer picture.Even though fewer children are coming into schools, the number of teachers has been rising steadily, improving the student-teacher balance. The UDISE+ data shows that at the foundational stage, the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) is now 10, at the preparatory stage 13, at the middle stage 17, and at the secondary stage 21. These ratios are much better than the 1:30 benchmark suggested in the National Education Policy 2020.Teacher strength has gone up by 6.7% compared to 2022–23, a growth that officials said will ensure more individual attention to students, stronger teacher-student interaction and better classroom support.The overall enrolment has been shrinking over the last few years. In 2022–23, 25.18 crore students were enrolled, which dropped to 24.8 crore in 2023–24 and further to 24.68 crore in 2024–25. But alongside this fall, dropout rates have shown a sharp decline. At the preparatory stage, dropouts have come down from 3.7% to 2.3%; at the middle level, from 5.2% to 3.5%; and at the secondary level, from 10.9% to 8.2%. Officials said this shows that children are staying in schools longer and schools are becoming more responsive to students’ needs.Retention levels have also gone up. At the foundational stage, retention improved from 98.0% to 98.9%; at the preparatory level from 85.4% to 92.4%; at the middle level from 78% to 82.8%; and at the secondary level from 45.6% to 47.2%. The report said one major reason for the improvement at the secondary level is the increase in the number of schools offering secondary education, which has made access easier and encouraged students to continue.UDISE+ also reported a significant decline in single-teacher and zero-enrolment schools. Officials said this has been possible because of targeted government interventions aimed at rationalising schools and teacher allocation. The number of single-teacher schools fell by about 6% compared to last year, while schools with zero enrolment declined by nearly 38%. The report said this reduction is a sign of better planning and will help create a more balanced education system.","The total enrolment in schools stood at 24.68 crore in 2024–25, which is about 11 lakh less than the previous year.

Head-on collisions were the reason for 28,898 fatalities (nearly 17%).According to the report, national highways, which comprise barely 2% of the country's entire road network, witnessed 31.2% of all road crashes and 36.5% of fatalities.

Since glanders are zoonotic, preventing its spread in equines also protects human health.Though the guidelines, issued by the animal husbandry and dairying ministry, primarily apply to these yatras with immediate effect, states may extend them to other religious/tourism-related journeys involving equines.The guidelines provide a uniform framework for mandatory registration and tagging of all equines, health certification with compulsory testing for glanders and equine influenza, and a minimum acclimatisation of working equines engaged in carrying pilgrims and goods to high-altitude areas during the yatras.It also prohibits night movement and makes insurance coverage for all working equines mandatory. There is also a provision of defined load limits for equines (80–90 kg for horses/mules, 50 kg for ponies and 25 kg for donkeys).Under the revised action plan on glanders, the ministry makes testing of equines in endemic and high-risk areas mandatory, supported by improved laboratory diagnostics and regular field inspections.The plan strengthens surveillance, diagnostic capacity, response measures and stakeholder engagement, incorporating recent experiences and scientific inputs to make the programme more robust and effective.","The move is expected to ensure safety of pilgrims during pilgrimages.

I never said I will retire or someone else should retire at 75 years,"" RSS chief Bhagwat said.Over the past few years, the opposition has consistently criticised the BJP for its apparent policy of not fielding candidates older than 75.This stance was allegedly based on comments made by Shah prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, where he stated that it was his party's decision not to give Lok Sabha poll tickets to those above 75 years of age, leading to veteran leaders like L K Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi missing out.Shah said, ""Only the media is pushing this issue. No one above 75 has been given tickets. This is the party's decision."" He made these remarks in an interview to 'The Week'.However, Shah later clarified that this was an electoral decision, emphasising, ""There is no provision regarding age, anywhere in the Constitution of the BJP.""Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal also voiced his concerns, stating, ""He ( PM Modi) will retire next year.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said there is no rift between the Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said the Sangh can give advice on any issue, but the final decision will be taken by the BJP.The RSS chief said there could be ""difference of opinion"" while working towards the goals of the country, but there was no “manbhed (heart-to-heart differences)”.""There are opinions, but we discuss and form a consensus to decide whether it is against one's opinion or in favour of it.

Not only this one. But there are systems that have some internal contradictions.The system (of governance) in general is the same, which was invented by the British so that they could rule.

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air Chief Marshal A P Singh says India must adopt its own model instead of copying others.

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.

Givani Smith joins Hurricanes on a professional try-out contract



Hurricanes seek depth to finally overcome Eastern Conference Final struggles



The Carolina Hurricanes are turning to an unlikely source as they prepare for a season that could define their future. After falling to the Florida Panthers in the Eastern Conference Final, Carolina is determined to find answers. One of those answers could come from a familiar face in Florida, as the Canes announced professional try-out deals with forward Givani Smith and defenseman Oliver Kylington ahead of training camp.The most intriguing signing for Hurricanes fans is Givani Smith. Once a teammate of Matthew Tkachuk during his stint with the Florida Panthers, Smith now finds himself battling for relevance in Raleigh. His path to this moment has been anything but steady. Drafted 46th overall by the Detroit Red Wings in 2016, Smith debuted in the NHL during the 2019–20 season, scoring two goals and adding an assist in 21 games.His time in Detroit eventually led to a trade to the Panthers in 2022, where he struggled to cement a role on a deep roster. Though part of the group that made a magical run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2023, Smith played just a single postseason game and failed to register a point. Since then, he has become a journeyman, making stops with the Sharks, Avalanche, and Flyers. Now, Carolina presents a last-chance window for the 26-year-old forward to prove his worth.For Carolina, the motivation behind these signings is no mystery. The franchise has repeatedly stumbled at the same hurdle, winning just one of its last 17 games in the Eastern Conference Final. The addition of Smith offers grit and a physical edge, while Kylington provides a potential boost to the blue line with his experience from Calgary, Colorado, and Anaheim.The message is clear: the Hurricanes are willing to take risks if it means breaking their postseason curse. Smith may not be the star that headlines the lineup, but his hunger to stick in the NHL could align perfectly with a Carolina squad desperate to climb over its long-standing wall.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid appears destined for maximum deal as analyst reveals extension proof",Carolina Hurricanes announce professional try-out deals with Givani Smith and Oliver Kylington.

Fans furious at Connor Bedard’s ranking while defending other rising stars

Connor Bedard’s growth and Blackhawks’ hopes for their franchise star

The NHL Network’s latest list ranking the top 25 players under 25 years old has set social media ablaze, with Chicago Blackhawks star Connor Bedard at the center of the debate. Despite being touted as one of the league’s brightest young talents, Bedard landed in the eighth spot—far lower than many fans expected.The list placed Buffalo Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin, New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes, and Ottawa Senators’ Tim Stutzle in the top three. But for many hockey fans, it was Bedard’s ranking that felt most disrespectful.“The Connor Bedard hate is hilarious. No chance he’s 8th hahahaha,” one fan wrote on X, echoing the sentiment of many others who felt the 2023 first overall pick should have been higher. Another fan blasted the list as an “absolute joke,” while others argued players like Lucas Raymond and Matvei Michkov were also undervalued.Not all reactions, however, defended Bedard. Some fans argued that his résumé didn’t yet justify a higher placement. “Based off what? Lol. What has Bedard done? Lucas Raymond will make you pay for your sins,” one user wrote, pointing out the small sample size of his NHL career.Since entering the league, Bedard has recorded 128 points in 150 games—a solid start for a 19-year-old forward leading a rebuilding Chicago team.NHL insider Frank Seravalli revealed that Bedard has been working on his skating and angling, while also developing a “shoot-first mentality” with a release he ranked second only to Auston Matthews.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s contract extension could wait until 2026 despite Frank Nazar’s $46M deal, says NHL analyst Bedard is now entering the final year of his entry-level contract, and the Blackhawks will likely push to lock him into a long-term extension.

NHL Trade Rumors: $81.5M star Artemi Panarin may face trade if Rangers miss postseason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-81-5m-star-artemi-panarin-may-face-trade-if-rangers-miss-postseason/articleshow/123558875.cms,"Artemi Panarin (Getty Images)

Rangers face difficult decision with Artemi Panarin ’s contract and performance

New NHL Offseason Rumors | Insider Notebook 🏒

A possible extension could reshape New York’s roster core

Artemi Panarin has been the face of the New York Rangers since arriving in 2019 on a seven-year, $81.5 million contract. But as the superstar forward enters the final year of that deal, his future in New York is far from guaranteed. NHL insider Frank Seravalli suggested that if the Rangers fail to reach the postseason in 2025-26, management could be forced to put their highest-paid player on the trade block.Now 34, Artemi Panarin is not expected to command the same $11.6 million AAV he currently carries, though his offensive pedigree still makes him one of the league’s elite. Just last season, he came off a 120-point campaign with 49 goals, proving he can still dominate. However, his most recent year was a step back, with 89 points and a -9 rating — his lowest output in a full season as a Ranger.That inconsistency has fueled speculation about his long-term role. Seravalli explained the situation bluntly: “I could for sure see that happening if the New York Rangers are out. But I’m going to tell you this, I don’t think the Rangers are going to be out. I have the Rangers as a playoff team.”Cap space will play a major role in the Rangers’ decision. With just under $30 million projected for 2026, re-signing Panarin to a double-digit AAV extension would commit the team to a veteran-heavy top six.Alongside Mika Zibanejad, Vincent Trocheck, and J.T. Miller — all in their 30s with multiple years left on their contracts — New York would be doubling down on experience over youth.Seravalli believes that outcome remains likely if Panarin produces. “I’ve got lots of faith in Artemi Panarin, and I think there’s a deal on the table that makes sense for both sides or will be at some point during this upcoming season,” he said.Also Read: Winnipeg Jets captain Adam Lowry shocks fans with stunning recovery from hip surgery ahead of schedule For now, Panarin’s performance may determine whether the Rangers build around him once more — or cash in on his value before time runs out.","Rangers face difficult decision with Artemi Panarin ’s contract and performance.

Former Maple Leafs forward brutally questions Golden Knights star’s NHL ranking with surprising “not like won the masters” jab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/former-maple-leafs-forward-brutally-questions-golden-knights-stars-nhl-ranking-with-surprising-not-like-won-the-masters-jab/articleshow/123569639.cms,"Ex-Leafs forward downplays Golden Knights star’s ranking, sparking heated debate among NHL fans and analysts alike

Is Jack Eichel overrated despite his Stanley Cup win?



Looking ahead: Eichel’s legacy on the line



The Vegas Golden Knights have leaned heavily on Jack Eichel since acquiring him in 2021, and he hasn’t disappointed. With a career-best 94 points in 77 games last season and a central role in securing the 2023 Stanley Cup, Eichel’s impact is undeniable. Yet, his recent placement in NHL Network’s top-20 centers list has stirred controversy, leaving fans and analysts questioning whether his ranking reflects reality or reputation.When the rankings placed Connor McDavid , Nathan MacKinnon, Leon Draisaitl, Aleksander Barkov, and Sidney Crosby in the top five, many expected Eichel to be close behind. Instead, his lower-than-anticipated position triggered debate. Former Toronto Maple Leafs forward Jay Rosehill, speaking on Leafs Morning Take, was particularly candid. He argued that context matters more than pure numbers when evaluating Eichel’s status.Rosehill remarked, “The one guy I looked at is Jack Eichel. I understand he’s got a cup, but it’s not like he won the Masters, like it was a purely individual effort.” In his view, Eichel benefited from being part of a well-constructed Vegas roster, rather than carrying the team singlehandedly. He added that not every player with a championship ring automatically deserves to be elevated into the sport’s pantheon.Still, Rosehill admitted that Eichel’s production places him among the NHL’s best forwards, even if he stops short of generational status. With mid-90s points last season and the potential to break the 100-point barrier, Eichel remains an elite offensive force—just perhaps not on the same tier as legends like Crosby or Draisaitl.The coming seasons may be decisive in shaping how Eichel is remembered. His current trajectory suggests he’ll remain a cornerstone for the Golden Knights, but the question lingers—can he transcend being “a piece of it” and build a legacy as one of the league’s most dominant individual talents?With a possible mega-contract extension looming next summer, the spotlight on Eichel will only intensify. For now, his blend of skill, consistency, and championship pedigree keeps him firmly in the conversation, even if opinions differ on just how high he belongs in the NHL hierarchy.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid appears destined for maximum deal as analyst reveals extension proof",Jack Eichel's ranking in NHL Network's top-20 centers list has stirred controversy.

Connor McDavid prioritizes patience and perspective

Edmonton’s confidence in their captain’s future

The future of Connor McDavid , widely considered the best player in hockey today, has been a constant source of speculation in Edmonton and across the NHL. With just one season left on his current eight-year, $100 million contract, fans and analysts alike have wondered if the Oilers captain is prepared to lock in his long-term future or test the waters of free agency. This week, McDavid addressed those questions directly, offering insight into why he isn’t in a hurry to make a decision.Speaking to reporters, Connor McDavid emphasized that his approach hasn’t changed since the summer. “I said at the end of June, I had every intention to take my time with it, and I still feel the same way,” he explained. “I’ll take my time and go through everything with my family, my agent, and everybody involved.”While his next deal will likely reshape the league financially, McDavid stressed that his focus remains on winning. “I have every intention to win in Edmonton,” he said. “That’s my only focus, maybe next to winning a gold medal with Canada. But that is my intention: to win there.”Despite the uncertainty, Oilers leadership remains optimistic. Jeff Jackson, the team’s CEO of hockey operations and McDavid’s former agent, downplayed concerns of a prolonged saga.“He has another year. He loves playing in Edmonton… It’s not going to be a long negotiation,” Jackson said on The Sheet with Jeff Marek Podcast.With training camp set to open on September 17 and the season beginning October 8 against rival Calgary, McDavid is determined to keep the focus on hockey. “All options are on the table, really,” he said. “We’re going through it slowly.”Also Read: Amid contract deadline Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle spark buzz as they take a private jet back to Edmonton","The future of Connor McDavid has been a constant source of speculation in Edmonton and across the NHL.

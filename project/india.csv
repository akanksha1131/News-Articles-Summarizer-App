"'Service, commitment, ethics': Revanth Reddy praises Sonia Gandhi amid Digvijaya Singh's RSS post; lauds Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-force-for-people-revanth-reddy-praises-sonia-gandhi-amid-digvijaya-singhs-rss-post-lauds-congress/articleshow/126224522.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversy over Digvijaya Singh 's remarks praising the RSS’s organisational strength, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi 's role in Congress leadership, citing examples of elevation of Manmohan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao to the post of Prime Minister.In a social media post on X, Reddy, on the 140th foundation day of the Congress, said that the party “has shaped every defining chapter of modern India.”“Congress: a force for the people of India was born 140 years ago on this day. The story of the Indian National Congress is the story of Indian democracy in motion. When one reflects on the leadership of Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji, we find service, commitment, ethics and values,” Reddy said.“Under Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji’s leadership, it became possible for Shri P V Narasimha Rao garu, who started his public career from a remote village in Telangana, to rise to become Prime Minister of the country. Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji also made an economist like Dr Manmohan Singh Ji the Prime Minister. From leading India’s freedom struggle to framing the Constitution, from building democratic institutions to uniting a diverse nation, the Indian National Congress has shaped every defining chapter of modern India,” he added.This comes after Digvijaya Singh stirred a controversy by sharing a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader L K Advani in Gujarat.Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing it to the “power of organisation.”He tagged several senior Congress leaders, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, Prime Minister Modi, and the official Congress handles.Reportedly, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister rued “over-centralisation” in the Congress and pushed for decentralisation in the presence of top leadership at the CWC meeting held on Saturday.He also complained that district and state chiefs were appointed by the AICC and questioned why decisions taken at the Udaipur Chintan Shivir, including setting up an election management department, had not been implemented.Last week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him “full marks,” while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, “Rahul ji, you are absolutely ‘bang on’ in matters of socio-economic issues. Full marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like the Election Commission needs reforms, so does the Indian National Congress. You have started with ‘Sangathan Srijan’, but we need more pragmatic, decentralised functioning.”He added, “I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. The only problem is that it is not easy to ‘convince’ you!!”","Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi's role in Congress leadership.

Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

BENGALURU: What began as a tattoo of ""another woman"" on the husband's forearm ended in the murder of his wife and a sentence of life imprisonment for him.Earlier this week, a city court convicted 33-year-old Vinay Kumar, a resident of A Narayanapura in Mahadevapura, of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021. Since his arrest, Kumar had remained lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, with his attempt to secure bail failing.Kumar and Ashwini, an engineer and his younger sister's classmate, met at a family wedding, fell in love, and married in 2018. But the marriage began to unravel three years later when Kumar returned home with a tattoo reading ""Roopa"" inked on his right forearm. When Ashwini questioned him about the tattoo and demanded to know who Roopa was, Kumar gave evasive answers. She later discovered that he was having an affair.According to the prosecution, Kumar feared she might take legal or personal action against him. Unwilling to end the relationship with Roopa, he decided to eliminate his wife.Public prosecutor Satyavati HR told TOI the murder was planned carefully. On the night of April 16, 2021, Kumar purchased a can of beer and a strip of 10 sleeping tablets before returning home.After having chicken biryani for dinner, he forced Ashwini to drink the beer, secretly mixed with the tablets. She soon slipped into a deep sleep. Kumar believed the overdose would be fatal. When he found Ashwini still breathing early the next morning, Kumar strangled her using her dupatta.""Afterwards, he stepped out of the house and raised the alarm, claiming his wife was lying motionless,"" Satyavati said. With a neighbour's help, he took Ashwini to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. Kumar initially managed to convince Ashwini's parents and relatives that it was a natural death. However, Mahadevapura police ordered an autopsy, while viscera samples were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.The autopsy revealed the death was due to strangulation, leading to Kumar's arrest. Subsequent FSL reports confirmed the presence of alcohol and sleeping tablets in Ashwini's system.During the trial, circumstantial evidence sealed Kumar's fate. Testimonies from a wine shop cashier and a medical store assistant, backed by CCTV footage, established that Kumar had purchased the beer and sleeping tablets on the night of the murder.After police filed the charge-sheet, Kumar filed his bail application. Police, however, discovered that the surety documents submitted were fake and informed the court that his family had distanced themselves from him after the crime. The bail plea was rejected, forcing him to spend time in prison.","Vinay Kumar, 33, convicted of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021.

30–35 terrorists on radar: Army steps up counterterror ops in J&K; heightened vigilance amid 'Chillai Kalan',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3035-terrorists-on-radar-army-steps-up-counterterror-ops-in-jk-heightened-vigilance-amid-chillai-kalan/articleshow/126211810.cms,"Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir , the Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.Army units have expanded their operational reach into higher and snowbound areas to pursue and neutralise Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment, news agency ANI reported, citing sources.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.The sources said that the Army and security forces have adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.This year's counter-terror strategy has been the integrated approach to operations. The Indian Army is leading a synchronised effort involving multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the civil administration, the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Special Operations Group (SOG), Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards (VDGs).This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution, sources said.ANI reported that intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully synthesised to draw precise situational pictures of terrorist movement and hideout patterns. Once intelligence is verified, coordinated joint operations are planned and launched, minimising overlaps and ensuring maximum impact with tactical precision.The synergy among ground units and intelligence frameworks has enhanced response time, enabling security forces to act the moment actionable information surfaces.According to the report, the terrorists, who are hiding in this region, are attempting to coerce or threaten local villagers for shelter and food supplies, though their support among locals and overground workers has sharply declined.Sources emphasised that this season's winter operations are guided by a clear doctrinal approach: Surveillance to Swift Operations and then Back to Surveillance.The philosophy emphasises an unbroken cycle of monitoring, quick response, and sustained watchfulness, minimising the chances of terrorists regrouping. This methodical rhythm allows forces to keep pressure constant while conserving resources and adapting to environmental challenges, they added.This comes with the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harshest phase of Kashmir's winter, spanning from December 21 to January 31. During this period, most activity in the mountains comes to a standstill.Meanwhile, the Indian Army has also deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units across several key sectors. These troops, adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat, have been instrumental in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.",Indian Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi continued to struggle with toxic air on Sunday, with several areas recording ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality levels, as a dense layer of smog blanketed the city.The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the 'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Morning visuals from Akshardham Temple showed the iconic structure fading into a thick, dense layer of smog that drastically reduced visibility.The AQI (Air Quality Index) in the area stood at 445, placing it in the ‘severe’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Around AIIMS, the AQI was measured at 340, categorised as ‘very poor’. Meanwhile, visuals from the ITO area showed the city shrouded in a thick blanket of smog, with hazy conditions reducing visibility.The AQI there had crossed 400, also falling under the ‘severe’ category.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, a light layer of fog enveloped the Bandra Kurla Complex, where the AQI was measured at 123, classified as ‘moderate’.Authorities have invoked Stage III measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which include restrictions on construction and industrial activities.The ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ rule is being enforced to curb emissions.Officials attributed the worsening conditions to a combination of cold weather, calm winds, and dense fog that trap pollutants close to the ground. Experts warn that the cycle of poor air quality is expected to continue under current weather patterns.The Commission for Air Quality Management has advised vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and people with respiratory issues, to limit prolonged outdoor exposure and wear masks.","The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400.

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine.Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death. Friends recalled how Anjel, in his final days, struggled but never regained full consciousness. Protests have begun in colleges in the northeast, demanding a national law against racial hate crimes. In Dehradun, too, student organisations are beginning to speak up.","Anjel Chakma, 24, died in Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days.

Dense smog engulfs Delhi-NCR: IMD issues orange alert; visuals show almost zero visibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dense-smog-engulfs-delhi-ncr-imd-issues-orange-alert-visuals-show-almost-zero-visibility/articleshow/126218395.cms,"Screengrab: X/PTI

Delhi-NCR witnessed severely reduced visibility late Sunday night and early Monday as a dense blanket of smog engulfed the region.Visuals from several parts of the region, including AIIMS flyover and Noida’s Sector 37 showed vehicles struggling through a haze of toxic smog, highlighting the severity of the pollution.The blow is twofold, as the city grapples with cold winter temperatures alongside rising pollution levels.The Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert for very dense fog on Monday, warning commuters of restricted visibility on major roads.Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) issued a passenger advisory as dense fog blanketed the national capital. Airport authorities announced that flight operations are being conducted under CAT III (Category III) conditions—an advanced instrument landing system that allows specially trained pilots and equipped aircraft to land in low-visibility environments (typically below 200–300 meters).The advisory reads, ""Flight operations are currently being conducted under CAT III conditions due to dense fog, which may result in delays and cancellations. Our ground teams are actively assisting passengers to ensure smooth travel. We sincerely regret for any inconvenience caused"".Due to dense fog at Delhi Airport, an Air India Express flight traveling from Goa’s Manohar International Airport (Mopa) to New Delhi was diverted to Ahmedabad in the early hours of Monday.The flight, which departed at 11:55 pm, was scheduled to land at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) Terminal 1 at 2:35 am.IndiGo also issued a travel advisory on Monday morning, December 29, 2025, warning that Delhi and Hindon (Ghaziabad) airports remain ""wrapped in chilly winter air and lingering fog.""The airline noted that fluctuating visibility has led to changes in flight schedules and cautioned that operations may be slower than usual as ground teams prioritize safety and compliance with visibility requirements.Maximum and minimum temperatures are expected around 22°C and 7°C, respectively, with Sunday night’s minimum dipping to 6.3°C, slightly below the seasonal average.The city’s air quality slipped into the “very poor” category, with several areas, including Anand Vihar, recording hazardous AQI levels above 400. Authorities advised residents, especially children, the elderly, and those with respiratory issues, to stay indoors.Under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), officials have imposed curbs on construction and industrial activity, while enforcing the ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ rule to control vehicular emissions.Experts have cautioned that poor air quality will likely continue under the prevailing weather conditions.",Delhi-NCR witnessed severely reduced visibility late Sunday night and early Monday as a dense blanket of smog engulfed the region.

"On the roof of the world, feral dogs hunt down Ladakh’s rare species",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladkah-on-the-roof-of-the-world-feral-dogs-hunt-down-ladakhs-rare-species/articleshow/126218554.cms,"Lean, feral dogs move with predatory intensity across a snow-dusted desert, Ladakh's stark peaks looming behind.

SRINAGAR: It’s bloody murder on the roof of the world.A new predator has quietly grown to dangerous numbers. Feral dogs roam the cold desert of Ladakh, preying, often in packs, on endangered wildlife and attacking people. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.What began as a byproduct of increased tourism, military deployment, and unmanaged waste in the cold desert moonscape of Ladakh has grown into a full-blown crisis. And it’s manmade.Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000, far in excess of what the region’s ecology can sustain — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like Pallas’s cat, the Eurasian lynx, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep, ibex, and Himalayan marmots, said Lobzang Visuddha, chairman of the Wildlife Conservation and Birds Club of Ladakh (WCBCL), a community-based voluntary initiative by young people.The killing of a Pallas’s cat, one of the rarest and least-studied species, by feral dogs in Anley last year has alarmed conservationists like Visuddha. “In fact, there are records of killing two Pallas’s cats and Eurasian lynxes by feral dogs,” he saidThe dogs also threaten ground-nesting birds, with packs frequently chasing black-necked cranes, the UT’s state bird, and attacking ruddy shelduck chicks when they move from rocky nesting sites to nearby water bodies, Visuddha said.Advocate Tashi Gyalson, who headed the local government in Leh as chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council from Nov 2020 to Nov 2025, said the issue hasn't been arisen all of a sudden. “We have to admit that this situation has actually been created by humans over a long period of time,” he said.Gyalson said these dogs have been part of the ecosystem and community but rapid urbanisation meant they lost their use as hunting dogs, shepherd dogs, watchdogs and companion animals. “This, multiplied by the abundant carrying capacity of the environment, caused their rapid multiplication, and eventually caused the current situation,” he said.Experts say the worst hit is eastern Ladakh, the region with the highest concentration of wildlife, where poor waste management are subsidising the dog population.“The main concern is the availability of excess kitchen waste in areas occupied by the Army and areas where there is tourism,” Gyalson said.The stretch from Kargyan Chibra to Tsokar, in eastern Ladakh, has become a hotspot for feral dog activity due to unsustainable waste “Feral dogs are by far the most serious threat as far as the wildlife of Ladakh is concerned. I have myself seen how stray dogs in Hanle and Tso Moriri actually raided the nests of the black-necked crane, and preyed upon the eggs and young ones,” said Intesar Suhail, who was wildlife warden of Ladakh in 2013-14.“I have even seen them chasing animals as big as the Tibetan wild ass. The active ground nests of waterbirds, particularly the black-necked crane and bar-headed goose, are more vulnerable as they are located in marshy areas, surrounded by shallow waters easily accessible to dogs,” he said.A strong sense of smell and pack behaviour give feral dogs a lethal advantage over wildlife that evolved without such human-introduced predators, Visuddha said.“Though these species face natural threats in the wild, feral dogs are not one of them, they are a problem introduced by humans,” said the WCBCL founder.Ladakh has also reported at least five fatal attacks on humans, mostly on women and children, by feral dogs, which was unheard of in the region until recently, he said.Phuntsog Wangail, president of the Chamba Animal Welfare Society, which runs Ladakh’s largest animal care facility, said Ladakh was facing growing fears of long-term ecological imbalance due to feral dogs.They survive largely on food waste from tourist camps, hotels, roadside dhabas and temporary settlements. When these facilities close or relocate, particularly during winter, the canines are left without reliable food sources and begin roaming over long distances.“This seasonal movement pushes dogs into wildlife habitats, increases territorial conflicts, and accelerates breeding, placing Ladakh’s fragile ecosystem under severe pressure,” Wangail said.Visuddha said the feral dog threat to wildlife of Ladakh was next only to human activity.The rapid infrastructure expansion, including road building, power lines and mobile towers, has already fragmented habitats, while the expansion of camps, resorts, guest houses and hotels has intensified pressure on wildlife, he said.In winter, when tourism grinds to a halt and food becomes scarce, the dogs roam extensively, leading to a rise in dog-bite cases, road accidents and formation of aggressive packs. “At the same time, winter offers the best window for sterilisation, as dogs tend to remain closer to human settlements.”Data from the Animal Husbandry Department in Leh shows that 32,887 dogs were sterilised between 2015 and 2024, yet officials and conservationists say the population remains dangerously high.Wangial said Ladakh should carry out mass sterilisation over the next two years, with a special focus on female dogs and puppies, while calling for strict enforcement of animal welfare laws, including heavy penalties for dog dislocation, abandonment and cruelty.He called for the replication of successful models from the Netherlands and Bhutan, where mass sterilisation, strict enforcement of animal welfare laws and strong community participation have led to significant reductions in stray populations.While Visuddha said govt appears unconcerned about the issue, Gyalson offered a contrasting view. He said that after Ladakh became a Union Territory in 2019, a mission-mode campaign was launched to control the dog population. “The impact of the programme is visible as there are far fewer street puppies, especially in Leh city,” he said.However, Gyalson said several challenges continue to hinder effective population control, including Ladakh’s vast and rugged terrain, extreme climate, dispersed dog population, difficulties in capturing animals, and the absence of an accurate census.","Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000 — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126218917,imgsize-191006,width-400,resizemode-4/predators-on-the-plain.jpg"

Spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi said the BJP recognises a “gudri ke laal” like PM Modi, while Congress focuses on “Jawahar ke laal”.Singh later clarified that his remarks had been misunderstood. “I was, am and will be a trenchant critic of the RSS and Modi,” he said. He reiterated, “I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS… But I admire their organisational capacity.”Meanwhile, Congress media department chairman Pawan Khera drew a sharp line, saying, “There’s nothing to learn from the RSS.

Hadi Killing: Dhaka Police Say Main Accused Escaped to India via Meghalaya

NEW DELHI: Security agencies in Meghalaya on Sunday rejected claims by the Bangladesh Police that the killers of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi had entered the state. They termed the allegations as unfounded and misleading.""There is no evidence to suggest that any individual crossed the international border from the Haluaghat sector into Meghalaya. The BSF has neither detected nor received any report of such an incident,"" BSF chief in Meghalaya, Inspector General O P Opadhyay was quoted as saying by PTI.A senior Meghalaya police officer said there was “no input or intelligence to corroborate” claims that the suspects were present in the Garo Hills region, adding that local police units had detected no such movement and that coordination with central agencies was ongoing. Border Security Force (BSF) officials said personnel deployed along the international border remain on high alert to prevent any untoward incident, especially in view of the unrest and volatile situation in the neighbouring country.Also Read: 'Horrific': US slams mob violence on Hindu worker Dipu Chandra Das in Bangladesh; demands action The force added that the border in the sector is under constant surveillance and that any attempt at illegal cross-border movement would be swiftly detected and dealt with.The Garo Hills region lies in Meghalaya’s western sector, which shares an international border with Bangladesh and is guarded by the Border Security Force.Earlier in the day, Bangladesh Police claimed that two prime suspects in the murder of Inquilab Moncho leader Osman Hadi had fled the country and entered India through the Meghalaya border.Addressing a media briefing in Dhaka, the Additional Commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh crossed into India via the Haluaghat border in Mymensingh with the assistance of local associates.Bangladesh Police said the suspects crossed into India through the Haluaghat border, were received by a local contact, and were later taken by taxi to Tura in Meghalaya, according to a report in the Daily Star.He added that Bangladeshi police had received informal reports indicating that Indian security agencies had detained those who assisted the suspects, and said the Bangladesh government is actively working to secure their return.Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, was shot in the head on December 12 during an election campaign in Dhaka. He was airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment but succumbed to his injuries on December 18.Hadi, spokesperson of Inquilab Moncho, was a prominent youth leader during the mass street protests in July–August 2024 that contributed to the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government. He was also a parliamentary candidate for the upcoming elections scheduled on February 12.",Bangladesh Police say two prime suspects in the murder of Inquilab Moncho leader Osman Hadi had fled the country and entered India through the Meghalaya border.

Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'Sanghatan Srijan' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""This is not the first time when senior leaders in Congress have called for organisational restructuring. In December, former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi , calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran ""is unable to resonate with India's youth.""Similar concerns were also raised in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections this year in November, where the distance between the ""leadership"" and the workers was on display during seat distribution talks.Earlier in 2020, a group of 23 senior leaders in the party had written a letter to Sonia demanding “collective and inclusive leadership” in the party.

'Power of the organisation'

BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday stopped short of agreeing with its senior leader Digvijay Singh after he gave example of Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh ( RSS ) to call for organisational reforms within Congress.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, reacting to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister's remarks said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Earlier on Saturday Digvijay praised the organisational strength of RSS and shared a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi seated back on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, acknowledging how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh BJP worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""However, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO.

Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress.

First Indian among world’s top 10 richest women



In 2025, women were no longer the footnote to the big story — they were the story. Across crises and celebrations, ballots and battlefields, podiums and boardrooms, women emerged as the decisive force shaping outcomes and narratives.This year ender traces how women became the X factor of 2025: from the symbolism and steel of Operation Sindoor , to the women voters who once again decided Bihar’s fate; from new women heads of state reshaping global politics, to athletes who carried India’s sporting year; and finally, to a woman who climbed into the world’s richest ranks, redefining economic power.These were not isolated moments. Together, they marked a year when women didn’t just influence events — they changed the balance.A newlywed wife, sitting silently beside her husband’s body — the image that came to define the Pahalgam attack.A terrorist strike. Twenty-six dead. All men.“Go, tell Modi,” a terrorist told a woman after shooting her husband.Operation Sindoor was the response. Its imagery was stark and deliberate — red and black, vermillion smeared like a warning. A symbol of vengeance, resolve, and the state’s answer to terror.""Terrorists dared to wipe 'sindoor' from the foreheads of our sisters; that is why India destroyed the very headquarters of terror,"" PM Modi had said in his first address to the nation after the launch of the operation.The symbolism did not stop at words or posters. It took shape on the world stage when two women officers stepped forward to brief the global media on Operation Sindoor.Their presence was widely seen as intentional messaging — women not just as victims or symbols, but as the face and force of India’s response to terror.Operation Sindoor also saw women in direct combat. In the Akhnoor sector along the IB, a six-member women’s BSF team led by Assistant Commandant Neha Bhandari defended forward posts under sustained Pakistani fire for three days and nights, forcing enemy positions across Sialkot to retreat. For several of the young recruits, it was their first combat test — marking a decisive shift from symbolism to frontline action.Women decided Bihar’s verdict once again, delivering Nitish Kumar a victory that numbers make hard to dispute. While their support for the JD(U)-BJP government’s pro-women agenda has been steady since 2005, this election saw a decisive surge.The turnout told its own story. As many as 71.6% women voted, nearly nine percentage points higher than men, and a sharp rise from 59.7% in 2020.A Rs 10,000 cash transfer to over 1.5 crore women in the run-up to polls acted as a turbo-boost. Like Rakhi after Diwali, the ‘das-hazariya’ payout — along with the mobilisation of Jeevika Didis — became the catalyst for the NDA’s sweeping win.For many women, this loyalty has been shaped over two decades — beginning with schemes like free bicycles for schoolgirls in Nitish Kumar’s first term.In 2010, smiling girls cycling to school became the defining image of his landslide victory, much like women voters have shaped this one.Even contentious policies have found unlikely champions. Prohibition, despite widespread criticism from men, continues to draw strong backing from women, particularly the poor, who often credit it with tangible household benefits.Add to this structural reforms — 35% reservation for women in government jobs, 50% in local bodies, and the expansive Jeevika self-help group network — and the pattern is clear.In Bihar, elections may be fought by parties, but they are increasingly won by women.Across continents in 2025, the ascent of women to the highest political office began to look less like an exception and more like a long-delayed correction. In March, Namibia’s Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah was sworn in as the country’s first woman president. In a region where power has long been shaped by patriarchal traditions, her presidency carries the promise of something deeper: a recalibration of institutional culture, with greater emphasis on accountability, environmental stewardship, and gender-balanced governance.That same shift echoed months later in South America. In July, Suriname elected Jennifer Geerlings-Simons as its first woman president at a moment of economic uncertainty and cautious optimism, driven by newly discovered offshore oil reserves. A physician by training and a respected parliamentary leader, Geerlings-Simons embodies a quieter, steadier form of authority — one rooted in consensus-building and institutional continuity. Her victory underscored an important truth: the gender wave in politics is no longer confined to large economies or global power centres. It is reaching smaller, diverse nations where leadership had remained stubbornly homogeneous for decades.By October, the tremor reached East Asia. Sanae Takaichi’s elevation as Japan’s first female prime minister shattered one of the country’s most enduring political glass ceilings. In a system long dominated by men, her rise signalled a shift not only within party hierarchies but also in public expectations. For Japan, where women’s political representation has historically lagged, Takaichi’s appointment was as much a cultural moment as a political one — a sign that the contours of leadership are slowly expanding, allowing future generations of women to imagine themselves not at the margins of power, but at its very centre.Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, Divya Deshmukh, Sheetal Devi, Nikhat Zareen , Stanzin Dolkar, Anahat Singh and India’s women footballers defined Indian sport in 2025, delivering results that cut across disciplines.The landmark moment came when the Indian women’s cricket team won its first-ever ODI World Cup, that too in front of a home crowd, with Jemimah’s match-winning knock in a pressure semi-final and a controlled final performance sealing a long-awaited title.Beyond cricket, Indian women asserted themselves with authority. Divya Deshmukh became the youngest Women’s World Cup champion in chess, while archer Sheetal Devi added a para-world title and earned selection to the able-bodied compound team purely on scores. In squash, Anahat Singh claimed the national spotlight by winning the SRFI Squash Indian Open, and in boxing, India’s women powered the country to seven of nine gold medals at the World Boxing Cup Finals, led by Nikhat Zareen.Some of the year’s most powerful moments came from inclusive and emerging sport. The Indian Blind Women’s Cricket Team won the inaugural Women’s T20 World Cup for the Blind, while Stanzin Dolkar’s decisive goals earned India its first international bronze in women’s ice hockey. Football completed the surge, with the women’s national team qualifying outright for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time in over two decades, and the U-20 and U-17 sides also sealing continental berths. In 2025, Indian women didn’t just shine — they set the standard.Roshni Nadar scripted history in 2025 by becoming the first Indian woman to break into the world’s top 10 richest women, ranking fifth on the Hurun Global Rich List with a net worth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore ($40 billion).The milestone followed the transfer of a 47% stake in HCL Technologies from her father, Shiv Nadar, firmly establishing her as India’s richest woman and the country’s third-richest individual this year.","This year ender traces how women became the X factor of 2025.

‘Woman married 2nd time, not entitled to maintenance’

Heartbreak, divorce & deadly crimes | Dark Truth Of Failed Marriages | Ft. Anand Handa

MUMBAI: In an unexpected turn, a woman’s current husband took the witness stand to depose on behalf of her ex-spouse, ending a nearly 17-year-old domestic violence case.The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband. She sought protection and monetary relief, claiming she was ousted from her home. However, a Borivli court ruled that with her current husband confirming marriage, she was not entitled to maintenance.Additional chief judicial magistrate B N Chikne said, “As such, in such facts and circumstances and the evidence on record, it appears to me that it is proved from the evidence and documents produced on record, after divorce from the respondent No. 1 (ex-husband), the applicant (woman) performed a second marriage. Therefore, she is not entitled to get maintenance from respondent No. 1.”The judgment centred on the revelation that the woman had entered into a second marriage while her original maintenance claim was still active.In her plea, the woman said she married her ex-husband in 2005 through an arranged setup. She alleged that she later found out that the man was already married and his first wife began to frequent their home.Along with the ex-husband, his first wife would abuse her too. She alleged numerous incidents of physical, emotional and economic abuse. In Dec 2009, the first husband was directed to pay the woman an interim monthly maintenance of Rs 3,200 until the disposal of the case.While the woman’s sister served as a witness to support her allegations, the man brought to court an imam who officiated the woman’s second marriage, a handwriting and fingerprint expert who testified on the signatures and thumb impression on the nikahnama of the second marriage, and her husband.The trajectory of the trial shifted dramatically when her ex-husband produced her current husband as a defence witness to confirm their marital status. By confirming the second marriage through the evidence of the current husband himself, the defence nullified the woman’s status as a dependent of her former spouse.The court ruled the existence of this second union, confirmed by the man who entered into it, extinguished the woman's right to seek further maintenance or protection from her first husband.","The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband.

"Hair-loss drug under lens over threat to infants, eye disorders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hair-loss-drug-under-lens-over-threat-to-infants-eye-disorders/articleshow/126195368.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants & a large number of eye-related side effects, according to a global safety analysis that has flagged dozens of baby-related cases and more than 1,600 eye disorder reports worldwide.Researchers identified more than 45 reports of excessive hair growth in infants aged up to 23 months linked to exposure to minoxidil. In several cases, exposure was not due to direct application but occurred unintentionally within the household, including contact with caregivers or contaminated surfaces.Globally, the analysis found 2,664 suspected cases of excessive hair growth linked to minoxidil use during pregnancy. Among infant cases, maternal exposure accounted for 22.2%, accidental exposure for 44.4%, while the route of exposure was unclear in 33.3% of cases.Though no infant cases were reported from India, the authors of the study cautioned that this likely reflected under-reporting rather than absence of risk, given the drug's widespread use.The study also raised concerns about eye health. A total of 1,660 reports of eye-related adverse effects associated with minoxidil use were recorded globally, including 25 reports from India.Frequently reported problems included eyelid swelling and blurred vision.More serious eye conditions were also noted, including central serous chorioretinopathy. After removal of duplicate reports, four serious eye cases remained - three involving central serous chorioretinopathy and one case of retinal artery occlusion.The findings are based on a post-marketing safety analysis of adverse drug reports submitted to VigiBase, the global drug safety database maintained by WHO, covering data up to March 2025.The study was authored by Dr V Kalaiselvan and Dr Jaishree Suresh of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, health ministry, and Dr Rohit Saxena of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Minoxidil was originally developed as an oral medicine to treat high blood pressure. Hair growth was later observed as a side effect, leading to its reformulation as a topical drug used to treat hair loss. Its effectiveness against androgenetic alopecia has since made it one of the most commonly used treatments worldwide.The authors warned easy over-the-counter availability, aggressive online promotion and limited counselling had allowed use to expand faster than safety awareness, particularly among pregnant women and households with infants.The study underlined that minoxidil was contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but awareness of this warning remained low. With topical formulations commonly used at home, unintentional exposure through skin contact or household surfaces may place infants at risk.Calling for action, the authors recommended clearer warning labels, stricter oversight of over-the-counter sales and routine counselling by pharmacists and healthcare providers.Caregivers were advised to store products safely and avoid use around infants and pregnant women.While minoxidil continues to benefit adults using it to treat hair loss, the authors stressed public awareness and pharmacovigilance must keep pace with growing use to prevent avoidable adverse effects.","Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants & a large number of eye-related side effects.

NEW DELHI: Union culture and tourism minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday urged senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to return correspondences and documents of the country’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru—the father of her mother-in-law and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi—to the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library (PMML).He asserted that the documents “belong to the country” and “not to any individual.”“We have requested the return of around 57 cartons containing roughly 26,000 documents that were taken from the museum. Sonia Gandhi has said she will look into the matter. Naturally, these ministerial documents cannot be the personal property of any individual. We have written two letters to her, and we once again urge that they be returned,” Shekhawat told news agency PTI.He recalled that in April 2008, on Gandhi’s instructions, her representative MV Rajan wrote a letter stating that she wished to take back all the “private family letters” and notes of the Congress stalwart.The minister elaborated, “Over a 20-year period, from 1970 to 1990, all the non-official documents related to Nehru were brought to the museum. This included personal letters he wrote to people, the replies received, and his personal comments and notes.Similar documents of all the prime ministers are preserved in the museum. There are approximately 2.5 crore such documents, of which 4 lakh relate to Pandit Nehru alone. ”While documents of other prime ministers remain the museum’s permanent property, Nehru’s were meant only for “safe custody,” he said, adding that it was therefore decided to return to the family any letters they requested.The Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) was established in April 1966, following Nehru’s death in May 1964. In June 2023, its name was changed to the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library Society to recognise all of India’s prime ministers.",Culture and tourism minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat urges Sonia Gandhi to return documents of Jawaharlal Nehru.

NEW DELHI: The survivor of the 2017 Unnao rape case on Sunday said that she fears for the safety of her children after the Delhi high court suspended the life sentence of expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar.Reacting to the CBI’s petition before the apex court, the survivor told news agency ANI, “I have faith in the Supreme Court that it will give me justice. I am raising the voice of every women... Had CBI done this before, I would have got justice. His (Kuldeep Sengar) bail would have been rejected because he raped me. My father was killed. My family members were killed. The security of my family members and witnesses was removed. .. My husband was fired from his job. My children are unsafe at home.The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the CBI’s plea on December 29. As per the cause list, a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant, along with Justices J K Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, will take up the matter. The court will also hear a separate petition filed by advocates Anjale Patel and Pooja Shilpkar challenging the high court’s order.On December 23, the Delhi high court suspended Sengar’s life sentence in the rape case, noting that he had already served seven years and five months in prison. The suspension will remain in force while his appeal against conviction is pending. The CBI moved the Supreme Court against the order on December 26.Sengar was convicted in December 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 25 lakh. While the high court granted him bail in the rape case, he will continue to remain in jail as he is serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the survivor’s father. His appeal in that case, along with a plea seeking suspension of sentence, is also pending.The high court imposed several conditions while granting bail, including a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties, a direction not to enter a 5-km radius of the survivor’s residence in Delhi, and a strict bar on threatening her or her mother.","Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted in December 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 25 lakh.

CHENNAI: Lottery operator Santiago Martin’s son, Jose Charles Martin, on Friday said his party, Latchiya Jananayaka Katchi (LJK), had expressed interest in an alliance with Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) ahead of the 2026 Assembly election, marking a shift from his earlier criticism of TVK president Vijay ’s political messaging.“We have expressed our interest. Now the response has to come from their side. We have conveyed our willingness,” Jose told reporters when asked about the possibility of an alliance, citing Vijay’s stated position against corruption.Jose said he had not yet spoken directly to Vijay. “We have sent a request first. If they show interest, we will go and meet him,” he said, adding that any meeting would depend on a response from the actor-politician.Responding to questions on his earlier remarks that Vijay’s Erode speech lacked clarity, Jose said his position was being misread. “The speech he delivered last time was like that. We said that the response it received was of that nature because of how he spoke.”“When we say there is a lack of clarity, what we mean is that the people around him are not at that level,” he said. “That clarity is supposed to be provided by them, because the information they are giving him is incorrect.”He also cited Vijay’s limited physical presence in Puducherry as a factor. “He is not going to be here regularly,” Jose said. “The people who are here are the ones who can sit down, get involved, and assess things on the ground. In such a situation, for a local party like ours, it would be good if we have their support.”Jose did not name Aadhav Arjuna, Vijay’s aide and his son-in-law, whom he had earlier accused of misleading the TVK leadership.","Lottery operator Santiago Martin’s son, Jose Charles Martin, on Friday said his party, Latchiya Jananayaka Katchi, had expressed interest in an alliance with Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.

MUMBAI: In a sophisticated twist to digital arrest scams, a 68-year-old woman from the western suburbs was duped of Rs 3.75 crore by fraudsters who staged a mock virtual court hearing featuring a man who claimed he was ""Justice Chandrachud"".Moving beyond the usual khaki-clad impersonations, the scammers got the victim to write an ""essay on her life"". While the masterminds remain at large, the West Cyber Police have arrested a 46-year-old man from Gujarat for receiving a major portion of the stolen funds into his bank account. Police said the actual callers often operate from outside the country where it's tough for Indian law enforcement to reach them.The woman's ordeal began on Aug 18 when she received a call from ""Colaba police station"" claiming her bank account was linked to a Rs 6 crore money laundering case.The complainant explained she did not operate any such bank account. But the caller had already assigned her a ""case number"" and a letter with details about her case. To ""prove"" her innocence, she was subjected to a series of high-pressure tactics. She was forbidden from disclosing case details to anyone and threatened with arrest.The complainant submitted her bank details to the scammers, as instructed by them.She was put under ""24-hour surveillance"" even as her case was being assigned to CBI. ""Officer S K Jaiswal"" took over & asked her to pen a 2-3 page essay about her life to evaluate her character. He said he was convinced of her innocence and assured her she would get bail soon. Her hearing was arranged before ""Justice Chandrachud"" soon after.The hearing started over video call and a man in judicial robes appeared, posing as ""Justice Chandrachud"". He asked her details about her money laundering case and ""rejected her bail"" when she pleaded non-guilty.She was asked to submit all her wealth for scrutiny and to redeem all her mutual funds as well. She transferred Rs 3.75 crore between Aug and Oct to the scammers. But when she never got back any if her money, she approached police.","Woman, 68, duped of Rs 3.75 crore by fraudsters who staged virtual court hearing.

34-year legal battle ends in win for wrongfully terminated man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/34-year-legal-battle-ends-in-win-for-wrongfully-terminated-man/articleshow/126222300.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Sometimes judicial proceedings are too slow and protracted to deliver justice in one's lifetime.This is reflected in a case in which the three-tier judicial system took 34 years to decide the validity of an ITDC employee's job termination. The litigant passed away a year before the final word was spoken on the litigation by the apex court, which delivered a verdict in his favour.D K Sharma was terminated in 1991 and the litigation started from the labour court. It then went before a single bench of Rajasthan HC, whose order was challenged before a division bench and the proceedings culminated in the Supreme Court.The labour court had passed an order in his favour and directed his reinstatement with 100% back wages after the management failed to lead evidence to prove the charges against him. It, however, passed the order in 2015, almost a quarter of century after his job was terminated.Aggrieved by the order, ITDC moved HC whose single bench modified the order to the extent that back wages awarded by the labour court were reduced to 50%. But a division bench of HC set aside the order of his reinstatement as well as payment of back wages. Sharma thereafter moved SC in 2020 which now directed the hotel to give 50% of back wages.Sharma had died last year and the litigation was pursued by his legal heir.""Insofar as the claim of the appellant for full back wages is concerned, having regard to the fact that there was no specific statement before the labour court that the appellant was not gainfully employed elsewhere in the interregnum as also the fact that Hotel Ashoka has changed hands, taking into account the long period that has elapsed since termination till passing of the award, we are of the view that award of 50% of back wages as directed by learned Single Judge of HC shall meet the ends of justice,"" said a bench of Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan while allowing his appeal.Granting 50% back wages to his family, the court said he had filed an affidavit stating that he was not gainfully employed in the interregnum and there was no evidence placed before the court by the opposite party to rebut his claim.The top court said that the order of the single judge bench of the HC was just and proper as a workman who had served for long would not be able to get employment if one crosses the age bar.""No doubt, a person may do odd jobs to survive but that cannot be a ground to deny back wages, particularly when termination of his service is by way of punishment,"" it said.","D K Sharma was terminated in 1991 and the litigation started from the labour court.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: A day before Supreme Court hears the suo motu civil case on the new definition of Aravali hills and ranges, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Sunday wrote to environment minister Bhupender Yadav, asking him four questions pertaining to assessment of Forest Survey of India (FSI) and views of one of the members of the central empowered committee (CEC) on the issue.Claiming that the acceptance of the new definition of the Aravallis will lead to fragmentation and undermining of the geographical and ecological integrity of the range, Ramesh said there were understandably widespread concerns with the redefinition of the hills that restricted them to landforms having an elevation of 100m or more.The environment ministry has clarified that the uniform definition would leave out only a fraction (nearly 0.2%) of the Aravalis for mining, FSI on Dec 23 refuted the claims that it carried out a study showing 90% of the hills would be left unprotected following the Nov 20 judgment.Nevertheless, Ramesh raised the question. ""Is it not a fact that the FSI, in a communication to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change dated Sept 20, 2025 had stated the following: The smaller hill formations of the Aravalis serve as natural barriers against desertification... Because the protective effect of a barrier against windblown sand scales directly with its height, even modest hills of 10 to 30 m act as strong natural wind breaks?""He further asked, ""Is it not a fact that the definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges in Rajasthan since 2012 had been based on a report of the FSI of Aug 28, 2010 that had said the following: All such areas having a slope of 3 degrees or more shall be delineated as hills... Is it not a fact that CEC, constituted by the SC, had in its report of Nov 7, 2025, concluded that 164 mining leases in Rajasthan were inside the Aravali Hills and Ranges as defined by the then-prevailing FSI definition?""",Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh wrote to environment minister Bhupender Yadav.

PM Modi Praises Gen Z Confidence, Sees Them Leading Viksit Bharat

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday flagged the growing threat of antibiotic resistance and urged people to stop using these drugs without medical advice, saying ""antibiotics are not medicines that should be taken mindlessly"".Speaking in his monthly radio address 'Mann Ki Baat', Modi cited a recent report by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that showed antibiotics are increasingly proving ineffective against common infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections. He said the trend should worry everyone.He pointed to indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics as a major driver of rising resistance and warned the belief that ""one pill can cure everything"" is making infections stronger than the drugs designed to treat them.Urging restraint, he appealed to citizens to avoid self-medication, particularly with antibiotics, and to consult doctors before taking such medicines. ""Responsible use,"" he said, ""is essential not only for individual health but also to preserve effectiveness of life-saving drugs for society at large.""Modi said greater public awareness and discipline in medicine use are crucial to reversing the trend. ""Following medical advice will prove helpful in improving your health,"" he said.Health experts have repeatedly cautioned that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is emerging as one of India's most serious public health challenges. ICMR has flagged irrational antibiotic use, often without prescriptions, as a key factor accelerating resistance, raising concerns that routine infections could become harder to treat.Adding clinical perspective, Dr Hitender Gautam, professor in department of microbiology at AIIMS, said antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most pressing global health threats of 21st century. ""Indiscriminate use of antibiotics delays treatment, increases healthcare costs and forces doctors to shift to higher-end drugs with greater side effects, raising risk of serious illness and morbidity and mortality,"" he said.Often described as a ""silent pandemic"", AMR requires urgent action, he said. ""Without preventive measures, projections suggest AMR could become one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide by 2050,"" he added.",PM Narendra Modi on Sunday flagged the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.

The Collapse Of The Red Corridor: How India Broke The Back Of Maoist Extremism | I Witness

HYDERABAD: By torchlight in deep forest camps, a shadow surgeon once cut close to a beating Maoist heart, fingers steady as a bullet lay lodged centimetres away. For years, the man they called Dr Rafiq worked unseen. Little about him surfaced beyond intelligence files.Now, through surrendered Maoists and security officials, a detailed portrait is emerging of Rafiq alias Mandip — an MBBS from Punjab who joined CPI (Maoist) and spent years building a medical system across Dandakaranya in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar.Surrendered Maoist M Venkatraju alias CNN Chandu described Rafiq as the only formally trained doctor to have joined the movement. He treated cadres and Adivasis, performed emergency surgeries with scarce resources, trained paramedics and documented medicine. He wrote manuals standardising treatment for bullet wounds, malaria, snakebites, gastroenteritis, and battlefield trauma under forest conditions.Chandu told TOI, “He trained locals and cadres in first aid, stitching sutures when a bullet hits, and how to remove the bullet.”Intelligence officers said he moved from Dandakaranya to Jharkhand in 2016, where he remains at large.Rafiq first surfaced in 2013 through confessions of arrested cadres, described then as a “mystery doctor” capable of surgeries and leading Dandakaranya’s medical wing. Police inputs in 2018 referred to “Rinki, wife of MBBS Dr Rafiq”, who allegedly treated senior Maoist commander Prashant Bose.According to Chandu, Rafiq worked from Maad, the Maoist headquarters zone in Abujhmarh. “The doctor is revered as a god by locals,” he said. “People came from far away just to see him.”Forest villages with little or no access to formal healthcare relied on Rafiq for everything from fever treatment to trauma care.Several underground medics, known as “doctors” despite lacking degrees, were trained through Rafiq’s system. Each dalam had at least one trained medical aide, Chandu said. Medical continuity survived even after Rafiq left Dandakaranya.Rafiq also documented herbal medicine knowledge passed down by Adivasi vaddes or pujaris and incorporated it into Maoist man-uals. “Malaria is most common,” Chandu said. “People believed illness meant God was angry. We told them even if they do puja, they should also take medicine.” Prayer and pills coexisted in those manuals, which still circulate in interior areas.While security forces tracked weapons and movement, Rafiq quietly built medical capacity — a parallel health network shaped by war, forests and necessity. As surrenders rise, his trail remains elusive.","Dr Rafiq is an MBBS from Punjab who joined CPI (Maoist) and spent years building a medical system across Dandakaranya in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar.

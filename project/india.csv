Runway relief? Man in kurta-pajama squats to pee next to aircraft; pilot‚Äôs viral video divides internet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/runway-relief-man-in-kurta-pajama-squats-to-pee-next-to-aircraft-pilots-viral-video-divides-internet/articleshow/123689329.cms,".

A strange event involving an old man urinating close to an airplane on the runway at Bihar's Darbhanga Airport has gone viral. The concerning incident occurred when a man in traditional white kurta-pajama attire was spotted squatting dangerously close to an aircraft on an active runway. The event was captured on video by the pilot from the cockpit, showing the individual positioned in a grassy area just meters away from the aircraft.The individual's positioning in the grassy area adjacent to the runway suggests a breach of multiple layers of airport security measures. Such areas are typically restricted and monitored to prevent unauthorized access due to the critical nature of aircraft operations. Airport authorities maintain multiple security layers, including perimeter fencing, surveillance systems, and security patrols, to prevent such unauthorized access. This incident may prompt a review of these security measures. However, the 9-second video has been viewed more than 285,000 times, with social media users responding in a combination of laughter and worry.These are some wacky reactions:One of the users said, ""Accha hai na itna samanya darje k log b plane me travel kar rahe hain.""Which roughly translates to,""Its good that even common people are traveling by plane.""Another user said, ""Accurate way to urinate.""In the backdrop, other passengers are lined up to board the aircraft while a voice that is perceived to be the pilot laughs.Another said, ‚ÄúMera desh badal raha hai aage badh raha haiüòÇüòÇ. Biharis never fail to surprise us.‚ÄùSome went on to school the man and the pilot.A user commented, ‚ÄúAirport terminals have sufficient toilets, but still these idiots would do it in the open. Disgusting civic sense of some Indians, they would never learn.‚Äù‚ÄúPilots making fun of old person. Old people have problems controlling the bladder. Shameful‚Äù, said another.The proximity of the individual to active aircraft operations created a hazardous situation that could have impacted flight safety. Aircraft movements require clear and unobstructed runway areas to ensure safe takeoffs and landings.The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is yet to release an official response to the incident. It is as yet unknown whether the man was a passenger or a staffer, or from which airline's cockpit the clip was shot.",A man in traditional white kurta-pajama was spotted squatting dangerously close to an aircraft on an active runway.

Benny Safdie and Emily Blunt share an emotional moment with Dwayne Johnson



Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson experienced one of the most emotional nights of his career when his latest film, The Smashing Machine, premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. The 53-year-old actor, portraying UFC legend Mark Kerr, was overcome with tears as the audience delivered a thunderous 15-minute standing ovation, among the longest of this year‚Äôs festival.Footage from inside the theater showed Dwayne Johnson wiping his eyes while applauding back at the cheering crowd. Standing beside him were his co-star Emily Blunt , director Benny Safdie , and Kerr himself, each visibly shaken by the extended applause. Variety‚Äôs co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, who shared the moment on X, remarked, ‚ÄúDwayne Johnson weeps during the 15-minute #Venezia2025 standing ovation for ‚ÄòThe Smashing Machine.‚Äô This was the most emotion we‚Äôve since on the Lido since Brendan Fraser launched his Oscar campaign here four years ago for ‚ÄòThe Whale.‚Äô‚ÄùThe comparison to Fraser‚Äôs Venice triumph quickly sparked speculation about Johnson‚Äôs awards season prospects.Fraser went on to win an Academy Award for The Whale, and Johnson‚Äôs raw, vulnerable turn as Kerr is already drawing early buzz.Johnson himself acknowledged how transformative the project has been. At a press conference earlier that day, he admitted, ‚ÄúI looked around a few years ago and I started to think, you know, am I living my dream or am I living other people‚Äôs dreams? I've been scared to go deep and intense and raw until now, until I had this opportunity.‚ÄùSafdie, making his solo directorial debut after acclaimed collaborations like Uncut Gems, also broke down during the ovation, clutching Johnson and Blunt as tears streamed down his face. Blunt, who plays Kerr‚Äôs now-ex-wife Dawn Staples, stood hand-in-hand with Johnson as the real Mark Kerr wiped his own eyes from the audience.The moment showed how personal the film is for everyone involved. Johnson underwent a dramatic physical transformation to embody Kerr, stepping away from his signature blockbuster action persona. Fans even noticed his lean frame on the red carpet.Also Read: John Cena turns heads as he carries wife Shay Shariatzadeh over puddle during sweet public moment Distributed by A24, The Smashing Machine releases in theaters on October 3.

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party‚Äôs Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.‚ÄúI was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,‚Äù he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. ‚ÄúHe was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,‚Äù he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA‚Äôs escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP‚Äôs office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach ‚Äúin tractors, trolleys, and cars‚Äù to demand his release. ‚ÄúI will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me.

Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled ‚Äî moves that raised eyebrows.‚ÄúThis is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali.

The reel that became evidence





LUCKNOW: Forget CID, forget private detectives. In Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, a wife solved a seven-year-old mystery with just a casual Instagram scroll.Back in April 2017, Sheelu of Murarnagar, Sandila, married Jitendra Kumar (32), better known in his village as Babloo. A few months later, the couple was expecting their first child. But instead of fatherhood, Babloo chose a disappearing act. In 2018, he suddenly vanished without a trace.His family, rather than helping Sheelu search, accused her of murdering him and hiding the body. A missing person‚Äôs report was lodged at Sandila police station, but the case soon went cold. For years, Sheelu carried the stigma of being suspected as a ‚Äúhusband killer,‚Äù while raising her son alone.Fast-forward to 2025. While scrolling Instagram reels, Sheelu spotted a man dancing happily in Ludhiana. The problem? It wasn‚Äôt just any man. It was Babloo ‚Äî alive, grooving, and flaunting a new woman by his side, who police later confirmed was his second wife.‚ÄúSheelu waited seven years. Then one reel ended the suspense,‚Äù quipped a police officer involved in the investigation.Furious, Sheelu made the reel viral, then filed a formal complaint.Acting swiftly, Circle Officer Santosh Kumar Singh and his Sandila team ‚Äî SI Ranjanikant Pandey, Head Constable Diwakar Mishra, and Constable Sunil Kumar ‚Äî tracked Babloo down in Ludhiana, where he was working at a cloth factory and living a double life. He was arrested under Section 82(1) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (bigamy).Police said Sheelu and Babloo married in 2017, and their son was born in 2018. Just weeks after the child‚Äôs birth, Babloo went missing. His family claimed ignorance but secretly filed a complaint suggesting foul play by Sheelu.‚ÄúTime passed, but he never returned,‚Äù Sheelu told reporters, recalling how she was left abandoned and stigmatised during pregnancy. She also alleged that before disappearing, Babloo became abusive, forcing her to return to her parents‚Äô house in late 2017. She only learned he ‚Äúvanished‚Äù when she was four months pregnant.For years, the case remained a mystery. Then came the Instagram reel.Sheelu described her shock when she spotted her missing husband online. Determined, she confronted her in-laws, who admitted the man looked like Babloo but offered no explanation. Meanwhile, residents began sharing the reel widely, and soon the entire district knew the man ‚Äúlong gone‚Äù was alive and well.The police investigation confirmed the reel‚Äôs authenticity and Babloo‚Äôs new life in Punjab. ‚ÄúDuring the inquiry, it was found that Jitendra married another woman in Ludhiana. He has been taken into custody,‚Äù said CO Santosh Singh.For Sheelu, the discovery was bittersweet. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why he left me during my pregnancy, when I needed him the most,‚Äù she said, adding that her years of waiting ended not with closure, but with betrayal gone viral.","Sheelu married Jitendra Kumar (32), better known in his village as Babloo, in 2017.

Impact on students and parents

Widespread heavy rains and persistent flooding have forced authorities in Jammu Division and several districts of Delhi-NCR to shut all schools on September 3, affecting students from nursery to Class 12.

NEW DELHI: Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington‚Äôs ties with India to further his family‚Äôs business interests in Pakistan In an interview with MeidasTouch YouTube channel, Sullivan described the development as ‚Äúa huge strategic harm‚Äù to the United States itself.He was asked about America‚Äôs trade row with India and Trump‚Äôs repeated claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, which resurfaced after the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir.‚ÄúI think this is one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy, and I'm really glad that you raised it,‚Äù Sullivan said in response to the host‚Äôs question, which also mentioned the Trump family‚Äôs Bitcoin business with Pakistan and Tim Cook‚Äôs Apple factories in India.The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties with India, ‚Äúthe world's largest democracy,‚Äù and a country it should be ‚Äúaligned with on technology, talent, economics, and so many other issues, and aligned with in dealing with the strategic threat from China.‚ÄùSullivan noted that Washington had made significant progress in developing these ties. ‚ÄúAnd now, in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, he has thrown the India relationship over the side.That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US-India relationship serves our interests,‚Äù he added.He warned that such moves would worry US allies worldwide. ‚ÄúBut imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States,‚Äù Sullivan said.According to him, America‚Äôs credibility was at stake. ‚ÄúAnd having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.‚ÄùDuring the conversation, Sullivan was reminded of Trump‚Äôs earlier claims about being ‚Äúbest friends with Modi‚Äù and promising that the first deal he would sign would be with India. The host said Trump then began ‚Äútaking credit for resolving the India Pakistan war which is a very big sensitive topic for India saying you did not do that stop taking he does that every day and that like you know hurts their hurts everything there and it like crushes them that's not they go that's not true. ‚ÄùThe host further alleged, ‚ÄúDonald Trump took like his family took Bitcoin from the Pakistani Bitcoin sovereign fund and they brought in the general from the Pakistan to be there and India's like what the hell are you. And then meanwhile, you still have Apple building new factories because Tim Cook came in with the gold bar and he's building the factories in India. What do you make of what's happening there?‚ÄùSullivan reiterated, ‚ÄúI think this is one of the more under reported stories in Trump's foreign policy and I'm really glad that you raised it on a bipartisan basis going back decades. The United States has worked to build its relationship with India, the world's largest democracy, a country that we should be aligned with on technology and talent and economics and so many other issues and aligned with in dealing with this strategic threat from China. And we had come a long way on that. And now in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, Trump has thrown the India relationship over the side. That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US India relationship serves our interests. But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States.

And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.‚ÄùBefore concluding, Sullivan remarked, ‚ÄúIt's a big world, so there's a lot more to say. I'll have to come back at some point in the future and, you know, hit the next 10 topics that we didn't get to today.‚Äù The host thanked him, saying, ‚ÄúJake Sullivan, former national security adviser. Thank you as always.‚ÄùThe controversy comes amid Trump‚Äôs increasing business engagements with Pakistan. In April, the World Liberty (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by Trump, signed agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and blockchain innovation. Trump and his affiliates reportedly hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, launched in 2024.A US delegation at the signing included WLF co-chairman and Trump‚Äôs special envoy Steve Witkoff‚Äôs son, Zachary Witkoff.In June, the Pakistan army stated that Field Marshal Asim Munir and Trump had discussed trade, economic development, and cryptocurrency during a White House meeting. ‚ÄúPresident Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,‚Äù the army said.A month later, Trump announced a trade agreement with Pakistan while threatening 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods. ‚ÄúWe have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,‚Äù Trump posted on Truth Social.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the agreement, calling it ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù and expressing hope it would expand cooperation between Islamabad and Washington.",Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington‚Äôs ties with India. Sullivan described the development as ‚Äúa huge strategic harm‚Äù to the United States itself.

Semiconductor Factories Rising in India, First Chip Ready by End of Year: PM Modi





India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs chip design engineers, placing it as a key player in the global semiconductor design ecosystem, according to a report by Bastion Research.According to news agency ANI, the report underlined India‚Äôs strong position in the global semiconductor chain, noting, ‚ÄúIndia is already an important piece in the global semiconductor design. You may be surprised to know that approximately 20 per cent of the world's chip design engineers are based here.‚ÄùGlobal technology leaders, including Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, and MediaTek have set up large R&D and design centres across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida. This strong presence has enabled India to emerge as one of the world‚Äôs leading hubs for chip design, as per ANI.Explaining the division of work worldwide, the report said engineers in the United States define the high-level chip architecture, such as deciding the type of chip, its end use, features, and launch strategy.Indian engineering teams, by contrast, take on the critical execution work ‚Äî translating architecture into logic, simulating and testing chips, optimising performance, writing drivers and firmware, and fine-tuning electronic design automation tools.The report stressed this was not a ‚Äúboss versus worker‚Äù setup but rather complementary roles between US and Indian teams.The Bastion Research findings also noted India‚Äôs policy push to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem. The government launched the Semicon India Programme in 2021 with incentives worth around Rs 76,000 crore to attract global manufacturers.India‚Äôs semiconductor consumption is projected to rise sharply. ‚ÄúWe consume about $24 billion worth semiconductors and it is expected to rise to upwards of $100-120 billion by 2030. When India starts to produce those chips, our share will definitely rise,‚Äù Sandeep Kumar, CEO of L&T Semiconductor Technologies and chairman of the Semiconductor Product Leadership Forum, was quoted as saying by ANI.The Forum, launched by the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), aims to build an ecosystem for product design, IP creation, and high-value innovation. It is targeting the launch of around 100 new companies by 2035, expected to absorb nearly five lakh workers, including a large number of engineers.Meanwhile, India recently rolled out its first domestically produced chip at CG Semi‚Äôs Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who inaugurated the facility last week, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will ‚Äúsoon‚Äù dedicate the country‚Äôs first chip produced there.The government has so far approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states. Work is also underway on Semicon 2.0, the next phase of India‚Äôs semiconductor mission.","India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs chip design engineers.

The Staff Selection Commission ( SSC ) has announced major changes for the upcoming Combined Graduate Level (CGL) exam in September 2025. In an exclusive interview with Navbharat Times (NBT), SSC Chairman S. Gopalakrishnan said that candidates faced many problems in earlier exams, such as computer glitches, non-working devices, Aadhaar verification delays, and far-off exam centres.To solve these issues and make the process smoother, SSC has introduced new measures. These include conducting the exam in a single shift, improving centre allocation, introducing a fair scoring system, and making Aadhaar verification mandatory. The reforms aim to make the exam more transparent, convenient, and fair for all candidates across India.SSC has decided to hold the CGL exam in one single shift instead of multiple shifts. This ensures that all candidates get the same exam experience and reduces problems caused by different question papers in different shifts.Many candidates in previous exams had to travel long distances to reach their centres. Now, SSC will allot exam centres within a 100 km radius of the candidate‚Äôs address.Currently, 80% of candidates get nearby centres, and SSC plans to increase this to over 90% in future exams.Moreover, SSC has also introduced a shift-wise normalisation system to ensure fair scoring. This method adjusts marks if question papers in different shifts have varying difficulty levels, so no candidate is at a disadvantage.SSC has divided responsibilities among four vendors:SSC itself will directly supervise question paper creation to maintain quality and consistency.","The Staff Selection Commission ( SSC) has announced major changes for the upcoming Combined Graduate Level (CGL) exam in September 2025.

Trump‚Äôs New Message To India As Modi Hails ‚ÄòPrivileged‚Äô Ties With Putin; ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Getting Late‚Äô

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday strongly criticised US counterpart Donald Trump for using tariffs as a bargaining tool with China and India in the current geopolitical landscape.Putin said both Beijing and New Delhi have their ""own domestic political mechanism and laws"" and noted that the two nations have endured difficult periods in their history, marked by colonialism and repeated attacks on sovereignty.""When somebody [Donald Trump] tells you that they are going to punish you...you have to think about the leadership of those big countries,"" Putin said.""You have countries like India with 1.5 billion people, and China, both with powerful economies. They also have their own domestic political mechanism and laws. When somebody tells you that they are going to punish you...you have to think about the leadership of those big countries, which had a difficult period of their history too...that had to deal with colonialism, attacks on their sovereignty during prolonged periods of time,"" the Russian President said at a press briefing.He futher said: ""You have to understand that if one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over, which influences his behaviour"".Putin, however, expressed hope that everything will ultimately be sorted out for the normal political dialogue to begin.""Just as the colonial era is over, they have to realise that they [the US] cannot use this term when speaking with partners. But ultimately, things will be sorted out, and we will have normal political dialogue again,"" he said.Last week, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in China's Tianjin, leaders from India, China, and Russia projected an image of warmth and strategic convergence that rattled Washington.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Russia a ""special and privileged partner"".Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs two most populous countries need to be friends.‚Äù And Russian President Vladimir Putin clasped PM Modi‚Äôs hand, addressed him as ‚Äúdear friend,‚Äù and whisked him away in his armoured Aurus limousine.The optics told a story of deepening chemistry: Xi and PM Modi smiling together after years of tension, PM Modi leaning into Moscow even as Trump slapped tariffs on Indian goods, and Putin positioning himself as the indispensable broker of this triangular courtship.The move was subtle but seismic. While Trump met Putin in Alaska on August 15 to persuade him to drift from China's orbit, Beijing welcomed PM Modi just two weeks later. On August 30, Modi was in Beijing. The next day, he stood smiling next to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit in Tianjin - a public relations coup for Beijing and Moscow.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a pointed remark seen as a veiled dig at Trump, said: ""India had achieved a 7.8 per cent GDP growth despite ""challenges created by economic selfishness"".Earlier, in support of India, Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong wrote: ""Give the bully an inch, he will take a mile"".Feihong said this a day after Trump slapped an additional 25 per cent tariff on India for its trade with Russia.The remark was seen by some as expressing solidarity with countries like India and Brazil, at the receiving end of Trump's trade war.Xu's post also tagged Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi's remarks, after his talks with the Brazilian president's chief advisor Celso Amorim, that using tariffs as a weapon to suppress other countries violates the UN Charter, undermines WTO rules and is both unpopular and unsustainable.","Vladimir Putin criticises US counterpart Donald Trump for using tariffs as a bargaining tool with China and India.

He went on to highlight the prime minister's campaigns for rape convict Prajwal Revanna.""If Modi questions Chief Minister Nitish Kumar‚Äôs origins by saying his DNA is faulty, meaning his blood is impure and wrong, is that justified? Can JD(U) people clarify if the report from the nails and hair sent to the PMO has come back?"" he said.""If Prime Minister Modi campaigns for Prajwal Revanna, who has been accused of raping women and girls, and appeals for his victory, that‚Äôs Modi‚Äôs masterstroke,"" he added.The accusations went further, charging PM Modi of being ""silent"" when ""Biharis are insulted in Gujarat"". ""Thousands of farmers died during the farmers‚Äô protests. Farmers and youth are committing suicide, workers walked miles during the lockdown, millions died, yet he didn‚Äôt cry.

Jaishankar Urges Stronger India-EU Ties As Trump‚Äôs Tariffs Shake Global Strategic Landscape

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said predictability has a huge premium in global politics, a remark made as India looks to readjust its relations with China while manoeuvring through US tariffs.The foreign minister also said the world is witnessing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. ""Changes we see in the world today do influence our policy and do influence the manner we approach other countries,"" he said.Speaking at a press briefing with German counterpart Johann Wadephul, Jaishankar further said: ""We are seeing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. We are also seeing volatility on the global economic landscape, and together they make a very powerful case for India and the European Union (EU) and Germany to work more closely with each other.""Jaishankar's remark could also be implied as a jibe at US President Donald Trump, who recently described India's economy as ""dead"" and has upended the global economy with his numerous contradictory tariff diktats.Wadephul said the only demand the Western nations have with regard to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is that ""weapons fall silent"". He said that Russia has ""not been willing"" to sit down at the negotiating table despite ""enormous efforts"" by Trump.""We have right from the outset been pursuing a policy that has the objective of Russia and Ukraine following the path of negotiations. However, what we have noticed of late is that despite the enormous efforts that the American president has invested, Russia has not been willing to sit down at the negotiating table, whereas the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed his immediate readiness to negotiate and sit down at the negotiation table,"" the German foreign minister said.He further said that Ukraine has been attacked ""without having done anything"" to trigger the Russian attack, while choosing to skip Moscow's apprehension of Kyiv joining the US-led Nato alliance, which is argued as a key reason Russian President Putin decided to invade Ukraine.""In a way, it has taken a first step. We're talking about a country that has been attacked without having done anything to trigger that attack. The only demand is that weapons fall silent. No more than that... The German approach and the European approach are that we want to do whatever we can to make President Putin sit down at the negotiating table,"" Wadephul said.On Friday, Jaishankar said India should not be ""unfairly targeted"" in the context of the Ukraine war, as New Delhi continues to face pressure over its oil trade with Russia.""Had a telecon today with Finnish Foreign Minister,"" Jaishankar posted on X. ""Our discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and its ramifications. India should not be unfairly targeted in that context. We have always advocated dialogue and diplomacy.""The remarks come as India is facing 50 per cent tariffs from the United States for purchasing Russian oil. The US administration has accused New Delhi of ""funding the war"" by continuing trade with Moscow.India has strongly criticised Washington‚Äôs decision, calling the tariffs ""unjustified and unreasonable"". The Trump administration recently raised duties on Indian goods to over 50 per cent as a penalty for India‚Äôs oil imports from Russia.Last week in Moscow, Jaishankar defended India‚Äôs position during a joint press briefing with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan‚Äôs Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children ‚Äì four sons and one daughter ‚Äì died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children‚Äôs weddings. ‚ÄúNo member of the family has ever gone to school,‚Äù he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.‚ÄúThis is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,‚Äù he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: ‚ÄúIt turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.‚ÄùAnother doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. ‚ÄúShe could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,‚Äù he explained.","Rekha Ram Kalbelia, 55, from Rajasthan's Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

Centre to build dozens of Ring Roads across cities to decongest urban highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-build-dozens-of-ring-roads-across-cities-to-decongest-urban-highways/articleshow/123682779.cms,"Centre to build dozens of Ring Roads across cities to decongest urban highways

NEW DELHI: It‚Äôs not just metros like Delhi and Bengaluru where vehicle speeds drop sharply as highways enter city limits. Govt data shared with states on Wednesday show that even in smaller cities such as Madurai in Tamil Nadu, the average speed on NHs can fall to just 27 kmph inside the city due to traffic congestion, compared to 55 kmph on highway stretches outside it.Aiming to remedy this growing problem of urban congestion, the Centre will take up development of around 34 new access-controlled Ring Roads, in addition to such 36 ongoing projects across cities. On Wednesday, road transport and highways ministry shared the roadmap with states while seeking support for fast-tracking the development of Ring Roads with a design speed of 100-120 kmph.Targeting to decongest NHs in urban areas, the road transport and highway ministry has identified agglomeration and cities with more than five lakh population for construction of the greenfield Ring Roads. These include Kolkata and Amaravati agglomerations, Nashik, Thiruvananthapuram, Ajmer, Warangal, Mangaluru, Udaipur and Tirunelveli. The details were shared with state PWD and urban development secretaries at a meeting chaired by road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.To ensure that new Ring Roads don‚Äôt end up becoming new choke points, 15 metres on either side of these stretches will be notified as Development Control Zone (DCZ) where no construction will be allowed, except for public utilities and green zone.States will allow regulated development in 2 km beyond the DCZ.For financing these capital intensive project, the states will have five different options to provide financial support, including upfront payment of 50% of cost and getting 50% of toll revenue for 15 years; payment of 50% of the land acquisition cost; and providing land pooled through land pooling scheme. Since states are the biggest beneficiary of such projects, they need to provide some share of the project cost, an official said.The ministry has also shared the details of 15 legacy municipal dump sites close to upcoming NH projects across states, which can provide inert waste for construction embankment of such roads. ‚ÄúSome of the high speed corridors and urban decongestion road projects have been mapped that are within 50 km of the top 15 landfill sites. Around 277 lakh tonne of inert waste from these dump sites can potentially be utilised (for highway construction),‚Äù said an official.In the closed door meeting, Gadkari said NH projects can significantly address the issue of legacy solid waste issues faced by cities. ‚ÄúSuccessful pilot projects, including UER-II in Delhi and Ahmedabad‚ÄìDholera Expressway, have demonstrated the technical feasibility and economic benefits of the initiative,‚Äù his office said.","The average speed on NHs can fall to just 27 kmph inside the city due to traffic congestion, compared to 55 kmph on highway stretches outside it.

He also said EU doesn‚Äôt want Russia to use ‚Äúdetours‚Äù for its oil. The US accuses India of profiteering from its export of refined Russian oil to Europe and other places. In Europe,countries like Germany and France are pushing for secondary sanctions that would target entities in third countries they see as backing Russia‚Äôs war.Jaishankar said in a joint press conference the world‚Äôs facing the twin challenges of economic volatility and political uncertainty India believes that a multi-polar world with strategic autonomy can best respond through more intensive cooperation among key member states.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question that the changes we see in the world today do influence our policies and do influence the manner in which we approach other countries. And I think together they make a very powerful case for India and the EU and India and Germany to work much more closely with each other,‚Äù he said. Backing Germany‚Äôs desire to double its Euro 50 billion trade with India, Jaishankar said India would pay special attention to any concerns German companiesmight have about operating in India.There was also discussion on the Indo-Pacific as Wadephulstressed India and Germany are united by the objective to preserve the rules-based international order and China‚Äôs aggressive behavior in the Indo-Pacific was a cause for concern for both our countries. ‚ÄúMore generally, we aim to further expand our cooperation in the areas of defense, security and armaments,‚Äù he said, adding Germany agrees with India and others that there‚Äôs a need to defend the rules-based order from China.Jaishankar also thanked Wadephul for the understanding shown by Germany on India‚Äôs fight against terrorism. ‚ÄúMinister Wadephul has himself been explicit about our right to defend our people against terrorist attacks. Our Parliamentary delegation that visited Germany in June after Operation Sindoor was also warmly received,‚Äù he said.Jaishankar said he raised the issue of Ariha Shah, an Indian child who has been in foster care of German authorities for years, saying it is essential that her cultural rights are ensuredand she grows up in Indian surroundings. ‚ÄúSo. this matter needs to be resolved without further delay, and I think we have had some discussions today on that subject,‚Äù he said.",The leaders discussed the Ukraine conflict as Wadephul urged India to convince Russia to join peace efforts.

School bells stop ringing in flood-hit North India as water cuts off access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/school-bells-stop-ringing-in-flood-hit-north-india-as-water-cuts-off-access/articleshow/123684989.cms,"Suresh Rawat (15) still wakes at 6 am - he has never needed an alarm. Not because school is in session or a bell might echo through the hills, but because his routine - wake, wash, dress - is a habit rooted in pre-monsoon normalcy. Comb hair, button shirt, pack school bag. But he has nowhere to go. No teacher has checked its contents in over 60 days, after a bridge connecting his village in Uttarakhand to the local school was washed away in June.Across flood-hit north India - Punjab, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Jammu, parts of UP and now Haryana - students have been missing school and college because waters won't allow them, teachers can't reach and buildings won't stand.""The path to my school, 7 km from Kupda village in Uttarkashi, lay across that bridge,"" Suresh said. ""On June 28, the Yamunotri highway link disappeared. Now I'll have to study a lot on my own to make up for lost classes."" He despairs at the gap in front of him, with no sign of repair or even a temporary bridge - only the weight of an academic calendar slipping away.Punjab ordered schools shut in late August until September 7 - a 12-day stretch overlapping with peak harvest, compounding family losses.Himachal staggered its orders through July and August, as repeated landslides cut off access to schools and staff housing.In Jammu, schools were shut on Sept 1 and 2 after heavy rain warnings and flood risks. The order expanded the next day to Kashmir, where flood alerts followed the Chenab and Jhelum crossing danger marks. The Srinagar-Jammu highway stayed closed for days, severing supply routes and classroom routines alike.The storm has erased not just structures - Himachal alone reported damage to 500 schools - but the scaffolding of education. In Mandi, where 300 schools were affected, functioning buildings became shelters. Teachers vanished from WhatsApp groups, not by choice but because they were stranded. Unit tests were pushed into vagueness, then abandoned. Online lessons were announced for Sept 1, but for most, the only thing that arrived was another rain alert.Sunil Negi, who teaches in Kullu, tried to hold a class. ""The power went within minutes. Then signal dropped. We stopped trying,"" he said. Leena Kapoor in Mandi was more blunt: ""We've taught nothing new. Half the staff haven't returned. The school was a ration camp for two weeks.""In places where classrooms hadn't collapsed, access became the barrier. Rakesh Kumar, a govt teacher, described walking 5 km along a landslide-prone path just to reach his students. ""The road was blocked, but we tried anyway. It's the kind of risk no one wants to take, but we do it because otherwise, the children lose everything.""The more remote the school, the worse the loss. In Bharmour, paths once curving through hills have been wiped out. ""We used to carry the younger children on our shoulders,"" said Vikram Rana, a village elder. ""Now even the elders can't reach them."" Students relocated from landslide-prone areas are now simply unreachable.Makeshift arrangements haven't always worked. A sudden lake formation behind the school in Syanachatti, Uttarakhand, forced 56 students out; 25 were sent to Bajri Primary, others to rented rooms. But 18 children were never relocated. ""They've disappeared into a crevice in the system,"" a local education officer said. ""And that widens every day.""No meaningful plan has followed. There's been no revision of the exam calendar, no guidance on syllabus cuts, and no plan for remediation. Authorities have floated ideas - weekend sessions, compressed holidays - but without any infra, internet or staff, those promises ring hollow.The east hasn't been spared. In Assam's Majuli island, floodwaters returned for third time this season. Rashmi Das, 16, had just resumed classes when her school was converted into a shelter again. ""They said we'd reopen soon. Then the water came back.""And beyond ridgelines of Ladakh, where Aug brought rainfall 930% above normal, teacher Jigmet Tundup continued to show up to a classroom half-submerged each morning. ""We sweep water out,"" he said. ""Then we begin. Sometimes with the alphabet.""(With inputs from Rohit Mullick in Kullu, Ashish Mishra in Uttarkashi, Yogesh Nagarkoti in Bageshwar, and Tanmayee Tyagi in Dehradun)","Across flood-hit north India, students have been missing school and college because waters won't allow them, teachers can't reach and buildings won't stand.

Constitution mandates guv to act as soon as possible: Sibal

NEW DELHI: West Bengal on Wednesday warned that vesting governors with discretion to decide the fate of bills would jeopardise states' legislative functions, while Supreme Court-prescribed timeline for governors and the President would expedite transforming people's will into laws. This would not amount to amending the Constitution, it told the court.The TMC govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, told a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that the Constitution does not assign to the governor a dominating position or a significant role in either the legislative or executive functioning of a state.Sibal said if the governor is given unbridled discretion and he decides to simply sit on a bill for years, it will amount to negating the will of the people which is expressed through the bill by the elected representatives in the state legislature.An interpretation that gives the governor the executive power to withhold assent upends the entire constitutional scheme,"" senior advocate Kapil Sibal added. If the Centre's argument is accepted, then it would enable the governor under Article 200 to avoid communication, bypass reasoning, and ignore the primacy of legislature and act on his own, he said.If one goes by the Centre's argument that the governor's decision regarding a bill is not amenable to judicial review, then he can veto any bill, he said, adding that the governor would become a super-constitutional office, a concept wholly alien and incompatible with constitutionalism, responsible govt, and democracy.The reading in of a timeline for the governor or President to take a decision on a bill has become of paramount importance, the senior advocate added, given the distortions of keeping bills pending indefinitely in opposition-ruled states. Sibal said, ""A house cannot run if there is a marital discord. This is also true for the democratic institutions, where there must be harmony between legislature, executive and constitutional heads. ""He said the Constitution mandates the governor to act ""as soon as possible"", which attaches immediacy to the action of the governor. When that is being breached by keeping the bills pending for years without ascribing a reason, the SC would be preventing constitutional distortion by providing a timeline, Sibal said.""Thus, time limits prescribed by constitutional courts under the circumstances above are not to be equated with judicially enacted constitutional amendments,"" Sibal said, and termed the President's queries to the SC as ""vague and based on conjured up situations"" most of which do not warrant the SC's opinion.For Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, senior advocates Gopal Subamanium and Anand Sharma echoed Sibal's arguments and said in the constitutional scheme for the federal structure of governance in India, the President or the governors are assigned no legislative or executive function.Subramanium said according to Dr B R Ambedkar, the states and Centre are to function as co-equals within their demarcated legislative arenas. ""If the governors, as agents of the Centre acting as titular heads of the states, would have unbridled power to stall bills enacted by state legislatures, then there would be a serious imbalance in the federal governance,"" he said.","West Bengal warns that vesting governors with discretion to decide the fate of bills would jeopardise states' legislative functions.

Earlier, this remuneration was handed over to some leaders who would pass it on to the cadres.The signing of the SOO is also set to have a positive impact on peace efforts in Manipur, in that it may specifically require Kuki-Zo groups to abjure violence and not brandish weapons outside their designated camps.

NEW DELHI: As Congress revamps its organisation at the district level under the ‚ÄòSangathan Srijan Abhiyan‚Äô, the profile of newly appointed District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents of three states ‚Äî Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana ‚Äî shows that 50% of the new presidents are below 50 years, making a marked shift towards giving younger party members a role to lead at the grassroots.According to an analysis by a senior Congress leader, earlier those above 50 years occupied 80% of these posts in these states, but now in keeping with the vision of Rahul Gandhi, care is being taken to ensure that the appointment process is more transparent and merit based, and also takes into account diversity by creating room for the youth, more women members and those from marginalised communities. Also, an evaluation and monitoring process has been put in place for quarterly assessment of DCC presidents which will play a key role in their continuity.‚ÄúFor instance, the number of women district presidents in these three states was zero but the newly appointed DCC presidents include six women chiefs with four of them in Madhya Pradesh and one each in Gujarat and Haryana,‚Äù the leader said, driving home the point that even though this number is small but it is a step forward to get more women to lead the party at the grassroots.It is also learnt that the percentage of DCC presidents from the SC and ST communities too has increased from 4% to around 12% and 6% to 12%, respectively, the leader said.The number of OBC presidents in these states have increased from 24% to around 33%.Addressing a meeting of observers appointed for these states last week, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, ‚ÄúWe will have to increase the representation of women and bring them into the mainstream by giving them responsibilities.‚Äù Both Kharge and Rahul have stressed that districts hold the key to winning elections.

‚ÄòInsult To Every Mother‚Äô: PM Modi Tears Into Congress-RJD For Abusing His Late Mother

NEW DELHI: A day after PM Narendra Modi said Bihar will not pardon the opposition for ‚Äúabusing my mother‚Äù, Congress asked him to focus on issues raised by the Vote Adhikar Yatra, instead of ‚Äúcrying‚Äù about extraneous matters.AICC spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the person who hurled the expletives is in police custody and should be punished. But, she said, blaming Tejashwi Yadav, Rahul Gandhi and Congress for the incident is a distraction being created by Modi to shift the focus of the election campaign as he is rattled by the phenomenal success of the Yatra in Bihar.‚ÄúTo make a mother the focal point of electioneering is the worst kind of politics Modi has resorted to. The simple fact is that the PM follows multiple people on social media who abuse women and threaten them with rape, who have fictitious photographs of Sonia Gandhi and other women leaders. What does the PM have to say about it?‚Äù she asked.Shrinate said Modi had mocked as ‚Äújersey cow‚Äù and ‚ÄúCongress ki vidhwa‚Äù a leader who is a former president of Congress and a mother, and called Sunanda Pushkar a ‚Äú50 crore ki girlfriend‚Äù, besides heckling Mamata Banerjee and campaigning for Prajwal Revanna who is accused of raping mothers.So, instead of ‚Äúcrying in public about his own issues‚Äù, Modi should talk about the concerns of the people, she said.Stating that the abuse incident took place when there were no big leaders on the stage, Shrinate said Modi‚Äôs bid to blame Rahul for it is unreasonable because he is a person with zero-tolerance for women being targetted. ‚ÄúWhen Smriti Irani lost in 2024, some people started ridiculing her. But Rahul had the political courage to come out and say that he does not like it, and that elections are won and lost. He did it for a woman who made a career out of abusing him and his mother. Is the PM questioning this person?‚Äù she wondered, adding the ‚Äúrules have to be the same. The PM has consistently abused women‚Äù.‚ÄúThere is an economic crisis, tariffs, factories are shutting down, there are layoffs. And the PM who was laughing loudly in China suddenly returns to India and starts crying. Is this an electoral issue? The issues in Bihar are BJP‚Äôs bad governance of 20 years, false promises. Bihar will vote for jobs and equality, and against high prices and poor law and order,‚Äù she asserted.","AICC spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the person who hurled the expletives is in police custody and should be punished.

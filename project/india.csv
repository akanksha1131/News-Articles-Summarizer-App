"“Put yourself in uncomfortable situations,” says Google CEO Sundar Pichai: 8 important career lessons that professionals must learn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/put-yourself-in-uncomfortable-situations-says-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-here-are-important-career-lessons-to-learn/articleshow/123178194.cms,"Be your own toughest critic



Seek out the people who intimidate you



Lean into discomfort



Let passion guide your decisions



Build mission-oriented teams



Trust before you criticise



Let recognition come naturally



Remember that wealth is only part of the story



Corporate boardrooms rarely produce leaders who combine quiet humility with the sharp strategic acumen needed to steer a $2.3 trillion enterprise. Sundar Pichai is one of those rare and remarkable exceptions. His ascent from a product manager’s desk in 2004 to the CEO’s chair at Google is not a story of brash, impulsive manoeuvres, but of measured choices, deliberate growth, and an unyielding focus on people and innovation.At 52, with a personal fortune of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Pichai stands as proof that leadership excellence is not defined by volume or theatrics, but by clarity of vision and consistency of execution. In a candid exchange with Lex Fridman, American Computer Scientist and podcaster, he offered a distilled set of principles, drawn from two decades at the helm of one of the world’s most influential companies, that hold deep relevance for anyone seeking professional and personal advancement.These lessons are not abstract platitudes. They are field-tested convictions forged through moments of uncertainty, challenge, and relentless innovation.For those willing to absorb them, they serve as a blueprint for growing beyond limitations and leading with purpose.Pichai’s most telling insight lies in his belief that the best professionals need no external reprimand to recognise their missteps. “At times, you're working with people who are so committed to achieving, if they've done something wrong, they feel it more than you do,” he remarked. The essence: Hold yourself to a standard higher than any imposed by a manager.Far from shying away from professional discomfort, Pichai considers it an essential growth tool. “At various points in my life, I've worked with people who I felt were better than me,” he admitted. The takeaway? Surround yourself with talent that challenges your competence and compels you to stretch your own abilities.For Pichai, growth rarely blossoms in the safe zone. He urges young professionals to “put yourself in uncomfortable situations” because “often you'll surprise yourself.” That willingness to step into the unfamiliar is what propelled him from a product manager’s desk to the helm of Google in just over a decade.In an age when career decisions are often algorithmically calculated, Pichai champions an instinctive approach. “When you do things, I think it's important to listen to your heart, and see whether you actually enjoy doing it,” he advised. Passion, he argues, is a more reliable long-term compass than expediency.A single leader cannot steer a global enterprise without the right people in place. Pichai’s formula for high performance is simple but uncompromising: “You find mission-oriented people who are in the shared journey, who have this inner drive to excellence, to do the best, and motivate people, and you can achieve a lot that way.”Pichai’s calm management style is grounded in faith in his teams. While he recognises that “occasionally, there are people who you need to clearly let them know, like, ‘That wasn't okay,’” he is quick to add, “I've often found that not to be the case.” His approach reflects a belief that empowered and committed employees self-correct more effectively than those micromanaged.Pichai’s rise to CEO was not the result of orchestrated self-promotion, but the by-product of consistent excellence. His work caught the attention of Larry Page and Sergey Brin precisely because it spoke for itself—a quiet reminder that recognition earned organically is the most enduring.Despite his billionaire status, Pichai’s net worth is modest in comparison to Google’s co-founders, whose fortunes exceed $160 billion each according to US media reports. Yet his focus remains fixed on impact, influence, and innovation, an implicit lesson that personal wealth is only one metric of success.Pichai’s philosophy is deceptively simple yet deeply profound: Growth begins where comfort ends, excellence thrives in self-discipline, and success is amplified by the people you choose to work with. For those willing to follow his lead, the results can be transformative.","Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google, worth an estimated $1.1 billion. He has been at the helm of the company for over a decade. In an interview with Lex Fridman, he offers a distilled set of principles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123178247,imgsize-26928,width-400,resizemode-4/123178247.jpg"

He was released on bail while investigations continue. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has suspended him and is providing legal support during the UK investigation.Ali's cricket career began promisingly. He made his mark in the 2020 PSL with Peshawar Zalmi, scoring 239 runs with an impressive strike rate over 157. His international debut was memorable, scoring 54 runs off 33 balls in Manchester, helping Pakistan win by five runs.One of his international matches thereon came against India in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia where he scored just 2 runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya . During that match in October 2022, played at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Haider couldn't make a name for himself in arguably the biggest game in the sport as he holed out to Suryakumar Yadav.Despite his explosive batting style, Ali has struggled with consistency in his career. He has played two ODIs and 35 T20Is for Pakistan. The Shaheens tour was seen as a chance for him to return to form and fit into Pakistan's aggressive T20 playing style.Ali was touring with Pakistan's Shaheens squad, their 'A' team, in England when the arrest happened in Beckenham.

Trump Reveals Location For Putin Meeting; 'Hidden Message' For Russian President? | Ukraine War

Also read:

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday welcomed the agreement between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold a summit in Alaska on August 15, 2025, describing it as a possible breakthrough in ending the war in Ukraine.“India welcomes the understanding reached between the United States and the Russian Federation for a meeting in Alaska on 15th August 2025. This meeting holds the promise of bringing to an end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and opening up the prospects for peace. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said on several occasions - This is not an era of war,"" the ministry of external affairs said in a statement released on Saturday.""India, therefore, endorses the upcoming Summit meeting and stands ready to support these efforts,"" it further added.The statement comes as Trump imposed 50% tariff on India, accusing it of supporting Moscow's 'war machine' against Ukraine by buying Russian oil.US had earlier announced 25% additional duties on Indian imports in the country, on the top of an already 25% tariff, taking the total to 50%.The order specified that ""The ad valorem duty imposed...shall be in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports...""The implementation timeline shows the base duty taking effect from August 7, whilst the additional charge begins from August 27, following a 21-day period.The order said, ""I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25%.""US President Donald Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, in an effort to negotiate a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and has seen numerous failed rounds of talks.It will be Putin’s first visit to the United States in a decade, his last being in 2015 for the UN General Assembly in New York.For Trump, the meeting marks his most direct attempt yet to fulfil his campaign pledge to end the war “within 24 hours,” a promise that has faced repeated setbacks despite phone calls, peace talks and diplomatic visits.The choice of Alaska is has symbolic importance as Russia sold the territory to the US in 1867, and its western tip sits just across the Bering Strait from Russia’s easternmost point.The Kremlin confirmed the meeting after US envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow. During his visit, Witkoff proposed a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but Russia did not respond to the idea.“The Russian side left this option completely without comment,” Kremlin spokesperson Ushkov said.Earlier, Trump had told reporters he would likely meet Putin face-to-face “very soon.”His efforts to halt Russia’s military offensive have so far yielded little progress, with three rounds of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv ending without a breakthrough.","India welcomes the agreement between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold a summit in Alaska on August 15, 2025.

Rahul Gandhi’s ‘vote theft’ charge: Sharad Pawar claims offer of 160 ‘guaranteed’ seats before Maharashtra polls; Fadnavis questions timing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vote-theft-row-after-rahul-gandhis-charge-sharad-pawar-says-he-was-offered-160-guaranteed-seats-before-maharashtra-polls/articleshow/123205951.cms,"Rahul Gandhi Releases New Video, Claims More 'Proof' On EC, BJP Collusion in Voter List Fraud

NEW DELHI: Amid Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s “vote theft” accusations, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday claimed that two individuals approached him before the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, offering to secure victory in 160 of the 288 seats.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis questioned the timing of the disclosure, linking it to Rahul Gandhi’s recent allegations against the Election Commission (EC) and the BJP.“I remember that before the Maharashtra Assembly elections were announced, two people came to meet me in Delhi... They told me that out of 288 seats in Maharashtra, we guarantee you 160 seats. I was surprised, to be honest, I had no doubts about the Election Commission,” Pawar told reporters in Nagpur.Pawar said he later introduced the individuals to Rahul Gandhi. “Whatever they wanted to say, they said in front of Rahul Gandhi. But Rahul Gandhi and I were of the opinion that we should not pay attention to this; this is not our path,” he added.Fadnavis questioned why Pawar made the revelation now, suggesting it supported Rahul Gandhi’s narrative. “Why is Pawar disclosing this after Rahul Gandhi's claims? Earlier Pawar never endorsed Gandhi's claims about (manipulation of) EVMs.No matter what, free and fair polls are held in India... Rahul Gandhi tells stories that sound like a Salim-Javed script, and what Pawar has said seems to be the same script,” he said.The chief minister also criticised Rahul Gandhi for not filing an affidavit as demanded by the EC to substantiate his claims of “huge criminal fraud” in the polls. “Why doesn't Gandhi give a declaration in a quasi-judicial matter?....because he is lying, and if caught, he will be liable to face criminal proceedings,” Fadnavis said.On August 7, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were “choreographed” by the EC to favour the BJP, pointing to Maharashtra and Karnataka as examples of voter roll irregularities and sudden spikes in turnout. “In Maharashtra and Haryana, we saw it right in front of our faces… More voters were added in five months than in five years in Maharashtra… Huge jump in voter turnout after 5 pm,” he said.Rahul claimed some constituencies recorded new voter additions exceeding the population of Maharashtra and accused the EC of refusing to share voter lists or CCTV footage. The Maharashtra chief electoral officer has since asked him to provide an affidavit and evidence of illegal voter inclusion or deletion.The 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections saw the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance win 235 seats, including 132 for the BJP, 57 for the Shiv Sena, and 41 for the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction).

In response to an RTI query, National Medical Commission (NMC) stated that of the 11,200 applications for registration received, 91% have not been approved as of Aug 8.Launched with much fanfare by Union health minister on Aug 23, 2024, the NMR portal of NMC for registration of all MBBS doctors eligible to practise in India has failed to take off. NMR was hailed as a move to ""strengthen the digital healthcare ecosystem"", after which similar registers were to be launched for paramedics and other healthcare professionals. Yet, with the register for doctors - who constitute the smallest professional group in the health system - not materialising, it remains to be seen whether the registers for an estimated 35 lakh nurses and for paramedics, who would be more than double the number of nurses, will happen any time soon.In response to a question in Parliament, the health ministry said that 13.9 lakh MBBS doctors are registered with state councils, of which it is assumed that about 80% (over 11 lakh) are available.NMC had issued the Registration of Medical Practitioners and Licence to Practice Medicine Regulations, 2023, on June 8, 2023. According to the regulation, NMC's Ethics & Medical Registration Board shall maintain the NMR, which shall contain entries of all doctors in all state registers maintained by state medical councils. The regulations envisage a unique identification number for every doctor, centrally generated by EMRB, which will ""grant registration in NMR and eligibility to practice medicine in India"".All existing medical practitioners enrolled in the Indian Medical Register or the State Medical Register not having registration number as per the regulation were mandated to update their registration in the web portal of EMRB within three months of publication of the regulation.However, applications have petered out as approvals for 90% of those who applied are still pending. From 6,000 applications in the first three months after launch, applications have dwindled to less than 800 in past four months.The renewal of registration every five years is supposed to happen through state councils and the status of registration in the state registry ""shall automatically reflected (sic) in the National Register"". However, state registries are yet to be linked to NMR.""Even when state councils confirm the membership of a doctor, NMC is rejecting it, as in my case,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist.

The IGIA, the country’s busiest airport, handles around 1,300 flight movements daily.The India Meteorological Department had issued a red alert early in the morning for heavy rain accompanied by lightning and thunderstorms across parts of north, west, south, southeast, and central Delhi, but later downgraded it to a yellow alert, advising residents to remain cautious.In the 24 hours ending 8:30 am, Safdarjung, the city’s main weather station, recorded 78.7 mm of rain.

""US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India's biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,"" said the authors - Raka Saxena and Ramesh Chand - of the working paper. Chand is member, Niti Aayog, while Saxena is senior adviser at the think tank.Although the paper used a disclaimer terming the content as personal views of authors, its recent withdrawal from the think tank's website reflects govt's thinking on the issue of GM products.India currently allows commercial cultivation of only transgenic cotton, a non-food farm item.Govt's stand is in sync with RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch's opposition to the cultivation and import of GM farm products. In its opposition to transgenic food items, the SJM has even joined hands with several left-leaning farm groups in the past.The working paper had pitched for a ""dual-track"" approach while negotiating the trade deal on agricultural items with the US and appeared keen on opening the country's market to specific non-sensitive imports of farm products that do not face direct competition from local producers, such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.India has maintained a surplus in agriculture trade with the US and it has increased over time. India's agricultural exports to the US grew nearly fivefold between 2004 and 2024, from $1.18 billion to $5.75 billion, while imports however, grew faster - from $291 million in 2004 to $2,218 million in 2024.","The Niti Aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper, which had suggested opening up import of genetically modified (GM) soybean and corn from the US, has given a peek into India's red-line on transgenic food items.

It is very shameful for any citizen of this country to ask for reservation after 65 years of independence. When our Constitution was framed, it was understood that reservation would remain for a period of 10 years but unfortunately it has continued even after 65 years of independence.

Within a few hours of the motion being filed by the MPs, the Gujarat govt came to Justice Pardiwala's rescue by moving an application requesting the judge to expunge the 'offensive' remarks.Justice Pardiwala acted swiftly and expunged the entire paragraph 62 from his judgment.

The aim this time was to strike not just the foot soldiers of terrorism, but the leadership infrastructure that sustained them, ACM Singh said.While seven targets close across the border were targeted by the Army, the IAF took on the main headquarters of the Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Muhammed in Bahawalpur that were further away.The two headquarters were hardened, well-defended structures, with the long-range strikes aimed at leadership residences, other housing for operatives and the spaces used for congregations and training, with a strict emphasis on minimising civilian casualties.This time there was also emphasis on getting video and other footage of the ""hits"" on different targets. The absence of such evidence during the air strikes on the Jaish-e-Muhammed terror facility at Balakot in Feb 2019 had led some quarters to doubt the claims at that time. ""So, I am very happy that this time we were able to take care of that ghost of Balakot,"" ACM Singh said.",Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh says govt did not impose any operational restrictions on the armed forces during the May 7-10 hostilities against Pakistan. The remarks are significant since the opposition has attacked govt on Operation Sindoor by latching onto some remarks made by India's defence attache to Indonesia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123210636,imgsize-46094,width-400,resizemode-4/123210636.jpg"

Asif called the statement “implausible, ill-timed and a dangerous distortion of the May clashes”. He also claimed the IAF chief’s statement was made “to serve domestic politics”.In a statement on X, Asif claimed New Delhi was attempting to rewrite the narrative months after the fighting ended. “It is ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by the strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians,” he said.Asif said no such statement on Pakistani losses had surfaced for three months, while Pakistan had immediately shared “detailed technical briefings” with the international media.The minister insisted not a single Pakistani aircraft was destroyed. Instead, he claimed Pakistan’s forces had shot down six Indian jets, including advanced fighters, destroyed S-400 air defence systems, downed unmanned aircraft, and disabled “several Indian airbases”.“If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification — though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure,” Asif said.","IAF chief claimed India had downed multiple Pakistani fighter jets and one large aircraft in Operation Sindoor.

Karra announced that Congress workers would fast in different districts of J&K from Aug 9 to Aug 21 --- when Parliament’s monsoon session concludes.Amid chants of “We want statehood”, Karra pointed out that after the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, the Narendra Modi govt had repeatedly promised to restore statehood and BJP leaders had publicly reaffirmed their commitment during election campaigns.“No steps have been taken. We feel they are not serious about their promise. This has compelled us to stage protests last month in Srinagar, Jammu, and at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. Now we have started this hunger strike programme,” Karra said.On July 17, Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to PM Modi to introduce a bill in the ongoing monsoon session to restore J&K’s statehood.Two days later, the party held protests in Kashmir, followed by a demonstration on the first day of the monsoon session in Delhi. The party also observed Aug 5 as a “black day.”K arra urged political forces, irrespective of political ideologies, to join the latest protests. “Every party is appealing for restoration of statehood. What stops them from joining us?” Karra asked in comments seen as an allusion to ally NC.Chief minister and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah had last month voiced displeasure at not being consulted or informed when Congress launched its protests in Delhi. Three days ago, Omar wrote to all national parties, including BJP, to help bring a bill in the Parliament’s current session for statehood restoration.Karra, however, argued that the CM should have directly written to Modi. “I don’t know why he (Omar) preferred parties for the letter rather than the PM.”",J&K Congress president Tariq Hamid Karra led the fasts in Srinagar coinciding with Quit India Movement’s anniversary.

He should speak about the development of Bihar, about ending unemployment and inflation. He doesn't speak about any of these. Bihar will not benefit if they keep abusing Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav. Unless unemployment, poverty and migration end in Bihar, they do not speak about education and health facilities. Their is only the politics of negativity. Let them do it, this doesn't matter.”The strong reaction came in response to Amit Shah's recent visit to Sitamarhi on Friday where he laid the foundation stone for the redevelopment of Janki Mata Temple at Punaura Dham. Later, while addressing a public rally, Shah accused the Congress party and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav 's camp of opposing the government’s anti-terror Operation Sindoor He also criticized them for opposing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter list in Bihar, accusing them of indulging in vote bank politics.

CHANDIGARH: Chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Saturday announced the launch of anti-drone systems, aimed at curbing the smuggling of drugs and weapons through drones from Pakistan. He declared that Punjab is the first state in India to deploy such a system in its border areas.Mann, along with AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal , unveiled three anti-drone systems during an event in the border district of Tarn Taran.The anti-drone system will be called 'Baaz Akh' (Hawk Eye), the chief minister said, adding that it will be deployed from Pathankot to Fazilka as the second line of defence in the border districts in coordination with the Border Security Force.Mann explained that the second line of defence refers to the deployment of the Punjab Police in border districts, working alongside the BSF stationed at the international border.He emphasised that this initiative marks a significant step for the Punjab government in the fight against the smuggling of drugs and arms across the border. ""In the coming days, we will expand the anti-drone system throughout the state,"" he added.Reaffirming his government's commitment to maintaining peace and harmony in the state, Mann said this initiative will play a crucial role in the government's anti-drug drive, Yudh Nasheyan Virudh (war against drugs).To enhance border security and address challenges posed by drone activities from Pakistan, nine anti-drone units are being established along the international border for Rs 51.4 crore, Mann informed, asserting that the anti-drone system will significantly counter the activities of drug smugglers.""The enemies of the country have turned drones into weapons to harm Punjab's youth, using them to smuggle drugs across the border,"" Mann said, praising the security forces for their relentless efforts to combat cross-border drug trafficking.He said that in 2024, a total of 283 drones loaded with heroin , weapons, and ammunition were seized, and as of 2025, 137 drones have already been recovered.Expressing confidence that the anti-drone system will assist the security forces in combating the smuggling of drugs and weapons, Mann said it will be deployed at specific border points where high drone activity has been observed.Mann claimed that the Punjab Police did not have any such system to neutralise drones previously.Further informing that the anti-drone system is equipped to accurately detect the drone's position and its ground control stations, the chief minister stated that this system comes with an automated alert technology, which immediately notifies authorities upon detecting drone movement, thus eliminating the need for manual monitoring.To ensure effective implementation, coordination will be maintained with the BSF, the Air Force, the Army, and other relevant agencies, Mann stated.During the launch, Kejriwal stated that another chapter has been added to their fight against drugs. He highlighted the AAP government's efforts to tackle the drug menace while criticising previous governments for their alleged collusion with drug smugglers, which he claimed contributed to the state's drug problems.Announcing that a crackdown against drug trafficking has begun, and the 'big fish' involved in this trade have been rounded up, Kejriwal further claimed that a notorious and feared drug lord has been put behind bars by the Bhagwant Mann government.He mentioned that the Punjab Police is actively taking action against drug smugglers, including demolishing properties acquired through drug trafficking as part of their anti-drug campaign.""We know that most drugs enter from Pakistan through drones. Today, the Punjab government is implementing the anti-drone system, which will neutralise any drone that crosses into Punjab from Pakistan,"" the former Delhi chief minister said.Three anti-drone systems were launched on Saturday, with plans to deploy six more.

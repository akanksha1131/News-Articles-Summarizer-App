Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

"Bihar polls: My age may be young, but my promise is mature, says Tejashwi Yadav",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-my-age-may-be-young-but-my-promise-is-mature-says-tejashwi-yadav/articleshow/125009260.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav (ANI)

As the Bihar assembly election campaign intensifies, INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lays out his vision for development, employment and economic justice while taking aim at his political rivals.

He shares his plans to create jobs, strengthen the economy and build an inclusive Bihar with TOI’s AlokKNMishra. Excerpts:

You are the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc and have been campaigning extensively across Bihar for the past several weeks. What promises are you making to people, and what feedback are you getting?

“My Age May Be Young, But My Promise Is Mature,” Says Tejashwi Yadav Ahead of Bihar Polls

You have pledged to provide a govt job for every family. Critics argue that this may not be financially feasible for Bihar, which does not have the financial resources to fund this. How do you plan to implement this promise?

Have you consulted experts, carried out any study or prepared a blueprint for this?

The INDIA bloc and the NDA are both contesting the election on the development plank. How is the RJD-led alliance’s development plank different from the NDA's?

Having served as deputy chief minister under Nitish Kumar, what do you think about Nitish Kumar's style of leadership and the way he runs the Government?

RJD has traditionally relied on support from the Muslim-Yadav vote base. This time, you have fielded more candidates from women, Dalits, and EBC communities. How is the RJD attempting to broaden its appeal beyond the MuslimYadav combination?

The voting patterns in recent Bihar elections indicate that a larger share of EBC, upper-caste and several groups within the Dalit community voters have favoured the NDA over the RJD

Women in Bihar have traditionally been seen as strong supporters of Nitish Kumar. What strategies is the RJD adopting to attract more women voters in this election?

Do you think the women of Bihar are going to support the INDIA bloc this time?

The NDA is contesting the election under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, but it has not yet categorically announced that Nitish will be the CM if the NDA wins. What is your view on this?

Why will the NDA not make Nitish Kumar the CM?

RJD rule in Bihar ended 20 years ago. Even now, many people say that a return of the RJD to power could bring back the ‘jungle raj’ of the past. Why do such perceptions persist even after so many years since the RJD last governed Bihar?

You have been saying that Lalu Yadav gave social justice to the people of Bihar, and you will deliver economic justice. Can you elaborate?

There have been reports of internal differences within the INDIA bloc. How have you addressed or managed these challenges?

But across 11 se

ats, the INDIA bloc partners are contesting against each other in what is being described as a friendly fight.

Congress is an important partner of the RJD-led alliance in Bihar. It won 19 seats in 2020. How do you feel it is going to perform in this election?

Did you give any suggestions to Congress when they were finalising the tickets?

There seems to be tension in your family, with your elder brother’s newly formed party (Janshakti Janata Dal) contesting the election against many RJD candidates. As his younger brother, many would expect him to support you and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this crucial time. How do you respond to this?

Is there any possibility of the RJD again aligning with Nitish Kumar’s party JD(U) in future?

How challenging is Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj for the INDIA bloc?

You are the INDIA bloc’s CM face. The VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) chief is the deputy chief minister face. Is there a possibility that there could be another deputy CM from the Muslim community?

We have taken an oath to make Bihar the number one state in the country and that is our ultimate objective. Our vision is to build a Bihar where no Bihari brother or sister has to migrate in search of work or opportunities. Every facility and opportunity should be available right here, in our own state. Bihar should have factories and job opportunities, as well as quality hospitals, colleges and universities.Factories should be set up, jute mills reopened, food processing units established and new IT parks and SEZs developed.Our goal is to make Bihar an educational hub so that students do not have to go to places like Kota to prepare for exams and we want to build good hospitals so that people do not have to travel outside the state for treatment. Bihar today is one of the poorest states with the lowest per capita income. We are determined to change that by ensuring that every citizen has access to education, healthcare, income, opportunities and justice – and that the govt is truly action-oriented.Bihar also has immense potential in the tourism sector – whether it is religious tourism, heritage tourism or general tourism. We want to develop this potential and promote Bihar as a major tourism destination. We want to make such a Bihar that moves ahead on the path of progress. We are getting a great response from the people who want a change in Bihar.Let the people say what they want to say. The last time, they were saying that giving 10 lakh jobs was impossible. Now, the same people – the BJP and JD(U) – have been forced to talk about jobs, and they are saying they will give one crore jobs. We have done and shown what we promised.We gave five lakh jobs – about 3.5 lakh every year during the 17 months from Aug 2022 to Jan 2024, when I served as deputy chief minister in the Grand Alliance govt. We also gave the status of Bihar govt employees to over four lakh contractual teachers in the state in Dec 2023. So, we have already done it, and soon we will turn this task – which looks impossible – into a possible one. My age may be young, but my promise is mature.We do not make any announcements without consulting the experts and without conducting the required research and study. We only make announcements that are feasible and practical. We have prepared the blueprint for it.The NDA has no development plank and no vision for Bihar. The BJP wants factories to be set up only in Gujarat – the semiconductor factory is in Gujarat, investor meetings are held there, SEZs are established there, and even the international stadium is built there.Everything is being done in Gujarat, while nothing is being done for Bihar. They have no road map or vision for Bihar. Amit Shah (union home minister) himself said that there is a dearth of land in Bihar, which is why factories and industries cannot be set up here. So, they have made it clear that they have no development plan for Bihar.At present, Nitish Kumar has been reduced to just a puppet. BJP is running the govt while Nitish Kumar is merely a figurehead – the real power lies with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. We even have sympathy for Nitish Kumar, considering his current condition.This is the same Nitish Kumar who once snapped ties with the NDA after Narendra Modi was announced the chief of the BJP’s campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He had even cancelled a dinner planned for Modi in Patna. In the past, the same Nitish Kumar returned the Rs 5 crore Koshi flood relief donation from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat govt in 2010 when the Gujarat govt issued advertisements for it.And now, Nitish ji has, unfortunately, become a puppet and his health condition also does not allow him to run the govt effectivelyThe RJD has always been a party for everyone – inclusive since the very beginning. No govt has given as much representation in the state cabinet to upper castes as the one led by Laluji. Similarly, no other govt has matched the number of leaders from the EBC category who were made MLAs, MLCs, and given various opportunities under the govt of Laluji.It was Laluji who made Bhagwati Devi, the daughter of the Musahar community, an MP. He ensured that every section of society received respect and representation in governance. Yes, some people may have left us at times, but eventually, all of them have come back — because they know that the RJD truly belongs to everyone.In the 2020 election, the difference between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan was only 12,000 votes, which was less than 1%. It shows that we got votes from all sections of society.The women have woken up now. The truth has come out in the open – that women were often exploited and were denied the respect and rights they truly deserved. This is why there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among women with the Nitish govt.See, due to growing dissatisfaction among women, the Nitish govt had to give a Rs 10,000 bribe to each woman just before the elections. They realised that their support base among women was drifting away, especially after we announced the ‘Mai Bahin Maan Yojana’ for the women of Bihar, under which women in Bihar will receive Rs 2,500 per month as financial assistance to make them financially independent, and we spoke about making Jeevika Didis permanent.This has clearly panicked the NDA. That is why they are giving out Rs 10,000 in the middle of the election, and yet the Election Commission is not stopping them. What is the emergency that justifies this?Amit Shah ji and the BJP are clear that Nitish Kumar will not become the chief minister again. It is totally clear. He will meet the same fate as Shinde ji (Eknath Shinde was not reinstated as CM after the BJP won a majority in the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections).His situation is not the same. The BJP wants to have its own chief minister in Bihar because, until now, they have never had one. They aspire for it, but that ambition will never be fulfilled.See, this is nothing but complete propaganda and a wrong perception fuelled by those opposed to the RJD. Lalu ji always gave respect to everyone and worked to ensure equality in society. Those who considered themselves superior by birth had to sit at the same level as Dalits and backward communities. This created resentment among such people. True superiority comes from one’s actions, not from birth. Lalu ji made everyone equal and upheld this principle consistently.We are living in an economic age, and people deserve economic justice. Inflation is soaring, jobs are scarce, and household expenses are rising rapidly. How are people supposed to manage their daily lives? Since Modi came to power, under the NDA govt, everything has become more expensive.Modi ji had promised to bring down inflation, but prices have risen fivefold since he took office – fuel, food, and almost everything has become costlier, while people’s incomes remain stagnant. Small and medium-scale factories are shutting down, businesses are struggling and the economy is not growing as it should. The situation worsened further after Trump imposed tariffs. Now is the time to ensure true economic justice for the people.There were no fissures in the INDIA bloc. There was no problem. It was only in the media.The friendly fight is being conducted strategically. In Jharkhand, we contested and won elections despite similar arrangements. Likewise, in Jammu & Kashmir, the INDIA bloc had friendly fights, and they emerged victorious. In Bihar, the situation is no different. We remain united and strong, contesting the elections with our full strength, and we are going to win the elections.Congress will perform much better this time. We are confident of winning more seats compared to 2020, as we have focused carefully on the winnability factor and meticulously selected our candidates.We all sit together and discuss it – the selection of candidates.That’s alright. In a democracy, everyone has the right to form their own party and contest elections. Yes, it would have been far better if the things that happened had not happened, but this is the reality, and we have to accept it.Now, the Janata Dal (United) will not survive after the elections are over. Half of the JD(U) leaders will go to the BJP and half will come to the RJD.We do not care about such things – who is coming to Bihar, who is making what party. Our only focus is to make Bihar the number one state in the country. Our fight is against unemployment.It has already been announced that there will be one more deputy CM if the INDIA bloc forms the govt. When the right time comes, the decision about it will be taken collectively by the alliance partners and an announcement will be made.","Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc.

MUMBAI: Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met, according to the FIR filed by assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, who entered the premises with three other cops to rescue the children and shot the captor in self defence after he “pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist at children’s side for a moment, and then pointed it towards me and my team, and he was about to fire”.Assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, complainant in the hostage crisis, said in the FIR he reached the RA Studio complex around 2pm when chaos broke out. “A few parents rushed in, shouting that their children were not answering calls. Someone showed me a video circulating on WhatsApp — a man named Rohit Arryya claiming he had taken several children hostage inside the studio. He was threatening to burn the place down if anyone tried to intervene.Within minutes, police teams led by API Sohail Subedar and senior PI Sonawane reached the spot. The atmosphere was tense—parents were crying, and we could smell petrol from outside the studio. The accused doused the premises with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met. There were also batteries nearby. Police gained access through a duct and reached the first-floor bathroom where the children were confined.” TOI has a copy of the FIR.The children were kept hostage on the first floor. Waghmare along with sub-inspectors Rakesh Nalawade, Bade and Shinde entered through the bathroom window with the help of fire brigade. “We heard children crying in the bathroom.Then Rohit Aarrya entered and, leaving the children alone, at a distance of about two to three feet, he used a pepper spray, and then pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist... and was about to fire. To save myself, our team and children from being harmed, I fired a shot from my service pistol and he was injured. He was immediately taken to Jogeshwari trauma care hospital and the hostages were rescued and handed over to their parents. ”The FIR stated before the police team entered the studio, Rohan Aher who worked as assistant to Aarrya appeared at the window and told the cops that Aarrya had confined four children with ropes and put adhesive tapes on their mouths. “We saw a person from the window on the first floor saying his name was Rohit Aarrya and he started talking to us policemen. At that time, since his voice was not clear, Sonawane took his mobile number from one Amol Dorugade and called Aarrya on his mobile number. ” Aher is the key witness in the case, said the police.Cops requested him to release the children and promised to fulfil his demands. DCP Datta Nalawade called and tried to talk to him, but he was not stating clearly what his demand was. He threatened on phone that he would set the place on fire and may harm the children, the FIR said.","Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met.

Deadly Stampede at Andhra Pradesh After Chaos, Panic Strikes Venkateswara Temple, At Least 10 Dead





VIJAYAWADA: A stampede at a privately run temple in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh killed nine devotees — eight women and a 13-year-old boy — and left more than 25 injured Saturday morning, after a railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.The toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured is critical.The Venkateswara Swamy temple, located at Kasibugga under Palasa mandal and modelled on the Tirumala shrine in Tirupati, was built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda from Odisha and opened just four months ago.One gate serving as both entry and exit, poor crowd control, and lack of official clearance turned the pilgrimage into chaos. “Nobody is responsible — it was an act of god,” Panda said.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said the main sanctum sits on the first floor with about 20 steps leading to it.“A railing along the staircase, believed to be poorly constructed, collapsed and caused a person to fall, triggering panic as the packed crowd surged forward,” he said.Calling the deaths “extremely heart-breaking”, CM N Chandrababu Naidu said: “Had police been informed in advance, they could have implemented a crowd management plan.Those responsible will face action.”Venkateswara Swamy temple at Kasibugga, visited by around 3,000 devotees on Saturdays, saw a crowd nearly seven times that number on the day of the stampede as it was the first Karthika Ekadashi since the temple’s inauguration. With no prior approval for the gathering or adequate security, the few guards were overwhelmed.District police chief K V Maheswara Reddy said temple authorities failed to alert police or the district administration about the festival and the likely crowd. Police have registered a case under section 100 (culpable homicide) of BNS and detained four temple staff for questioning.The shrine isn’t registered with Andhra Pradesh’s endowments department, which oversees thousands of temples. “Everything looked fine around 9am, but suddenly the number of devotees surged. Narrow stairway was choked. I was nearby when the railing broke and people started falling over each other,” said R Ramanamma, a devotee.The deceasad were identified as E Chinnammi (46), R Vijaya (48) from Tekkali; M Neelamma (60) from Vajrapukotturu; D Rajeswari (60), G Rupa (50), B Brunda from Mandasa; Ch Yasodamma (56) from Nandigam; D Ammulamma from Kasibugga; and L Nikhil (13) from Sompeta. Two women — B Kalavathi and R Kumari — remain critical. “I have instructed officials to ensure proper treatment for the injured,” chief minister Naidu said.PM Modi said he was “pained” by the tragedy. “My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover soon,” he said, announcing Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to each victim’s family and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Saturday’s crush was the third major temple tragedy in Andhra Pradesh this year — following six deaths at Tirupati’s Vaikunta Ekadashi token centre on Jan 8 and seven killed in a wall collapse at Visakhapatnam’s Simhachalam temple on Apr 30.","A railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.

NEW DELHI: Janata Dal (United) candidate and former Mokama MLA Anant Singh was arrested by the Patna Police on Saturday night in connection with the murder of Jan Suraaj Party worker Dularchand Yadav, the Patna senior superintendent of Police Kartikeya Sharma confirmed.Anant Singh has been arrested along with two associates, Manikant Thakur and Ranjit Ram, from Bedna village.According to officials, a massive police operation involving around 150 personnel was carried out at Singh’s residence in Barh, near Patna, late Saturday night. Singh, a well-known strongman in Bihar politics, was taken into custody and brought to Patna for interrogation. “Further details will be shared during a scheduled press conference at 1:30 am on Sunday,” the SSP said.SSP Patna, Kartikeya K Sharma said, ""... On 30 October, there was a clash between two groups of competing candidates. Stones were pelted resulting in injuries. A dead body was recovered after the incident. The deceased, Dularchand Yadav, aged 75 years, was a resident of the village where this clash occurred... Both sides registered cases, and police started investigating the case... Based on evidence, eyewitness accounts, and the postmortem report of the deceased, it appears that the Model Code of Conduct was violated, and it is a serious issue.It was found that all this happened in the presence of the candidate, Anant Singh, who is also the main accused in the case. Anant Singh has been arrested. His accomplices, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram, have also been arrested with him... All three will be presented before the magistrate, and due investigation will follow.""Patna DM Thiyagarajan SM said the incident was taken “very seriously.” The Model Code of Conduct will be enforced strictly, he said, adding that all licensed arms must be deposited during polls to ensure peaceful elections.The case pertains to the killing of former RJD leader Dularchand Yadav, who was attacked in the Mokama Tal area on Thursday afternoon while campaigning for Jan Suraaj’s candidate Piyush Priyadarshi. A violent clash reportedly erupted between rival groups, during which Yadav was shot by an unidentified assailant and later run over by a vehicle. The postmortem report released on Friday confirmed that his ribcage was crushed, suggesting he was run over after being shot.An FIR filed by Yadav’s grandson Neeraj Kumar named Anant Singh, his nephews Karamveer and Ranveer, and two others as accused. Police sources said further arrests may follow as the investigation continues.Reacting to the arrest, Jan Suraaj candidate Piyush Priyadarshi told ANI, “This is a good gesture, but it would have been good had they taken action sooner. Today, he was moving around in a convoy of 50 vehicles and even participated in election campaigning. When an FIR was registered against him, he should have been arrested sooner... But better late than never. What is important now is how the police investigate the whole case. .. It is a relief for his family.”Meanwhile, the Election Commission took strong action following the murder, ordering the replacement of the Patna Rural SP and Mokama returning officer, and initiating disciplinary proceedings against three officials for lapses. The poll panel directed the immediate suspension of SDPO Abhishek Singh and sought a compliance report by 12 noon on November 2, 2025.The Mokama Assembly seat, which votes on November 6, has long been notorious as a stronghold of powerful “bahubalis” who wield influence during elections. The killing of Yadav has intensified the political battle in Bihar, with opposition leaders, including RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, accusing the administration of failing to maintain law and order.","Janata Dal (United) candidate and former Mokama MLA Anant Singh arrested.

Air India Flight Faces Stall, GPWS Warnings After Takeoff From Delhi In Second Near-miss

Scheduling and rostering lapses at Air India continue five months after being reprimanded by the regulator on this issue. In the latest instance, a co-pilot and a senior captain have been taken off flying duty after the airline found they operated a flight each last month with a lapsed English Language Proficiency (ELP) licence in one case. And in the other, a co-pilot did so without undergoing mandatory corrective training after not being able to clear the bi-annual pilot proficiency check (PPC) - instrument rating (IR) test.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is investigating these lapses and has sought a report from the airline. AI is learnt to have asked pilots to ensure they meet all licence requirements.The co-pilot had not been able to clear his latest IR-PPC check. While this is not an out of the ordinary occurrence, pilots have to mandatorily undergo corrective training and get their proficiency rechecked to a satisfactory level of performance before they can fly again. In this case, however, the Airbus A320 co-pilot operated a flight without the same and the lapse is learnt to being viewed very seriously by authorities.On this issue, an AI spokesperson said: “An instance of a first officer operating a flight after an unsatisfactory recurrent training check was detected by the training team.As soon as the error came to our notice, a crew scheduler and the pilot involved were off-rostered. Strong disciplinary proceedings have been initiated and the same has been duly reported to the regulator, DGCA.”In the other case, a senior commander was the pilot-in-command of an A320 flight despite a lapsed ELP licence. A valid ELP is among the requirements mandatory for pilots to exercise the privilege of their licence, or in simple terms fly.On this issue, AI said: “An instance of a senior pilot operating a flight with a lapsed ELP licence was detected. As soon as the error came to our notice, the senior pilot involved was off-rostered and the matter is being investigated. The same has been duly reported to the regulator, DGCA.”Senior pilots say these lapses raise questions over the oversight in AI to ensure only fully compliant pilots are rostered to operate flights.Just a week after the June 12 Ahmedabad crash, the DGCA had found serious issues with AI rostering. While ordering immediate removal of three senior officials increase of crew scheduling following “lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements,” the DGCA had warned AI that “any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable. ”Basically, the regulator had gone to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses on crew scheduling continue.The June 20 DGCA order on the three officials had said: “Repeated and serious violations voluntarily disclosed by Air India concerning flight crew being scheduled and operated despite lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements… point to systemic failures in crew scheduling, compliance monitoring, and internal accountability.”",A co-pilot and a senior captain have been taken off flying duty after the airline found they operated a flight each last month with a lapsed English Language Proficiency licence.

“Even Trump Doesn't Know...”: Army Chief on Rapidly Evolving Security Challenges

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Saturday addressed a gathering in his hometown Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, where he reflected on Operation Sindoor , spoke about the future of warfare, and even took a dig at US President Donald Trump over his unpredictable statements and recent claims about mediating peace between India and Pakistan.Speaking at an event at TRS College, General Dwivedi highlighted the uncertainty and complexity of emerging global challenges. He said, ""... Future challenges are coming. They're instability, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity... You and I are completely clueless about what the future holds.""He then added, ""What is Trump doing today? I think even Trump doesn't know what he is going to do tomorrow. Challenges are coming so quickly that by the time you try to grasp an old challenge, a new one emerges, and the same security challenges our military faces. Whether it's on the border, terrorism, natural disasters, or cyber warfare. The new things that have started: space warfare, satellites, chemical, biological, radiological, and information warfare. The way rumours are spread. As you heard in Operation Sindoor, Karachi has been attacked. So much such news came, which seemed like news to us too. Where did it come from, who did it?... In the scope of all these challenges, you have to work on land, sky, water and all three...""Speaking to reporters in Rewa, General Dwivedi asserted that India only destroyed terrorist infrastructure in the neighbouring country.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan. The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended on May 10 with an understanding to stop military actions.Also read: Foreign policy reset under Trump 2.0?

""We attacked places that had the presence of terrorists. We did not target innocent civilians or defence installations. We achieved our goal in Operation Sindoor and sent a message to Pakistan that we are not like them,"" he said, adding that no action was taken during prayers or namaz.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he negotiated a peace deal between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. India, however, has consistently refuted these claims, maintaining that all issues concerning Jammu and Kashmir are strictly bilateral and that no third-party mediation is acceptable.","Upendra Dwivedi spoke at an event at TRS College in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.

Government to issue bus safety checklist for RTOs after fire incidents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-issue-bus-safety-checklist-for-rtos-after-fire-incidents/articleshow/125021736.cms,"Hyderabad-Bengaluru Bus Tragedy: 20 Passengers Burnt Alive in Minutes, Andhra CM Naidu Orders Probe

NEW DELHI: As most sleeper coaches and long-haul buses remain outside the ambit of the mandatory Bus Body Code that came into effect in September 2025, providing an easy escape for operators and local transport authorities, the government is set to issue a mandatory checklist of safety features that regional transport offices (RTOs) must verify while renewing registration and fitness certificates.Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari this week held a meeting on the recent bus fire incidents in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, and directed officials to take necessary steps, including writing to state govts for stricter enforcement and compliance of notified norms by transport departments.TOI has learnt that the checklist — aimed at preventing mishaps like fires and ensuring faster evacuation of passengers in emergencies — will include provisions such as a minimum 450 mm passageway, at least four emergency doors, fire-resistant electrical equipment and wiring, two fire extinguishers, a fire detection and suppression system (FDSS), and hammers at each berth to break glass windows during emergencies.Sources said other items on the checklist include provisions for fixing yellow reflective tapes along the edge of the passageway and retro-reflective tapes on all borders of the inside face of emergency doors.While several of these provisions — forming part of the Automotive Industry Standards — were notified in phases since 2016 and came into force after March 2017, their enforcement remains a challenge.Officials added that since these norms are already in place, and with additional requirements such as mandatory emergency lighting of the passageway and removal of partition doors between driver and passenger sections from July this year, these features can be included in the checklist for older buses when they come for fitness tests and renewal of registration.Compliance with the Bus Body Code was voluntary before Sept 2025, and RTOs granted permissions based on self-declarations submitted by body builders claiming adherence to the norms. However, from Sept onwards, all fully built buses with seating capacity exceeding 22 passengers require type approval from govt-recognised testing agencies, and self-certification is no longer permitted.Meanwhile, in an appeal, the Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India (BOCI) urged its members not to shy away from taking responsibility for fire incidents by giving lame excuses, but instead to take immediate corrective measures. “If we don’t take due care of passenger safety, the survival of private bus operations — and of sleeper coaches in general — will be at risk,” BOCI chief Prasanna Patwardhan said, appealing to members to adhere strictly to the Bus Body Code and ensure full compliance with all legal requirements.New model of buses & trucks to have Advanced Driver Assistance System from 2027All new model buses and trucks will need to have Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) from Oct 2027 and existing models will need them from Jan 2028. ADAS will include features such as automatic emergency braking system, driver drowsiness alert system and lane departure warning system. These changes aim to prevent crashes by alerting drivers and applying brakes if there is a delay in their response.","Most sleeper coaches and long-haul buses remain outside the ambit of the mandatory Bus Body Code that came into effect in September 2025.

JAMMU: The special NIA court in Jammu has granted a 45-day extension to the probe agency to complete its probe into the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that had left 26 people dead, most of them tourists.Additional sessions judge Sandeep Gandotra passed the order on Friday after public prosecutor (PP) Chandan Kumar Singh, appearing for NIA, told the court that the investigation was at a “crucial and sensitive stage” as key forensic and electronic reports were still awaited.The agency also sought an extension of judicial remand of two Anantnag residents, Bashir Ahmad Jothatd and Parvaiz Ahmad, who were arrested on June 22 and are currently lodged in the district jail in Jammu. The plea was also granted.The agency argued that the accused must be confronted with the forensic findings before the charge sheet is filed.Defence counsel Ashwani Kumar argued that the NIA had already been given sufficient time but had failed to establish any direct evidence against the accused.After hearing both sides, the court observed that the investigation was being carried out in a proper and professional manner and that the complexity and sensitivity of the evidence justified an extension under Section 43-D(2)(b) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.","NIA granted 45-day extension to complete probe into April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. 26 people were killed in the attack, most of them tourists.

In many districts, camel carts and horse carts are still used for transporting food grain to mandi (wholesale markets),"" Sunil Ghiya, joint director of animal husbandry, told TOI.Ghiya also refuted social media claims of a horse being sold for over a crore rupees, confirming the most expensive horse was sold for Rs 4.6 lakh by Kailash, a resident of Amber near Jaipur, to one Dilip Choudhary of Haridwar in Uttarakhand.The lowest price for a camel was Rs 8,000, sold by Hasan Khan of Jaisalmer's Sam area to one Banwari of Tonk. The shift in livestock sales is attributed to the advent of modern farming equipment, which has reduced the necessity for bulls in agriculture.""Bulls are no longer used for agricultural purposes with the availability of advanced tractors and other equipment. Also, it is unsafe to purchase cows or buffaloes from such fairs due to the risk of attacks on vehicles transporting them.

With no prior approval, temple overwhelmed by festival crowd





How a 94-yr-old man’s mini-Tirupati shrine turned into a site of death





SRIKAKULAM: A stampede at a privately run temple in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh killed nine devotees - eight women and a 13-year-old boy - and left more than 25 injured Saturday morning, after a railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi. The toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured is critical.The Venkateswara Swamy temple, located at Kasibugga under Palasa mandal and modelled on the Tirumala shrine in Tirupati, was built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda from Odisha and opened just four months ago. One gate serving both entry and exit, poor crowd control, and lack of official clearance turned the pilgrimage into chaos. ""Nobody is responsible - it was an act of god,"" Panda said.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said the main sanctum sits on the first floor with about 20 steps leading to it.""A railing along the staircase, believed to be poorly constructed, collapsed and caused a person to fall, triggering panic as the packed crowd surged forward,"" he said.Calling the deaths ""extremely heart-breaking"", CM N Chandrababu Naidu said: ""Had police been informed in advance, they could have implemented a crowd management plan.Those responsible will face action.""Srikakulam: The Venkateswara Swamy temple at Kasibugga, visited by around 3,000 devotees on Saturdays, saw a crowd nearly seven times that number on the day of the stampede as it was the first Karthika Ekadashi since the temple's inauguration. With no prior approval for the gathering or adequate security, the few guards were overwhelmed.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said temple authorities failed to alert police or the district administration about the festival and the likely crowd. Police have registered a case under section 100 (culpable homicide) of BNS and detained four temple staff for questioning. The shrine is not registered with Andhra endowments department, which oversees thousands of temples statewide.""Everything looked fine around 9am, but suddenly the number of devotees surged. The narrow stairway was choked. I was nearby when the railing broke and people started falling over each other,"" said R Ramanamma, a devotee.The deceasad were E Chinnammi (46), R Vijaya (48) from Tekkali; M Neelamma (60) from Vajrapukotturu; D Rajeswari (60), G Rupa (50), B Brunda from Mandasa; Ch Yasodamma (56) from Nandigam; D Ammulamma from Kasibugga; and L Nikhil (13) from Sompeta. Two women - B Kalavathi and R Kumari - remain critical. ""I have instructed officials to ensure treatment for the injured,"" CM Naidu said. PM Modi said he was ""pained"" by the tragedy. ""I pray that the injured recover soon,"" he said, announcing Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to each victim's family and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Saturday's crush was the third major temple tragedy in Andhra this year.Faith met fury of fate Saturday morning at Kasibugga in Srikakulam when a temple born of one man’s devotion turned into a site of death. Nine devotees were crushed to death at Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple, built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda, reports Umamaheswara Rao.Panda, originally from Odisha, had dreamed of building the shrine after an “unsatisfactory” darshan at Tirupati a decade ago. His mother Hari Vishnupriya had urged him to build a temple of their own. That suggestion became a mission. On 12 acres of family land, Panda created a near-replica of Tirumala — complete with rituals, architecture, and traditions — to bring Lord Venkateswara closer to devotees of north coastal Andhra and southern Odisha.The temple, locally known as ‘chinna-Tirupati’ (mini-Tirupati), opened four months ago. It was built entirely with Panda’s own funds — no donations, no trustees. The 9ft single-stone idol of Lord Venkateswara was carved in Tirupati and dominates the sanctum. Hundreds of other divine idols dot the complex, blending Odisha’s sculptural style with south Indian temple design.But on the temple’s first major festival — Karthika Ekadasi — devotion overwhelmed design. The Ekadasi tithi began at 9.10am, and within minutes, volunteers were overrun.Beyond the temple, Panda is known for quiet philanthropy — feeding hundreds of poor and differently abled people weekly, funding pensions and arranging transport from Palasa railway station to his orchard for Monday meals. Panda said, “I built this temple to offer devotees peaceful and free darshan of Lord Venkateswara, not to witness such deaths.”","A railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.

Andhra Tragedy Sixth Incident This Year

NEW DELHI: Stampedes, categorised as avoidable accidents, have claimed at least 114 lives so far this year, marking the second-highest toll in recent years. In 2024, at least 123 people lost their lives in such incidents, with the crowd crush in Hathras, UP, alone accounting for 116 deaths at the end of a satsang conducted by self-styled godman Narayan Sakar Hari.The stampede at the Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, was the sixth such incident this year. Experts have often pointed out that the absence of proper crowd control mechanisms, poor communication, and inadequate emergency response systems aggravate such situations. Authorities frequently underestimate the expected number of attendees, leading to overcrowding and chaos.There have been five major stampedes that occurred earlier this year. On January 29, during the Mahakumbh, 30 people lost their lives. On February 15, at the New Delhi Railway Station, 18 people died in a stampede. In North Goa's Shirgao village, seven devotees were killed when lakhs had gathered to participate in the annual Lairai Jatra at the Shree Lairai Devi Temple. On June 4, 11 fans died and several others were injured in a stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru, during celebrations of RCB's maiden IPL win.The most recent tragedy occurred in Karur, Tamil Nadu, where at least 39 people died during a rally organised by Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) president and popular actor Vijay.","The stampede at the Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, was the sixth such incident this year.

NEW DELHI: At least nine devotees, including eight women and a 13-year-old boy, died and several others were injured after a stampede broke out at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple—popularly known as Chinna Tirupati—in Kasibugga town of Srikakulam district on Saturday morning.According to official reports, the incident occurred around 11:45 am when an estimated 15,000 devotees gathered for Ekadashi darshan at the newly constructed temple, which was inaugurated just four months ago.The temple, privately managed and not registered under the Endowments Department, reportedly had the same route for entry and exit.As per news agency PTI, police said the stampede occurred after an iron railing near the temple steps collapsed due to crowd pressure, triggering panic among devotees.Srikakulam SP KV Maheswara Reddy stated, “It is purely an accident and due to the owner’s mistake. They haven’t applied for police bandobust; there were no permissions also.”Kasibugga DSP Lakshman Rao said, “The public, in fear, thought that something was falling and panicked. They fell from a height of about six feet. There was no stampede.”Seven devotees died on the spot, while two succumbed to their injuries at the Community Health Centre, Palasa.Fifteen people were shifted to the hospital; three remain in serious condition and ten are stable.The deceased have been identified as Eduri Chinnami (Rameswaram), Rapaka Vijaya (Pittalasaria), Muripinti Neelamma (Dukkavanmipeta), Duvvu Rajeswari (Belupatiya), Chinni Yosodamma (Sivarampuram), Rupa (Guddibhara), Lotla Nikhil (13, Benkili), Dokkara Ammulamma (Palasa-Kasibugga), and Bora Brunda (Mandasa).Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed grief over the tragedy, calling it “extremely heartbreaking.”In a post on X, he said, “The stampede incident at the Venkateswara Temple in Kasibugga in Srikakulam district has caused a shock. The death of devotees in this tragic incident is extremely heartbreaking. I have instructed the officials to provide speedy and proper treatment to those who have been injured.”He also ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed district officials to supervise relief operations.Also read: Andhra Pradesh tragedy: Video shows moment panic erupted at Venkateswara Swami temple Deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan expressed profound grief and announced that the state would strengthen crowd management across temples, especially on spiritually significant days.“It is extremely tragic that nine devotees lost their lives… The fact that a child was also among them has deeply shaken us,” he wrote on X. “The government will take all possible measures to ensure that the injured receive the best treatment… I request the administrative machinery to regulate the crowds of devotees at temples across the state during spiritually significant days.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “pained by the stampede” and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.“My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover soon,” he said on X.President Droupadi Murmu said she was “shocked to learn about the loss of lives,” while Vice President CP Radhakrishnan wrote, “Deeply pained by the tragic stampede… My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured.”Andhra Pradesh minister Nara Lokesh said that the tragedy at the Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Kasibugga was the result of an unplanned congregation of devotees, most of whom were visiting the temple for the first time.“Majority of the pilgrims who came here are first timers… It was a slow congregation that resulted in a large group. It was a very unplanned congregation,” he said.Lokesh added that the government will now frame new Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) not only for temples under the Endowments Department but also for privately managed shrines.“We will devise ways to better monitor and ensure the quality of construction,” he stated.Former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy accused the government of negligence, saying, “This repeated loss of innocent lives reflects the inefficiency of Chandrababu Naidu’s administration.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also expressed deep sorrow and urged the state to “mobilise every resource for relief and to engage with the victims’ families with empathy, dignity, and speed.”Authorities have launched an inquiry into the tragedy, and additional police have been deployed at the temple site to manage the situation.","At least nine devotees, including eight women and a 13-year-old boy, died and several others were injured after a stampede broke out at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple.

He made the announcement during a special assembly session convened to mark the state’s 69th formation day.Congress-led opposition, however, walked out of the House, terming the declaration a politically motivated “hoax”, made without any scientific basis.The CM said the Left govt had through a meticulous process identified 64,006 extremely poor families and lifted them out of abject poverty through micro plans. He added that successive govts had contributed to this achievement over time.Vijayan said the accomplishment marked a major milestone in the march towards creating a new Kerala. “Every Kerala Piravi Day (state foundation day) is celebrated with joy. However, this year’s Kerala Piravi Day marks a new dawn. Today, Kerala makes history by becoming the first Indian state without extreme poverty. The eradication of extreme poverty was a major decision taken at the first cabinet meeting after the new (Left) ministry was sworn in in 2021,” the CM said.The project began with the identification of beneficiary families “through a comprehensive participatory process”.“This list was presented in Gram Sabhas, from which 1,03,099 individuals from 64,006 families across 1,032 local bodies were identified as extremely poor, “ the CM explained.“Food, health, housing, and income were considered as the distress factors for identifying the extremely poor. Subsequently, micro plans were prepared for each family,” he added.For the financial years 2023–24 and 2024–25, Rs 50 crore each was allocated for the project and Rs 60 crore for 2025–26. “These funds were utilised for healthcare, housing and livelihood support...,” Vijayan said.Among the 64,006 families, 4,677 families required homes, which were built under the LIFE Mission, the CM said. Similarly, 2,713 families were first provided land and then assistance for house construction.","Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared Kerala free of extreme poverty.

"Opened after 54 years, Banke Bihari treasury reveals dust, raises doubts; SC-appointed panel is now auditing assets of temple",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opened-after-54-years-banke-bihari-treasury-reveals-dust-raises-doubts-sc-appointed-panel-is-now-auditing-assets-of-temple/articleshow/125027537.cms,"SC-Appointed Panel Is Now Auditing Assets Of Temple

MATHURA: The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries-old offerings, was opened last month after 54 years on the orders of an SC-appointed panel tasked with overseeing the temple's financial, structural and administrative functioning. But what emerged from the vault shocked many: one gold and three silver bars and utensils. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit, covering bank deposits worth up to Rs 400 crore, sealed lockers, land holdings and donation records - as questions mount over where the ""missing treasure"" is.Like on every Dhanteras, on Oct 18, the priest lit a small earthen lamp and placed it at the foot of the door of the treasury. The wood had darkened, carvings dulled, a panel eaten halfway by termites. No key had survived and a metal cutter was brought in. Snake catchers moved in first as forest officials stood by with oxygen cylinders. Behind the panels - sealed for more than five decades - lay the toshakhana.When it opened, there was no gold crown as expected. Or a gemstone necklace. Just a long wooden box containing a single gold bar and three silver bars streaked faintly with vermilion.Around them, there were brass utensils, wooden trays, and layers of dust so thick that one official described it as ""undisturbed for generations"". The chamber yielded no spectacle. But what it did offer was unsettling - the near-total absence of any official record of what had once been kept there: no donor register, no inventory, no valuation documents, and no reconciliation with decades of temple offerings.The toshakhana, last opened in 1971, had been spoken of for years in reverent tones - a place where ornaments, royal gifts from Bharatpur, Karauli and Gwalior, land deeds and handwritten letters were believed to lie, donated by kings and commoners to ""Thakurji"". Instead, the inventory was strikingly thin and sparked disbelief among devotees, demands for a CBI probe from locals, and a quiet but unmistakable scrutiny of the shrine's financial history.As of now, the items found in the toshakhana have not been formally valued, though they have been sealed. No FIR has been filed, and no report has been made public. ""The audit is on. This is the first official attempt to document the temple's assets,"" said a senior official associated with the panel. ""We don't have the full inventory yet. Even the panel is trying to find out. A CA firm has been appointed.""Banke Bihari temple, founded in 1864 by followers of saint and musician Swami Haridas, receives some 50,000 visitors a day - a number that rises to several lakhs on festivals and auspicious days. Yet unlike temples in the south, whose wealth was historically documented and regulated under systems of royal patronage and formal audits, Banke Bihari has evolved with a structure rooted in tradition rather than regulation. Offerings - jewellery, land, cash - have come in over generations, but few comprehensive records exist to track them.Among devotees, reactions have been mixed. ""My devotion is to the deity, not to any treasure,"" said Ramesh Patel, a Surat-based cloth trader who visits Vrindavan two or three times a year. ""Yes, I too was expecting something spectacular. But I am not disappointed. We hope all the assets will eventually be documented."" Others, however, have gone further. Dinesh Falhari, a local, has written to PM Narendra Modi seeking a CBI probe. Several residents in the vicinity have echoed the concern.The committee, chaired by retired HC judge Ashok Kumar, was formed after a series of PILs raised concerns over crowd management and administrative lapses. The recent vault opening has prompted the panel to expand its scope and begin a full structural and financial audit - the temple's first.As per official estimates, the temple holds between Rs 350 to 400 crore across over 10 bank accounts in Mathura and Vrindavan, most currently in Multi-Option Deposit form - a product that offers lower interest rates than fixed deposits. The panel has directed that these accounts be converted into FDs for better returns and asked bank officials to submit details of the temple's funds and their status.The audit has also raised questions about assets held outside the temple premises. While members of the Goswami community - hereditary sevayats who manage rituals and daily operations - acknowledge that jewellery had once been deposited in SBI's Mathura branch, there is no documentation on when this was done or what was deposited. ""Still not with us,"" said the official. ""The Goswamis say the jewellery is there. But no order to open the lockers has been given yet. We don't have a list of items, and there is no record of valuation.""There is no exhaustive list of temple-owned land, income from leases, or encroachment details. Officials have said that the local tehsildar and SDM have been asked to retrieve land records from around the temple. The temple manager has also been asked to prepare a consolidated report of all bank accounts, financial assets and donation receipts before the panel's next meeting on Nov 19.Within the sevayat community, there is growing discomfort over public speculation around the temple's finances. ""People are comparing Banke Bihari with temples in the south,"" said Shailendra Goswami, a member of the committee and part of the lineage of Swami Haridas. ""But those temples were built by kings. Our's was built in stages, in 1864, with around Rs 70,000 collected from devotees. Even the large Hindola (rocking cradle) was made from offerings. Some of Bihariji's jewellery is in the SBI branch - this has been shared with the committee. No one can make a single accusation against the priests.""Three of the four Goswami members who are part of the high-powered committee confirmed that their concerns had been placed on record at the committee's Oct 29 meeting. Among the issues discussed was the crowd situation and the perception being created around the vault opening. ""This is Bihariji's temple,"" one of them said. ""The service is done by love. Let them do their audit. We have nothing to hide.""","The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple was opened last month. It is believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries- old offerings. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125027574,imgsize-1634329,width-400,resizemode-4/banke-bihari.jpg"

Explosives Found Near Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's Event Venue In Bengaluru, Major Attack Foiled

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday accused the Centre of neglecting Kannada and imposing Hindi, while calling upon people of the state to oppose those who are “anti-Kannada.”“The federal government is meting out step-motherly treatment to Karnataka,” Siddaramaiah said during his address on the occasion of the state foundation day (Rajyotsava day) in Bengaluru.He charged that the state provides Rs 4.5 lakh crore revenue to the Centre, but “it is denied its rightful share and is given a paltry amount in return.”Stating that injustice is being done to Kannada, the chief minister said, “There are continuous attempts to impose Hindi. Grants are given for the development of Hindi and Sanskrit while other languages of the country are being neglected.”“Injustice is being done to the classical language Kannada by denying adequate funds for its growth. We have to oppose all those who are anti-Kannada,” Siddaramaiah said.Underlining the need to take Kannada language and its culture to new heights, the chief minister said the neglect inflicted upon Kannada in education has caused many problems.Also read: From IT to AI: Karnataka unveils vision to make Kannada future-proof in AI era “Children of the developed nations think, learn and dream in their mother tongue but here the situation is against it.

MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk. After my discussions are over, I will come out myself. I am not alone. I have more people with me. Many people have similar problems as mine. And I am going to give this solution only by talking. Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"". He added, ""We are preparing the youth of Bihar to win medals in the 2036 Olympics that will happen in India.""","Amit Shah takes 'Italy' Jibe at Rahul Gandhi after Cong MP Targets PM Modi over Chhath 'Nautanki' He asks voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124980899,imgsize-681244,width-400,resizemode-4/lkn-35.jpg"

Bengaluru Road Rage Horror: Delivery Boy Chased, Crushed To Death By Martial Arts Trainer Couple

Victim Darshan

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





BENGALURU: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister. His family is demanding strict action against the accused.","Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

Hostage Drama At Powai Studio: Mumbai Police Rescues 17 Kidnapped Children, Accused Killed

NEW DELHI: Panic gripped Mumbai's Powai area on Thursday after a man identified as Rohit Arya allegedly took 19 people hostage, including 17 children, a senior citizen and one unidentified man, inside RA Studio.Arya later died after being injured in the chest during a police crossfire. The senior citizen was also hurt in the exchange and was rushed to Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Hospital for treatment, as per reports.Mumbai Police teams, including senior officers and a quick response unit, rushed to the spot after receiving information about the standoff.

Man behind Mumbai hostage scare sat on hunger strike over Rs 2 crore govt dues; new details emerge According to police, Arya had released a video in which he demanded to speak to certain individuals and warned that he would harm himself and the children and “set everything on fire” if prevented.The standoff ended after a police inspector forced entry into the studio and seized an airgun and some chemical from Arya’s possession, Powai police said.Joint Commissioner of Police (L&O) Satyanarayan Chaudhary said, “Prima facie, the motive behind the hostage act appears to be related to some pending work-related dues.”Police said the incident was reported around 1.45 pm, when a distress call from the studio prompted teams from Powai and Sakinaka police stations to rush to the spot.The children, aged between 13 and 17 years, had reportedly travelled from different parts of Maharashtra to attend an audition for an ad shoot being held at the studio.Officials had described the accused as mentally unstable and said they acted swiftly to defuse the situation. Police confirmed that all the children were rescued safely and have been handed over to their parents.The captor, Rohit Aarrya, a social entrepreneur & project management consultant, owned a company that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile shows he was an alumnus of Symbiosis and ISB-Mumbai.Three years ago, he launched a ‘Swachhata Monitor’ in various schools across the state.The next year, he sat on a hunger strike against the then education minister Deepak Kesarkar alleging non-payment of Rs 2 crore dues.","A man identified as Rohit Arya allegedly took 19 people hostage, including 17 children, a senior citizen and one unidentified man.

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

"“A sad, pathetic, nobody loser”: Swifties unleash fury on Kayla Nicole after Halloween stunt reignites drama with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-sad-pathetic-nobody-loser-swifties-unleash-fury-on-kayla-nicole-after-halloween-stunt-reignites-drama-with-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift/articleshow/125027091.cms,"Kayla Nicole's Halloween costume and song choice sparked outrage among Swifties, who interpreted it as a jab at Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Fans accused Nicole of jealousy and obsession, viewing her post as a deliberate provocation. This incident highlights how quickly fandoms punish perceived slights, even years after a breakup.

Social media turns explosive as Swifties label Kayla Nicole’s post a jealousy-driven move

The engagement, the album shockwave, and the ongoing stakes

The Taylor Swift–Travis Kelce era continues to command every corner of pop-culture conversation, but this Halloween, the spotlight unexpectedly shifted back to someone outside their circle — Kayla Nicole. While Swift’s fanbase has been riding a high since the tight end announced his engagement to the music superstar in August, Nicole’s Halloween Instagram activity has reopened old wounds and reignited an internet tug-of-war.Swifties saw her Toni Braxton costume and the music choice attached to it, not as nostalgia or simple creativity, but as a targeted jab at the newly engaged couple. And in an entertainment environment where narrative, timing, and symbolism matter just as much as actual words, that single video triggered a wildfire reaction online, one that shows how rapidly fandom culture punishes perceived provocation.Kayla Nicole posting herself dancing to “He wasn’t man enough” may have felt harmless or playful in her own lens, but Taylor Swift ’s fanbase did not view it through that filter. They instantly connected dots to Travis Kelce, dissected the timing, and responded aggressively. Many comments were brutal, including “Remember when in this video Travis specifically told her “none of you are getting married” and she still pathetically posted this? She’s a sad, pathetic, nobody loser.”Fans argued this wasn’t just a costume; it was narrative warfare. One user doubled down, writing “Kayla Nicole is embarrassing lol. Her being THIS obsessed with Taylor and Travis three years after the breakup is not the flex you all think it is. However, being the woman who gets the ring two years in is.”For fans, Kelce has long moved on and so should she.Swift dropping “The Life of a Showgirl” only amplified tension. “Opalite”, though never directly naming Nicole, was broadly interpreted by fans as a lyrical slap. Nicole herself admitted she feared reaction to it. That vulnerability now contrasts strangely with this latest costume-driven provocation.Meanwhile, Kelce is simply focused on Buffalo. With 474 yards and three touchdowns, the tight end continues to be a centerpiece in Kansas City’s offense and the Swift-Kelce machine looks fully locked on the future, not the past.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s choreographer exposes her past struggles — from stage anxiety to finding confidence with Travis Kelce by her side","Kayla Nicole's Halloween costume and song choice sparked outrage among Swifties, who interpreted it as a jab at Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.

What It Means for Atlanta

Thecould be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring. A trade for Skubal, whose projected market value hovers around $400 million, would form a dominant rotation trio alongside Chris Sale and Spencer Strider, instantly elevating the Braves’ World Series aspirations.Heading into 2026, Atlanta Braves’ front office - led by Alex Anthopoulos - is expected to focus heavily on both the bullpen and starting rotation. The bullpen remains the team’s most pressing concern after inconsistencies during key moments of the 2025 season.One key decision involves reliever Tyler Kinley, who emerged as one of the most reliable arms for the Atlanta Braves last year.“So far, he’s proved to be a steal. In 21 games pitched since coming to Atlanta, Kinley has a 0.41 ERA and a 0.73 WHIP over 22 innings of work. He’s averaging nearly a strikeout per inning as well. It was a low-risk gamble that brought high reward,” wrote SI’s Harrison Smajovits. (H/t: Sporting News)For just $6.5 million, the Braves have the opportunity to retain a quality late-inning option. If Kinley continues his impressive form, this decision could be one of the most cost-effective bullpen moves of the offseason.While bullpen reinforcements are vital, the Braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for Tarik Skubal, one of MLB’s most dominant starting pitchers. Skubal has just one year of team control remaining, which could make him available if the Tigers look to maximize his trade value before free agency.HTHB’s Eric Cole highlighted the potential challenge and magnitude of the move: “Okay, this is the big one and also the toughest one to pull off. The Braves want starting pitching depth and there is a good chance that soon-to-be multiple Cy Young winning Tarik Skubal is available in the right trade.”Cole also suggested that a trade package similar to the one used to land Kyle Tucker last offseason could be a realistic starting point for negotiations.Here’s the revised and properly formatted table you asked for:While such a deal would come at a steep cost, the payoff could be enormous. Adding Skubal would immediately create one of the most fearsome pitching rotations in the league.If the Atlanta Braves were to acquire Skubal, their projected top three starters would be:1. Tarik Skubal – Cy Young contender, elite left-hander2. Chris Sale – Veteran ace with championship pedigree3. Spencer Strider – Strikeout machine and franchise cornerstoneAtlanta would be a nightmare for opposing hitters thanks to this trio's ideal combination of power, experience, and left-right balance.For General Manager Alex Anthopoulos, landing Tarik Skubal would be a career-defining move - one that could be remembered for years in Atlanta Braves history. It would not only reinforce the team’s championship window but also address the long-term stability of the rotation as veterans age.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $150 million Philadelphia Phillies star to bolster team and title chances As Eric Cole summarized, this would be “the toughest one to pull off,” but it’s exactly the kind of bold decision that could make the Atlanta Braves unstoppable in 2026 and beyond. If Anthopoulos pulls the trigger, this could be remembered as the defining trade that set the stage for another Braves dynasty.","The Atlanta Braves could be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring.

“Hailee gotta sue”: Stephen A. Smith under fire after bizarre Hailee Steinfeld comment during Josh Allen segment triggers explosive fan outrage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/hailee-gotta-sue-stephen-a-smith-under-fire-after-bizarre-hailee-steinfeld-comment-during-josh-allen-segment-triggers-explosive-fan-outrage/articleshow/125015642.cms,"Stephen A. Smith's comment about thinking of Hailee Steinfeld while watching Josh Allen during a First Take segment sparked significant backlash. Despite his clarification that he was referring to her talent, viewers criticized the remark as inappropriate and a distraction from football analysis, highlighting the importance of professional boundaries in sports commentary.

Fans believe Stephen A. Smith crossed a professional boundary and they said so immediately

THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING for the Bills 🧐 Stephen A.'s thoughts ahead of Chiefs matchup | First Take

Meanwhile, Josh Allen continues to build his new era with Hailee Steinfeld

ESPN’s First Take rarely goes quiet but Thursday morning’s segment ahead of Week 9’s Bills vs Chiefs matchup became one of those moments where a single line from Stephen A. Smith completely hijacked the conversation. Viewers have gotten used to fiery debates between Smith, Shannon Sharpe and the rest of the table, but this time the noise wasn’t about red-zone numbers or defensive matchups.It centered around one sentence involving Hailee Steinfeld . Smith wasn’t breaking down Buffalo’s red-hot offense. He wasn’t comparing Allen to Mahomes. He openly admitted that when he watches the reigning MVP, “Everytime I see him, I'm thinking about his wife, Hailee Steinfeld.” The Internet didn’t just pause, fans unloaded.Yes, Stephen A. Smith clarified himself. He said it was about Hailee Steinfeld's talent, not attraction, “What an actress,” he insisted, praising her performance in ""Sinners"" and calling her “special.” But social media didn’t soften.Fans went straight to the comments, and their wording was brutal and unfiltered. One fan commented, “Thinking about someone wife is diabolical.”Another wrote, “Wild compliment of Allen's wife.” A third chimed in, “Every time you hear Josh Allen you think about his wife lmaoo yoo and then tried to qualify it bc her acting stop it.” A fourth commented, “The shout out to Josh Allen's wife was really weird.” A fifth wrote, “Hailee gotta sue at this point. ”This wasn’t the fun kind of NFL banter. Fans argued that even with context, the comment created a misalignment Smith was reducing an MVP segment into a punchline about his spouse.Allen proposed to Steinfeld in November 2024. They married this past March. She has been a consistent stadium-side presence this season and his box score doesn’t lie: 1,560 passing yards, 12 TDs, 261 rushing yards, 5 rushing TDs through seven games.Allen recently said, “Maybe that I am more than a football player,” explaining how marriage reset his perspective. Sports talk culture loves a viral moment, but this one wasn’t the kind Smith wanted. Fans made one thing clear: the line between sports analysis and personal commentary still matters.Also Read: Is Hailee Steinfeld’s marriage to Josh Allen already hitting rough waters?

Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchens-post-divorce-evolution-raises-question-did-tom-brady-underestimate-what-letting-her-go-would-cost-him/articleshow/125015224.cms,"Years after her separation from Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen's life has demonstrably recalibrated, not just continued. Reports indicate she has blossomed, building a fulfilling routine focused on inner alignment rather than external expectations. Her lifestyle and confidence have reportedly strengthened, showcasing a reclaiming of identity rather than reinvention, proving her purpose was never tied to public couple status.

Gisele’s lifestyle, confidence and routine were reportedly strengthened — not shaken — after the divorce

The narrative shift matters — she wasn’t rebuilding her identity, she was reclaiming it

Time has a way of revealing whether a celebrity breakup was simply messy or genuinely transformative and in Gisele Bündchen’s case, years have now become proof. What once dominated headlines in 2022, her separation from Tom Brady, has shifted into something that looks far more layered, intentional and emotionally mature than a typical high-profile divorce cycle.Back then, the story was framed as a stunning split between America’s NFL dynasty couple. Today, the story is clearer: her life did not just “continue,” it recalibrated. And according to PEOPLE reporting at the time, she “has blossomed” and built a full routine that has more to do with inner alignment than industry expectations. The split did not stall her, it rerouted her life into a more self-defined lane.In 2022, a PEOPLE insider had said she was “secure and happy, and so busy with her life that she doesn’t have time to dwell on the negatives out there.” That sentiment aged well. Even as public curiosity swirled around her outings with Joaquim Valente, her jiu-jitsu instructor, PEOPLE’s reporting noted it was a “close relationship, but not a serious love affair.”Translation: she wasn’t chasing distraction. She was centering herself.Bündchen’s own framing in earlier interviews backed that philosophy. She emphasized that authenticity requires partnership alignment, not emotional containment.Those quotes read differently now, almost like a foreshadowing of the version of herself she eventually grew into.The last few years proved that her sense of purpose was never tied to public couple status. The yoga retreats, the Gaia Herbs projects, the moments she chose to stay out of Hollywood red carpets and instead walk her dogs, these weren’t signs of avoidance. They were recalibration rituals.Long before the culture moved on from Brady’s retirement and roast-night headlines, she had quietly moved on from needing to be understood. She entered her 40s without panic, she entered them with permission.Not reinvention. Re-alignment.Also Read: “Obsessed with that kid kissing”: Tom Brady banned jokes about his son but let comedians roast Gisele Bündchen during Netflix roast","Gisele’s lifestyle, confidence and routine were reportedly strengthened — not shaken — after the divorce.

NEW DELHI: The last Indian warship to be built abroad, a 3,900-tonne multi-role stealth frigate packed with sensors and weapons like the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, will be commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia on July 1.The Navy currently has 59 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards at an overall cost of around Rs 1.2 lakh crore to add to its expanding blue-water combat capabilities.It also has the initial approval or ‘acceptance of necessity (AoN)’ for indigenous construction of another 31 warships, including big projects for nine diesel-electric submarines, seven new-generation frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare corvettes.“The force has fully transformed from a `Buyer’s Navy’ to a `Builder’s Navy’ over the years. There is no plan for an Indian warship to be constructed abroad in the future,” a senior officer told TOI.The Navy, which currently has 140 warships and submarines along with over 250 aircraft and helicopters, plans to expand to around 180 warships and 350 aircraft and helicopters by 2030.This is crucial for tackling the rapidly-growing maritime collusiveness between China, which has the world’s largest Navy with 370 warships but is currently constrained by the `tyranny of logistics’ in the Indian Ocean Region, and Pakistan.China is also helping Pakistan to augment its naval capabilities, with the latter on course to induct eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines with air-independent propulsion in a major capability jump.The 125-metre long INS Tamal, with extended endurance, a top speed of over 30 knots and a crew of 250 sailors, will be commissioned at a ceremony presided over by western naval command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay J Singh in Kaliningrad.India in Oct 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two to be imported for around Rs 8,000 crore. The other two, Triput and Tavasya, in turn, are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore.The first frigate, INS Tushil, reached her home port of Karwar from Russia in February. These four new warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted from 2003-2004 onwards.Designed for blue-water operations across the spectrum of naval warfare in the four dimensions of air, surface, underwater and electromagnetic, these frigates are armed with a wide array of advanced weapon systems. “INS Tamal has significant upgrades over her predecessors, punching well above her weight,” an officer said.Apart from BrahMos missiles, the frigate has Shtil vertical launched surface-to-air missiles, an improved A190-01 100mm gun and a new age electro-optical/infrared Sandal V system. She is also equipped with a 30mm close-in weapon system, heavyweight torpedoes, urgent attack anti-submarine rockets, apart from various surveillance and fire control radars and systems.“Kamov-31 early-warning and Kamov-28 multirole helicopters can also operate from her deck. The combat capability is augmented by a host of network-centric warfare capabilities, including the latest SATCOM, radio, high-speed data link, and advanced electronic warfare suite,” the officer said.","The 125-metre long INS Tamal, with extended endurance, a top speed of over 30 knots and a crew of 250 sailors, will be commissioned at a ceremony presided over by western naval command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay J Singh in Kaliningrad. “INS Tamal has significant upgrades over her predecessors, punching well above her weight,” an officer said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014589,width-400,resizemode-4/122014589.jpg"

CHENNAI/ BENGALURU: An IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai with 168 passengers on board made an emergency landing at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) in Bengaluru on Thursday night after the captain gave a ‘Mayday’ (distress) call due to insufficient fuel.The pilot of IndiGo flight 6E-6764 (A321), which took off from Guwahati at 4.40pm, attempted to land at Chennai around 7.45pm, but decided to ‘go around’ after the landing gear touched the runway in a procedure called ‘balked landing’. “About 35 miles from Bengaluru airport, the captain made a ‘Mayday’ call,” said a source familiar with the development.The source said it appeared to be an ‘unstabilised approach’. “The sudden and steep climb had many passengers on the edge of their seats, some visibly frightened,” said a passenger who did not wish to be named.Multiple sources at the airport and ATC confirmed that the pilot did not attempt a second approach, he instead decided to fly to Bengaluru.Sources in KIA said: “After getting the distress call, the ATC alerted the on-ground staff members who swung into action. Medical and fire services personnel were in place. The aircraft landed safely at 8.20pm.”A source said both the pilots have been taken off the roster, but IndiGo refused to confirm the information.The airline said the flight was diverted to Bengaluru because of traffic congestion at Chennai airport – a claim that Chennai ATC disputed.“It appears that the plane, after the ‘go around’, did not have the mandatory minimum diversion fuel’,” said a source. IndiGo refused to confirm if the pilot made the ‘Mayday’ call.After landing at Bengaluru at 8.20pm, the crew announced that the flight would leave for Chennai after refuelling.

Poll Should pilots have more stringent regulations regarding flight duty times? Yes, for safety No, current regulations are sufficient

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered the removal of three Air India officials who are incharge of crew rostering following “lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements”. AI has been warned that “any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable” — basically the regulator has warned going to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses on this crucial front continue.In response to the order, Air India said: ""We acknowledge the regulator’s directive and have implemented the order. In the interim, the company's Chief Operations Officer will provide direct oversight to the Integrated Operations Control Centre (IOCC). Air India is committed to ensuring that there is total adherence to safety protocols and standard practices.""The DGCA has also issued a showcase to the airline for operating two flights — Bangalore-London on May 16 & 17 — by making pilots fly for longer than the 10 hours that was allowed as per flight duty time limitation (FDTL) dispensation given to AI at that point of time.The June 20 order on the three official says: “Repeated and serious violations voluntarily disclosed by Air India concerning flight crew being scheduled and operated despite lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements. These violations were discovered during review (in crew rostering platform transition). The voluntary disclosures, while noted, point to systemic failures in crew scheduling, compliance monitoring, and internal accountability. Of particular concern is the absence of strict disciplinary measures against key officials directly responsible for these operational lapses.”The order says the three identified senior officials “have been involved in serious and repeated lapses including but not limited to: Unauthorised and non-compliant crew pairings; Violation of mandatory licensing and recency norms; Systemic failures in scheduling protocol and oversight.”The regulator has directed AI to “remove (these three) from all roles and responsibilities related to crew scheduling and rostering. Internal disciplinary proceedings must be initiated against these officials without delay, and the outcome of such proceedings shall be reported to this office within 10 days from the date of issue of this letter. The (three) officials shall be reassigned to non-operational roles pending conclusion of corrective reforms in scheduling practices, and shall not hold any position involving direct influence over flight safety and crew compliance until further notice. Any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations detected in any post-audit or inspection, will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable.”Apart from this order, the DGCA on June 20 also issued a showcase to AI for violating FDTL norms for pilots of two Bangalore-London flights on May 16 and 17. “Accountable manager has failed to ensure adherence,” the notice while seeking a response within seven days.Comments have been sought from AI on both these issues and are awaited.","The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered the removal of three Air India officials who are incharge of crew rostering.

NEW DELHI: In a shocking incident, a woman's body was discovered buried in front of her residence, allegedly killed by her in-laws who concealed the crime for nearly two months by filing a missing person report. The victim, Tannu Kumar from Shikohabad in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh , was married to Arun Singh from Roshan Nagar two years ago.The victim's father, Hakim, claimed that despite his suspicions about a freshly covered pit observed during his visit to his brother-in-law's residence, the police initially dismissed his concerns.Four family members have been charged at Palla Police Station: Bhoop Singh (from UP's Mainpuri), his wife Sonia, son Arun Singh, and daughter Kajal. Sources indicate that Bhoop Singh and Arun Singh are currently under police interrogation.Police investigations reveal that on April 23, Arun Singh and his father arranged for an earthmover to dig a 10-foot deep pit outside their house. The following day, they had a mason fill it. Subsequently, they reported Tannu as missing, describing her as mentally challenged.Hakim stated that his daughter endured dowry-related harassment, forcing her to stay at her parents' home for a year post-marriage.Despite a panchayat's intervention facilitating her return to Faridabad, the issues persisted.Upon learning of his daughter's disappearance, Hakim visited Bhoop Singh's residence with his other daughter, Preeti, where he noticed the suspicious pit. Despite multiple visits to the local police station, his pleas for investigation were ignored until recently.The authorities excavated the pit on Friday morning in the presence of Naib Tehsildar Jaswant Singh, recovering Tannu's remains. A Faridabad Police spokesperson confirmed ongoing raids to apprehend the remaining family members. Following a post-mortem at Badshah Khan Civil Hospital, the body was released to the family.","Tannu Kumar from Shikohabad in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh, was married to Arun Singh from Roshan Nagar two years ago.

For the last 2-3 days, the entire Congress party kept saying that Pakistan's army chief general Asim Munir is going to the US.This was a trap by Pakistan,” Dubey told ANI.“People across the country turned the opposition to Modi into opposition to the country. Today, it is known that the White House or the US military never called Asim Munir.

It must be an embarrassment to any country that the military chief gets invited and the prime minister is nowhere to be seen,” Singh said.“It’s a very strange thing... It’s a weird, structurally imbalanced state where the military essentially has first claim on resources.”His remarks come amid growing global scrutiny of Pakistan's internal power dynamics and its military’s central role in foreign policy.On India’s recently concluded Operation Sindoor , Singh revealed that the Pakistani military faced “manifold” losses in terms of both men and material compared to India.“In terms of both assets, material and casualties, the losses on their side are manifold, anything that we have suffered,” he said.Singh also commented on speculation about Chinese support to Pakistan during the operation. While ruling out direct involvement, he hinted at indirect assistance.“Collusion in terms of equipment, supplies, helping them out in various ways, perhaps with satellite imagery as well — all that could have happened, but definitely they did not take any active role,” Singh said.“Trust is low… Pakistanis don't have many resources, so they will do all this begging, borrowing, etc., to get equipment from wherever they can, whether it is Turkey or China.

Let’s use our water for ourselves first,” Omar said when asked about the Centre’s proposal for a 113-km canal to redirect surplus waters from Indus, Jhelum and Chenab to Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.Shah had announced the canal plan in Madhya Pradesh’s Pachmarhi on June 14 against the backdrop of the Centre putting Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan “in abeyance” in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack.Speaking on the sidelines of an outreach office’s inauguration in Jammu on Friday, Omar made it clear that he would not allow any proposal to build a canal and divert surplus water to other states. “I am not going to give approval. Let us be allowed to use our water first, then we will talk about others,” the J&K chief minister said.Among the three states mentioned in the water-sharing plan, the CM specifically questioned Punjab’s inclusion.“Why should I send water to Punjab?

The allusion was to Mehbooba’s term as chief minister in coalition with BJP from 2016 to 2018.Omar pointed out that a cabinet sub-committee set up by his government had submitted its report on reservations and the law department was examining it.Asked if his govt would move Supreme Court to have J&K’s statehood restored, Omar expressed hope that PM Narendra Modi and the Centre would stand by their commitment on such a move. “Will see whether we have to go legally or not for statehood but till then, we are waiting for the Prime Minister and home minister (Shah) as they have assured that statehood will be restored,” the CM said.","“I will never allow this (divert water from J&K to other states) Let’s use our water for ourselves first,” Omar Abdullah said.

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, on Saturday renewed his attack on the Election Commission, questioning its transparency and alleging a deliberate attempt to destroy crucial poll-related data. The poll body reacted saying that making webcasting footage of polling stations public violated privacy and security concerns of voters.""Voter list? Will not provide machine-readable format.

Citing a possible scenario, officials further said that if a political party received fewer votes at a specific booth, it could use CCTV footage to identify who voted and who didn’t—potentially leading to targeted harassment or intimidation of those individuals.They clarified that the Election Commission retained CCTV footage, used solely as an internal administrative tool, for 45 days in line with the legal window for filing an election petition. Since no election can be challenged beyond this period, they argued that keeping the footage any longer could lead to its misuse by non-contestants to spread misinformation or malicious narratives. They added that if an election petition is filed within 45 days, the footage is preserved and made available to the competent court upon request.The government, last year, amended election rules, based on the EC's recommendation, to restrict public access to certain electronic records—such as CCTV and webcast footage—to prevent misuse. In a May 30 letter, the EC informed state officials that multiple recording methods, including photography, videography, CCTV, and webcasting, are used to document the election process.","Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, renewed his attack on the Election Commission, questioning its transparency.

MUMBAI: A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan 's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand, on Friday following a complaint about coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violations during renovation of the property.The property comprises Mannat, a heritage structure, and an annex structure, a multi-storey building. As Khan and his family have shifted to a nearby place due to the renovation, the officials were met by his staff who told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.Pooja Dadlani, Khan's manager, said ""There are no complaints. All work is going on as per guidelines.""The property is undergoing renovation, and clearances were earlier sought from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for it.

The Act restricts property transactions in designated areas and mandates the district collector's permission for transactions.Dholkawala continued to face opposition in the neighbourhood as some of the residents challenged the sale to a Muslim and demanded its cancellation. The residents contended that allowing a Muslim to buy property in the area could lead to polarisation and disturb demographic equilibrium.In Feb 2023, HC rejected their petition and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on each of the two litigants hounding the owner and ""thwarting his attempt to enjoy the fruits of the property which he successfully purchased"". An appeal against this order was also dismissed.However, the locals still did not allow Dholkawala to use the shop. They allegedly dumped debris at its gate so that it could not be opened.

NEW DELHI: Wildlife scientists while enumerating snow leopards in India during the last population assessment used a smart trick to make the elusive big cats in the high and rugged Himalayas pose in front of cameras and get their foreheads having distinctive patterns, akin to human fingerprints, photographed.They used a scent, which only had a localised effect, in luring and making a snow leopard bend down and expose its forehead to the appropriately positioned camera trap, according to a recent study that explained the methodology adopted to count the big cats, nicknamed “ghost of the mountains”.It was done by spraying a small amount of perfume just below the cameras that were deployed near their favoured scent marking rocks on high-ridge tops, said the authors of the study published last month in the open-access journal PLOS One. They added that once the curious leopards lower their heads to smell, the enumerators got their prized-unique picturesThough the snow leopard population assessment in India was done during 2019-23 and the counting figure, total 718 in India, was released last year, the scent lure method was revealed in the study by Pankaj Raina from the Ladakh wildlife protection department and co-authors, including senior wildlife scientist at the Indian national science academy, Yadvendradev V Jhala, and others from the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India.""We identified individual snow leopards through their unique forehead pattern,"" said the authors while underlining that every camera trap photograph was geotagged and stamped with the time and date information in the metadata.""The photo-captured species were identified using an AI-based software programme, CaTRAT, customised to identify Himalayan species. The identified species were subsequently validated by biologists,"" they said.The counting figures, released in 2024, show the highest number, 477, of snow leopards in Ladakh out of total population of 718 in India. Among the remaining ones, 124 snow leopards are in Uttarakhand, 51 in Himachal Pradesh, 36 in Arunachal Pradesh, 21 in Sikkim and 9 in Jammu & Kashmir.Covering approximately 1.2 lakh sq km, the counting exercise was conducted using a meticulous two-step framework. The first step involved evaluating snow leopard spatial distribution while the second step involved estimation using camera traps in each identified stratified region. During the exercise, camera traps were deployed at 1,971 locations, including 956 in Ladakh.","Scientists used a scent, which only had a localised effect, in luring and making a snow leopard bend down and expose its forehead to the appropriately positioned camera trap.

The children were rescued by a collective of voluntary organisations in collaboration with authorities.The highest number of rescue operations (23,530) were related to child labour, followed by cases of sexual exploitation (2,766), and begging (1,092). Telangana reported the highest number of child labour rescues (11,063), followed by Bihar (3,974), Rajasthan (3,847), Uttar Pradesh (3,804), and Delhi (2,588). As many as 2,971 children were rescued from sexual exploitation, with West Bengal standing out at the top with 1,005 rescues followed by Bihar (454), Odisha (232), Maharashtra (194) and Rajasthan (191).The report, prepared by voluntary organisation India Child Protection, has drawn from data gathered by Just Rights for Children, a civil society network of over 250 organisations in across 26 states and UTs working in coordination with law enforcement agencies to combat child labour and trafficking as an organised economic crime.Focusing on how prosecution acts as a tipping point to end child labour, the report highlighted that legal action taken in 27,320 operations, showed that in majority of cases that is 35% (9,595) FIRs were registered - seen as a the most critical step in ensuring that those who are exploiting are prosecuted. In another 25% (6,959) cases were filed as General Diary entries, which are initial police records.In addition, around 23% of legal actions involved orders from child welfare committees (CWCs) or were filed under Form 17 of Juvenile Justice Rules, both of which focus on immediate care, protection and rehabilitation of rescued children. In 14% cases, challans were issued by labour departments, mainly in cases of child labour, serving as administrative penalties. The report said a very small proportion (less than 1%) were orders from district magistrates or sub-divisional magistrates, and only about 2% of cases had no clear legal action recorded.Just Rights for Children national convener Ravi Kant said despite gaps, prosecution action, crucial in creating strong deterrent against trafficking and child labour, is getting stronger in India.The report also highlighted that 5,809 employers and traffickers were arrested as part of these rescue operations and 85% of these were in child labour-related cases. Telangana, Bihar and Rajasthan reported the highest arrests, while states like UP and MP had fewer arrests despite high rescue numbers - highlighting enforcement gaps. The report also draws attention to missing children data, citing that is not uncommon for children classified as missing to be subsequently rescued from exploitative labour situations.Nearly 11,409 missing children were identified by the civil society network in 11,068 FIRs over 2024-25. Of them, 8,749 children were reported to be traced by March-end this year. States such as West Bengal (3,509), Maharashtra (1,149), and Bihar (1,306) reported the highest rescues of missing children, pointing to active coordination with child tracking systems.","Nearly 90% of the 44,902 children freed from the clutches of exploitation in over 27,000 operations between April 2024 and March this year were rescued from child labour.

But since we have to keep in mind the interests of all stakeholders, especially users, we are sticking to the Aug 15 timeline,” a top NHAI official said.NHAI has monetised its projects through three models — Toll Operate Transfer (TOT), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and securitisation.The official added that work on the annual pass scheme had started months back and all implications have been worked out, based on past toll collection data.

Shashi Throor’s son Ishaan among staff sacked by Washington Post; pens sombre note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-throors-son-ishaan-among-staff-sacked-by-washington-post-pens-sombre-note/articleshow/127922743.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

The Washington Post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation which includes shutting down its current Sports Desk and scaling back its international reportage footprint. According to Fox News, about a third of the organisation’s workforce has been affected, close to 300 people.Ishaan Tharoor, foreign affairs columnist at The Post and son of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, is among journalists laid off as part of a major restructuring at the US newspaper that has sharply reduced its international coverage.Tharoor said he was “heartbroken” after being laid off, sharing the news in a post on X on Wednesday. “I have been laid off today from the Washington Post, along with most of the International staff and so many other wonderful colleagues,” he wrote.“I’m heartbroken for our newsroom and especially for the peerless journalists who served the Post internationally – editors and correspondents who have been my friends and collaborators for almost 12 years. It’s been an honour to work with them,” Tharoor added.In a separate post, Tharoor described it as “a bad day,” sharing a photograph of an empty newsroom.He also reflected on launching the WorldView column in 2017, saying it had been an honour to help readers make sense of global affairs and thanking the column’s roughly half a million subscribers.Several senior journalists and foreign correspondents confirmed their exits on social media.Will Hobson, an investigative reporter focused on sports, said on X: “Some personal news: I’m among today’s Washington Post layoffs. It was a dream 11-year run as an investigative reporter focused on sports.”Gerry Shih, the Post’s Jerusalem bureau chief, said he was laid off along with much of the Middle East team and international staff across regions. “I’m gone along with the rest of the ME team and the majority of teammates from Delhi to Beijing to Kyiv & Latam,” he wrote, calling it a “sad day.”Cairo bureau chief Claire Parker said the entire roster of Middle East correspondents and editors had been affected. “Hard to understand the logic. But I am grateful for my incredible colleagues,” she wrote.Other journalists impacted include Visual Forensics staffer Nilo Tabrizy, Ukraine correspondent Lizzie Johnson, and Berlin bureau chief Aaron Wiener, who said the Post had decided to eliminate its Berlin bureau. Johnson said she was “laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”National culture writer Jada Yuan and national politics reporter Brianna Tucker also spoke publicly about the layoffs, highlighting the personal and professional toll. “Thinking about my colleagues on the foreign desk living in war zones,” Yuan wrote.Former executive editor Marty Baron described the developments as among the most troubling in the newspaper’s history. “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organisations,” Baron was quoted as saying by The Wrap.Reports have also said the cuts include the closure of the Books section, the cancellation of the Post Reports podcast, and further reductions in Metro and international coverage.The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The Washington Post Guild, which represents staff, issued a statement urging Bezos to continue investing in the paper’s journalistic mission. “Without the staff of The Washington Post, there is no Washington Post,” the union said.","The Washington Post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation.

M R K Panneerselvam sparks row with ‘North Indians clean tables’ in Tamil Nadu remark; BJP hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/panneerselvam-sparks-row-with-north-indians-clean-tables-in-tamil-nadu-remark-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/127922094.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday hit out at a Tamil Nadu minister over remarks about North Indian migrant workers, accusing the ruling DMK of repeatedly targeting migrants and fuelling social divisions in the state.The BJP was reacting to comments made by DMK agriculture minister M R K Panneer Selvam at a party event in Chengalpattu, where he referred to North Indians working in low-paying jobs.""People from the North are coming here to clean tables, engage in construction works, sell pani puri. Because he learnt only Hindi and had no job opportunity there, he has come here,"" the minister said.In a post on X, the BJP said the remarks were derogatory and reflected a broader pattern within the DMK.""At a party event in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, DMK agriculture minister Shri MRK Panneer mocked North Indian migrants as “table cleaners and pani puri sellers.” In today’s India, people from every state work everywhere - North, South, and across the world. No job is small. No citizen is inferior,"" the party said.The BJP alleged that such comments were particularly dangerous at a time when incidents of violence against migrant workers were being reported in Tamil Nadu.""This isn’t an isolated slip; it’s a pattern. DMK leaders have repeatedly derided migrant workers, especially for being North Indian or for speaking Hindi. At a time when violence against innocent migrant workers in Tamil Nadu is rising, such statements are reckless and dangerous, branding an entire community as “low standard” and fuelling hate on the streets,"" the post said.The party also questioned the silence of leaders from the opposition INDI alliance over the controversy.""Now a direct question to the INDI alliance: if you claim to stand for unity, human dignity, and social justice, why this deafening silence? Is alliance compulsion more important than national unity? Do Shri RahulGandhi, Priyanka Gandhi , Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav endorse this hatred by staying quiet? Is this your idea of justice which is dividing Indians for votes? Complete shame!"" the BJP said.There was no immediate response from the DMK or the leaders named by the BJP on the issue.Meanwhile, Tamilnadu BJP president in a post on X said, ""Leaders of Arivalayam who incite hatred against North Indians!Even as attacks on North Indians are already rampant under the DMK regime, I strongly condemn the Minister of DMK, Mr. MRK Panneer,for mocking them at a meeting held in Maduranthakam in Chengalpattu district by saying, “North Indians come to Tamil Nadu only to sell pani puri, work in construction, or wipe tables.” The DMK Minister must immediately seek a public apology from the people for his arrogant speech.In our Tamil land, which has upheld equality and brotherhood through the life philosophy of “Yadhum Oore, Yaavarum Keleer,” it is not only deplorable but also dangerous that DMK leaders continue to sow seeds of hatred against North Indians. Do the Congress and Communist parties, as alliance partners of DMK, endorse this divisive politics of the DMK, which strives to divide people ethnically into North and South?In our Bharat, which shares a unified cultural heritage “from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari,” the people will uproot and cast away this venomous creeper called DMK—which toils to seize power and authority by using North Indian people as scapegoats—in the upcoming Assembly elections!""",The BJP was reacting to comments made by DMK agriculture minister M R K Panneer Selvam at a party event in Chengalpattu.

NEW DELHI: Breast, cervical and ovarian cancer cases have risen steadily in India over the past five years, with deaths also increasing, according to new government data tabled in Parliament — underscoring the growing burden of cancers that largely affect women and the urgency of early detection.Figures from the National Cancer Registry Programme show breast cancer cases rose from about 2.13 lakh in 2021 to nearly 2.4 lakh in 2025. Cervical cancer cases increased from around 77,000 to over 79,000, while ovarian cancer cases climbed from about 45,000 to nearly 49,500 over the same period.Deaths have followed a similar upward trend. Breast cancer deaths increased from about 91,700 in 2021 to over 1.03 lakh in 2025. Cervical cancer deaths rose from roughly 41,500 to nearly 42,800, and ovarian cancer deaths from about 27,600 to more than 30,000 in five years.Large states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka reported the highest absolute numbers of breast and cervical cancer cases, while northeastern states including Assam, Mizoram and Manipur continued to show disproportionately high cervical cancer rates relative to population size.The data was shared by the Union health ministry in response to a Rajya Sabha question. Officials said the rise reflects both an increasing disease burden and improved detection through expanded screening.Oncologists said the figures point to gaps that still need urgent attention. Dr Pragya Shukla, head of clinical oncology at Delhi State Cancer Institute, said the data reinforces the need to accelerate screening, HPV vaccination, timely referral and affordable treatment, warning that gaps in awareness and early care continue to drive avoidable deaths.To address the trend, the Centre said it is strengthening cancer care under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. At present, 770 district NCD clinics, 364 district day-care cancer centres and over 6,400 NCD clinics at community health centres are operational nationwide, with 297 more district day-care cancer centres approved for 2025–26.Population-based screening for people aged 30 years and above is being scaled up for early detection of breast and cervical cancer. The ministry said 19 State Cancer Institutes, 20 Tertiary Cancer Care Centres and cancer facilities across 22 new AIIMS are also part of the expansion.","Figures from the National Cancer Registry Programme show breast cancer cases rose from about 2.13 lakh in 2021 to nearly 2.4 lakh in 2025.

NEW DELHI: In a suspected case of road rage, a 36-year-old businessman has died after allegedly being beaten with a helmet by two food-delivery riders during a brawl in Connaught Place last month. Police have arrested the two men.The deceased, Shivam Gupta, lived with his parents in Laxmi Nagar and ran a construction business with his brother-in-law. The incident occurred in the early hours of Jan 3 when Gupta, returning from a party with a friend, was walking near the Rajiv Chowk metro station in the E-block parking area.Police said he brushed against the handle of an approaching bike, leading to an argument, after which the accused allegedly assaulted him with their helmets and fled, leaving him bleeding on the pavement.Gupta, critically injured, underwent multiple medical procedures across hospitals and briefly showed signs of recovery before he died on Jan 19.His father, Anil Kant Gupta, who runs garment shops, said CCTV footage shown to him by police featured three men — a detail also recorded in the FIR. However, officers told him only two men were directly involved in the assault and have been arrested, while the third allegedly handed over the helmet used in the attack.Distraught, the father said, ""All I want is that no innocent man is punished and no guilty man walks free."" Fighting back tears, he added, ""My son was known to make peace between people. He never instigated anyone. He was on a call and simply tried to block a bike coming towards him… and they attacked him.""He added that his daughter had moved out after her marriage, and Shivam's death has now left the elderly couple alone with no one to look after them.","Shivam Gupta, 36, died after allegedly being beaten with a helmet by two food- delivery riders.

PUNE: Political analyst Tehseen Poonawalla on Tuesday alleged that his mother, a senior citizen, was deliberately hit by a car in an hit-and-run incident in Pune, leaving her seriously injured and requiring surgery.Sharing CCTV footage of the incident on social media platform X, Tehseen said his mother had stepped out for a drive with his driver and executive assistant and was standing by the roadside while the car was being refuelled when a vehicle allegedly struck her and fled the spot.“My mom, a senior citizen, went for a drive with my driver and executive assistant and was waiting on the side while they were tanking up gas in our car. Someone just hit her (seems deliberate) and ran away,” he wrote.In a later update, Tehseen said he had spoken to senior police officials, including the Joint Commissioner of Police and the Deputy Commissioner of Police, adding that his mother would have to undergo hip surgery and would require a rod for life.“Mom will have to undergo hip surgery and a rod for life.

PRAYAGRAJ: After decades of waiting, Dhani Ram finally won his freedom in his 100th year. Allahabad high court last month acquitted the Hamirpur native, convicted in 1984 for a 1982 murder tied to a property feud.Though sentenced to life, he was released on bail that same year, spending 42 years waiting for finality while his appeal crawled through the docket.A division bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Sanjiv Kumar, in a 23-page ruling dated Jan 21, tore into contradictions they found in the prosecution’s case — from unreliable testimony of two eyewitnesses to omissions in FIR and what the court called “inherent improbabilities.”With main accused Maiku absconding since 1982 and allegedly the one who fired the fatal shot, the judges said the prosecution had failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.When a person stands before the court at the twilight of existence, the insistence on penal consequences, after decades of procedural delay, risks transforming justice into a ritual divorced from the purpose it intends,” the bench wrote, adding that prolonged anxiety, uncertainty and social fallout “cannot be ignored” when deciding what justice now requires.Dhani Ram and co-accused Satti Din had been convicted under IPC sections 302 read with 34 for accompanying Maiku during the killing.Satti Din died during his own pending appeal, leaving Dhani Ram the lone surviving appellant.His counsel said he was only accused of exhortation, not firing any shot. State counsel opposed the acquittal.The Allahabad high court ruled that the benefit of doubt must go to the centenarian. With acquittal granted, his bail bond stands discharged.","Allahabad high court last month acquitted the Hamirpur native, convicted in 1984 for a 1982 murder tied to a property feud.

NEW DELHI: As India is finalising the details of its trade deal with the US, a report suggested that the Narendra Modi-led government was willing to wait out US President Donald Trump 's term for the trade agreement and Washington was also informed of the same.According to a report by news outlet Bloomberg, national security adviser Ajit Doval held a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in September last year and told him that India won't be bullied by Trump or his top aides.Doval told US officials that the Modi government was willing to wait out Trump's term, having faced other hostile US administrations in the past.Doval also told Rubio that New Delhi wanted Trump and his aides to dial down their public criticism of India so they could get relations back on track.This comes after the US President announced a trade deal with India on Monday, slashing tariffs from 50 per cent to 18 per cent.“It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi, of India, this morning.

Doval also told Rubio that New Delhi wanted Trump and his aides to dial down their public criticism of India.

There’s LOC against Anil Ambani, court told

NEW DELHI: Industrialist Anil Ambani on Wednesday gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court through his lawyer that he would not flee India pending court-monitored CBI and ED probes into alleged siphoning of Rs 40,000 crore from loans availed of from banks.With petitioner EAS Sarma’s counsel Prashant Bhushan apprehending that given the spread and size of the fraud, the principal accused may leave the country, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said, “We don’t want any such thing to happen.”When the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing both CBI and ED, to take preventive steps to ensure that investigation into the alleged fraud was not impeded, Mehta said that there was a look out circular (LOC) against Ambani, indicating that any attempt to flee the country would be foiled at the airport.Ambani’s counsel Mukul Rohatgi said, “There are many LOCs against him. But in the last three years, two ADAG companies have paid back Rs 20,000 crore to the banks. If he was to flee the country, why would he repay such huge amounts?”When Rohatgi assured the SC that Ambani would not leave the country without prior permission of the court, Mehta cautioned Rohatgi and reminded him that despite similar undertaking given by him on behalf of another client, that person had fled the country.The bench recorded the SG’s assurance that “all preventive/remedial measures would be taken to ensure that the ongoing investigations are not impeded”.The bench took exception to CBI registering only one FIR on SBI’s complaint against ADAG and adding similar loan amount siphoning complaints from other banks and financial institutions to the SBI FIR.“Each loan taken is a separate agreement. The modus operandi may be similar but violation of each agreement is a separate offence. Why would CBI not register separate FIRs?” the bench asked. Mehta said CBI would examine this issue and register separate FIRs if needed.The bench also found it strange that CBI was awaiting sanctions to investigate bank officials who were in collusion with ADAG officials in the alleged defrauding of banks through siphoning of loan amounts. It directed CBI to investigate all such bank officials involved in the crime, ignoring any legal impediment on that score. The SC said it would continue to monitor the CBI and ED probes and asked the two agencies to file a fresh status report in four weeks.The petition, filed through advocate Pranav Sachdeva, alleged that ADAG companies — Reliance Communications , Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom — cumulatively received loans of Rs 31,850 crore from a consortium of public sector banks led by State Bank of India between 2013-17.SBI’s deputy GM Jyoti Kumar registered an FIR on Aug 21 alleging “conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal misconduct by Reliance Communications, Anil Ambani and other individuals resulting in a loss of Rs 2,929 crore”, the petitioner said, adding that the FIR was based on the report of a forensic audit of financial transactions of the three ADAG companies for the period 2013-17, which was commissioned by SBI in 2019.The ED, in its affidavit, informed the SC that it has so far registered three PMLA FIRs (ECIRs) against ADAG companies, searched 46 premises, issued 305 summonses, attached 204 properties worth Rs 12,000 crore and arrested four persons. Under Fema, it has attached properties worth Rs 78 crore, it said.","Anil Ambani gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court through his lawyer that he would not flee India pending court-monitored CBI and ED probes into alleged siphoning of Rs 40,000 crore from loans availed of from banks.

From Minerals Gift To Diplomatic Snub: Pakistan Misses Out On Key US Meet While India Takes Seat

The online reckoning

Why this cut so deep

PM Modi and Trump

The received wisdom in Washington circles has been that Pakistan has ‘played’ Donald Trump better than its Indian counterpart. This has included praising Donald Trump to high heavens at every turn, nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize with every breath, offering him (snake?) oil, and in general agreeing to anything including joining the Board of Peace.Perhaps, Pakistan felt it had returned to its older role of indispensable intermediary as New Delhi remained the insouciant child who refused to bow to Trump’s diktats. Overnight, the illusion shattered as Trump announced the US had reached a trade agreement with India lowering tariffs on India’s exports to 18%. While most of the details about the deal are still being worked out, that didn’t stop a full-blown meltdown on Pakistani (or South Asian) Twitter.One viral tweet summed up the mood: “Mover, shaker, and beggars.”That line became a shorthand for something deeper than trade arithmetic. The reaction in Pakistan was not about supply chains or tariff schedules. It was about hierarchy.The first wave of reactions was disbelief. Then came sarcasm. Then came something closer to anger, much of it directed inward. Pakistani social media users began listing, almost ritualistically, the many ways Islamabad had publicly courted Trump.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination resurfaced again and again, often framed as a punchline. So did Pakistan’s enthusiastic endorsement of Trump’s various peace initiatives and grand visions.A widely circulated post laid it out bluntly: Pakistan did everything to please Trump, including nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, joining his “Board of Peace”, and offering cooperation on minerals. Yet India, which spent months resisting Trump’s pressure, ended up with a lower tariff rate. To make matters worse, users pointed out, India had also just secured major trade concessions with the European Union.The tone shifted quickly from disbelief to gallows humour. One viral image showed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir holding up an AI-styled magazine cover featuring Modi and Trump, both leaders pointing at the image as if presenting evidence of a reality they could not alter. The accompanying Urdu caption roughly translated to: “Asim Munir is stuck between them… the world has moved on.”Across Facebook and Instagram, memes treated the 18% versus 19% tariff gap like a scoreboard. Comment threads were filled with variations of the same lament: how did bending over backwards still lead to being sidelined? Why did obedience not translate into leverage?Even YouTube reaction videos, often noisy and incoherent, showed an unusual convergence. Commenters questioned the entire premise of Pakistan’s Trump strategy. If this was the payoff for flattery, many asked, what exactly had been achieved?For months, Pakistan’s elite discourse had convinced itself that India-US relations were deteriorating while Pakistan-US ties were stabilising. Trump’s public irritation with India was misread as strategic rupture. Pakistan’s warmth was read as influence. Proximity was mistaken for power.The trade deal punctured that narrative decisively. What Pakistan’s discourse missed was that India’s apparent indifference was not neglect. It was posture.New Delhi did not merely refuse to flatter Trump; it actively declined to participate in his theatre. Reporting through last year showed that as tariff tensions escalated, India chose distance over desperation. At the height of the standoff, international media reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi declined to take multiple phone calls from Trump, an almost unheard-of move in the choreography of great-power diplomacy. Silence, in this case, was not accidental. It was communicative.That frostiness surfaced more clearly in what would become the last direct exchange between the two leaders. According to reporting by The New York Times, a June phone call turned sour when Trump claimed credit for de-escalating tensions between India and Pakistan and floated the familiar Nobel Peace Prize rhetoric. New Delhi pushed back firmly, insisting that India and Pakistan had managed matters bilaterally, without US mediation. After that call, the two leaders did not speak again for months.That, in hindsight, is what makes the trade deal so destabilising for Pakistan’s narrative. India did not win by courting Trump better. It won by not courting him at all.","Pakistan's elite discourse had convinced itself that India-US relations were deteriorating while Pakistan-US ties were stabilising.

IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

NEW DELHI: Two months after IndiGo ’s mass flight cancellation in the wake of non-compliance with flying time norms, Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday ordered a detailed probe into its alleged unfair business practices.It said the carrier enjoyed “a position of dominance” in the airline business, noting that it operated exclusively on 330 routes, had consistently had 60%-61% market share and a much larger fleet than its rival Air India.Bengaluru-based Kartikeya Rawal had moved CCI after his flight on Dec 5 last year was cancelled and alternative ones were available only at higher prices. He alleged the overcharging by IndiGo was “abuse of dominance”. The airline contested the claim, while arguing that CCI did not have jurisdiction in the case.“…IndiGo is a significant market player… (has) effective control over market capacity and supply-side conditions. The domestic passenger aviation market exhibits very high and increasing concentration, exhibiting leading firms possess the ability to operate independently of competitive forces, as the presence of effective rivals is materially constrained,” the regulator said in a 16-page order uploaded on its website.In 2025, IndiGo had 64% domestic market share, followed by Air India group with 27%, Akasa with 5.1%, and other smaller airlines the remaining 3.9%, according to DGCA data.“..IndiGo operates the largest fleet with over 400 aircraft, which is significantly higher than that of its nearest competitor, Air India, which operates a fleet of (about) 191 aircraft. Therefore, on the basis of substantial and sustained market share, wide network reach with exclusive operations on a significant number of city-pair routes, comparatively larger fleet and strong financial performance, the commission is of prima facie view that (IndiGo) enjoys a position of dominance in the relevant market,” CCI said.The order said “by cancelling thousands of flights constituting a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its service from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand. Such conduct by a dominant enterprise may be viewed as restricting the provision of services.”The order added passengers who had booked tickets were left with “no real choice but to accept last-minute cancellations. Further, passengers were left to seek alternatives, on their own, at significantly higher prices. Given IndiGo’s dominant position, consumers were effectively locked in and lacked viable alternatives which appears to be in violation of (rules).”Cancellation of flights and lack of alternatives for passengers seemed to be “prima facie causing an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. Thus, the Commission is of the opinion that a prima facie case of contravention of provisions is made out in the present matter.”","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered a detailed probe into IndiGo's alleged unfair business practices.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

SC asks govt to produce original files on Wangchuk’s detention

NEW DELHI: Observing that the medical condition of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk , who has been in detention for more than four months, is not very good, Supreme Court asked the Centre Wednesday to rethink/relook its decision to continue to keep him in custody, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.SC had earlier directed authorities to conduct Wangchuk’s medical examination by a specialised doctor and file a report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail. The medical report was placed before the apex court during the last hearing.Wangchuk was detained on Sept 26 last year under the National Security Act following protests in Leh over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh. SC is hearing the plea moved by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali Angmo against his preventive detention.Apart from submissions, counter submissions and law points, just give a thought to it, as an officer of the court. The detention order was passed on Sept 26, 2025, nearly five months have passed. Considering the health condition of the detainee… which is certainly not very good.There are certain age-related, may be otherwise. Is there a possibility for the govt to rethink, have a relook?” the bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale asked.Additional solicitor general K M Natraj told the bench he will take instruction and will brief the court on the next date of hearing.The bench also directed the govt to place before it original files related to Wangchuk’s detention and the process adopted by the govt. Nataraj submitted that the govt had nothing to hide, and will place the documents.The additional solicitor general submitted that the speech given by Sonam Wangchuk on Sept 24 last year was so provocative that it eventually led to the violent protest, which claimed the lives of four people.“Four people died in the incident, and 161 were injured. I will place the materials. Ultimately, it was his provocative speech, his instigation, which led to violence. The person needs not to be actively participating in it. It is the propensity of the person to influence the group of people or to commit somebody else to do a violent act which is relevant. That is more than sufficient for prevention detention,” he submitted.“It (NSA) is only a preventive law. It is only to prevent somebody from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or security of the state. Preventive detention is not punitive detention. It has to be necessarily left to the discretion of the executing authority. It is purely discretionary,” he said.Earlier, the govt had told the court that the activist was trying to create political and social turmoil and unrest in Ladakh, and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",SC had earlier directed authorities to conduct Wangchuk’s medical examination by a specialised doctor and file a report before it.

They also displayed a large banner which read ""Do what is right.""Subsequently, BJP MP Sandhya Rai, who was the acting speaker, adjourned the proceedings.While walking out of the Parliament, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra claimed that PM Modi did not arrive at the House because ""he got scared.""""He (PM Modi) got scared and that's why he did not arrive at the house...Union Railway Minister and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey ran away like a bullet train.""

JAMMU: A Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) commander was among three terrorists killed in separate gunfights with security forces in snow-covered forests of Udhampur and Kishtwar districts in J&K’s Jammu division Wednesday, officials said.Sources identified the slain JeM man as Rubani, alias Abu Mavia, though there was no official confirmation of his identity by authorities. Security forces launched a seek-and-shoot operation Tuesday in Jopher forest near Basantgarh — a mountainous area of Udhampur district about 65km northeast of Jammu city — acting on specific intelligence inputs.“Heavy exchange of fire rocked the forest around 4pm Tuesday when the terrorists attempted to break out of the cordon,” an official said. Reinforcements, including paratroopers and dog squads, were rushed in to seal escape routes across the rugged terrain.For several hours overnight, troops maintained a tight vigil using drones and ground surveillance before launching a final assault at daybreak. Both terrorists were killed in the morning operation, officials said.In Dichhar area of Kishtwar district, a suspected Pakistani terrorist was killed Wednesday evening in a running hunt across snowbound mountains.The Army’s White Knight Corps said on X the action followed renewed contact with terrorists on the run. Forces have pursued the group since Jan 18, when a clash broke out at Sonnar village near Mandral–Singhpora — hill hamlets south of Kishtwar town — killing a paratrooper and wounding seven soldiers. Terrorists slipped away through dense vegetation and broken ridgelines.Search teams had been combing Sanjinala–Dichhar axis inside Chingam forest, part of the Chatroo belt — a rugged stretch of terrain roughly 190km northeast of Jammu. The area has remained under deep snow for weeks.They were intercepted again several km away on Jan 22. Contact broke. Two more gunfights followed on Jan 26 and Jan 31 as snowfall crossed two feet across upper reaches, slowing movement but not search grids.","Sources identified the slain JeM man as Rubani, alias Abu Mavia, though there was no official confirmation of his identity by authorities.

We also sought dignified compensation for the families of those killed in the violence,” he said, adding that the discussions continued for about two-and-a-half hours. “We hope the next meeting will be held in 15 days.

Four protesters were killed in the firing. After the commission was set up, the LAB and the KDA agreed to begin talks with the Centre, leading to the Oct 22 meeting.Later, on Nov 14, the LAB and the KDA submitted a 29-page joint draft proposal to the home ministry seeking statehood and sixth schedule.

CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal

tells TOI . Excerpts:

What will be your strategy to achieve the target?

What kind of red flags?

What about widening the tax base?

What is the volume of data and how do you handle and ensure security of this data?

What would be the deadline for filing tax for a certain category of taxpayers?

How many taxpayers have shifted to the new tax regime?

There was some adverse market reaction on STT on the first day. Has that settled down? Will it be reviewed?

■ The target for the next year is based on a nominal GDP growth of 10%, and above that is tax buoyancy (tax growth as a ratio of GDP expansion). The tax buoyancy that is being projected is reasonable. Therefore, we should not find any problem in achieving that target.We have ushered in a lot of initiatives to bring in trust, and taxpayers are responding to it. There is greater focus on promoting better compliance because that means more conversion of data into revenue. If you can do that, it helps widen the tax base and also deepen it.We will have a new Income Tax Act, which is simpler. The sentiment will be positive and that will help bring more clarity into the processes and trigger higher compliance. We will notify rules and forms in Feb. It will simplify processes in the sense that forms will be made smarter and aligned with tax returns or audit reports to take care of disconnects and discrepancies, if any. It will be easy to identify red flags.■ Red flags like incorrect claims or not incorporating certain income. We have data and we can tally that. Analytics will help. The process will be strengthened. All this will send a strong message to the taxpayer community that you need to be consistent.That process has been initiated, and people are responding to it.■ When you talk about widening, there is also an element of deepening. Deepening is when I ought to report X, but I have reported X by 2. In that case, the return should reflect higher income than what has been shown. Widening is to expand base. It is not just about people who file returns, but also those who have paid taxes (via TDS or TCS) but did not file returns.There is a third category too: where you have certain information and those people have neither made a tax payment nor filed returns. You need to move scientifically; deep analysis has to be done, and where data is mature, you can act. Our NUDGE exercise is a step in that direction.We have got a very satisfactory response. In the last two years, 1.1 crore people have either updated their returns or revised them, yielding additional revenue of Rs 8,800 crore. Of this, Rs 1,750 crore are cases where refund claims have been reduced. All this has been done in a very non-intrusive way and based on data available with us. Widening and deepening depend on TDS outreach and data sharing among departments.■ There are 650 crore data pieces of transactions that the department handles on a yearly basis. We are in favour of getting more data. The department is only using data on transactions that have been done. The data is 100% secure and there is a process.■ Right now, for ITR 1 to 4 and part of ITR 5 that is not audited, the due date is July 31. For ITR 1 and 2, we will retain July 31, and for ITR 3 and 4, we will shift it to August 31. We often get complaints about bunching. This is how you stagger compliance and make it easier. We will allow taxpayers to revise till March.■ In assessment year 2024-25 (FY24), it was 76%, and in AY 25-26 (FY25), 88% of taxpayers moved to the new tax regime.■ The market shows that. There is nothing as of now.","Those using ITR 3 and 4, including bizmen, professionals, freelancers, will get extra month to file returns, with the deadline extended to Aug 31. The target for the next year is based on a nominal GDP growth of 10%, and above that is tax buoyancy (tax growth as a ratio of GDP expansion)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127921421,imgsize-49182,width-400,resizemode-4/cbdt-chairman-ravi-agrawal.jpg"

PUNE: As suspense over the merger of the two NCPs continues, family patriarch Sharad Pawar on Wednesday met late nephew Ajit Pawar ’s wife Sunetra Pawar at her residence in Baramati for the first time after she took oath as Maharashtra’s deputy CM.Amid reports of a division in the family, Pawar, Sunetra, her sons Parth and Jay, and other relatives held a closed-door meeting in their hometown late Wednesday, reigniting the reunification buzz. Pawar Senior and his wife Pratibha offered condolences to Ajit Pawar’s family, and together, they all met locals who visited them.The NCP (SP) chief had, a few days ago, made his disappointment clear as he said Sunetra did not consult him about taking up the deputy CM’s post last week. However, he told reporters in Baramati on Wednesday morning he supported her decision. “I am happy that she was given the opportunity.” Despite ill health, he spent the entire day in a series of meetings in Baramati. Among these were a closed-door meeting with Sunetra’s sons and Ajit Pawar’s sister, Vijaya Patil, on Vidya Pratishthan campus. Later in the day, key members of the Pawar family met at Sunetra’s residence.Pawar also chaired a meeting of the trustees of Vidya Pratishthan, of which he is president. Parth and Jay were also called for the meeting, where both were apprised of the functioning of Vidya Pratishthan in which Ajit Pawar was a trustee. There was also a primary discussion on Ajit Pawar’s proposed memorial, sources toldPawar returned to Baramati from Mumbai on Tuesday after cancelling his Delhi visit to participate in the budget session of Parliament. “Be it Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha or assembly, I was a member of these houses for 58 years. But, for the first time, I could not attend the Budget session due to the tragedy (Ajit Pawar’s death in a plane crash),” Pawar added.","Sharad Pawar met late nephew Ajit Pawar ’s wife Sunetra Pawar for the first time after she took oath as Maharashtra’s deputy CM.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine a public interest litigation challenging the decision of National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences to reduce the qualifying cut-off percentiles for NEET-PG 202526, which would allow even candidates with zero or negative scores to qualify.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Alok Aradhe issued a notice on the PIL and posted the case for Feb 6.The petitioners alleged that reducing the cut-off would affect patient safety, public health and the medical profession. They raised the point that the move, undertaken primarily to fill vacant seats, abolished merit as a criterion and converted a competitive examination into an administrative formality. They said medicine directly impacted human life, bodily integrity and dignity, and dilution of professional standards in the field was impermissible.Over 18,000 postgraduate medical seats across the country remain vacant.","Justices P S Narasimha and Alok Aradhe issued a notice on the PIL and posted the case for Feb 6.

NEW DELHI: A day after flagging the ‘reserve verdict-andforget about it’ ailment in the judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday took exception to long pendency of anticipatory bail and regular bail petitions in high courts and said the respective chief justices must ensure speedy disposal of matters relating to liberty.After learning that issues relating to bail and pleas for suspension of sentence after conviction were pending in HCs for months and getting routinely adjourned, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said, “We are extremely disappointed over the manner in which matters relating to personal liberty of individuals are dealt with by the HCs.”Though the malady pointed out related to Punjab and Haryana HC, the CJI recalled there had been earlier petitions seeking direction to high courts to expedite decisions on pleas seeking bail and, in some cases, directions were sought for urgent listing of such before HCs.The CJI said, “The delay in hearing the cases could be because of overflowing dockets or other matters requiring immediate attention of the judges, but nothing can be more important than deciding pleas for grant of bail.”The bench said, “It is equally disturbing to know that in Patna HC bail applications are not listed for hearing for months. We expect the CJs of the HCs to take some remedial measures...”The bench said this was happening despite the SC on many occasions indicating a timeline for deciding such pleas.“We are conscious of the fact that listing and prioritisation of hearing in cases is the exclusive prerogative of CJs, who are the masters of rosters,” the bench said, adding that in such situations, the SC had a bounden duty to lay down guidelines for expeditious hearing.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha, already deadlocked over Rahul Gandhi’s insistence on referring to an unpublished book, was plunged into deeper impasse on Wednesday as BJP MP Nishikant Dubey turned to a pile of books with uncharitable references to members of the Nehru-Gandhi family to “expose” Congress.PM Modi’s reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address had to be called off due to the stepped-up protest from the opposition.Dubey’s move was seen as BJP’s bid to turn the heat on Congress, which has been attacking Modi over bits of the unpublished book authored by ex-Army chief Gen M M Naravane (retd), and it further riled up the protesting opposition MPs in LS, who turned up the noise and tore papers, but not before the fourth-term member had his say for over a couple of minutes.TDP MP Krishna Tenneti, who was in the Chair, kept asking Dubey not to carry on and that his speech was against Speaker Om Birla’s ruling. “You listen to me. You cannot do this,” Tenneti said even as the BJP MP continued.The Chair later adjourned the House, but several opposition MPs questioned why Dubey was allowed to go on. Congress members later met LS Speaker Birla and demanded his suspension.The books Dubey mentioned included ‘Reminiscences of the Nehru Age’ by former private secretary to India’s first PM, M O Mathai; ‘Edwina and Nehru’, ‘Ceasefires’ and ‘The Red Sari’, and then touched on their content, including some controversial references to private lives besides allegations of corruption, amid furious protests.These books were either banned when Congress was in office or restricted to the extent that they were not available. “Since a book which is not published is being discussed, I want to speak about books which are full of stories of the corruption, deviousness, wanton indulgences and corruption of the Nehru family,” Dubey alleged, a charge he elaborated during a press conference later.Congress MPs, including Priyanka Gandhi, K C Venugopal and Deepender Hooda, urged Birla to suspend Dubey, and demanded that Rahul be allowed to speak before Modi’s reply on motion of thanks on the President’s address.Unrelenting protest from opposition members meant that Modi’s address scheduled for 5 pm was called off.In his comments to the media later, Dubey referred to more books, many of them he said were banned, to target Congress’s leading family over a host of allegations, including personal indulgences. This included ‘Himalayan Blunder’, a damning account of Indian leadership during the 1962 war with China which was banned, but became available later.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey turned to a pile of books with uncharitable references to members of the Nehru-Gandhi family to “expose” Congress.

NEW DELHI: Union minister and former Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and Rahul Gandhi got into a bitter exchange Wednesday, when the LoP mocked him as a “traitor” and a surprised Bittu retorted with a “desh ke dushman” barb.The exchange — which took place at the main entrance of the Parliament building, where Rahul was standing in solidarity with the eight MPs who are on protest since being suspended from the Lok Sabha a day earlier — was caught on video and promptly went viral. It was also circulated by Congress.While walking towards Parliament for morning proceedings, Bittu, grandson of former Punjab CM Beant Singh, who was killed by Khalistani terrorists, mocked the protesters “as sitting as if they had won a war”, which appeared to have annoyed Rahul and his colleagues.As he approached to walk past, Rahul said, “The thing is, here is a traitor walking right by. Take a look at the face. How he looks.” Bittu wagged his finger and retorted, “desh ke dushman (enemy of the country)”. Rahul then extended his hand towards Bittu and said, “Hello brother, my traitor friend”, even adding, “Don’t worry, you will come back (to Congress)”. Bittu, however, did not reciprocate with a handshake. As he walked past, Congress MPs jeered, “surrender, surrender”.The altercation had a fallout outside Parliament, with BJP protesting against Rahul’s “traitor” jibe. BJP fielded several Sikh faces, including Union minister Hardeep Puri, Delhi minister Manjinder Sirsa and MLA Arvinder Lovely, to hit out at Rahul. Puri claimed that “traitor” is used for those who betray their country, and said Rahul’s comment was all the more insulting for Sikhs as Ravneet is the grandson of former Punjab CM Beant Singh, who was assassinated by Khalistani terrorists and is lauded for his role in restoring normalcy in Punjab.“Use of such language for a member of such a family is not only shameful but an insult to the entire Sikh community. His comment is a slur on every Sikh. It is an insult to the contributions made by Sikhs in every sphere,” Puri alleged.Rahul and Bittu had a close association before the Punjab neta crossed over to BJP ahead of the 2024 LS elections. He contested from Ludhiana on a BJP ticket but lost to Amarinder Raja Warring.In fact, Punjab Congress netas posted a video in which Bittu says Rahul encouraged him to start tying a turban. In the viral clip, Bittu says, “If I am standing here in a turban, it’s because of Rahul Gandhi, who told me I should wear a turban.”",Former Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and Rahul Gandhi got into a bitter exchange Wednesday.

Banking on all 36 communities to restore peace: Manipur CM

GUWAHATI/IMPHAL: Yumnam Khemchand Singh of BJP was sworn in Wednesday as the CM of Manipur's reinstated NDA govt along with Kuki legislator Nemcha Kipgen and Naga MLA Losii Dikho as his deputies, marking a fresh spin on shared governance in a multi-ethnic state riven by the Meitei-Kuki conflict.Governor AK Bhalla also administered the oath of office to BJP's Konthoujam Govindas and Khuraijam Loken Singh of NPP as cabinet ministers at the Lok Bhavan ceremony, which ended almost a year of President’s rule since N Biren Singh resigned over criticism of the previous govt's handling of the violence that erupted in May 2023.Khemchand Singh, a former assembly speaker from the state’s majority Meitei community, said there was nothing he wanted more than to fulfil the faith reposed in him by PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah.Manipur has 36 communities. Our hope rests on all of them to help establish a peaceful atmosphere,” CM Khemchand Singh told reporters.Khemchand, elected leader of the BJP legislature party on Tuesday, had called on the governor along with central observer Tarun Chugh, BJP's northeast coordinator Sambit Patra and ex-CM Biren Singh, among others, to stake claim to form the govt.PM Modi, who visited the state last Sept for the first time since the conflict, congratulated the new CM and his newly-inducted colleagues in a post on X. “I am confident they will work diligently towards furthering development and prosperity for my sisters and brothers of Manipur,” he wrote.Deputy CM Dikho, who is from BJP ally Naga People’s Front, reinforced the sentiment of reconciliation. “We hope to fulfil the people’s aspirations. Our first task is to reach out to them. Inclusiveness is the mantra of this govt,” he said. On whether action would be taken against armed groups that had threatened Kuki legislators participating in govt formation, Dikho replied, “Why not?”Kipgen, whose appointment as deputy CM has invited criticism from Kuki-Zo organisations pressing for the creation of a Union territory for the community, took oath through videoconferencing from Delhi’s Manipur Bhawan. The Kuki-Zo Council said any of the 10 MLAs from the party joining the govt would do so “at their own risk”.Two Kuki-Zo MLAs, LM Khaute and Ngursanglur Sanate, attended the swearing-in, marking the first time in more than two years that any of the community’s elected representatives had set foot in Meitei-majority Imphal.Four parties – Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma's NPP with six MLAs, NPF with five MLAs, JD(U) with one legislator and two independents – extended unconditional support to BJP. NPP had briefly withdrawn support to NDA in Manipur in Nov 2024, citing the then CM Biren Singh's failure to resolve the ethnic crisis. Khemchand chaired a cabinet meeting at his new official bungalow in the evening. “The meeting marked the beginning of collective decision-making and governance for the newly constituted state cabinet,” his office said in an official statement.Sources said the assembly was likely to be in session from Friday.

CHENNAI: Apollo Hospitals chairman Dr Prathap C Reddy, who turns 93 on Thursday, cuts a commanding figure — the tall cardiologist who walked away from a thriving US practice after his father’s plea to “help people in India. ” A 1979 tragedy sealed it: a 35-year-old patient died, treatment abroad unaffordable. Seeing the widow and children, he asked, “If Indian doctors save lives in the US, why not here at home?”Dr Reddy, who turns 93 Thursday, lobbied PM Indira Gandhi to ensure import duties on equipment fell from 300% to zero. Banks funded the build; cement and steel came cheap, and he built Apollo Chennai, India’s first multispecialty hospital, in 1983 with a promise to offer treatment to 25% of patients free.Dr Reddy’s zeal reshaped more than medicine. Hours before Apollo’s launch, he axed a glaring “Casualty” sign: “Why would trauma patients want to be wheeled into ‘casualties’ rooms? My staff thought people wouldn’t recognise any other word. But I insisted on changing it to ‘Emergency’. It’s now standard nationwide,” he said.He recalled how four decades on, his 4Cs mantra — clinical excellence, compassionate care, cost-effectiveness, cutting-edge technology — powers a 10,000-bed empire rivalling reputable international hospitals in cardiac procedures, organ transplants, and outcomes at a fraction of developed nations’ costs.While Southeast Asia’s first proton therapy centre hums in Chennai; Mumbai and Delhi will get next-gen upgrades, he said.His dream now is to put India on the global healthcare map. If India allows visa-on-arrival at least for friendly nations, it will double patient inflows overnight across 400 hospitals, including Apollo, spurring jobs and retaining skilled resources, including doctors and nurses. Simultaneously, India must ensure its people are healthy. Periodic health checks and health risk evaluation using AI models and genetic tests must be encouraged. “People must not assume they are healthy; they must be told they are healthy,” he said.He agrees this will not be easy without reforms in health insurance. Dr Reddy practises what he preaches. “Like any other Indian, I have all the health risks – I have been diabetic for nearly 50 years, I have hypertension, high cholesterol and I was overweight,” he said. Fifteen years ago, he suffered a heart attack.“But preventive health checks, early diagnosis and treatment, diet and regular exercises have kept me going. I still do 20 minutes’ walk every day with at least seven minutes of brisk walking. I have lost at least 15 kg from nearly 105 kg. My blood pressure and sugar levels are under control. Indians have the genetic predisposition for some non-communicable diseases, but they can all be brought under control with lifestyle and medications,” he said.","Apollo Hospitals chairman Dr Prathap C Reddy, who turns 93 on Thursday, cuts a commanding figure.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday flagged the substantial haircuts taken by creditors in proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after being told how the bankrupt Reliance Communications of Anil Ambani group was bought at a throwaway price by Mukesh Ambani ’s Reliance Jio.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Apropos the SC’s concern, govt of India is seriously looking into this issue arising in IBC proceedings. I cannot elaborate as I am part of that discussion. It is receiving very serious consideration at the appropriate quarter.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that Reliance Communications had outstanding dues of Rs 47,000 crore and in bankruptcy proceedings, it was sold for Rs 455 crore, that is, 1% of the outstanding amount. It was sold to his brother’s company.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Anil Ambani group, said such a sale was a public process, whether the buyer was a brother or anyone else. But the CJI-led bench said, “Unfortunately, IBC proceedings are misused nowadays. The assets of a company in debt are undervalued. Then it is put on a sham auction and, in a planned manner, a family member or a friend buys it.”The bench added, “Every day such matters are coming up before the court.”The SG said, “The haircut (suffered by creditors) is phenomenal.” Bhushan po-inted out that “surprisingly, bankruptcy is declared by the very company which is facing bankruptcy”.The CJI remarked, “It is a nice plan. Voluntarily declare bankruptcy and then get evaluated by friendly valuers at 10% of the market value.

Kashmir BEd colleges face large-scale de-affiliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmir-bed-colleges-face-large-scale-de-affiliation/articleshow/127916579.cms,"Representative image

JAMMU: University of Kashmir (UoK)’s latest BEd Admission notification, which limits applications to only two private colleges, has led to large-scale de-affiliation of nearly 55 colleges, with far-reaching consequences for employment, private higher education and Kashmir’s ability to attract students from outside Jammu and Kashmir.According to the notification issued by UoK for the 2025-2027 session, only two colleges are recognised by National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) and have invited applications from eligible candidates for admission to two-year BEd programmes.Professor C L Vishen, president of Kashmir Private BEd Colleges’ Association, said about 75 BEd colleges were operating in the Valley before 2019. After the nullification of Article 370 in 2019, NCTE norms became applicable to J&K, and the number of colleges shrank, primarily because most institutions did not meet the requirement of transferring land to the college trust.Prof Vishen, however, said that the provision in the 2014 NCTE Amendment Act regarding land transfer did not have a retrospective effect in J&K and should not apply to most colleges in Kashmir, as they had been established before 2014. “We repeatedly pointed this out to NCTE but received no response. Even the CM has recommended our case to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, but there has been no outcome so far,” Vishen said.Syed Masroor Andrabi, chairperson of Chinab Valley College of Education, said BEd colleges in Kashmir stood at the verge of closure. “It is not merely an academic concern but a serious employment and social crisis. These institutions sustain thousands of students, teachers, and non-teaching staff, and serve as a crucial pipeline for trained educators in our schools,” Andrabi said.A senior UoK official said after the nullification of Article 370, NCTE had granted repeated relaxations to colleges, asking them to complete documentation, including transfer of land to the college trust, for several years, but the colleges didn’t fulfil the requirements, forcing NCTE to act this year.University officials said once land is transferred, the process becomes irrevocable, which has caused hesitation among some institutions. “Admissions for this year are already over. If colleges fulfil the requirements by next June, they will be allowed to admit students again,” said an official.",University of Kashmir (UoK)’s latest BEd Admission notification has led to large-scale de-affiliation of nearly 55 colleges.

Early signs of Cervical cancer women often miss

In a landmark achievement for preventive healthcare, Novaneo Hospital on Wednesday entered the Guinness Book of World Records by collecting the highest number of cervical cancer (Pap/HPV) screening gut samples within an eight-hour window, underscoring the growing role of hospital-led initiatives in large-scale disease prevention.The record-setting feat was achieved during a mega carcinoma cervix screening camp organised by Novaneo Hospital and Delhi Cancer Hospital, in collaboration with the All India Terapanth Mahila Mandal, at the Novaneo Hospital campus in Budh Vihar. Between 9 am and 5 pm, medical teams successfully screened over 500 women, marking one of the largest single-day cervical cancer screening efforts conducted by a hospital in the region.The initiative was aimed at addressing cervical cancer, one of the most common yet preventable cancers among women in India, where late diagnosis often leads to poor outcomes. Alongside sample collection, doctors and healthcare workers provided counselling on risk factors, early warning signs and the critical importance of routine screening. Women requiring follow-up care were guided on the next steps, ensuring continuity beyond the camp.Medical teams from both hospitals conducted examinations and provided counselling on risk factors, symptoms and the importance of regular screening. Participants were also guided on follow-up care wherever required, reinforcing the message that timely detection remains the most effective tool in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes.The camp underlined the role of hospital-led outreach programmes in bridging gaps between clinical expertise and community healthcare needs. By partnering with the All India Terapanth Mahila Mandal, which has a wide grassroots presence among women, the initiative was able to reach a large and diverse group of beneficiaries in a single day.The programme also highlighted the growing clinical capabilities of the participating institutions. Novaneo Hospital has steadily built a reputation for advanced paediatric and neonatal care, anchored by a state-of-the-art 30-bedded Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The NICU is equipped with advanced technology such as SLE 6000 infant ventilators for precise respiratory management, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) machines critical for treating neonatal respiratory failure, and whole-body cooling systems used in the management of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. These facilities enable the hospital to handle high-risk and critically ill newborns with comprehensive care.Delhi Cancer Hospital, on the other hand, continues to focus on making oncology services more accessible and patient-friendly. Its 20-bedded oncology daycare unit operates all seven days of the week, ensuring continuity of treatment for cancer patients. With an efficient patient turnaround time of just two to three hours, the facility reduces waiting periods while maintaining quality care. The hospital also offers significant cost advantages, delivering cancer treatment at 40-60 per cent lower costs compared to corporate hospitals.The success of the cervical cancer screening camp reflects a shared commitment by Novaneo Hospital and Delhi Cancer Hospital to preventive healthcare and community engagement. Both institutions plan to continue similar outreach initiatives, with the aim of expanding access to early diagnosis and quality medical care across Delhi.",Over 500 women screened in mega cervical cancer camp at Budh Vihar in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: In a move to address the menace of loose items, such as soil, construction materials and municipal waste, often falling from both uncovered or tarpaulin-covered trucks, the govt will soon make it mandatory for these vehicles to have “mechanised covering” — automated or machine-assisted methods for covering.This will be part of the updated Truck Body Code. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has said the code will be notified soon. Officials said the changes to the code have been adopted by a committee under the road transport ministry that has representatives from the industry as well. TOI has learnt that the truck-manufacturing industry has sought two years to implement the code while the govt is keen to roll it out in the next one year.There have been several Supreme Court orders directing proper covering of trucks carrying loose and protruding loadsbut there has been little compliance due to poor enforcement.Officials said the Automotive Industry Standards (AIS)-093, dealing with the code has been published. This addresses issues related to unsafe body building practices, structural weaknesses, overloading, instability and non-uniform vehicle dimensions. The AIS provisions for minimum safety standards, structural integrity, dimensional uniformity and roadworthiness of truck bodies built on approved chassis.Officials said the revised code will incorporate the requirement of AC driver cabin, advanced driver assistance systems for improving safety, and updated provisions for under-run protection devices.",The truck-manufacturing industry has sought two years to implement the code.

'Republic Day 2026 Flypast Will Be IAF's Tribute To Operation Sindoor': Says Wing Commander Deshwal

New Delhi: From Bactrian camels to Zanskar ponies, a rare contingent of “animal soldiers” will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute Republic Day parade on Monday.They will be under the command of Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of a retired IAF officer, and from the first batch of Indian Army’s Remount & Veterinary Corps.Speaking to TOI, she said, “This contingent is very uniquely curated. There are two Bactrian camels from Ladakh, four Zanskar ponies, four raptors (specially-trained birds of prey), 10 military dogs, mostly indigenously-bred. They are all Army soldiers and have different operational roles.”Perfectly adapted to extreme cold, thin air and altitudes above 15,000 feet, the Bactrian camels, which are recently inducted in Army operations, can carry a load of up to 250 kg and traverse long distances in the cold deserts.She said the Indian Army has been using indigenously-bred dogs for quite some time and they are trained basically for two purposes — detection (explosives, mine detection, tracking, search and avalanche rescue) and protection (assault on enemies).“Training of birds like kites or any animal involves neuroscience. Once you understand the science behind these animals and the training part, then these are highly trainable,” Captain Harshita said.IAF Air Commodore Manish Sabharwal, during a Republic Day press preview on Friday, said the S-400 air defence system, which shot down multiple Pakistan aircraft and also a spy plane from a distance of over 300 km deep inside Pakistan, which is a “documented kill”, will also be showcased at the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) tableau during the parade for the first time.The tableau will showcase India's victory in Operation Sindoor last year and the jointness of the three services displayed during the decisive action. One side will feature lethal military weapons that proved crucial during the operation. The other side will depict the destruction of the infrastructure on the side of Pakistan.Major General Navraj Dhillon, Chief of Staff, Delhi Area, said Lt Gen Bhavnish Kumar, GOC, Delhi Area, will head the parade for the fourth time.Battalion, Shaktibaan regiment, drone shakti and robotic mules to take part in the parade for the first time, along with Ladakh Scouts,” he said. He said the Army will feature the debut of a Battle Array Formation showcasing synchronised manoeuvres alongside tanks, missile systems, drones and armoured platforms. The defence assets that will be showcased during the parade will include BrahMos, Akash missile system, Medium Range Surface-To-Air Missile (MRSAM) system, Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), Dhanush artillery gun, Shaktiban and a static display of some drones.The parade will also see the debut of the Shaktiban Regiment, which has been set up in the artillery. The newly-raised regiment will be equipped with a drone, counter-drone and loiter munition. Eighteen marching contingents and 13 bands will take part in the parade.Akash weapon system and MRSAM system are being fielded in this year's parade. Universal Rocket Launcher System URLS 'Suryastra', which can carry out surface-to-surface strikes up to 300 km, is being showcased for the first time in the parade, Maj Gen Dhillon said.As European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be the chief guests, a small EU contingent, comprising an officer of the colonel rank, will lead the delegation. Following him in their contingent will be four flag-bearers.A senior military official said women’s participation is also in big numbers. CRPF’s Assistant Commandant Simran Bala will be the first woman officer to lead an all-male contingent at the parade.Captain Samira, a fourth-generation army officer, is the commander of an Army tableau depicting the success of Op Sindoor. She told TOI the tableau will display the indigenously developed military assets and weapon systems used during the Pakistan conflict and will also highlight Atmanirbhar Bharat.DRDO will showcase some of its path-breaking innovations for national security during the parade. Apart from displaying long-range anti-ship hypersonic missile (LR-AShM), DRDO will have a tableau 'naval technologies for combat submarines'.A formation flying named “Operation Sindoor” comprising Rafale, Su-30, Jaguar and MiG-29 combat jets will feature in the IAF's R-Day flypast that will serve as a powerful symbol of the dominance it established during the four-day hostilities with Pakistan last May. A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighters, nine helicopters and four transport planes, will be part of the flypast.A total of 30 tableaux to roll down Kartavya Path and 150 years of Vande Mataram will be the theme of the parade.","A rare contingent of “animal soldiers’ will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path.

The art of listening in a noisy world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-listening-in-a-noisy-world/articleshow/127273399.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I was at the wedding ceremony of a relative. One of those rare weddings with an early morning muhurtham , where brunch is still an hour away. Relatives who otherwise communicate only through forwarded messages on WhatsApp, slowly formed a circle. There was genuine warmth, laughter and enquiries . Then a teenager murmured an alert, almost like a warning: “Manju aunty.” Half the teenagers vanished with remarkable coordination. Manju aunty is, by all accounts, a loving and well-meaning person. The problem is volume—of words. Excessive talking would be an understatement. It is as though God, while assembling her, forgot to install a filter between thought and speech. She joined the circle, entirely unmindful of the sudden stillness. Her eyes landed on a teenage girl who had not escaped in time. Turning to the girl’s mother, she asked loudly, “Did you forget to feed her? Why is she so thin? Does she think this is some fashion?” Without waiting for an answer, she launched into how well she had fed her own daughter—and how that, naturally, led to a smooth ‘ normal delivery’ . The women who had undergone caesarean sections shifted uncomfortably, eyes lowered, dignity bruised in silence . Her gaze then fell on a Class IV boy and asked his rank in class. When the boy replied there was no ranking system anymore, she smiled indulgently and explained how her son always stood first though, thanks to her strict control. As her words poured out, relentless as autumn leaves falling from a tree, the gathering began to dissolve. Someone urgently needed the restroom. Someone else had to check on their child. A phone rang. Soon, only Manju aunty remained, speaking uninterrupted, and an elderly grandmother who could not hear a word anyway. We have all met Manju aunties in our lives. People who love to talk. When they call you, you immediately panic. If you pick up, your next 20 minutes is gone. If you don’t, you will have to hear about the habit of not answering calls the next time you meet. One thing often common among such persistent speakers is judgement. An unspoken “I know better” . What they lose—without realising it—is the chance to learn. Listening is not merely waiting for one’s turn to speak; it is an act of humility. Wisdom often arrives softly. It does not shout to be heard. Silence, contrary to popular belief, is not emptiness. It is strategy. The silent observer learns far more about the one who speaks without pause than the speaker ever learns about the listener. That is why Plato observed, “Wise men speak when they have something to say; fools speak because they have to say something.” The world today celebrates constant expression—opinions aired instantly; reactions broadcast without reflection. Yet the power lies not in saying everything, but in knowing what deserves to be said. Thiruvalluvar captured this with disarming simplicity: “Solluga sollir payanuḍaiya; Sollarka Sollil payanillach chol.” If speak you will, speak words that are fruitful; If speak you will, speak never fruitless words. The Kural does not glorify silence blindly. It demands responsibility from speech. Words must justify themselves. If they wound, belittle, inflate ego, or merely fill space, silence would have served better.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

NEW DELHI: Fresh controversy has surfaced around the cancellation of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding with singer-composer Palaash Muchhal, following serious allegations made by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane. Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial misconduct, claiming he was cheated of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project. A formal complaint has been filed in Sangli, Maharashtra.Smriti and Muchhal were initially scheduled to tie the knot on November 23, 2025. The wedding was first postponed citing health emergencies in both families before being officially called off in December 2025.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old alleged that the relationship between Mandhana and Muchhal broke down after a shocking incident during wedding festivities in November 2025.“I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers. The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.”Mane further claimed he is a childhood friend of Smriti Mandhana and was introduced to Muchhal through her family.Mane also levelled allegations of financial coercion against the Muchhal family, stating that he was pressured to invest additional money into a stalled film project.“When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to Rs 1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, communication with the family stopped entirely after the wedding was cancelled.“After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also asserted that he has evidence to back his claims. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal later issued a response through an Instagram story, firmly denying all accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,” Muchhal wrote.Amid widespread speculation over the reasons behind the split, both parties later issued separate statements confirming the cancellation. Smriti stated that she needed to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal said, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”",Smriti Mandhana and Palaash Muchhal's wedding has been called off.

NEW DELHI: Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital, but air quality remained in the “poor” category, with the AQI recorded at 297 at 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

Officials said the maximum temperature is forecast to fall to 18-20°C on Friday and further to 16-18°C on Saturday.The rainy spells, accompanied by cloud cover, are also expected to bring down Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) to the poor category on Friday and to moderate by Saturday, if the predictions hold true.The IMD has issued a yellow alert for rain across the city. “Another round of very light to light rain is likely towards the afternoon or evening on Friday,” officials added, advising residents to remain cautious of strong winds and localized thunderstorms.A day earlier, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked all Stage III measures across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect on January 22, following improvements in air quality and favorable forecast trends.A statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said: “The Sub-Committee had invoked Stage III of GRAP on January 16, 2026, after a deterioration in Delhi’s average AQI.” Since then, air quality has shown a downward trend.

VIJAYAWADA: A woman allegedly murdered her husband with the help of her boyfriend after lacing biryani with sleeping pills, police said.The incident occurred at Chiluvur village in Duggirala mandal. The victim, Lokam Shivanagaraju, an onion trader, had been married to Lakshmi Madhuri since 2007.The couple had two sons.

'Bangladesh does not deserve a govt aligned with radicals',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-does-not-deserve-a-govt-aligned-with-radicals/articleshow/127331988.cms,"ANI file photo

Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says in an interview with Alpyu Singh that free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt and that India deserves a reliable neighbour. Excerpts:

Tarique Rahman

has assumed office as

Bangladesh Nationalist Party

chairman recently. How do you look at his return?

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

A lot of people are questioning whether an election could actually take place in Feb? If so, how will

Awami League

take part, considering that there is a ban on your party?

As atrocities against minorities continue in Bangladesh, India's external affairs ministry reacted by saying there is a disturbing pattern in all this. What do you think is reason behind these recurring attacks?

How can India help in restoring peace in Bangladesh?

What do you think is the future of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations?

The people of Bangladesh should remember that Tarique Rahman has lived in exile in London for years, far removed from the daily realities faced by ordinary citizens. He fled the country because of his role in abetting his late mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in the embezzlement of public funds. This is not a matter of political disagreement, but of accountability and integrity.BNP leadership has consistently aligned itself with extremist elements when it suits its short-term interests, even at the cost of national stability... it has chosen exclusion, intimidation, and opportunism. Bangladesh deserves leadership that governs from within the country, respects pluralism, and is accountable to the people, not figures who seek power through alliances with radical forces while remaining safely abroad.The question is not whether elections will take place but whether these will be elections in any meaningful or legitimate sense... At present, Bangladesh is ruled by an unelected regime that has appointed itself the authority to rewrite our country's constitution and amend our legislation to ban the nation's most widely supported party from participating in elections.Over half the voters in Bangladesh have confidence in Awami League and would vote for us if Awami League were allowed to participate.It is precisely this fear that has led them to ban us.A govt's most basic duty is to protect its citizens. The interim govt has not only failed in this responsibility, it has actively emboldened this repression. Under Yunus, extremist groups that my govt worked hard to contain have been empowered and elevated to positions of authority. These criminals, many of whom belong to known terrorist orgs, have been allowed to spread a hardline ideology that threatens to remove any trace of diversity from our country and carry out deplorable acts of violence against peaceful Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims with total impunity. The current climate is the direct result of the appeasement of fundamentalist forces.India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under the Yunus regime. They are watching in dismay right now as Bangladesh descends into lawlessness, as minority groups face daily acts of violence, as political imprisonments become the norm, and as harmful, hostile rhetoric emanates from Dhaka. India understands that prosperity of our two nations is tightly linked.n India is Bangladesh's closest friend and longest-standing ally, a relationship built through geography, history and cooperation. Yunus has done considerable damage to this relationship through his empowerment of extremist groups who freely target religious minorities with impunity and his willingness to allow mobs to besiege Indian diplomatic premises and threaten representatives.

Amit Shah Vs Oppn Showdown: Bill To Remove PM, CMs Over Criminal Cases Sparks Big Lok Sabha Ruckus

Experts: 30-day bar not aligned with current procedure

NEW DELHI: An expansive anti -corruption bill has drawn criticism from a legal think tank and two law universities, which told a parliamentary committee that provisions linking the removal of a PM, CM, or minister to 30 days of arrest on serious criminal charges risk political misuse.Representatives of Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, National Law University (NLU)- Odisha and National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS)- Kolkata, who were invited by the joint parliamentary committee scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, flagged a host of issues, including that it may override popular will.Two of them suggested the threshold for removal should be ""framing of charges"" as it will introduce an element of judicial scrutiny in the process, people in the know said. Vidhi Centre cautioned that certain provisions may invite constitutional challenges.It said the purported intent behind the bill is laudable and largely complies with constitutional doctrine.Representatives of two of these bodies pointed out that the global consensus, at least in established democracies, for removal of ministers from office is judicial conviction and the proposed law moves away from this and has a low threshold.Existing criminal provisions allow police to seek custody of an accused for up to 90 days in serious offences, and the 30-day bar is not congruent with the current procedure, it was noted.NUJS said the legislation may intend to curb criminality within politics, but it has a “high probability” of severely destabilising Union and state cabinets, sources aware of the details said. The varsity said it has potential to lead to policy paralysis at Centre and states.An investigation can turn into a “potential regime change operation,” NLU said, adding that the bill incentivises retaliation as state police can act against a visiting Union minister after central agencies take action against a chief minister or state minister.Vidhi Centre said, “The framework creates scope for political misuse. Arrests may be timed or selectively pursued.”NLU echoed similar views, saying opposing parties can use its provisions to destabilise legitimate govts. The trend over the past few decades suggests the possibility of its misuse and it will have a negative impact on the country’s democracy, it said. “Automatic removal of a PM or CM overrides the choice of the majority party and the voters,” it said.Though the bill seeks removal from office over arrest in offences where punishment is five years or more, it was also pointed out that there are several serious crimes, including corruption, where punishment may be less than five years.The govt has batted for the bill citing instances of ministers and even a chief minister — Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi — continuing to be in charge despite being under a long period of incarceration on corruption charges. However, it agreed to send the bill to the parliamentary panel headed by BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi for wider consultations. Most opposition parties have refused to be part of the panel.","Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, National Law University (NLU)- Odisha and National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS)- Kolkata flagged a host of issues, including that it may override popular will.

Tharoor Snubs Congress, Skips Key Meeting; Zelensky Announces First US-Russia-Ukraine Talks

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor did not attend the meeting of Kerala state leadership with AICC high command Friday amid reports that he is upset over a recent ""snub"", even as the party stepped up planning for the upcoming state polls scheduled for mid-2026 and urged netas to put up a united fight.AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi met important netas of the Kerala unit for discussion on poll campaign strategy and seat-sharing with allies.Among those who took part in the session were AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, special poll observer Sachin Pilot, senior neta Ramesh Chennithala, state president Sunny Thomas, LoP V D Satheesan, MPs Kodikunnil Suresh, Adoor Prakash, among others. However, Tharoor did not attend despite an invitation.The Thiruvananthapuram MP was in Kozhikode for Kerala Literature Festival where, sources said, he had a lecture scheduled on an important social reformer. Sources said he had informed the party about his inability to attend the meeting. However, Tharoor is said to be upset that Rahul did not acknowledge him while he mentioned other netas on the dais during Kochi ""mahapanchayat"" organised after UDF's victory in local body elections.Tharoor is said to have told the party about his unhappiness about the ""snub"".To media queries, party's state incharge Deepa Dasmunshi denied that Tharoor was unhappy with Congress.The events before Kochi had suggested a thaw between Tharoor and the party, after the MP's repeated statements and political stance over myriad issues had embarrassed the Congress brass. The repeated clashes between him and Congress had even triggered speculations that Tharoor was searching for political space outside Congress.For Kerala polls, Congress is also discussing the return of estranged ally Kerala Congress (Mani). The party has to decide whether MPs will be fielded in state polls, even as it is almost final that most of the MLAs will be repeated. A comfortable victory for UDF alliance over the governing Left bloc in the local body elections last month rekindled hopes about its prospects in the assembly polls.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor did not attend the meeting of Kerala state leadership with AICC high command Friday.

Indian seafarers are most abandoned in the world again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-seafarers-are-most-abandoned-in-the-world-again/articleshow/127319128.cms,"Representative image: ANI

LONDON: Indian seafarers are the most abandoned in the world for the third year running.A total of 1,125 Indian seafarers were abandoned on ships in 2025 out of a total of 6,223 seafarers abandoned across 410 ships worldwide, making 2025 the worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.The number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned. In 2023, it was 401. After Indians, the next highest cohort to be abandoned in 2025 were Filipinos (539).India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the Philippines and China.Worldwide the total number of seafarers abandoned has increased by 32% and ship abandonments are up 31% compared to 2024, according to the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), headquartered in London.ITF data shows that seafarers were owed a total of $25.8 million in 2025 as a consequence of abandonment. From this, the ITF has recovered and returned $16.5 million to seafarers.The two countries where most ship abandonments took place were Türkiye and the UAE.Seafarer abandonment is defined as failing to cover the cost of a seafarer’s repatriation; leaving a seafarer without maintenance; or severing ties with a seafarer, including failing to pay wages for at least two months.“It’s nothing short of a disgrace that, yet again, we are seeing record numbers of seafarers abandoned by unscrupulous ship owners,” said David Heindel, chair of the ITF seafarers’ section.An Indian seafarer abandoned with three Indian crew on the “Eleen Armonia”, off the coast of Nigeria, since June, without pay, said: “I can’t sleep from stress, and if this continues I don’t know how it will affect my health. I joined this vessel quickly because the assignment meant I could spend Christmas and New Year with my new daughter and family. I have now missed these and an important family event. As seafarers, it feels really shameful that we’re treated this way. ”Last Sept India’s Directorate General of Shipping blacklisted 86 vessels linked to recurrent Indian seafarer abuse.Three hundred and thirty-seven ship abandonments in 2025 were on vessels sailing under flags of convenience — flags of a country other than the country of ownership. These flags are commonly used by shadow fleets (carrying sanctioned goods) to hide the identity of the real ship owner and are associated with poor safety standards and working conditions.","Number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned.

SRINAGAR\JAMMU: Snowfall and savage winds up to 155kmph pulverised J&K on Friday, blocking highways, causing flight cancellations, shutting down schools, disrupting power, leaving homes roofless and forcing the suspension of Vaishno Devi pilgrimage.In the Valley, IMD reported snowfall of 55cm in Shopian, 45cm in Gulmarg, 20cm in Kupwara, 17cm in Pahalgam, 16cm in Banihal, and 15cm in Sonamarg as the weather system fed by western disturbances began its onslaught late Thursday night.In Jammu, Trikuta Hills, home to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi’s cave shrine, received the first snowfall of the season alongside Doda, Kishtwar, Ramban, and Poonch. “Light to moderate rains lashed several other areas,” an official said in Jammu.The rough spell will linger. According to Mukhtar Ahmad, director of Srinagar’s Met department, a second burst of western disturbance is likely on Jan 26, preceded by light to heavy rainfall on Jan 24 and 25.Vehicular movement was stopped in both directions on the all-important Jammu-Srinagar National Highway due to fresh snowfall around Navyug Tunnel. Several other roads were blocked.At Srinagar airport, no flights moved on Friday. IndiGo said both take-offs and landings had been suspended due to snowfall.“We are closely monitoring the weather and will get you on your way as soon as conditions allow,” the airline added.Power and transmission lines took a beating. Chief minister Omar Abdullah warned of massive losses. “We can figure losses from this point that active power load in the Valley is less than 100 MW today (Friday) against the usual 1700 MW. The gusty winds disrupted the whole transmission system,” Omar, who is also power minister, said.Mehmood Ahmad Shah, MD of Kashmir Power Distribution Corporation, said several roofs fell directly on transmission lines in Srinagar and other districts, hitting electricity supply.IMD put wind speeds at 155kmph in Shopian, 80kmph in Poonch, 76kmph in Reasi, 63kmph in Jammu and 84kmph in Srinagar. In Srinagar’s busy Lal Chowk, battered roof sheets fell and piled up near Clock Tower, bringing traffic to a standstill. Similar scenes were reported from other Valley areas.“The roofs were not anchored properly to the walls,” former Kashmir chief town planner Iftikhar Hakeem said. Architect Sameer Hamdani echoed the view. “Many roofs are constructed as temporary structures, especially in shopping complexes where owners intend to add a floor,” Hamdani said.In Jammu, authorities ordered school closures in Rajouri, Reasi, Poonch and Udhampur for the safety of students and staff. Cops rescued 12 people, including children, stuck in heavy snow in Udhampur’s Chochru Galla area after a daring three-hour mission. Army troopers helped civilians stuck in buses, trucks and other vehicles in Poonch’s Tota Gali area after snowfall.","Snowfall and savage winds up to 155kmph pulverised J&K on Friday, blocking highways, shutting down schools, disrupting power, leaving homes roofless.

India Named Global Growth Engine By IMF, BJP Says Global Data Exposes Rahul Gandhi's Claim

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Friday renewed his “dead economy” attack on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , citing the impact of steep US tariffs on India’s textile sector. He held him accountable, alleging official inaction amid job losses and growing uncertainty for exporters.“50% US tariffs and uncertainty are badly hurting India’s textile exporters. Job losses, factory shutdowns and reduced orders are a reality of our ‘Dead Economy’,” Gandhi wrote in a post on X.Targeting PM Modi, Gandhi accused the government of failing to respond to the crisis despite the scale of the impact.“Mr Modi has offered no relief or even spoken about tariffs, even though more than 4.5 crore jobs and lakhs of businesses are at stake. Modi ji, you are accountable; please direct your attention to this matter!,” the leader of opposition further wrote.Earlier, echoing US President Donald Trump ’s sharp criticism of India’s economy, Gandhi had said the Indian economy was “dead” and blamed the PM Modi government’s policies for the situation.He accused the Centre of damaging growth through decisions such as demonetisation, a flawed GST rollout and what he termed the collapse of MSMEs and job creation, remarks that had drawn strong political reactions.In a post on X last year, Gandhi said, “Economy is dead. Modi killed it”. He also listed the key reasons behind the decline: the “Adani-Modi partnership,” demonetisation, a flawed GST, a failed “Assemble in India” initiative, the wiping out of MSMEs, and distress in the farming sector.Speaking to reporters at the time, Gandhi claimed that the economic slowdown was evident to everyone except the Prime Minister and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.“Everybody knows this except PM Modi and the Finance Minister. It is a dead economy. I am glad that the US President has stated facts,” he said, alleging that government policies had destroyed jobs and hurt small businesses.Trump had earlier taken a swipe at India and Russia on his Truth Social platform. He wrote, ""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together.""Reacting to Gandhi’s claims, the BJP rejected allegations of job losses and factory shutdowns. Union minister Giriraj Singh said that the industry was expanding, not declining and accused the Congress leader of spreading misinformation.Also read: 'Maha Yuddh in Maha Panchayat?'

“The textile and garment industries have not shut down; the only shutdown is in the minds of those spreading negativity about India. From April to December 2024, exports were Rs 95,000 crore, and from April to December 2025, they rose to Rs 1,02,000 crore. So, which shutdown are they talking about? Which exports have fallen? Those spreading confusion are misleading people. During the previous government, stitching machines, whether for garments or leather products, were not manufactured in India, and 40 lakh machines had to be imported. .. In the fabric-to-garment sector, one machine provides employment to 1.7 people. So with 2 crore machines today, at least 3 crore people are employed in this sector alone. Over the past 11 years, we have created employment for 5 crore people in the textile sector. This is not a shutdown. Visit industrial hubs in Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and across the country, and you will see investments worth Rs 60,000 crore. Stop spreading false claims about a shutdown, the industry is thriving; it is only his (Rahul Gandhi) mindset that is in a shutdown,” Singh said.","Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi renewed his “dead economy’ attack on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

A large quantity of arms and ammunition, including an M4 automatic rifle, was recovered from him during the operation in a remote village in the Parhetar area.Usman was one of the most wanted JeM terrorists active in the Udhampur-Kathua belt for the past two years after infiltrating into India from across the border.He had escaped several previous encounters, the latest being on January 7 and 13 in the Kahog and Najote forests, respectively.Meanwhile, security forces continue a separate anti-terror operation to hunt down three JeM terrorists in Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora, and adjoining forest areas in the Chatroo belt of Kishtwar district for the sixth consecutive day on Friday.Named by the Army as ‘Operation Trashi-I’, the mission was launched on January 18. The gunfight has so far claimed one paratrooper’s life, while seven soldiers were injured, primarily due to splinter injuries caused by a sudden grenade attack by the hiding terrorists.After a four-day lull, another encounter took place on Thursday, but the terrorists managed to escape, taking advantage of thick vegetation and challenging terrain.Operations have been further intensified ahead of Republic Day to ensure peaceful celebrations, amid intelligence inputs about attempts by Pakistan-based handlers to push more terrorists into the region","Officials identified the deceased terrorist as JeM commander Usman, also known as ""Abu Maviya"" A large quantity of arms and ammunition, including an M4 automatic rifle, was recovered from him during the operation in the Parhetar area.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127280107,imgsize-64684,width-400,resizemode-4/kathua-jammu-and-kashmir-jan-22-ani-security-personnel-conduct-checks-ahea.jpg"

'Will Come to Mumbai, Try Cutting My Legs: Annamalai Hits Back at Raj Thackeray

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray posted a cryptic social media message on Friday, saying that if he ever took a “flexible stance” in politics, it would never be driven by ""personal gain.""His remarks came on the 100th birth anniversary of his uncle, Bal Thackeray, the founder of the undivided Shiv Sena . Raj Thackeray left the Sena in 2005 and launched the MNS the following year.The MNS chief posted on X in Marathi, ""Today loyalties are easily sold off. Principles are casually discarded, and politics has become entirely opportunistic. In today's politics, success is measured not by which issues were brought to the forefront or how fiercely regional and linguistic identities were kept alive, but by how much success was achieved in electoral politics and what tricks are employed to get there. """"In Balasaheb's time, there were no such compromises with expectations like these...He himself had no craving for power...Even when Balasaheb had to take a flexible stance in politics at times, his love for the Marathi people never diminished even by a fraction; on the contrary, it only grew stronger. These are the values instilled in us,"" he wrote.Thackeray added that he is giving his word that if he ever took a ""slightly flexible stance in this completely transformed politics,"" it would ""never be for my personal gain or selfish interests.""His statement comes two days after five MNS corporators extended support to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde 's Shiv Sena in the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) in the Thane district.The move raised eyebrows, as the party had contested the January 15 civic polls alongside the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) in several municipal corporations across the state, including the KDMC and Mumbai. The MNS-Sena (UBT) alliance had reunited Raj with Uddhav, Bal Thackeray's son and former Maharashtra chief minister, after 20 years of estrangement.Shiv Sena (UBT) is a faction of the previously undivided Shiv Sena, the other being the Shinde-led group. The party split in June 2022, resulting in the two factions, with the Shinde camp recognised by the Election Commission as the ""real"" Shiv Sena. The split also led to the collapse of the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government.","Mumbai Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray posted a cryptic social media message on Friday.

'Netaji’s Strategic Realism Matters More Today As World Fragments', Says CDS Anil Chauhan At JNU

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals. He added that the country now knew how to build, manage and use power.In a video address to a programme in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Parakram Diwas, which commemorates Netaji's birth anniversary, Modi said due to the insecurities of those who came to office after independence - a swipe at Jawaharlal Nehru and his successors from Congress - the glorious history of the islands, which were briefly under the control of Bose's Indian National Army during the World War II, were not preserved as they wanted to credit only one family for independence.His govt has taken corrective measures, he added. Home minister Amit Shah lauded Netaji's ""unwavering determination to liberate India"" through his long and fraught journey across different countries and said every youth should read about his life to strengthen their resolve to protect the nation.""Netaji declared an independent India in 1943 by hoisting the tricolour in Andaman and Nicobar Islands,"" he said in a post. In his remarks, Modi said India was making its defence sector self-reliant in line with Bose's vision.India struck its enemies in their homes during Op Sindoor, he said in reference to the military strikes on terror sites in Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack, and destroyed them, he said, emphasising his govt's deft use of power to achieve its goals and the expansion of its defence production.""In their political self-interest, the nation's history was neglected,"" he said, noting that the islands continued to be knowns by the names of British officers before his govt made the correction. Port Blair was now 'Shri Vijaypuram', a name that reminded us of Netaji's victory, he said, recalling that 21 islands of Andamans were named after 21 Param Vir Chakra awardees in 2023.At a presser, BJP slammed Congress for trying to erase Bose's contribution from history in its long tenure in office and said he played the most decisive role in the country's independence. Nehru dismissed Bose's party Forward Bloc as a negative group against Congress and imbued with fascism and communalism, BJP's Sudhanshu Trivedi said, citing comments of B R Ambedkar and others to claim that Bose's campaign had ensured that the colonial rulers were not sure about the loyalty of Indian soldiers.",PM Narendra Modi said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals.

5 girls booked under UP anti-conversion law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-girls-booked-under-up-anti-conversion-law/articleshow/127342164.cms,".

BAREILLY: An FIR has been registered under Section 3 of the stringent Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act against five minor Muslim girls -- aged between 15 and 17 -- for allegedly getting their 16-year-old Hindu friend to wear a burqa in Moradabad.The incident took place on Dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother, Daksh Chaudhary, on Friday.If found guilty under this law, an accused, especially if the victim is a minor, can be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term “which shall not be less than 5 years but which may extend to 14 years”.Superintendent of police (rural) in Moradabad, Kunwar Akash Singh, told TOI, “As soon as we received the complaint, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered and further investigation is on.”Section 3 of the anti-conversion law deals with “prohibition of conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, and allurement”.“My sister was talking to one of the girls whom she’d met about two months back and had been going out regularly with. The five girls who took away my sister in burqa had may have had some ill intention. So, I approached cops at Bilari police station,” Chaudhary, the complainant, told TOI.A purported video of the incident was widely circulated on social media.In the minute-long video clip, the girls can be seen in a narrow alley between houses. One of them is seen wearing a burqa over her dress with the other girls trying to help her.“The accused girls and the Hindu girl are friends. All are believed to be minors. That afternoon, they were on their way to a restaurant which crosses the victim’s brother’s shop. They didn’t want him to know about it. Fearful of getting caught, the Hindu girl may have worn her friends’ burqa,” said a police officer, privy to the case.He added that since it is a sensitive matter, the local police registered a case following the complaint filed by the family members.“Further investigation is on to find out the backgrounds of the young girls and their motive, if any, behind the incident,” the officer said. As they are minors, police said, they cannot be immediately put the girls in custody.","The incident took place on Dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother.

"Blue room, broken wall: Clues from 10-year-old help nab rape accused",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blue-room-broken-wall-clues-from-10-year-old-help-nab-rape-accused/articleshow/127340969.cms,"Representative file image

NEW DELHI: A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall leading into a forested ridge helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi’s Prasad Nagar. The child was allegedly abducted, raped and left unconscious in the secluded area by an e-rickshaw driver.In the absence of a name or registration number, investigators said they relied entirely on the visual identification of a red e-ricks-haw with a white roof. TOI had earlier reported the incident, which took place on Jan 11, and the arrest made on Jan 14. Fresh details have since emerged about the investigation that led police to the suspect. The survivor has since been discharged following medical treatment and counselling.The investigation began on Jan 11, when the girl — who supports her family by selling flowers at traffic signals — was brought to a hospital with injuries. She told police she was lured by an e-rickshaw driver on the pretext of being offered tea and taken to a forest patch. Despite being disoriented, she recalled fragments of her surroundings—a “blue-painted room” and a “broken entry point”—providing police with their first lead.DCP (Central) Anant Mittal formed three teams to crack the case. They scanned a 20-sq-km radius, manually inspecting 22 locations with similar features and analysing CCTV footage.The breakthrough came when police examined CCTV footage from Professor Ram Nath Vij Marg, which matched the details shared by the girl. On a deserted stretch of the ridge, officers found a broken stone wall leading to a small structure. The recovery of the girl’s slippers confirmed the crime scene, allowing forensic teams to reconstruct the route taken by the accused between 11 pm and 1 am.“Alongside the ground search, a second team scanned footage from over 100 CCTV cameras. A key lead emerged when a camera recorded a red e-rickshaw with a white roof carrying the minor. Based on this visual, a third team searched e-rickshaw stands in Karol Bagh and Rajendra Place,” a senior officer said.Photographs of suspected drivers were circulated among investigators until the vehicle was traced near a petrol pump in Rajendra Place. Police later spotted a man matching the victim’s description approaching the vehicle. He attempted to flee on noticing the police presence but was chased down and apprehended.The suspect, identified as Durgesh, 25, from Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh, later led police to the recovery of blood-stained clothes.","A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi.

What's cooking in this kitchen? Just synthetic drugs like MDMA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-cooking-in-this-kitchen-just-synthetic-drugs-like-mdma/articleshow/127339356.cms,"Representative image (ANI)

.

NEW DELHI: The south district police have arrested an alleged narcotics kingpin and uncovered a ""chemical kitchen"" of sorts that was operating as a factory for manufacturing high-end psychotropic substances like MDMA and heroin . The action to bust synthetic drug distribution in the city led to the arrest of Emmanuel (36), a Nigerian national. He was held with ready-to-sell heroin.The drug lab was inside the suspect's nondescript house in south Delhi's Devli area. A huge quantity of raw material required for synthesising the drugs was seized, besides the processed heroin.According to police, around 16 kg of crystalline material and 16 kg of grey grain-like substances used as bases for drug synthesis were stored in the house.The haul also included 51 kg of liquids stored in multiple containers and 30 unlabelled glass bottles, all intended for the chemical processing of MDMA and heroin. In total, 113 kg of raw materials was recovered. The heroin and MDMA crystals that could have been made using these chemicals would be worth several crores in the international market.DCP (south) Ankit Chauhan said that the breakthrough came on Jan 20, when a team led by ACP Mukesh Walia and SHO Paras Nath Verma arrested the Nigerian national while he was allegedly on his way to sell the processed heroin. The operation was conducted as part of a drive against organised crime and illegal foreigners.""The police teams were on foot patrol when they spotted the suspect. His attempt to evade the police backfired, leading to a search that revealed the cache of premium heroin worth over a crore. However, as the interrogation deepened, it transitioned from a routine drug bust to the uncovering of a sophisticated manufacturing nexus,"" said a senior police officer.During the raid at his house, the cops stumbled upon the chemicals stored in multiple containers. This massive haul of precursors suggests that the accused was not merely a foot soldier or a distributor, but a ""cook"" or supplier in a larger Nigerian gang operation.According to the investigators, the ability to transform raw, industrial-grade chemicals into ""high-quality"" heroin and MDMA marks a shift from simple smuggling to local production, making this bust significant for Delhi Police . Emmanual had been living in India illegally. By hiding in the dense residential pockets of Devli, he managed to operate under the radar. An FIR has been registered against him under the NDPS Act. Cops are conducting an in-depth investigation as the sheer volume of seizure indicates links to an international cartel.Special CP Madhup Tiwari has formed a team under joint CP Sanjay Jain to bust the supply chain and trace the absconding members of this gang.",The drug lab was inside the suspect's nondescript house in south Delhi's Devli area. A huge quantity of raw material required for synthesising the drugs was seized.

Op Trashi-I: Pak terrorist killed in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kathua,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/op-trashi-i-pak-terrorist-killed-in-jammu-kashmirs-kathua/articleshow/127318018.cms,"Operation Trashi-I: Gunfight Erupts In J&K’s Kishtwar; Eight Army Personnel Injured

JAMMU: Security forces shot dead a Pakistani terrorist belonging to the proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit in Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, even as Operation Trashi-I entered its sixth day on Friday, IGP Bhim Sen Tuti said.The slain ultra, Usman, was one of the most-wanted Jaish terrorists who had been active in the Udhampur-Kathua belt for the past couple of years after having infiltrated into India. “He had escaped several encounters in the past, with the latest ones on Jan 7 and Jan 13, in the forests of Kahog and Najote,” an official said.The Army’s Rising Star Corps, in an X post, stated that earlier in the day, a joint team of the Army, CRPF and J&K Police launched a counter-terrorism operation in Kathua’s Parhetar area based on intelligence inputs. While combing a house, the search party came under fire, triggering an encounter in which Usman was killed in close combat.The fire exchange lasted only a few minutes, officials said, terming the encounter a breakthrough for security forces.With three more Jaish ultras believed trapped in the region, troops continued their hunt under Operation Trashi-I, combing the forests of Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora and adjoining areas in Chatroo belt, notwithstanding treacherous terrain and harsh weather conditions, including snowfall.Operation Trashi-I was launched on Jan 18. That night, an intense gunfight between security personnel and terrorists in Sonnar village near the LoC left eight soldiers injured. One of them, Army Special Forces Commando, Havildar Gajendra Singh, succumbed Jan 19 — the first security force death in a counter-terrorism operation in the Union Territory in 2026.On Jan 20, the cordon was strengthened with the help of aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs, following which, the troops busted a well-concealed terrorist hideout and recovered large quantities of rations, utensils, and consumables. Three-four locals from Sonnar village were detained for questioning, as officials suspected that running such a setup would not have been possible without local help from overground workers.On Jan 21, additional forces were rushed to the operation site to fortify the cordon and block possible escape routes. Amid increased vigil ahead of Republic Day, joint teams of security forces conducted door-to-door searches in localities with a high concentration of Burmese (Rohingyas) and Bangladesh nationals in Bhatindi-Narwal-Rajiv Nagar areas on the outskirts of Jammu, as well as in Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Doda districts as a precautionary measure.After a three-day lull, fresh contact was established with terrorists on Thursday in Kishtwar’s Singhpora. Heavy fire was exchanged between both sides before the ultras managed to escape further into the woods. Meanwhile, in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector, security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation following the alleged sighting of terror suspects in Sumah locality the night before.Operation Trashi-I is the third this year in Jammu division, following clashes earlier this month in Kahog and Najote forests of Billawar in Kathua, south of Pir Panjal range.Kishtwar, a remote district east of the Chenab and south of Kashmir Valley, saw intensified counter-terrorism efforts in 2025 as forces tracked Pakistan-based terrorists through steep terrain and thick forests. At least six gun battles were reported there over seven months. On May 22, an Army trooper was killed and two others wounded in Chatroo. Weeks earlier, three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were shot dead in the same area.Security officials said Kishtwar sits astride a traditional infiltration corridor, with terrorists crossing from Pakistan via Kathua and moving through Udhampur and Doda before heading towards Kashmir valley, using forest cover to evade detection.","The slain ultra, Usman, was one of the most-wanted Jaish terrorists.

A disturbing pattern

NEW DELHI: Families of Hyderabad youths allegedly trapped along the Myanmar–Thailand border have made an urgent appeal to MEA and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying their sons were lured with fake job promises and are now being tortured and held against their will.The issue came into focus on Thursday after All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Owaisi posted on X, urging external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the case of at least 16 Indians allegedly enslaved near the Myanmar–Thailand border. According to Owaisi, three of them are from Hyderabad, from Osman Nagar, Moula Ali and Banjara Hills.Owaisi said all of them were promised jobs in Thailand but were instead taken to the border region and forced into labour. He urged the Centre to act urgently to ensure their safe return.Speaking to PTI on Friday, the mother of one such youth said her son travelled to Thailand on a visit visa after being promised a job that would later be converted into a work visa. She said the interview was conducted through a social media platform.“After reaching there, he was blindfolded and taken to a different city. He was not even aware where he was taken.He was tortured there and made to work for 18–20 hours,” she said. According to her, her son and others were denied food and rest, and were beaten when they asked to leave.She said she last spoke to her son 10 to 15 days ago, when he described his ordeal. His phone and personal belongings were taken away, and he was allowed to use a phone only once a week.The woman said she had approached Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi for help in rescuing her son, but expressed fear that he could face more harassment if his name appeared in the media.A relative of another Hyderabad youth also spoke about a similar situation and appealed for immediate intervention to secure his release.The concerns come amid earlier reports of similar cases from Telangana. Last week, six people from Armoor in Nizamabad district, including a young couple, were brought back to Hyderabad after being allegedly trafficked to Myawaddy in Myanmar, a known cybercrime hub.The Telangana Cyber Security Bureau registered a case after one of the victims complained that he was promised a data entry job in Thailand but was smuggled across the border and forced to work in online scam operations. The victims alleged their passports were seized, they were beaten for missing targets, and were asked to pay money to be released.Officials said 17 victims from Myanmar have returned to Telangana so far.","Families of Hyderabad youths allegedly trapped along Myanmar–Thailand border have made an urgent appeal to MEA and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday asserted that none of its six MLAs in Bihar, elected in last November’s state assembly polls, would desert the party, calling such reports ""bogus news. """"There were rumours that all our MLAs are deserting the party. But all of them were present at today's meeting. These are all bogus news.

The RJD, the largest constituent, contested 143 seats but won only 25. The ruling NDA, led by the BJP and JD(U), registered a landslide victory.Speculation that the legislators might quit the Congress arose when they skipped a feast organised by the party ahead of the Makar Sankranti festival.The MLAs are: Surendra Prasad (Valmiki Nagar), Abhishek Ranjan (Chanpatia), Manoj Bishwas (Forbesganj), Abidur Rahman (Araria), Qamrul Hoda (Kishanganj), and Manohar Prasad Singh (Manihari).","Rumours that all our MLAs are deserting the party.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court judge Justice Girish Kathpalia on Friday recused himself from hearing Congress MP Karti Chidambaram 's petition in the alleged Chinese visa scam case, citing ""personal reasons.""He said, “I don't think I would be able to hear this. Subject to orders of the learned judge in charge, criminal side, list before some other bench for personal reasons,” according to news agency PTI.The matter is now scheduled to be heard next on January 28.Justice Kathpalia follows two other Delhi high court judges, Justices Swarana Kanta Sharma and Anup J Bhambani, who had also recused themselves from hearing the case.On January 15, Justice Sharma directed that the matter be placed before another bench. Four days later, Justice Bhambani passed a similar order.Justice Kathpalia was sworn in as a Delhi high court judge in July 2024. He had earlier recused himself from a case in September 2025, having dealt with the same matter as a principal district and sessions judge.In his petition, Chidambaram, the Lok Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu's Sivaganga and son of Congress veteran and former Union minister P Chidambaram, has challenged the framing of charges of corruption and conspiracy against him in the case, which is being probed by the CBI.In December last year, a trial court had ordered the framing of charges for criminal conspiracy and corruption against Karti Chidambaram and six others in the case.His petition argues that the trial court ""did not apply its judicial mind to the material and documents on record, completely ignoring evidence and statements of witnesses that demonstrate the absence of criminality.""In October 2024, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Karti Chidambaram and others in connection with alleged bribery in facilitating visas for Chinese nationals for the Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) project in 2011, when his father was the Union home minister.The central agency had filed the chargesheet after a two-year probe into its FIR registered in 2022. The FIR alleged that the Punjab-based TSPL was setting up a 1,980 MW thermal power plant, with work outsourced to the Chinese company Shandong Electric Power Construction Corp (SEPCO).","Delhi high court judge Justice Girish Kathpalia on Friday recused himself from hearing Congress MP Karti Chidambaram's petition in the alleged Chinese visa scam case. He said, “I don't think I would be able to hear this. Subject to orders of the learned judge in charge, criminal side, list before some other bench for personal reasons,” according to news agency PTI. The matter is now scheduled to be heard next on January 28.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127269586,imgsize-640171,width-400,resizemode-4/karti-chidambaram-file.jpg"
ECINET to integrate 40+ poll apps: India invites world EMBs to collaborate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ecinet-to-integrate-40-poll-apps-india-invites-world-embs-to-collaborate/articleshow/127262009.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday formally launched ECINET — a single digital platform that onboards over 40 different election-related applications and portals — at the ongoing India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) here, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar offering EC's collaboration to other election management bodies (EMBs) for developing similar platforms for their respective countries.Addressing delegates from around 42 EMBs at the launch of ECINET — which subsumes IT innovations by EC over a protracted timeline of eight years, is as per the election laws and offered in 22 Indian languages and English — Kumar proposed that the EC team behind ECINET can work with the representatives of other EMBs to evolve a similar platform aligned with their laws and in their own language. ""I would request the EMBs to examine this, and if you so request, EC will be more than willing to work with you on this score,"" he said.During bilateral meetings between EC and heads of 32 EMBs — from countries like the US, UK, South Africa, Portugal, Peru, The Philippines and Sri Lanka, etc. — on Thursday, the latter evinced interest in the collaboration offer. India also offered to provide training support to the officials of foreign EMBs through the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM).ECINET was envisaged as a one-stop digital platform by Kumar, along with election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, and its development was announced in May 2025.It onboards more separate EC apps meant to connect citizens, candidates, political parties, election officials, and extend key services like voter registration, electoral roll search, 'track your application', 'know your candidate, 'connect with election officials', 'book-a-call with the BLO', e-EPIC download, near-realtime polling trends, grievance redressal, amongst others.""I formally launch ECINET for the world for better elections... and for a much more transparent and efficient sharing of information with billions of users at all points in time,"" Kumar said at the event.The beta version of ECINET was successfully piloted during the 2025 Bihar assembly elections and the preceding special intensive revision (SIR), enabling EC to deliver enhanced citizen-centric electoral services and make available all election-related information at the click of a button. Suggestions were sought from citizens before giving final shape to the platform. Kumar on Thursday shared that nearly 53,000 suggestions were received and the app was constantly updated, sometimes by the hour.

Viral courtroom exchange: Supreme Court asks lawyer to apologise to Jharkhand HC — what it said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/viral-courtroom-exchange-supreme-court-asks-lawyer-to-apologise-to-jharkhand-hc-what-it-said/articleshow/127259606.cms,".

What unfolded earlier

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked a Jharkhand-based lawyer to tender an unconditional apology before the Jharkhand High Court over a viral courtroom exchange in which he allegedly told a judge, “Don’t cross the limit”.A bench of chief justice Surya Kant and justice Joymalya Bagchi asked the lawyer to submit an affidavit of unconditional apology before a five-judge bench of the high court that had issued a contempt notice against him in October last year. The Supreme Court also told the high court to consider the apology “sympathetically”.The top court took note of the lawyer’s challenge to the high court’s suo motu contempt proceedings. While hearing the matter, the bench recorded that the lawyer had explained he did not intend to disrespect the judge or obstruct judicial proceedings. His senior counsel told the court that the lawyer was “extremely repentant” and willing to offer an unconditional apology.“Having regard to the above-mentioned stand, we dispose of this with liberty to the petitioner to submit an affidavit of unconditional apology before the high court.We request the high court to consider the apology sympathetically,” the bench said in its order.However, the judges also expressed concern over the lawyer’s conduct. The chief justice questioned why the lawyer could not explain his position directly before the high court judges and described his behaviour as defiant.CJI Surya Kant remarked, ""“Why cannot he explain this before the judges? This is his obstinate character. Let him face them… let him explain. If he wants to show eyes there… let him show and then we will see. We know how to deal with this.Justice Joymalya Bagchi also spoke about declining courtroom decorum, saying friction was increasingly becoming a matter of “professional pride” at different levels of the judiciary.During the hearing, senior advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for the lawyer, said live-streamed court proceedings had created new challenges and that even a notice could damage a lawyer’s career.The controversy began on October 16 last year during a hearing before justice Rajesh Kumar of the Jharkhand High Court. The lawyer was representing a client seeking restoration of an electricity connection.Justice Kumar reportedly made observations about the lawyer’s manner of argument and asked the chairman of the Jharkhand state bar council to take cognisance of his conduct. The lawyer then approached the bench, said he would argue “in his own way”, and told the judge, “Don’t cross the limit”.Clips from the live-streamed proceedings later went viral on social media. A five-judge bench of the Jharkhand high court, led by then chief Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan, subsequently took suo motu cognisance of the matter and issued a contempt notice to the lawyer.",The Supreme Court has asked a Jharkhand-based lawyer to tender an unconditional apology.

"Low Vitamin D may worsen Dengue outcomes, global study raises questions for India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/low-vitamin-d-may-worsen-dengue-outcomes-global-study-raises-questions-for-india/articleshow/127236738.cms,"Photo for representative purpose only

NEW DELHI: A clinical study from Colombia, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, the peer-reviewed journal of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has found that low vitamin D levels are linked to more severe dengue, a finding with clear relevance for India, where both dengue and vitamin D deficiency are widespread.Dengue remains a recurring public health challenge in the country, especially during the monsoon, when hospitals see sharp rises in patients with high fever, falling platelet counts and bleeding complications. While many recover with supportive care, a significant proportion deteriorate rapidly, and predicting severity remains difficult.In the Colombian study, researchers analysed blood samples from nearly 100 laboratory-confirmed dengue patients, classified by disease severity, and compared them with healthy individuals. They measured serum vitamin D levels along with miRNA-155, a molecule that regulates immune and inflammatory responses. Patients with milder dengue had higher vitamin D levels, while those with warning signs or severe disease showed significant deficiency.At the same time, miRNA-155 levels rose steadily with increasing severity, indicating an exaggerated immune response. The study also found an inverse relationship between vitamin D and inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, both linked to severe dengue and complications like dengue haemorrhagic fever.Commenting on the findings, Dr R. Goswami, professor of endocrinology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the study strengthens earlier evidence linking low vitamin D with severe dengue, particularly dengue haemorrhagic fever. “What this study adds is a possible disease mechanism through microRNA-155, which is involved in immune dysregulation via Th1 and Th2 pathways,” he said, adding that it is prudent to maintain normal levels.Doctors say the findings resonate with Indian clinical experience. Dr Pankaj Soni, principal director (internal medicine) at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, said low vitamin D is associated with bleeding and complications and may worsen inflammation and viral replication, making it a modifiable risk factor but not a treatment. Dr Atul Gogia, head of infectious diseases at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said severe dengue is often driven by a cytokine storm, and correcting deficiency could help reduce complications, though larger, well-controlled trials are needed.India continues to face a heavy dengue burden, with about 1.13 lakh cases and 95 deaths reported till November 2025, and much higher numbers recorded in peak years such as 2023. At the same time, national studies show vitamin D deficiency affects a large majority of Indians across age and income groups. Experts caution against self-medication but say the study highlights the need for India-specific research to examine whether correcting widespread deficiency could help identify high-risk patients early and reduce dengue-related complications.","Study from Colombia finds low vitamin D levels linked to more severe dengue.

Travellers have been advised to check the latest status of their flights before heading to the airport, as operations will resume only after weather conditions improve.Cold conditions tightened their grip across Kashmir on Thursday as minimum temperatures dipped further at most locations, with officials warning that an approaching western disturbance could bring fresh snowfall later in the day.Night temperatures fell below the freezing point across the valley. In Srinagar, the minimum temperature dropped by one degree from the previous night to settle at minus 3.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday night.The coldest spot in the valley was Sonamarg in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, where the mercury plunged to minus 6.1 degrees Celsius, compared to minus 5.5 degrees Celsius a night earlier.

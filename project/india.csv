Bihar polls: EC allows 12 alternative documents apart from EPIC for voting; special arrangements for 'purdanasheen',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-ec-allows-12-alternative-documents-apart-from-epic-for-voting-special-arrangements-for-purdanasheen/articleshow/124443282.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday issued detailed instructions to ensure proper voter identification ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, including special arrangements for women in burqa or purdah, amid heightened scrutiny over electoral rolls and voter verification.In a press note, the poll body said, ""To encourage participation of 'purdanasheen' (in burqa or purdah) women, special arrangements shall be made at the Polling Stations as per extant instructions for their dignified identification in the presence of lady Polling Officers/Attendants while ensuring their privacy.""The ECI said it is empowered under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, to issue Electors’ Photo Identity Cards (EPICs) to facilitate identification and prevent impersonation at polling stations. Nearly 100% of voters in Bihar and the eight constituencies going to bye-elections have already received EPICs. The Commission also directed Chief Electoral Officers to ensure delivery of EPICs to new voters within 15 days of final publication of electoral rolls.For voters unable to produce an EPIC, the ECI on October 7, 2025, allowed the use of 12 alternative photo identity documents, including Aadhaar cards, MNREGA job cards, bank or post office passbooks with photographs, health insurance smart cards, driving licenses, PAN cards, Indian passports, pension documents with photographs, government service identity cards, official MP/MLA/MLC IDs, and Unique Disability ID (UDID) cards.The Commission reiterated that inclusion on the electoral roll is a prerequisite for voting.The instructions come amid a political debate over voter verification. Last week, Bihar BJP president Dilip Jaiswal urged the ECI to ensure “proper verification” so that only “genuine voters” can cast ballots, particularly highlighting burqa-clad women. “We have urged the ECI to ensure that the tallying of faces of voters, especially burqa-clad women, must be ensured with respective EPIC cards so that only genuine voters get to exercise their franchise,” he said. Jaiswal also suggested deploying paramilitary forces in villages with sizeable weaker-section populations to prevent intimidation during polling.The move drew criticism from the opposition. Abhay Kushwaha of the RJD, which leads the Mahagathbandhan coalition, called the BJP proposal “a political conspiracy.” He added, “Only recently has the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls been carried out. New EPIC cards are to be issued to all voters with fresh photographs. Identification of voters is no big deal. But the BJP wants to push its own agenda.”The RJD also requested the ECI to disclose details of 3.66 lakh names deleted from the final electoral roll and urged the poll panel to restrain the NDA government from making “populist announcements” without budgetary allocation and curb personal attacks during the campaign.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) issued detailed instructions to ensure proper voter identification ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.

"HC bins Roche's injunction plea, allows generic version of only drug for SMA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-bins-roches-injunction-plea-allows-generic-version-of-only-drug-for-sma/articleshow/124441574.cms,"A division bench of Delhi high court Thursday rejected the appeal of pharma giant, Roche, seeking an injunction against Indian pharma company Natco Pharma launching a generic version of Risdiplam, the only available drug to treat a rare genetic disorder, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This comes as a major relief for Indian SMA patients.Govt's one-time aid of Rs 50 lakh for patients of rare diseases was not enough to cover even a year's treatment using Roche's patented version of Risdiplam, but at Natco's price for the generic version of the drug, treatment cost could be covered for 10-16 years.In March this year, a single-judge bench of Delhi HC rejected Roche's injunction plea against Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma in a patent infringement dispute related to Risdiplam. Roche's patent expires only in March 2035. However, Natco applied for a patent for an improved process for the preparation of Risdiplam and intermediates in Sept 2022. The court had ruled Natco had prima facie raised credible challenges to the validity of Roche's patent and ruled in favour of Natco.Several public health groups had opposed Roche seeking a permanent injunction against Natco, arguing that Roche's patent infringement lawsuit against Natco prioritised profits over patients' access to affordable treatment, potentially violating India's National Rare Disease Policy.Roche's patented medicine costs roughly Rs 6 lakh a bottle. An individual with a body weight of over 20kg needs roughly 2.5-3 bottles per month, or 30-36 bottles per year. Roche gives two bottles for free if you buy one, and so the patient would have to pay about Rs 60-72 lakh per year for treatment, unaffordable for most patients in India. Drug costing experts peg the cost of producing the drug at roughly Rs 3,000 for a year's supply.In April, Natco revealed in a ""legal update regarding Risdiplam launch in India"" that the ""company has decided to price the product (Risdiplam) at Rs 15,900"" per 60mg bottle, reducing the price by as much as 97%. This would bring down the cost to less than Rs 5 lakh per year. Bulk buying by govt could bring down the price to Rs 10,000 per bottle, which could bring the cost down to Rs 3.1 lakh per year, said health activists. The financial assistance for patients with rare diseases was increased to Rs 50 lakh in Sept 2024. At Natco's price, those living with SMA would be able to afford treatment for up to 16 years.The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment welcomed HC's decision and said it highlighted harmful effects of patent evergreening, which could delay access to affordable medicines and lead to unnecessary litigation. It reaffirmed that access to lifesaving drugs should not depend on one's ability to pay.","Roche's patent expires only in March 2035.

HISAR: Amid reports of youths from Fatehabad, Rohtak, Ambala and Sonipat trapped in the Russia-Ukraine war, concern has deepened over the fate of a youth from Hisar district. Sonu, 28, from Madanheri village is feared to have been killed in the conflict, while his companion, Aman, 24, from the same village has been missing since September 22.Both men went to Russia in May 2024 to pursue a foreign language course. Their families said their visas were nearing expiry and they were expected to return soon. What came instead was a claim that Sonu had died. Aman's brother Sunil said on September 3 Aman called home and said he and Sonu were being deceived into joining the Russian army and being sent to fight in Ukraine. ""He told us he didn't want to join the army and begged us to save him,"" Sunil said.On Sept 19, Sonu's uncle Billu received a message on Telegram app, purportedly from a Russian official, which, after translation, stated that Sonu had been missing since Sept 6 and that his body had been found. The family was asked to come to Moscow to claim the body.Russian govt doesn't bear the expense of transporting the body and will at best take it to a Russian airport, the message said. The family has to pay for the flight to India, and if they couldn't afford it, Sonu would be buried in ""Leningrad's Oblast"", it said.Sunil said that on Sept 22, Aman made a video call and told him he was recruited into the Russian army under the pretext of a security job, and that money from his bank account was withdrawn. Since then, the family has lost contact with him as well. The families have approached MHA the ministry of home affairs seeking help, but have yet to receive a satisfactory response.On Oct 7, an email from Tadu Mamu, counsellor at the Indian embassy in Moscow, arrived on Sonu's uncle Billu's email ID saying the Russian authorities have not yet confirmed Sonu's death and that the embassy would share updates once official information was received.The families have appealed to MHA and Indian embassy in Moscow for assistance.","Sonu, 28, from Madanheri village is feared to have been killed in the conflict.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday filled a 75-year-old constitutional vacuum that caused serious heartburn among judicial service officers, who took 15-20 years to become district judges through promotions and were left behind in career progression by advocates who with just seven years experience could become district judges through direct recruitment.A five-judge bench of CJI B R Gavai, M M Sundresh, Arvind Kumar, S C Sharma and K V Chandran interpreted Article 233 of Constitution, which was silent on the experience of career judicial officers to get promoted as district judges, to provide a uniform criteria of seven years experience for both trial judges and advocates to make them eligible to compete for the posts.CJI Gavai said, ""A person who has been or who is in judicial service and has a combined experience of seven years or more as an advocate or a judicial officer would be eligible for being considered and appointed as a district judge/additional district judge under Article 233 of Constitution."" Referring to the Shetty Commission recommendations, SC rejected the plea that permitting young trial judges with seven years combined experience as advocate and judicial officer would make them leapfrog over senior judicial officers who preferred the promotion chain to reach the post.The CJI said, ""If a person is meritorious and on account of merit alone gets selected directly as a district judge, there can be no question of heartburn for those who are not as meritorious..."" Supreme Court provided an uniform eligibility age of 35 years for both advocates and judicial officers.

The case: Rolex seizure at IGI Airport

₹1.8 lakh as redemption fine

A penalty equivalent to AED 6,250

Warehousing charges accumulated since the seizure

Poll Should customs authorities provide clearer guidelines for classifying personal vs. commercial items? Yes, clearer guidelines are needed No, current rules are sufficient

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, thereby allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while also reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive personal item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also strongly urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such broad, blanket assumptions may not stand up to thorough judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, hefty fines, or confiscation, even if the items are clearly personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly intended for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

Departments have also been advised to create a pool of academically outstanding final-year law students, who can assist with legal research, drafting, and other aspects of litigation.Officials said that the PM urged all department heads to reduce litigations and also to draft legislations in easy to understand and simple language for convenience of citizens. The meeting had lasted for more than two hours where different secretaries had made their observations and suggestion.TOI has learnt that taking forward his swadeshi pitch and to reduce imports, Modi asked secretaries to interact with domestic manufacturers to identify products that can be produced domestically and that the departments should handhold those industries to facilitate efficient manufacturing of the identified products locally.

NEW DELHI: In a surprise move, Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, positioning itself as an alternative to both the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan. The decision has added an interesting variable as strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj also debuts this time in what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Party leaders said AAP aims to introduce its ""Delhi-Punjab model"" of governance in Bihar, focusing on education, healthcare and anti-corruption measures. The leadership believes widespread public frustration with unemployment, migration and poor infrastructure has created space for a new brand of issue-based politics in the state.""We have an approved model of growth and governance. The work done by the Aam Aadmi Party is being discussed across the country. People hailing from the Purvanchal region had contributed immensely to our victory in Delhi,"" AAP's state in-charge Ajesh Yadav said while announcing the decision.""Our national convener Arvind Kejriwal asked if they can help us form a government in Delhi, then why not in Bihar?"" he added.AAP’s move comes at a time when the opposition bloc - RJD, Congress, and Left parties - is struggling to finalise a seat-sharing formula ahead of the polls. The AAP, which earlier announced its decision to part ways from INDIA bloc in July, shortly after Delhi election debacle, has again chosen to chart an independent course in Bihar.Kejriwal's move is being widely seen as a response to the rise of Prashant Kishor, who has visited almost every corner of Bihar with an aim of grassroot expansion in the last couple of years. Prashant Kishor is promising an alternative to the traditional contest between the BJP-JD(U) and RJD-Congress that heavily depends on caste politics.AAP MP Sanjay Singh explained this: ""We have already delivered on the ground, but Prashant Kishore is making promises only. Making promises and actually implementing them on the ground are two very different things,"" Singh said.Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, as a strategist, played a pivotal role in AAP's success, especially in Delhi. His I-PAC collaborated closely with AAP charting out campaign strategies that helped AAP win massive once again in 2020.The timing of this bet also seems to be perfect for Kejriwal, and Prashant Kishor, as with nearly two decades of Nitish Kumar-led governance, political fatigue seems to have set in among voters, creating what some see as an opportune moment for a third front. It's a formula that once worked for Kejriwal in Delhi where AAP dethroned Congress mired in corruption and anti-incumbency.The same story was repeated in Punjab where AAP defeated the two traditional parties of Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal that had ruled the state for seven decades. AAP was seen as a party offering a fresh, corruption-free alternative, building on its reputation for delivering welfare policies and good governance in Delhi.In Bihar, Kishor has been attempting a similar style of politics, and now Kejriwal’s party has entered the fray, vying for the same space. But will Kejriwal's party succeed in making inroads in a state like Bihar or will it just vanish in thin air? We will not have to wait long to know, as the state votes in two phases on November 6 and 11. The decision will be known on November 14 when the election result is announced.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.

When Bhushan said veracity of the affidavits can be inquired into, the bench said, ""After experiencing such false affidavits, how can we trust these? We are not in the business of conducting inquiry.""""We would have been with you had you given details of persons whose names have been deleted without intimation from the final voter list and whether their appeals have been disposed of without proper hearing. We could have intervened. Why not a single instance cited by you? It seems there is too much passion and little reason,"" the bench told ADR's counsel.However, the bench ensured that no name is deleted from the voters' list without following procedure and directed DLSA to deploy para-legal volunteers to inquire from booth level officers about the persons whose names figure in the deletion list of 3.75 lakh, which is in addition to 65 lakh, and facilitate them in filing an appeal against deletion.On EC's charge that the affidavit contained false information amounting to perjury, Bhushan said, ""It was given to me by a responsible person. If EC is having a problem with it, the court can direct legal services authorities to inquire into it.""Justice Bagchi said, ""EC has demonstrated that the facts are incorrect. If the person who has filed the affidavit is not found at the address given, how would legal services authority inquire into it. Inquiry does not rectify falsehood."" EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, said once the allegation is found to be false, the NGO would now change the narrative. ""Their aim is to create a narrative through analysis based on wrong data,"" he said.Social activist Yogendra Yadav took over from Bhushan and alleged that the SIR of Bihar's electoral rolls has been weaponised to exclude a large chunk of voters, especially women. He said because of SIR, around 80 lakh voters have been deleted from the list. Based on data and graphics presented by him, the bench said till 2023, the number of voters in Bihar exceeded the total adult population. When Yadav said it was a problem which was cured subsequently, the bench said, ""If it (total number of voters ) was 105% of total adult population, it is a crisis not a problem. ""Yadav said there are still several lakh voters with the same name and same address. EC should employ software to delete duplicate names from the final voter list, he said, which invited sarcastic comments from Dwivedi, who said, ""Till now they were seeking inclusion.

The two have alleged that Priya usurped their father's assets by presenting a forged will.During the hearing of a suit challenging division of Sunjay's assets, reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Samaira and Kiaan Raj, said: ""She (Priya) has made these children the cynosure of every kidnapper's dream. She has put them in danger by disclosing how much they get from the assets. Who is really greedy? She is getting 60% of the assets and 75% of the trust. She is no benign stepmother but Cinderella's stepmom. ""Jethmalani alleged before a bench of Justice Jyoti Singh that Priya was in a ""glaring hurry"" to restrict the children's share, and carried out a ""clumsy forgery"" of the will. He claimed there was ""enough evidence"" to probe the forgery, and sought a status quo on the movement of Sunjay's assets. ""She (Priya) is a nominee, and she holds the assets.How far the forgery of documents goes will have to be unravelled - there is enough evidence to conduct a probe,"" he added.Questioning the authenticity of the will presented by Priya, Jethmalani further claimed that Sunjay did not consult a lawyer while making it. ""Sunjay's digital footprints are nowhere; the digital footprints are there of the conspirators to a serious crime, which is forgery of a will,"" the senior lawyer argued, pointing out that the will's executor got it just one day before its reading.He alleged that the will was modified when Sunjay was on a holiday with his son, adding that those who forged the document got rewarded.HC will resume hearing the matter on Oct 13. The court last month asked Priya to furnish a list of his assets and allowed her to file it in a sealed cover, even as she questioned the claim filed by the two children.

BENGALURU: Karnataka cabinet, chaired by CM Siddaramaiah, Thursday approved a policy granting one paid menstrual leave every month (12 in a year) to women employees across all sectors - including government offices, garment factories, IT firms, MNCs, and private industrial units. The initiative is expected to benefit over 50 lakh women in the state, and the policy is likely to be notified soon.CM Siddaramaiah described the policy as a step toward creating a more humane, understanding, and inclusive workplace. With this move, Karnataka joins Bihar and Odisha in granting menstrual leave to women employees. While Bihar restricts the benefit to women government staff (two days per month), Odisha offers 12 such leaves annually to women employees across all sectors.Law Commission of Karnataka drafted the Karnataka Menstrual Leave and Hygiene Bill, 2025, proposing 12 days of leave for working women and two days every month for students. Of the 75 stakeholder responses received, 56 supported the move. The draft prescribes a fine of up to Rs 5,000 for employers who deny leave or discriminate against menstruating employees.According to the government's Periodic Labour Force Survey, Karnataka has one of the highest female labour force participation rates in the country, at 31.5%. Bengaluru, with a population of 14 million, is home to thousands of startups and MNCs such as Walmart and Google , as well as major Indian tech firms like Infosys and Wipro Labour minister Santosh Lad said the policy had been worked out over the past year. ""Women shoulder multiple responsibilities, from household chores to caring for children. During menstruation, they experience physical and mental stress.

"SC: There's no age bar for having kids or adoption, then why for surrogacy?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-theres-no-age-bar-for-having-kids-or-adoption-then-why-for-surrogacy/articleshow/124441445.cms,"SC: Not for state to question couple's ability to parent kids

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that an age bar on aspiring parents under the surrogacy law cannot be enforced retrospectively, and those who froze their embryos before commencement of the law, that is Jan 25, 2022, would be allowed to go for surrogacy irrespective of their age. It also raised questions over the rationality behind the age restrictions when there is no age bar for procreation or adoption.The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act sets age limits for intending parents and surrogate mothers. It says the intending mother must be between 23 and 50 years, and the intending father between 26 and 55. The surrogate mother must be married and be between 25 and 35 years, have a biological child, and act as a surrogate only once in her lifetime. It allows single women (widowed or divorced) between 35 and 45 to pursue surrogacy.The bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of Centre justifying the restrictions on the ground that children born out of surrogacy would not be cared for properly if the intending mother and father, one or both, are above the prescribed age-limit(s) under the Act.""In the present case, the parenting capabilities of the couple are being used to assail their eligibility to have children through surrogacy...It is not for the State to question the couple's ability to parent children after they had begun the exercise of surrogacy when there were no restrictions on them to do so,"" the bench said.The bench allowed the plea of three couples who are in their 50s and 60s and had frozen their embryos before 2022. They moved SC after the authority under the law refused to permit them to move to the next step in the surrogacy process. Giving a ray of hope to all similarly placed couples, the court said they can approach HCs for similar relief.It also clarified that it was not questioning the wisdom of Parliament on its prescription of age limits under the Act, and the issue before it was limited to couples who had commenced the surrogacy process before the enforcement of the Act. Petitions challenging the age bar are already pending before SC.""Thus, prior to the enforcement of the Act, the right to pursue surrogacy despite one's age did not impinge on any of the above considerations and was solely in the decision-making domain of the intending couple. It was a personal decision, with personal consequences. Although the Union of India has argued that age-limits are directly related to the welfare of children, as explained above, we are unable to accept this submission in view of the unlimited freedom afforded to couples who wish to conceive children naturally, irrespective of their age,"" the bench said.""Thus, if an intending couple had - (i) commenced the surrogacy procedure prior to the commencement of the Act; (ii) were at the stage of creation of embryos and freezing after extraction of gametes; (iii) and on the threshold of transfer of embryos to the uterus of the surrogate mother, the age restriction under Section 4(iii)(c)(I) of the Act would not apply,"" the court said.Centre had taken the stand that the law should be applied retrospectively due to concerns over the declining quality of gametes with age and the potential impact of the same on children born through surrogacy.Rejecting it, SC said, ""On the basis of concerns over gamete quality, the law does not fetter couples who wish to bear children naturally. Moreover, there is no age bar for couples who wish to adopt children under the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, which personal law applies to the intending couples herein.""","The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act sets age limits for intending parents and surrogate mothers.

Law minister Jogaram Patel said the Act had now also been notified.Putting an end to the traditional notion of 'chat mangni-pat byaah (prompt wedding)', the new law mandates that priests or clerics inform the district administration of inter-religious weddings they are about to officiate over, at least two months in advance. The law also says individuals getting married must inform the district magistrate at least three months in advance.Failure to adhere to these mandates will lead to penalties for ""forced conversions"", including imprisonment of 7 to 14 years and fines starting at Rs 5 lakh. Penalties escalate significantly if the victim is from a protected group, such as women, minors, Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, with jail terms of up to 20 years and fines of at least Rs 10 lakh. Mass conversions could result in life imprisonment and fines not less than Rs 25 lakh.The Act stipulates that all offences will be non-bailable and will be tried exclusively in a sessions court, with repeat offenders facing life sentences and fines of up to Rs 50 lakh.Additionally, marriages conducted solely for conversion purposes will be deemed void.This was Rajasthan govt's second attempt at passing the anti-conversion law. An earlier legislation passed in 2008 when Vasundhara Raje was chief minister could not be enacted as it was returned by then President Pratibha Patil. In the present instance, Governor Bagde granted assent to the legislation, making a referral to the president unnecessary.Minister of state (MoS) Home, Jawahar Singh Bedham, has described the Rajasthan law as the ""strictest in the country"".","Governor Haribhau Bagde granted assent to Rajasthan Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Act, 2025.

New Delhi: With winter knocking and the mountain passes in Jammu and Kashmir set to become snow-bound, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday reviewed the law and order situation in the Union Territory and asked the forces to be on 100% alert against any attempts by Pakistan and PoK-based terrorists to exploit the snowfall and infiltrate across the border.The J&K review meeting - attended by LG Manoj Sinha, the Union home secretary, Intelligence Bureau director, Chief of Army Staff, central paramilitary forces heads and the chief secretary and DGP of J&K - took stock of the security scenario, particularly in the aftermath of the April 22 terror strike in Pahalgam, in which 26 persons including 25 tourists from different parts of the country, were brutally gunned down. The attack prompted retaliatory strikes by the Indian forces as part of Operation Sindoor, which not only destroyed only terror hubs but also caused heavy damage to military facilities in Pakistan. The military assets were hit after the Pakistani forces tried to target civilian and secrurity facilities in India.At the J&K review meeting here on Thursday, Shah reaffirmed PM Modi government's unwavering commitment to achieving the goal of a terrorism-free Jammu and Kashmir. He said that thanks to the sustained efforts of the security agencies, ""the terrorist network nurtured by enemies of the nation in Jammu and Kashmir has been crippled"".Shah also assured that all necessary resources will continue to be provided to take these efforts further.

NEW DELHI: Acting swiftly on projects of strategic significance following suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), an expert committee of the environment ministry has recommended environmental clearance for constructing the Sawalkot hydroelectric project on Chenab in Ramban district of J&K.The 1,856-MW project is a major hydropower initiative on Chenab, one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum that currently flow unchecked to Pakistan despite India's right to use it for non-consumptive purposes, including hydro-power generation. The construction will begin after meeting UT govt's formalities.The Sawalkot hydroelectric project by NHPC is a run-of-the-river project that will be using water of Chenab river in Ramban, Reasi and Udhampur districts of the UT.It will be constructed in two phases (6x225MW & 1x56MW for Stage 1, and 2x225MW for Stage 2) in an area of 1,401 hectares at an estimated cost of Rs 31,380 crore. The project will include a 192.5m-high concrete dam, an upstream short water channel, an underground power station, and a system to carry water back to the river.The expert appraisal committee of environment ministry on river valley and hydroelectric projects, while granting green clearances during its last meeting on Sept 26, has specified certain ""environment conditions"" and safeguards.According to minutes of the September 26 meeting, released on Thursday, the environment conditions include setting up a dedicated team to oversee environmental management activities, installing an online monitoring system for e-flow releases and a detailed mechanism of compensation for land acquisition for the project.In addition to several socio-economic and disaster management security conditions, the panel also made it mandatory to undertake a study on the project's impact on environment, by an independent agency five years after commissioning of the project. It also asked the project proponent to obtain forest clearance under the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1986, in case of diversion of forest land for non-forest purpose involved in the project, and clearance from National Board for Wildlife, if applicable.The project, with its water storage capacity, will also help India utilise additional waters as the nation, at present, doesn't have the capacity to store even 3.6 million acre-feet (MAF) of water on western rivers, the share which was allowed to it under Indus Waters Treaty. Similarly, so far, India has built only 3,482MW capacity of hydro-power generation units from western rivers out of an estimated potential of about 20,000MW.","The 1,856-MW project is a major hydropower initiative on Chenab, one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum that currently flow unchecked to Pakistan.

An anabolic phase of the clock that heals the catabolism (breakdowns) of the day, relaxes the fatigued muscles, quietens the central and autonomic nervous system to keep neurological activity to a minimum, so as to rest the mind, only to deliver to a 'rejuvenated' morrow.Let's go into the lesser known pros of uninterrupted and thus, productive sleep.Consolidation of memories and sharpening of skills by allowing the rest time to process the daytime information. The best computer ever made, the human mind, assimilates, processes and formats the inputs into the brain hard disc. The immaculate methodology is unique, but just like a power interruption that stalls your laptop, sleep too should not be in fits and starts.Sleep also regulates emotions and down regulates stress, leading to upliftment of mood. All this by a mechanism of purging toxins that accumulate during waking and this is vital for preserving brain health.Did you know that healthy sleep helps weight management by regulating hormones that control appetite and fat-burn that is kindled by the good sleep metabolism. Ipso facto, the morning after the workout, then translates into weight loss. The impetus that a good night's sleep gives to the immune system cannot be understated. Whether bacteria, viruses or whatever, the ability to fight the invader is enhanced. No amount of zinc, ginger or 'kada' can substitute sleep for boosting immunity.It's not about the duration of sleep alone that's important, it's the sustained rest with the biochemical shutdown that counts. With 7 to 8 hours for adults and more for teenagers and much more for children, more than the quantum, it's the regularity of sleep at almost the same time of evening that reaps the best harvest. The body clock acclimatizes, the mind refreshes and you can make the candle burn longer rather than only brighter.The million-dollar modus operandi is inducing natural sleep. Your regular quota of physical activity, the abstinence of caffeine later in the day and keeping your TV in the living room (not bedroom) while shunning screen time 45 minutes before the anointed time helps, sedatives should be the absolute last resort. From chamomile tea and valerian root, to bedtime magnesium, L theanine, and hops, a lot of natural measures can be initially used to mould the habit. Lavender and passion flower, all hold their specific places and to each his own. Melatonin is physiological and safe in appropriate doses for the prescribed duration. The golden hour is usually between 10pm and 11pm and coaxing the body and mind regularly for some time, establishes the routine. A quiet, cool and darkened environment is obviously conducive and adds a lot to the show. While a short power nap for senior citizens is acceptable, the thumb rule is to avoid lying down during the day. The bed should be used for sleep and sex and, of course, for the sick. (alliteration intended) A good sleep means going to and getting up at almost similar times every day. That allows the human geno and phenotype to moult out of the previous day and be reborn.'Fatigued, but when I lay down, sleep doesn't come'. This is the stress manifesting as a fight or flight response making it hard to relax.It's getting into the regime that requires dedication and maybe help, but once disciplined, you soon start merrily dreaming, which incidentally is a sign of good sleep. I have intentionally left out medical conditions like sleep apnoea, and cardiopulmonary diseases which are pathological causes.I want you to 'sleep over' this nocturnal psalm and try and incorporate the advice to your benefit.

Oilers ownership reportedly getting restless over contract delay

TSN's Darren Dreger On McDavid & Crosby's Futures, 2025 Flames & More | The Insider Hotline

Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress..“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times.

Turning Point USA promises a “patriotic alternative” to Bad Bunny’s halftime show

Bad Bunny fires back at critics and doubles down on representation

The NFL ’s decision to name Bad Bunny as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has sparked one of the most polarizing cultural debates in recent memory. While millions of fans worldwide celebrated the Puerto Rican megastar’s appointment, conservative circles — led by Turning Point USA, the late Charlie Kirk’s right-wing political organization — are striking back with their own plan: a rival event called The All American Halftime Show.On Thursday, Turning Point USA’s official X (formerly Twitter) account confirmed the initiative, writing, “It’s true, Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce The All American Halftime Show. Performers and event details coming soon.”The announcement follows a week of escalating backlash from conservative commentators who claim Bad Bunny’s selection represents a cultural shift that sidelines traditional American performers. Critics have also resurfaced the artist’s past remarks about U.S. immigration enforcement and his outspoken criticism of former president Donald Trump .For Turning Point, the timing is deliberate. The group, known for its fusion of pop culture and politics, is positioning the rival concert as a “celebration of American values,” a move that could appeal to disenchanted NFL fans who see the league’s halftime programming as increasingly political.Meanwhile, Bad Bunny has shown no signs of backing down. Hosting Saturday Night Live, the global superstar addressed the controversy with confidence and pride.“I’m very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” he said.Switching to Spanish, he added, “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us.

Bad Bunny’s global influence outweighs critics’ complaints

When the NFL confirmed that Bad Bunny would headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, the news sent waves through both the music and sports worlds. The Puerto Rican megastar’s selection marked a historic shift, he would be the first artist to perform the show primarily in Spanish, signaling a bold embrace of Latin culture on America’s biggest stage. But as the applause rolled in, so did the criticism.Model and media personality Kayla Nicole, who once dated Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , addressed the uproar on her podcast Pre-Game, sharing a sharp take on what the public reaction revealed. “I think that the discourse, too, around this whole Benito halftime show, I’m just thankful for moments like this,” she said.She added, “Because every time it happens, anything that has like any level of cultural significance, I know exactly who I need to unfollow and delete out of my f*****g life, because the racist people will tell on themselves every single time.”Her remarks struck a chord online, as social media debates over Bad Bunny’s performance quickly turned into conversations about language, culture, and inclusivity. Some fans questioned whether a Spanish-language show belonged in the Super Bowl, claiming they wouldn’t understand the lyrics.Nicole brushed off those complaints, pointing out the hypocrisy behind them. “The amount of people complaining because they’re not going to be able to understand the words because they don’t know Spanish,” she said.“I’ve listened to so much, so many genres where I don’t know what they’re talking about, but I still love a beat.”At just 31, Bad Bunny has become a cultural force unlike any other. With three Grammy wins, 10 nominations, and billions of streams, he’s helped redefine what global stardom looks like. His selection for the Super Bowl isn’t just about entertainment, it’s a statement about where American pop culture is headed.Also Read: Speaker Mike Johnson accuses NFL of turning ‘anti-American’ after picking Bad Bunny for Super Bowl halftime show While critics question whether a Spanish-led performance fits the Super Bowl’s mainstream tradition, Nicole and many fans see it differently. To them, this halftime show represents something far greater, a celebration of diversity that refuses to bow to outdated expectations. And as Nicole made clear, the outrage says far more about those clinging to old biases than about Bad Bunny himself.","Model and media personality Kayla Nicole addressed the uproar over Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show on her podcast Pre-Game.

Is Jalen Carter playing tonight?



How Jalen Carter’s injury impacts the Eagles’ defense



The Philadelphia Eagles will be missing one of their biggest defensive weapons in Thursday night’s NFC East showdown against the New York Giants. Star defensive tackle Jalen Carter has been ruled inactive due to a heel injury, marking another setback for the reigning Super Bowl champions as they continue to battle early-season adversity.No, Jalen Carter will not suit up against the Giants. The Second-Team All-Pro appeared on the Eagles’ injury report Wednesday after limited practice participation with a heel issue. Despite traveling with the team and joining pregame warmups briefly, Carter was declared inactive just hours before kickoff.NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo confirmed the update, noting that Carter “was on the field only briefly, signing autographs and speaking with agent Drew Rosenhaus before leaving the field.” The absence is significant, as this marks the second game this season that Carter will miss.Philadelphia’s defensive line will have to adjust quickly. The Eagles elevated defensive tackle Gabe Hall from the practice squad earlier Thursday, joining Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo, Byron Young, and Ty Robinson to anchor the middle of the defense. The reshuffled group faces added pressure to fill the massive void left by Carter, who has been a disruptive force when healthy.Carter’s absence couldn’t have come at a worse time. The Eagles’ defense, built around its fierce pass rush, relies heavily on Carter’s ability to collapse pockets and disrupt plays from the interior. Without him, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio may need to tweak his approach, leaning more on Jordan Davis and Byron Young to contain the Giants’ offensive line.Philadelphia’s injury list doesn’t end there. Pro Bowl left guard Landon Dickerson (ankle) and tight end Grant Calcaterra (oblique) have both been ruled out for Week 6, further testing the team’s depth. However, there’s some relief with linebacker Nakobe Dean’s return from a knee injury, offering a spark to the defense in Carter’s absence.Carter’s heel injury adds to a turbulent season already marked by highs and lows, including his early-season ejection for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. The Eagles now face the challenge of keeping momentum alive without their defensive anchor as they aim for another deep playoff run.Also Read: Saquon Barkley’s fiancée Anna gets emotional watching his heartwarming pregame moment with daughter before facing former team",Jalen Carter has been ruled out of Thursday night's game against the New York Giants.

How Brittany Mahomes became a lightning rod for criticism

How she learned to rise above the noise

Brittany Mahomes has long been one of the most polarizing figures in NFL circles, not for anything she’s done on the field, but for how openly she lives her life off it. As the wife of Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes , Brittany has spent years navigating fame, online criticism, and the often unforgiving microscope that comes with being part of the NFL’s most-watched power couple.From her outspoken opinions to her viral game-day moments, Brittany has never shied away from expressing herself \ and fans have never hesitated to respond. One of her most talked-about incidents came in January 2022, when she popped a bottle of champagne after a Chiefs playoff win and sprayed it into the crowd, earning mixed reactions from viewers. Some called it tone-deaf, while others defended it as pure joy in the moment.She’s also drawn heat for her candid social media activity. Back in August 2024, she was criticized for liking Instagram comments expressing political support for Donald Trump , including one that read “TRUMP-VANCE 2024.” The backlash was swift, but Brittany didn’t stay silent. Responding to critics, she wrote, “I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood.”It wasn’t the first time she’s clashed with fans. Dating back to 2018, Brittany has been known to call out referees during Chiefs games, famously tweeting that “refs are never in our favor” after a controversial loss to the Buffalo Bills.In recent interviews, Brittany has taken a reflective tone, admitting that the online attention once got to her but that she’s learned to handle it with the help of her husband. Speaking on the WHOOP podcast, she said, “Having him to help me get through it has helped a lot, because he is very good at managing those things and blocking people out.”Patrick’s advice, she revealed, was simple but powerful: “Block out the haters.” Over time, that mindset reshaped her confidence. “I think social media used to get me a lot, and now it's just like honestly I don't give a f--- about what people have to say about me anymore,” she shared.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns heads in Abercrombie & Fitch NFL collection as Randi Mahomes proudly cheers her on Now, Brittany Mahomes stands as someone who’s learned to turn criticism into confidence, embracing her public role on her own terms and proving that resilience, not approval, defines her story.","Brittany Mahomes is the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

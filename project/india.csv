The climate and sustainability sessions threw up compelling questions that look ed at the progressive thinking and action on the ground.“India’s Waste to Energy success story is that every drop of petrol produced is blended with 20per cent ethanol, much of which comes from agri waste. This has saved us Rs 1.1 trillion on crude imports and helped mitigate 544 lakh metric tonnes of CO2,” said SSV Ramakumar of AM Green.Wilma Rodrigues, of Saahas zero waste said: “60per cent of dry waste is low-value plastic that ends up in landfills. When properly sorted, it can be sent to W2E plants (as feedstock).” Pranshu Singhal of Karo Sambhav said while schemes such as the extended producer responsibility were sound, the question of financing waste collection and recycling remained unresolved. “You can buy a product instantly, why is disposal difficult?”Public policy can’t be implemented without investment, said Srestha Banerjee of iFOREST. Policy support and financial resource mobilisation are both needed to develop capacity to scale sustainable solutions, she said.“Philanthropy can fund experimental climate solutions. As innovative capital, it fills the space between govt and business,” said Radha Goenka of RPG Foundation, whose organisation supported the transformation of a public garden into an urban forest called The Nest in Mumbai, and plans to use it as a prototype to create a green corridor in the city.While sustainable solutions need govt and corporate support, communities are no less capable of driving change, said Bipin Odhekar of Marico adding: “What’s important is to build conviction in stakeholder communities.”Aarti Khosla of Climate trends, said: “There’s a lopsided focus on mitigation. We need adaptive solutions to changing weather and to address declining agricultural production due to rising heat, for instance.”Conventional thinking around environment versus development needs to be challenged, insisted Geetanjoy Sahu, Dean of TISS. Shilpashree Muniswamappa of Colgate-Palmolive India, said, “People don’t necessarily buy to benefit the planet; they buy what saves them money.”, adding that consumers shouldn’t have to pay a premium for sustainable products.","India’s Waste to Energy success story is that every drop of petrol produced is blended with 20per cent ethanol.

Municipal solid and liquid waste in India can be turned into a Rs 5-lakh-crore business, Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari said in his inaugural address at The Times of India Social Impact Summit in Mumbai.“With the right approach, we can convert waste into wealth, create jobs, and address environmental concerns,” he said. “Plastics can be turned into fuel, sewage into industrial-grade water, and even garbage into commercially viable products,” he added.Citing a project in Mathura that treats sewage flowing into the Yamuna, he said, “That treated water is now being used by nearby Indian Oil refinery.” The particulates are treated with organic culture while the extracted sludge is turned into bio-flocculants. “If we scale this up nationally, the potential is enormous,” he said.Gadkari drew from personal experience, saying: “For the past nine years, I have been selling treated toilet water from my constituency, earning Rs 300 crore annually.”He highlighted clean energy as another area of potential. “Thermal plants have traditionally used coal, but NTPC and the Maharashtra govt have started using biomass—also known as white coal.It costs Rs 7 per unit but is far cleaner,” he said.With 17 percent of India’s land classified as wasteland, he proposed bamboo plantations for biomass. “We’ve invested Rs 5 crore to develop 1.5 lakh ha. Tree plantations around mines can earn carbon credits,” he said.A deeper rethinking of CSR in India is the need of the hour, said Sivakumar Sundaram, CEO (Publishing), The Times of India. “India’s CSR investment was approximately Rs 30,000 crore last year,” he said. “But more important than the quantum is the quality—how we measure impact, how we embed sustainability into strategy, and how we turn compliance into conscience.”The summit was presented by Malabar gold & diamonds with HAL as PSU partner, FUEL (skill partner), E&Y (knowledge partner) and supported by Times Foundation.","The Union minister laid out a vision for an ecologically sustainable growth model that can blend commerce with carbon credits. “Plastics can be turned into fuel, sewage into industrial-grade water, and even garbage into commercially viable products,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122483731,imgsize-1120023,width-400,resizemode-4/122483731.jpg"

The video was shared by Colonel Anne McClain, who captured the crew’s playful struggle to pose mid-air.“How do we take group photos in space? We cannot ask a passerby for help, so we set up a camera to take a photo every 5 seconds, get in position, then stop to smile at the camera. Looks a little chaotic, but it works!” McClain wrote on X.The cheerful moment surfaced just hours before Shukla and his fellow Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crew members undocked from the ISS on Monday, wrapping up a nearly 20-day scientific mission in orbit.Launched aboard SpaceX’s Falcon-9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center on June 25, the Ax-4 mission covered over 310 orbits and travelled 1.3 crore km — approximately 33 times the distance between Earth and Moon. The crew docked with the ISS on June 26 and conducted more than 60 experiments from 31 countries, including seven led by India’s ISRO.On Monday, at around 2.50 pm IST, the crew closed the hatch of their Dragon capsule, named Grace.By 4.45 pm, the spacecraft successfully undocked from the ISS. The capsule is now on a 22.5-hour return journey to Earth, carrying over 580 kg of cargo, including the scientific payload.Before the undocking, Shukla and mission commander Peggy Whitson were fully suited by 2.11 pm, while specialists Tibor Kapu and Slawosz Uznanski followed by 2.47 pm. NASA and SpaceX teams completed all safety checks, including leak tests and depressurisation, before issuing the undocking command.Grace performed its initial departure burns at 4.46 pm and 4.51 pm and is scheduled to carry out two more burns over the next 90 minutes to distance itself from the ISS and stabilise its orbit. The de-orbit burn is planned for 2.07 pm IST on Tuesday (July 15), with splashdown targeted for 3 pm off the coast of California.Axiom said ground teams are closely monitoring weather conditions — including wind speeds under 10 mph and the absence of rain or lightning — to ensure a safe recovery. Roughly 50 minutes after the de-orbit burn, the capsule will deploy drogue parachutes followed by the main ones for a controlled descent.Upon splashdown, recovery teams will board the capsule, conduct safety and medical checks, and airlift the astronauts for further health evaluations and debriefs.With this mission, Shukla joins the growing list of Indian-origin astronauts contributing to global space research — and now, to space humour as well.","Video shows Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla attempting to take group photos in microgravity.

Varun Mohan education qualifications: How an Indian-origin MIT engineer secured Google’s $2.4 billion AI investment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/varun-mohan-education-qualifications-how-an-indian-origin-mit-engineer-secured-googles-2-4-billion-ai-investment/articleshow/122405531.cms,"A strong academic foundation in Sunnyvale



MIT years: A dual degree and deeper specialisation

Real-world experience across leading tech firms

Founding Windsurf: Where AI meets developer workflows

The $2.4 billion deal with Google

In July 2025, Google signed a $2.4 billion deal for a nonexclusive licence to the technologies developed by Windsurf, a cutting-edge AI startup co-founded by Varun Mohan. Along with the deal, Mohan and several core members of his team joined Google DeepMind, marking one of the most high-profile movements in the AI talent landscape this year. The agreement not only represents a major financial milestone, but also signals Google’s strategic push to integrate advanced AI development tools into its global software ecosystem.A landmark agreement has validated Windsurf's AI-powered software development and brought global recognition to Mohan's achievements in the technology sector. Mohan's journey began as a mathematics Olympiad participant during his high school years, leading to his education at MIT as an engineer. He later established himself as an AI entrepreneur, combining his technical expertise with innovative business leadership.Born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, Mohan is the son of Indian-origin parents who instilled in him the value of rigorous learning from an early age. He attended The Harker School in San Jose, a school known for nurturing bright minds in science and technology. Here, he developed a reputation as a math and computing Olympiad achiever, excelling in competitions that tested both analytical depth and speed.These early achievements laid the groundwork for his future academic and entrepreneurial success.Mohan was not just performing well academically. He was exploring the boundaries of computational thinking, often creating solutions to problems that went well beyond classroom material.Mohan’s academic promise led him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he enrolled in the prestigious Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) program. Between 2014 and 2017, he completed both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in EECS, a challenging combination that only a few students pursue.At MIT, Mohan chose to specialise in operating systems, distributed computing, machine learning, performance engineering, and algorithms. His graduate work was marked by a strong blend of theory and hands-on experimentation, especially in building systems that could operate at scale. Collaborating with leading faculty and research labs, he also gained early exposure to emerging AI frameworks.This academic foundation was instrumental in shaping his long-term vision: a world where artificial intelligence could assist humans in coding, debugging, and designing software—making development faster, smarter, and more accessible.Following his graduation from MIT, Mohan took a thoughtful approach to building experience. He worked at some of the top technology companies in the world, including LinkedIn, Quora, Nuro, Samsung, and Databricks. Across these roles, he gained practical insights into backend systems, machine learning infrastructure, robotics, and big data platforms.Each job added a new layer to his expertise and deepened his understanding of the challenges developers face when working with large-scale systems. It also reinforced his belief that existing development tools needed a fundamental overhaul—something only AI could deliver. His experience across both startups and tech giants gave him a rare, well-rounded industry perspective.In 2021, Varun Mohan co-founded Codeium, later rebranded as Windsurf, with his MIT classmate and close friend Douglas Chen. Initially focused on GPU virtualisation, the company soon pivoted to its breakthrough idea: an AI-native IDE (Integrated Development Environment) capable of helping developers write, refactor, and understand code using large language models.Under Mohan’s leadership, Windsurf gained enormous traction in a short time. It onboarded over a million developers within four months, raised $243 million in funding, and reached a valuation of $1.25 billion. The platform’s core innovation lay in its use of agentic workflows, where AI tools like Cascade could automate routine development tasks while keeping engineers focused on architecture and strategy. Its open-source contributions and rapid deployment capabilities also made it a favorite among enterprise teams.In one of the biggest AI deals of 2025, Google entered into a $2.4 billion agreement to license Windsurf’s technologies. Though it did not acquire the company outright, Google welcomed Varun Mohan and key members of his team into Google DeepMind. The move positions Mohan at the heart of Google’s efforts to lead the future of AI-assisted software development.The structure of the deal also means Windsurf can continue to operate independently, licensing its tools to other enterprise clients. This hybrid model of licensing plus talent integration is seen as a blueprint for future collaboration between startups and tech giants. Analysts believe this model may become more common as companies seek agility without losing access to top innovation.At the core of Varun Mohan’s success lies a consistent thread: education as a launchpad. Whether it was the competitive environment of Harker School, the academic intensity of MIT, or the deep technical exposure across companies like Databricks and Quora, every stage built upon the last.Mohan’s story shows that deep learning—of the academic kind—is still one of the most powerful tools for shaping the future of technology. While AI may now assist in writing code, it was a strong human foundation in mathematics, systems thinking, and research that enabled Mohan to imagine that future in the first place.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

First Somvar Vrat in Sawan 2025: Do’s and Don’ts for attracting success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/others/first-somvar-vrat-in-sawan-2025-dos-and-donts-for-attracting-success/articleshow/122408446.cms,"1. Ignoring the Purity of Food (Vrat Bhojan)

2. Treating the Fast as a Diet or Social Trend

3. Neglecting the Timing and Simplicity of Rituals

4. Not Preparing Mentally or Emotionally

5. Overlooking Consistency and Closure

6. Fasting Without Chanting or Mantra Japa

7. Forgetting to Involve the Mind and Heart

Sawan Somvar, the Mondays that fall during the holy month of Sawan (Shravan), are among the most spiritually potent days for Lord Shiva devotees. In 2025, the first Sawan Somvar falls on July 14, setting the tone for a month filled with devotion, fasting, prayer, and rituals. Observing Sawan Somvar vrat (fast) is believed to bring blessings in health, relationships, and spiritual evolution. However, many devotees—especially beginners—unknowingly commit mistakes that dilute the spiritual essence or disrupt the intended discipline of the fast.Let us explore the five most common mistakes people make while observing the Sawan Somvar vrat, particularly on the first Monday. Whether you're a first-time devotee or a seasoned follower, avoiding these pitfalls will help you experience the true sanctity and power of the vrat.One of the most common mistakes is consuming the wrong type of food during the fast. The spiritual and energetic purity of vrat bhojan (fasting food) is essential during Sawan Somvar. Many people unknowingly include ingredients that are strictly prohibited during this fast, such as salt (including rock salt in some traditions), grains, pulses, or processed food items that contain additives not aligned with fasting norms.Even ingredients like onion, garlic, or table salt, which are typically avoided in most Hindu vrats, are sometimes used by mistake. These items are considered tamasic, meaning they increase lethargy, emotional disturbance, and cloud spiritual clarity. Instead, vrat foods should be sattvic—simple, fresh, and full of pranic energy. Commonly accepted items include fruits, milk, yoghurt, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes, sabudana (tapioca pearls), kuttu (buckwheat), singhara (water chestnut flour), and fresh coconut water.Additionally, cooking utensils should be clean and separate from those used for regular meals. If possible, prepare food with a calm, meditative mind, ideally chanting or listening to Shiva mantras while cooking. This brings vibrational alignment to your offering and enhances the purity of your fast.In the age of wellness culture and social media trends, fasting during Sawan is sometimes mistaken for a detox diet or spiritual fad. While the health benefits of Sawan vrat are real—such as digestive rest, hormonal balance, and mental clarity—the spiritual purpose far outweighs the physical.A common mistake is fasting without internal intention. People may skip meals but remain angry, anxious, or distracted throughout the day. They may even indulge in screen time or gossip, defeating the purpose of inner purification. Remember, Sawan Somvar vrat is not merely about abstaining from food—it’s about disciplining the body and elevating the mind.Lord Shiva represents stillness, introspection, and transcendence. Fasting during Sawan is symbolic of withdrawing from worldly indulgences to connect with that inner silence. Even if you’re only fasting partially, approach it with the bhava (intention) of surrender, not as a checkbox or challenge. This small shift transforms the vrat into a sacred offering.Another frequent mistake is not honouring the time-specific rituals associated with Sawan Somvar. Many people perform puja at random times or rush through it without understanding its flow. In Vedic tradition, timing (muhurta) is key to maximising the spiritual current of any practice.For example, the Brahma Muhurat (around 4:00–6:00 AM) is considered the best time to bathe and begin prayers. Ideally, one should perform Abhishek (ritual bath of the Shivling) in the early hours and continue with mantra chanting or silent meditation throughout the day.Another mistake is over-complication of the puja itself. While elaborate rituals have their place, they are not necessary for everyone. Devotees often get caught up in externalities—types of milk, exact numbers of Bilva leaves, arrangement of flowers—and forget the inner devotion. Lord Shiva, known as Bhola Bhandari, accepts even a single drop of water with pure devotion.If you're unsure about the full puja process, keep it simple. Offer clean water or milk to the Shivling, chant “Om Namah Shivaya” 108 times, light a lamp, and sit in silence for a few minutes. This minimalist approach, done with sincerity, can be more spiritually rewarding than a mechanical, elaborate ritual.Many people enter the Sawan vrat without preparing themselves mentally or emotionally. Fasting is not just a physical act—it is a form of tapasya (austerity), which requires inner stability and intention. If the fast is observed while carrying resentment, stress, or emotional volatility, the very purpose of calming the mind is defeated.Emotional and mental preparation begins the night before. Avoid arguments, heavy meals, or overstimulation (like binge-watching or overuse of social media). Instead, read or listen to stories of Lord Shiva, chant mantras, or journal your intentions for the vrat.On the day of the fast, be mindful of your thoughts, reactions, and speech. Speak kindly, forgive easily, and maintain a gentle pace throughout the day. These subtler aspects often go unnoticed but play a huge role in the success of your vrat. Remember, the energy you carry is the offering you make.Another mistake is starting with great enthusiasm but failing to maintain consistency throughout the month. Devotees often fast diligently on the first Sawan Somvar but gradually become lax in the following weeks. The initial energy is not sustained, and the spiritual build-up is interrupted.Sawan is about accumulative energy—each Monday deepens your alignment with Shiva. Missing fasts or treating subsequent Mondays casually reduces this cumulative effect. To avoid this, plan your Mondays in advance. Set reminders, prepare simple sattvic food the night before, and create a supportive environment that encourages continuity.Another often-overlooked aspect is closing the vrat with gratitude and reflection. At the end of the day, offer a final prayer expressing what the vrat meant to you, what you learned, or how you felt. Thank Lord Shiva for the strength and clarity to observe the fast. This simple act of reflection seals the spiritual energy and allows it to integrate into your life.Many devotees observe the physical fast but neglect the most potent tool for spiritual elevation: mantra chanting. Fasting without japa is like having a lamp without a flame. The repetition of “Om Namah Shivaya” or the Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra purifies the mind and channels the energy of the fast toward inner awakening.Set aside even 15 minutes for mantra japa, using a rudraksha mala if possible. Mantras refine your emotional frequency and deepen your connection with Shiva’s formless presence.Often, devotees fast with great discipline but without bhakti (devotion). A distracted, joyless fast driven by obligation misses the essence of Sawan Somvar. Lord Shiva values heartfelt sincerity over mechanical austerity.Bring your full presence into each act—whether it’s boiling potatoes, lighting a diya, or offering water. Even the simplest ritual, done with love and awareness, becomes sacred. Sawan vrat is less about what you give up and more about what you offer from within.","In 2025, the first Sawan Somvar falls on July 14, setting the tone for a month filled with devotion, fasting, prayer, and rituals.

Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.





BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon. Witnesses said the girl briefly walked away from the protest site, doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. CCTV footage showed the student setting herself ablaze, then running toward the principal's office, and later through the campus before being rescued by some students.Panic ensued as students rushed to douse the flames. A male student sustained injuries while trying to save her.The two injured were initially taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital. Given that the girl had sustained over 90% burns, she was shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for advanced treatment.The incident triggered widespread outrage across the campus. Students accused the college administration of gross negligence, alleging that their classmate's earlier complaints were ignored or poorly handled. Although an internal committee was reportedly formed to probe the allegations, students claimed it was biased and lacked transparency.The college principal said the girl had approached him with complaints some days back. ""She met me again on Saturday around 11 am and expressed severe distress. I summoned the teacher and spoke with both parties. Shortly after she left my office, we heard screams,"" the principal said, adding, ""Internal complaint committee did not find conclusive evidence of sexual harassment.""In the principal's suspension order, the higher education department stated that ""he has failed to perform his duties in the capacity of principal of the college"". It added that ""the matter has not been handled properly"".The principal has been barred from leaving Balsore without the district collector's permission. The accused teacher's suspension order said it was based on ""prima facie evidence"".DIG (eastern range), Satyajit Naik, said the accused faculty member has been arrested and booked for abetment to suicide attempt and sexual harassment. A forensic team visited the site, and a detailed investigation is underway.

Protests erupt outside AIIMS over student’s death

NEW DELHI: Odisha chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi on Tuesday announced the death of the 20-year-old girl student from FM Autonomous College, Balasore, who had attempted self-immolation earlier this month after alleging sexual harassment by a faculty memberThe victim, a second-year BEd student at FM Autonomous College, was undergoing treatment at AIIMS Bhubaneswar after sustaining 90% burn injuries.In a post on X, CM Majhi wrote, “I am deeply saddened to hear the news of the demise of the female student from FM Autonomous College.

I assure the family of the deceased student that all those guilty in this case will face the strictest punishment as per the law. For this, I have personally issued instructions to the authorities. The government stands firmly with the family.”The student had set herself ablaze on July 12 outside the college gate during a peaceful protest that had been ongoing since July 1, demanding action against the head of the education department.She had earlier submitted multiple complaints accusing the faculty member of sexual harassment and threats to manipulate her academic scores. A male student who tried to save her also suffered burn injuries.The incident, caught on CCTV, triggered public outrage and led to the arrest of the accused assistant professor and the suspension, later arrest, of the college principal.The Odisha Higher Education Department cited failure to handle the matter properly in its suspension order for the principal, while the assistant professor was suspended based on “prima facie evidence.”Odisha deputy chief minister Pravati Parida visited AIIMS Bhubaneswar and met the grieving family of the Balasore student.Speaking to the media, she said, “She (the victim) died around 11:45 pm.

We’ll remember martyrs on any day, if not July 13: Omar

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah climbed over a wall at Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib shrine Monday after police denied entry to him and several cabinet members attempting to pay tribute to the 1931 martyrs at their graves.“I was subjected to physical grappling,” Omar said. “I’m made of sterner stuff. I was doing nothing unlawful or illegal. The so-called protectors of the law need to explain under what law they were trying to stop us.”Authorities had sealed the site a day earlier and placed several politicians, including Omar, his father and National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti under house arrest — intensifying a political standoff between the Union territory’s elected govt and Centre-appointed lieutenant governor’s administration.Determined not to be thwarted again, Omar avoided notifying anyone Monday. The confrontation began after the CM and his ministers headed to the shrine. Blocked by police barricades and CRPF vehicles, he and deputy CM Surinder Choudhary proceeded on foot. Minister Sakina Itoo arrived on a scooter, while Farooq came in a three-wheeler.“They blocked our way with CRPF and police vehicles and even resorted to physical force,” Omar said.He alleged that police tried to tear the NC flag and manhandled party workers.A video shared by Omar shows him scaling the shrine’s wall after being refused entry. “We succeeded in offering prayers,” he said. “They think these graves matter only on July 13. If not July 13, then July 12, 14, or any other day — we will come and remember the martyrs.”Observed as Martyrs’ Day on July 13, the date marks the killing of 22 civilians outside Srinagar jail in 1931 during protests against Maharaja Hari Singh, then Dogra monarch of J&K. The event has become a flashpoint in Kashmir’s evolving identity after Article 370 was revoked in 2019. Since then, police and security forces have been under the direct command of LG Manoj Sinha, while the Omar-led elected government has no authority over law enforcement.Omar quoted BJP stalwart Arun Jaitley to underline the friction. “Democracy in J&K is a tyranny of the unelected,” he said. “The unelected nominees of New Delhi locked up the elected representatives of the people.”Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq rubbed it in. “The CM tasted the bitter medicine of authoritarian high-handedness and experienced what ordinary Kashmiris endure,” he said. “I hope this experience shifts his focus to restoring dignity and fundamental rights.”","J&K CM Omar Abdullah climbed over a wall at Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib shrine.

I-T department tapped many databases to identify likely offenders

NEW DELHI: The income tax department Monday launched a nationwide verification operation targeting individuals and entities facilitating fraudulent claims of deductions and exemptions in I-T returns.The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities but also those related to health insurance and medical expenses (Sec 80D and 80DDB of I-T Act), HRA (Sec 10(13A), interest on education and home loans and for purchase of vehicles (Sec 80E, 80EE and 80EEB), CBDT said.Those under lens are MNC staff, public sector companies, government bodies, academic institutions and entrepreneurs who have claimed deductions without valid justification, it said.The I-T department is now poised to take stern action against continued fraudulent claims, including penalties and prosecution wherever applicable. The ongoing verification exercise across 150 premises is expected to yield crucial evidence, including digital records, that will aid in dismantling networks behind these schemes and ensure accountability,"" the I-T dept said.This action follows a detailed analysis of ""misuse of tax benefits under I-T Act, 1961, often in collusion with professional intermediaries"", it said. It said that investigations have uncovered ""organised rackets"" operated by certain ITR preparers and intermediaries, who have been filing returns claiming fictitious deductions and exemptions. The move is a signal to individuals who take shortcuts and make claims without having evidence of deductions or expenses shown in returns.Tax authorities tapped multiple databases to identify likely offenders. It conducted search and seizures in several states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, and MP, where it found evidence of fraudulent claims.CBDT said the actions follow an outreach conducted programme, asking taxpayers to revise their returns in case discrepancies were noticed. ""As a result, around 40,000 taxpayers have updated their returns in last four months, voluntarily withdrawing false claims amounting to Rs 1,045 crore. However, many remain non-compliant, possibly under influence of masterminds behind these evasion rackets,"" it said.","The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities.

65 in-flight engine shutdowns reported since 2020: RTI data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/65-in-flight-engine-shutdowns-reported-since-2020-rti-data/articleshow/122471505.cms,"Air India crash

HYDERABAD: Sixty-five in-flight engine shutdowns in five years. Eleven ""Mayday"" distress calls from aircraft cockpits in 17 months, excluding the London-bound AI-171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 and a diverted domestic IndiGo flight.These numbers, obtained by TOI through a Right to Information (RTI) query to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), suggest a scary reality: engine malfunctions plague airlines operating in India at the rate of nearly one incident a month.Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's report mentioning fuel cut-off to engines of the crashed AI Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fits the broader pattern of technical failures being handled by experienced pilots, until one crops up that is unmanageable.DGCA data covers all engine shutdowns, including failures during take-off and mid-air. ""A total of 65 incidents related to in-flight shutdown of engines from 2020 to 2025 (till date) were reported across India,"" states the aviation regulator's RTI reply.In all 65 of these instances, pilots were able to safely manoeuvre aircraft to the nearest airport with a single, unaffected engine. Experts attribute engine shutdowns to technical issues ranging from low fuel to turbine malfunction and faulty electronic components.""Primary causes of engine shutdowns include blocked fuel filters, fuel contamination with water, interrupted fuel supply to engines, and foreign objects entering engine stack, all of which can halt flight operations,"" Capt C S Randhawa, president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told TOI.The RTI data shows that between Jan 1, 2024, and May 31, 2025, there were Mayday calls from 11 flights, reporting various technical glitches and seeking emergency landing. Besides AI-171, the list doesn't include a June 19 IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai that had to be redirected to Bengaluru due to congestion at the destination, only for the aircraft to report low fuel around 35km before landing.RTI data reveals that four of the 11 flights issued distress calls due to technical glitches and landed at Hyderabad.Airline Pilots' Association of India states that Mayday signals are exclusively used in life-threatening situations, distinguishing them from ""Pan Pan"" urgency alerts.""Flight crew initiate MAYDAY calls when confronted with critical emergencies such as aircraft fires, engine failures or situations posing imminent danger, necessitating immediate landing or grounding as continued flight becomes unsafe,"" said Anil Rao, secretary of ALPA India.AX Joseph, director of air safety at DGCA, said the aviation regulator was responsible for promulgating ""civil aviation requirements, circulars, aeronautical information circulars and public notices for compliance by the stakeholders to ensure safe operations"".While experts say that in-flight engine shutdowns and Mayday calls aren't uncommon across the world, India's position in global aviation safety standards may not be confidence-inspiring.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar’s first visit to China in 6 years - amid the thawing of Sino-India ties – saw him pressing Beijing to further address border issues, including through de-escalation, while also urging China to avoid restrictive trade measures.In a meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi, Jaishankar acknowledged “good progress” in efforts to normalize the relationship saying it’s a result of the resolution of friction along the border and both sides’ ability to maintain peace and tranquillity.“This is the fundamental basis for mutual strategic trust and for smooth development of bilateral relations. It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,” said the minister. The Indian side said both countries agreed to take “practical steps” including travel to each other’s country and direct flight connectivity, for facilitating people-to-people exchanges.India and China had resolved the almost 5-year-old military standoff in eastern Ladakh last year in October, leading to a bilateral meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping on the margins of the BRICS summit in Kazan.Jaishankar is in China for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting and Modi himself is expected to visit the country for the summit of the Eurasian bloc in September. Taking note of the positive direction in ties since the Modi-Xi meeting, Jaishankar sought a “far-seeing approach” to the relationship saying it is the responsibility of both sides to maintain that momentum .In his meeting with Wang, Jaishankar also gave vent to India’s concerns about China’s export controls that may adversely affect domestic manufacturing here. He said that as neighbouring nations and major economies in the world today, there are various facets and dimensions of their bilateral ties.“Measures towards normalizing our people – to – people exchanges can certainly foster mutually beneficial cooperation. It is also essential in this context that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks are avoided,” he said in his opening remarks, expressing hope that he and Wang would continue their “strategic communication” not just on the margins of multilateral events but each other’s countries.Ahead of the SCO meeting on Tuesday, Jaishankar touched upon the issue of terrorism too as he reminded Wang that the primary mandate of the grouping is to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism. “This is a shared concern and India hopes that zero tolerance for terrorism will be strongly upheld,” he said, while backing China’s SCO presidency and efforts to ensure good outcomes.In the meeting, Jaishankar also underlined the need for cooperation on trans-border rivers, including resumption of provision of hydrological data by the Chinese side. The 2 sides had agreed to this, along with resumption of direct air services and Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, in January this year.The minister also told Wang that stable and constructive ties between India and China are not only to their benefit, but that of the world as well. “This is best done by handling relations on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity,” said Jaishankar, recalling the agreement earlier that differences should not become disputes, or competition turn into conflict. He said that on this foundation, both sides can continue to develop ties along a positive trajectory. He also thanked China for allowing the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra to resume after a gap of 5 years.",India and China had resolved the almost 5-year-old military standoff in eastern Ladakh last year.

Toll may be halved for 2-lane national highways undergoing expansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toll-may-be-halved-for-2-lane-national-highways-undergoing-expansion/articleshow/122470281.cms,"File photo: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: In yet another move to rationalise tolling on national highways (NHs), the road transport ministry has proposed to halve the toll during the expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders to four-lane highways. This has been proposed since commuters don't get the desired service while construction work is underway on such stretches, with the highway width available for use being reduced.At present, the user fee for such stretches is 60 per cent of the normal toll for NHs, even during expansion phase, as they are narrow highways without dividers. If the proposal goes through and gets the green signal from the finance ministry, the user fee will go down to only 30 per cent of the normal toll during the construction phase.In the case of widening of four-lane highways to six lanes or expanding six-lane highways to eight lanes, the chargeable toll is capped at 75 per cent of the normal rate during the construction phase.This is also because commuters don't get the desired service while work is underway on such stretches. This has also been a major issue, with there even being instances of courts taking note of the anomaly.The proposal to give relief to commuters using two-lane NHs with paved shoulders gains importance considering road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has announced a plan to convert 25,000 km of two-lane highways into four-lane highways with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore in the next two years.The govt will be focusing over the next decade on the expansion of two-lane and two-lane with paved shoulders NH stretches, as nearly 80,000 km out of the total 1.46-lakh-km length of NHs fall under this category.Earlier, to provide relief to commuters, govt had announced the Rs-3,000 annual toll pass scheme, which will allow private vehicles to cross 200 toll plazas annually.More recently, it notified a new rule to reduce the toll rate by up to 50 per cent for structures such as bridges, tunnels, flyovers and elevated sections on highways, which will benefit commercial and heavy vehicles.","Road transport ministry has proposed to halve the toll during the expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders.

SCO meet: Jaishankar meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing; calls for ‘far-seeing approach’ in India-China ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-meet-jaishankar-meets-chinese-president-xi-jinping-in-beijing-calls-for-far-seeing-approach-in-india-china-ties/articleshow/122482260.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday, his first visit to the country in six years, amid signs of improving relations between the two neighbours following years of border tension.Jaishankar was in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting, where he also met his counterpart Wang Yi.“Called on President Xi Jinping this morning in Beijing along with my fellow SCO Foreign Ministers,” Jaishankar wrote on X. “Conveyed the greetings of President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Apprised President Xi of the recent development of our bilateral ties. Value the guidance of our leaders in that regard.”During his bilateral meeting with Wang Yi, Jaishankar said India and China had made “good progress” over the past nine months in normalising relations, attributing it to the resolution of friction along the border and the maintenance of peace and tranquillity. “This is the fundamental basis for mutual strategic trust and for smooth development of bilateral relations.It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,” he said.Jaishankar emphasised that both countries must continue to build on this positive momentum. “We have earlier agreed that differences should not become disputes, nor should competition ever become conflict,” he said. “Stable and constructive ties between India and China are not only to our benefit, but that of the world as well. This is best done by handling relations on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity. ”The minister also raised concerns about China’s export controls that could hurt domestic manufacturing in India. He urged Beijing to avoid “restrictive trade measures and roadblocks” and advocated steps to improve people-to-people ties, such as easing travel, resuming direct flights, and promoting exchanges. “Measures towards normalising our people-to-people exchanges can certainly foster mutually beneficial cooperation,” he said.During the SCO meeting, Jaishankar also reiterated India’s stance on terrorism, reminding Wang that the group’s primary mandate was to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism. “This is a shared concern and India hopes that zero tolerance for terrorism will be strongly upheld,” he stated, extending India’s support to China’s SCO presidency.He further stressed the need for cooperation on trans-border rivers, including the resumption of hydrological data sharing by China. He welcomed China’s decision to allow the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra to resume after a five-year pause, a move agreed upon earlier this year.The visit follows a significant turning point in October 2023, when India and China resolved the prolonged military standoff in eastern Ladakh, clearing the way for Prime Minister Modi and President Xi to meet in Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS summit. That meeting helped restart high-level diplomatic channels, with Modi expected to visit China in September for the SCO summit.","Jaishankar was in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting, where he also met his counterpart Wang Yi.

SC to examine their power to interfere in quasi-judicial functionsNew Delhi: Can parliamentary and legislative committees interfere in the quasi-judicial work of the revenue department? The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine this question arising from the directions issued by a parliamentary committee in the UP Assembly in a land dispute case.Appearing for a petitioner, senior advocate Amit Anand Tiwari told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that multiple directions have been issued by the Uttar Pradesh govt, on the instructions of legislative committees, to revenue officers asking them to take “necessary action” and submit report on the land dispute.“Such directions directly and substantially impinge on free and independent adjudication by the revenue authorities in pending proceedings,” Tiwari said, which prompted the bench to entertain the petition and say that the question of law arising in this case is – “Whether legislative committees can interfere in quasi-judicial functions of revenue authorities?”The issue pertained to demarcation and determination of possession of a plot, which according to the petitioner could be gone into by the competent authority, in this case the sub-divisional magistrate, under the UP Revenue Code.Tiwari said a proper and effective adjudication by the revenue authorities is not possible if there is regular and constant interference from the legislative Committees. He said the Allahabad HC erred by failing to issue appropriate directions to prevent interference by political authorities in the adjudicatory process before Revenue Authorities.The petitioner informed SC that he had filed a complaint before the Assistant Collector, Meja, Prayagraj under section 67 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006 against one R P Shukla, who using his influence, had encroached upon the public lands causing great hardships and obstruction to people in pursuing their agricultural activities.“While the petitioner was diligently pursuing the remedies available to him under the law, questions were being raised in the Vidhan Sabha and directions were being issued by the Secretariat to Revenue Officers asking them to take necessary action and to submit report regarding the land dispute concerning RP Shukla,” he alleged.","SC to examine their power to interfere in quasi-judicial functions.

KOCHI: In a setback for the Kerala governor, the high court on Monday dismissed petitions challenging a single bench decision that declared 'illegal' the appointment of two temporary vice-chancellors for Kerala University of Digital Sciences Innovation and Technology and APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU), made without the recommendation of the state govt.A division bench of Justices Anil K Narendran and P V Balakrishnan rejected the appeals filed by the governor-cum-chancellor and temporary VCs of the digital university and KTU, Ciza Thomas and K Sivaprasad, respectively.Taking note of the prolonged administrative stalemate in both universities and its adverse impact on their functioning and students, the court urged the chancellor and the state government to act proactively and ensure regular appointments to the posts without further delay.The appeals primarily challenged the single bench's finding that appointments made without the government's recommendation are bad in law, citing that the university acts mandate such recommendation and limit the tenure of temporary VCs to six months.They also questioned the legality of these provisions, contending that they are inconsistent with the UGC Regulations. The bench, however, rejected this contention, holding that the UGC Regulations, 2010 and 2018, are silent on the appointment of temporary VCs.",HC urged the chancellor and the state government to ensure regular appointments to the posts without further delay.

Six death-row convicts await HC verdict for over 3 yrs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/six-death-row-convicts-await-hc-verdict-for-over-3-yrs/articleshow/122476178.cms,"6 death-row convicts await J’khand high court verdict for over 3 years.

HC reserved verdicts in early 2022, yet to pronounce.NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented judicial inaction causing anxiety and uncertainty to those under the shadow of death sentence, the Jharkhand high court had reserved verdicts more than three years ago on appeals filed by six death-row convicts challenging their convictions and capital sentences and is yet to pronounce verdicts.Arguing their appeals filed in the supreme court through its legal services committee against non-pronouncement of judgments for years, advocate Fauzia Shakil told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that it is a serious infraction of the right to speedy justice.Justice Kant asked whether these judgments were reserved by the same Judge who was called out by the apex court on an earlier occasion for similar inaction in delivering judgments. Shakil answered in the affirmative and said though these are 10 judgments which are reserved for a long time, the status report submitted by the HC on delayed pronouncement of verdicts to the SC did not reflect eight of them.Interestingly, in all these 10 appeals – six of whom have been awarded death sentence and rest life terms in murder cases – justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay is the presiding judge of the benches which heard and reserved verdicts in nine cases between Jan 2022 and Aug 2022 and in one in Aug 2023.The death-row convicts are Nitesh Sahu (judgment on appeal reserved on Aug 28, 2022), Sanatan Baski (Feb 3, 2022), Sukhlal Murmu (Feb 3, 2022), Gandhi Oraon (Jan 10, 2022), Rohit Rai (Jan 25, 2022) and Bandhan Oran (Jan 13, 2022).Earlier a similar inaction by the HC in pronouncing judgments in four cases of lifers was brought to the notice of the SC through Shakil and a bench led by Justice Kant had sought a status report from the HC about such cases being kept in limbo. Within a week of the SC entertaining the four cases, the HC had pronounced the verdicts which were reserved for years. Three were acquitted and in one there was a split verdict entitling the accused bail.Shakil informed the apex court that among the present 10 petitioners have been convicted and sentenced to death or life imprisonment. “It is pertinent to note that each one of them has served an actual custody period ranging between over 6 years to over 16 years,” she said.The petitioners pointed out that non-pronouncement of judgments by the HC for more than three years breached the Jharkhand HC Rules, 2001, which provided that “Reserved judgments should ordinarily be pronounced within six weeks of the conclusion of the arguments. In the event of the judgments not being pronounced within three months of the conclusion of the arguments, the chief justice may either post the case for delivering judgment in open Court or withdraw the case and post it for disposal before an appropriate Bench. ”","HC reserved verdicts in early 2022, yet to pronounce. 6 death-row convicts await J’khand high court verdict for over 3 years.

Maoist mines turn Saranda's forest into jumbo killing fields,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoist-mines-turn-sarandas-forest-into-jumbo-killing-fields/articleshow/122476369.cms,"Asia’s largest sal forest spread across 900sqkm in Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall

RANCHI/JAMSHEDPUR: Gunfire didn't ring out in the forest. It cracked with the weight of an elephant's scream. A six-year-old female collapsed near a stream, leg mangled, bleeding into the mud. Four days later, a 15-year-old bull dropped dead deeper in the jungle, a Maoist IED buried under the red soil of Saranda, triggered by a footstep.Asia's largest sal forest spread across 900sqkm in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall. Elephants are walking into Maoist landmines, traps meant for troops. Two deaths in one week. Officials fear more lie wounded and unseen.Search patrols sweep elephant trails and riverbanks. Drones buzz low above watering holes. Five are deployed, but monsoonal rain, foliage and fog obscure visibility. ""We first got wind of a wounded elephant weeks ago,"" said DFO Aviroop Sinha. ""It was only on June 28 that we managed to spot it through drone feed and send help.""Teams are working across four divisions - Kolhan, Porahat, Chaibasa, and Saranda - each step a gamble. ""It's hostile terrain,"" Sinha said. ""Security concerns make it worse.But we've deployed field patrols wherever we can."" IEDs have long turned Saranda's forest trails into minefields. Since November 2022, at least six security personnel have been killed and more than two dozen wounded during combing operations. Maoists and breakaway factions have laid explosives across the forest - old ones buried years ago, fresh ones planted in 2024 and 2025.Civilians aren't spared either. Twenty villagers have died - some while collecting firewood, others while foraging for mahua. In Saranda, every path winds into uncertainty - for soldier, villager, and elephant alike. ""We have no maps, no numbers, no idea how many explosives are buried out there,"" said a forester. ""We just move with caution and gut feeling.""The forest department has begun treating IED-triggered elephant deaths as a conservation emergency. Field teams have been ordered not to enter unknown terrain. Surveillance focuses on riverbanks - likely spots for wounded elephants to rest. But with rain sweeping the region, even drone eyes fail.Regional chief conservator of forests Smita Pankaj said search ops are on high alert. But mobility remains limited. ""We're also planning a joint effort with Odisha's Rourkela and Keonjhar divisions, as elephants use trans-border corridors,"" she said. Just recently, a herd of 40 moved from Saranda to Karampada in Odisha.Wildlife expert DS Srivastava called the elephant casualties unprecedented. ""This is new,"" he said. Srivastava surveyed Saranda between 2015 and 2016. ""Even then, locals told us to avoid human trails,"" he said.Each footstep could be the last for man and wildlife alike. And when a trunk lifts to call for help, the cry often vanishes into the forest - an SOS swallowed by the Sal.","Asia's largest sal forest in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall.

NEW DELHI: In a major setback to over 1,000 assistant professors appointed in 2021 in Panjab University and Guru Nanak Dev University, the Supreme Court on Monday quashed their recruitment, observing that it was done in violation of UGC regulations.Recruitment was done for 1,091 posts of assistant professor and 67 posts of librarian. The court said it is a settled principle that when the law prescribes a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it should be done in that manner alone.""In the present case, there are multiple deficiencies.

NEW DELHI: As Parliament's monsoon session approaches, the stage seems to be getting set for a BJP-Congress duel over ""foreign interference"", with BJP MP Nishikant Dubey circulating documents about Jawaharlal Nehru govt's decision to let US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) install ""two nuclear-powered devices"" high in the Himalayas to monitor Chinese preparations for nuclear tests.In a post of X, Dubey attached a copy of an April 1978 letter from members of the US Congress addressed to the then US president Jimmy Carter. The letter expressed concern about a ""CIA operation"" in India in the 1960s, which the US foreign intelligence agency apparently carried out without keeping Indian government in the loop.The letter cited an 'Outside' article, published by Rolling Stone. According to author Howard Kohn there were ""two nuclear-powered monitoring devices"", allegedly for surveillance of Chinese atomic weapons testing, high in the Himalayas.The devices, containing plutonium, were placed on two mountains, one of which, Nanda Devi, is the source of India's Ganges River, the holy river for millions of Hindus, the letter stated. The then Congress government's decision to let CIA surveil on China's plans for nuclear tests has long been an open secret in many quarters. So was the unsuccessful effort to retrieve one of the monitoring devices, which was buried by an avalanche, by sending expeditions.But BJP's decision to ignite a fresh debate at this juncture is significant because of indications that Congress may double up on its allegation that US president Donald Trump coerced Modi government into agreeing to pause Operation Sindoor.Dubey linked Nehru government's decision and disapparance of the devices to natural calamities by citing the article which said the untraceable device could be ""leaking plutonium into the Ganges. If this is true, it would be a serious problem, indeed"".Sharing the letter, Dubey asked whether Kedarnath disaster, Teesta River flooding, melting glaciers in Gangotri and Yamunotri, and even decreasing water level of Ganga could be linked to this incident.""The Nehru-Gandhi family bowed before America. Rahul Gandhi ji, Congress is responsible for the destruction of farmers and played with India's faith...""

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday told producers of the film 'Udaipur Files: Kanhaiya Lal Tailor Murder', screening of which has been stayed by Delhi high court , that it will hear its plea for release of the movie in the theatres ""within a day or two"".Senior advocate Gaurav Bhatia appealed to a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi for urgent hearing on the special leave petition by Meerut-based producer 'Jani Firefox Media' challenging the high court's July 10 order stalling release of the film despite the censor board clearing its screening with certain cuts.Bhatia said the high court order came on a petition by Maulana Arshad Madani, who claimed the film was an attempt to vilify an entire community, even though the storyline of the movie is based on a true incident of beheading of Kanhaiyalal by two Muslim men in June 2022 for sharing a post on Prophet Mohammad, and that the producers had carried out cuts suggested by CBFC.The high court had disposed of Madani's petition by permitting him to appeal against permission to release the film before Union government. It had said, ""Since we are relegating the petitioner to remedy of revision under Section 6 of Cinematograph Act, we direct that till the application for interim relief, if made by the petitioner along with the revision petition under Section 6, is decided by central govt, release of the film shall remain stayed.The film producer through advocate Pulkit Agarwal cited several SC judgements which had laid down the principle that a film cleared by censor board cannot be stalled from being screened in theatres unless there is an explicit violation which squarely fell within 'reasonable restrictions' on right to free speech specified under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.",Producers of the film 'Udaipur Files: Kanhaiya Lal Tailor Murder' have appealed to the Supreme Court for urgent hearing.

NEW DELHI: A preliminary probe into the June 12 AI-171 crash finds no ""mechanical or maintenance issues"" with the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft and its engines, and also no fault with fuel quality and ""medical status"" of the pilots, according to the airline's CEO Campbell Wilson.In his first internal note to employees since the report's release, Wilson acknowledged the findings but cautioned against speculation. ""The preliminary report identified no cause nor made any recommendations,"" he wrote Monday. ""I urge everyone to avoid drawing premature conclusions as the investigation is far from over.""Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's initial report concluded that ""all mandatory maintenance tasks had been completed"" and ""no mechanical or maintenance issues"" were detected. Fuel quality and take-off roll were cleared, as were pilot breathalyser and medical checks.The report has raised eyebrows within aviation circles - not for what it reveals, but for what it omits. Released in India nearly two days after being shared with sections of western media, the report has triggered new rounds of speculation, including a disputed suicide theory strongly denied by the pilot community.""There was no issue with quality of fuel and no abnormality with the take-off roll,"" Wilson said.""The pilots had passed their mandatory pre-flight breathalyser and there were no observations pertaining to their medical status.""India's first wide-body aircraft disaster in decades has shaken public confidence in Air India. The airline has since cut multiple flights, both on wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, as it works to stabilise operations.""Despite the shared grief, I could not be prouder of the togetherness, compassion and resilience that you have all shown,"" Wilson wrote to Air India's staff. ""We must remain focused on our task and be true to values that have powered Air India's transformation - integrity, excellence, customer focus, innovation and teamwork.""Wilson said preliminary findings bring ""greater clarity"" but also open ""additional questions"". He underscored the psychological toll of the crash on staff and the broader aviation community, especially amid unfounded theories.To reassure passengers, Wilson said that ""out of an abundance of caution and under oversight of DGCA, every Boeing 787 aircraft operating in our fleet was checked within days of the accident and all were found fit for service"".","Preliminary probe into AI-171 crash finds no ""mechanical or maintenance issues"" No fault with fuel quality and ""medical status"" of the pilots, says Air India CEO.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday held that a private conversation between spouses, secretly recorded by one of them, is admissible as evidence in a matrimonial dispute and would not amount to breach of right to privacy Enumerating Section 122 of the Evidence Act, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said it dealt with the rule of privilege protecting disclosure of all communications between husband and wife during marriage except in litigation between them.It said, ""Under section 122, privileged communication between spouses is protected in the context of fostering intimate relationship. However, the exception under Section 122 has to be construed in light of right to a fair trial which is also an aspect of Article 21 of the Constitution."" ""When we weigh the respective rights of the parties in a trial within the parameters of Section 122 of the Evidence Act, we do not think that there is any breach of right to privacy in the instant case.In fact, Section 122 does not recognise such a right at all. On the other hand, the section carves out an exception to right to privacy between spouses, and therefore, cannot be applied horizontally at all,"" the bench said.In this regard, ""we reiterate that as per procedure established by law, Section 122 does not touch upon the aspect of right to privacy as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution, let alone invade upon such right. The reason is because Section 122 recognises the right to a fair trial, right to produce relevant evidence and a right to prove one's case against a spouse so as to avail the relief sought for by a party,"" it said.The section talks about communications during marriage and states that ""no person who is or has been married, shall be compelled to disclose any communication made to him during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married; nor shall he be permitted to disclose any such communication, unless the person who made it, or his representative in interest, consents, except in suits between married persons, or proceedings in which one married person is prosecuted for any crime committed against the other. ""SC made the observations on man's plea to bring privileged communication as evidence before a family court in matrimonial dispute. SC also said, ""Now, in today's day and age, when the technological advancement has made it easier to record and recreate moments of past and present for reference in future, then to say that such better forms of evidence and material would not be admissible on the ground of they being in violation of the right to privacy would amount to defeating the very object of the Evidence Act. That was the reason for Parliament to amend the Evidence Act by incorporating Section 65B which specifically deals with electronic evidence.""","A private conversation between spouses, secretly recorded by one of them, is admissible as evidence in a matrimonial dispute.

SC: Why can't citizens regulate themselves?

NEW DELHI: In two different cases, regarding ""objectionable"" posts on social media and sharing of a cartoon of PM Modi and RSS workers, Supreme Court on Monday expressed concern over abuse of fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression by citizens, particularly on social media.Such posts, it said, were causing hatred and increase in litigation and clogging of the criminal justice system. It asked people to show restraint on the medium.Hearing a plea of Wazahat Khan for clubbing of cases registered against him in different states for his objectionable posts against a Hindu deity on X, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan said citizens must know the value of fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression.In another case filed by cartoonist Hemant Malviya, a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Aravind Kumar strongly objected to objectionable cartoons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS workers on social media and said that right of freedom of speech and expression was being ""abused"".""If they want to enjoy fundamental right of speech and expression, it should be with the reasonable restrictions also. Apart from that, there must be self-restraint and regulation also, to enjoy the valuable freedom, not like this abuse.Article 19 is against the State, what you call it - verticality. What about horizontality?"" the bench observed in Khan's case.The court said Khan should have shown restraint in his remarks. It was Khan's complaint that had led to the arrest of influencer Sharmistha Panoli, whom he accused of posting derogatory content on Islam in relation to a post on Operation Sindoor.""One of the fundamental duties is to uphold unity and integrity of the country. So that is being violated. See all these divisive tendencies, at least on social media, must be curbed. But to what extent can the State curb? Instead, why can't the citizens themselves regulate themselves? Citizens must know the value of freedom of speech and expression. If they don't, then the State will step in and who wants the state to step in? Nobody wants the state to step in,"" the bench said.To Malviya who sought anticipatory bail, the bench posed the question, ""Why do you do all this?"" Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for him, said that she was not justifying the social media post which may be ""unpalatable and in poor taste"" but raised the question whether it could be an offence.The bench, while posting the case for Tuesday said, ""This is definitely the case that the freedom of speech and expression is being abused.""Malviya is challenging a Madhya Pradesh high court order of July 3 refusing to grant him anticipatory bail. Malviya was booked in Indore in May on a complaint filed by lawyer and RSS worker Vinay Joshi.","Supreme Court expresses concern over abuse of fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression by citizens.

Aviation Expert Links Mid-Air Fuel Cut-Off to AI171 Crash After AAIB Preliminary Report

Until final report is out, any speculation unacceptable: Union

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A day after Airline Pilots' Association of India said Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete, Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), one of the Air India pilots' unions, on Sunday slammed the ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" that has been doing the rounds since the report was made public on Saturday.AAIB had stated that both fuel switches on the Boeing 787 transitioned from ""run"" to ""cut-off"" three seconds after it took off from the runway, cutting off fuel supply to the engines. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other, 'Why did you cut off (the fuel supply)?' The other responded he did not do so,"" according to the report. However, it didn't elucidate why the fuel control switches were cut off.Soon after the report's release, pilots and aviation experts, in interviews and posts on social media, claimed one of the pilots had knowingly cut off the fuel supply switch.The pilots of AI 171, which crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions, ICPA, one of the AI pilots’ unions, said, adding the crew should not be vilified based on conjecture.Referring to a 2018 safety bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches — which could cut off fuel supply to the engines without pilot input — the report said that Air India did not carry out the inspection as it was not deemed mandatory.“In the aftermath of this incident, we are deeply disturbed by speculative narratives emerging in sections of the media and public discourse — particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide. Let us be unequivocally clear: there is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage, and invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible — it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved,” said ICPA.“Pilots undergo extensive psychological and professional screening, recurrent training, and operate under the highest standards of safety, responsibility, and mental fitness. To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it added.“As aviation professionals, we trust and respect the rigorous investigative protocols established by competent authorities. These inquiries are designed to uncover facts methodically and without bias. Until the official investigation is concluded and the final report is published, any speculation — especially of such a grave nature — is unacceptable and must be condemned,” ICPA said, calling on media and public commentators to act with restraint, empathy, and respect for due process.","Pilots' union slams ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122423964,imgsize-1785791,width-400,resizemode-4/122423964.jpg"

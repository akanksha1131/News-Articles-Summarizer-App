Looking Ahead

The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday, with both teams achieving record-breaking feats.Zimbabwe's first innings saw them amass a colossal 586 runs, surpassing their previous highest Test score of 563/9 against the West Indies in 2001. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699 all out, establishing their own record for the highest innings total, beating their previous best of 545/4, also achieved against Zimbabwe in 2021.The Afghan innings was highlighted by captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's historic 246, a national record, and Rahmat Shah's 234. Together, they forged a massive 364-run third-wicket partnership, the highest in Afghanistan's Test history for any wicket. Shahidi’s 246 eclipsed his previous best of 200 against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi. Wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai also contributed a maiden Test century with 113 runs, further solidifying Afghanistan's dominance in their first innings.Zimbabwe's Brian Bennett, a 21-year-old spinner in only his second Test, showcased his all-around brilliance. Bennett took a career-best 5/95 in Afghanistan's innings and earlier contributed an unbeaten 110 with the bat in Zimbabwe's first innings.Afghanistan’s innings ended in a collapse, with the last six wickets falling for just 20 runs in four overs, largely due to Bennett's spin. In their second innings, Zimbabwe reached 142/4, avoiding further damage thanks to an unbroken 54-run partnership between veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22).The match's conclusion was impacted by mid-afternoon rain, which caused a delay of over an hour. Zimbabwe showed resilience, with debutant Ben Curran impressing with 41 runs before a run-out, and opener Joylord Gumbie contributing 24.The second and final Test of the series begins Thursday, also in Bulawayo, with both teams eager to build on the momentum from this high-scoring encounter.For context, Sri Lanka still hold the record for the highest-ever Test innings score with 952/6 declared against India in Colombo in 1997.","The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday.

WATCH VIDEO

The closing stages of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia in Melbourne were marred by controversy around Yashasvi Jaiswal 's caught-behind decision, which was given out by the third umpire.During the last session of the match, Jaiswal missed a pull shot against Pat Cummins and the ball went past his bat and gloves as the bowler went up in appeal, but the umpire shook his head in denial.Cummins signalled for a review straight away and the third umpire gave it out, overruling the on-field decision.Seeing no deviation on the 'Snickometer' during replays shown on the giant screen, Jaiswal had a long discussion with the umpires before walking back.Former players and experts remained divided in their opinion on the decision. However, a latest video released by the Australian media hints at Jaiswal possibly telling Travis Head that he did get a touch on the ball and the Australian batter could be seen raising his arms in delight, signalling 'out' to his teammates.The decision left India staring at a defeat, as Jaiswal, who scored 84, was the last hope to save the Test. But India slipped from 121 for 3 to 155 all out, resulting in a 184-run victory for Australia, which gave them a 2-1 lead in the five-match series with just the Sydney Test left to play.After the match ended, India captain Rohit Sharma was asked about his views on the controversial call during the press conference.He felt Jaiswal did get a touch.""It didn't show on Snicko, but with the naked eye there was a deflection. In all fairness, it looked like he touched it, but more often than not we fall on the wrong side of such decisions,"" Rohit said.Australia now need just a draw in the last Test at Sydney to reclaim the Border Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014.","Yashasvi Jaiswal's caught-behind decision marred by controversy.

Political tensions rise ahead of Delhi polls

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Atishi on Tuesday raised concerns over the order for the demolition of multiple religious structures in the city, and urged Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena to reconsider the orders. In a letter addressed to Saxena, Atishi said that the Religious Committee had decided to demolish several temples and Buddhist structures across Delhi, including those held dear by the Dalit community.Atishi wrote, ""It has been decided by the Religious Committee - on your directions, and with your approval - to demolish multiple religious structures across Delhi.As you can see the list of religious structures to be demolished includes many temples, and Buddhist places of worship that are revered by the Dalit community.""The Delhi CM said that the demolition orders, issued in a meeting held on November 22, 2024, were bypassing the Delhi government’s involvement, with all decisions now routed through the Lieutenant Governor’s office.She added that, given the elected government's role in protecting the religious sentiments of Delhi’s people, such decisions should not be taken without consultation. “On behalf of the people of Delhi, I request you not to demolish any of these temples and places of worship,” she wrote.In response to Atishi’s letter, the Lieutenant Governor’s office rejected the claims, asserting that no temples or places of worship were being demolished. A spokesperson from the LG Secretariat said, ""Neither any Temples, Mosques, Churches or any other place of worship being broken/demolished, nor has any file to this effect come. CM is playing cheap politics to divert attention from her and her predecessor CM's failures.""The statement further added that the Lieutenant Governor had issued strict instructions to the police to maintain extra vigilance to prevent any politically motivated vandalism, citing the smooth celebrations during Christmas as evidence of the policy’s success.""LG has issued strict instructions to the Police to maintain extra vigil against forces who may indulge in deliberate vandalism for political benefits. His instructions are being strictly followed, as was witnessed during the just gone Christmas celebrations which did not see any untoward incident,"" the statement added.The latest exchange of letters comes amid growing political tensions between Atishi and the Lieutenant Governor. Earlier, in a separate letter, Atishi had criticised the LG’s office for acting as a proxy for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi. She accused Saxena of undermining the Aam Aadmi Party ’s (AAP) government by interfering in key initiatives, particularly schemes aimed at empoweringwomen.Atishi’s comments followed an earlier dispute with the LG’s office over Arvind Kejriwal’s remark referring to Atishi as a ""temporary CM."" Saxena had expressed his disapproval of the statement, calling it an affront to constitutional values. Atishi responded by saying that all elected officials, including her, were temporary by nature and should not be subject to petty political criticism.","Delhi chief minister Atishi has raised concerns over the order for the demolition of multiple religious structures in the city. She has urged Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena to reconsider the orders. In response, the Lieutenant Governor’s office rejected the claims, asserting that no temples or places of worship were being demolished.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116837024,imgsize-1016229,width-400,resizemode-4/116837024.jpg"
"2024: When voters said 'abki baar, coalition sarkar'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2024-when-voters-said-abki-baar-coalition-sarkar/articleshow/116829981.cms,"NEW DELHI: 2024 will be remembered for the return of coalition politics at the Centre after a gap of 10 years with the regional parties playing a key role in the formation of the BJP-led NDA 3.0 government. Even the opposition space was firmly dominated by a coalition of regional parties - which were led by the Congress but not dominated by the grand-old-party.The BJP, which created history in 2014 by winning majority on its own and then bettering its performance in 2019, failed to touch the half-way mark in 2024. This brought the focus back on regional parties, which though being part of NDA 1.0 and NDA 2.0 also had little say in the alliance as the BJP was not dependent on their numbers for the survival of its governments.Before 2014, the last time India saw a one-party majority in Lok Sabha was in 1984 when the Congress, under Rajiv Gandhi, won over 400 seats after the killing of Indira Gandhi.However, in 1989, regional parties gained prominence as the Congress started losing ground. The grand-old-party could retain less than half of the seats it had won five years back. The decline of Congress marked the beginning of another coalition era in Indian politics. From 1989 to 1991, the country saw two non-Congress Prime Ministers - V P Singh and Chandra Shekhar. In 1991, P V Narsimha Rao led the first Congresscoalition government for 5 years. The era of coalition politics continued and from 1996 to 1998, we had three Prime Ministers which included a very short 15-day stint of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The other two regional leaders who led coalition governments in this period were H D Deve Gowda and I K Gujral.Coalition compulsions ensured Lok Sabha elections were held two times in two years - in 1998 and then again in 1999 - with Atal Bihari Vajpayee returning as Prime Minister on both the occasions. In 1999, the National Democratic Alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party won a majority as a pre-poll alliance. Vajpayee went on to become the first non-Congress Prime Minister to serve a full five-year term.2004 saw the surprise return of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance to power which remained in government for two terms till 2014.In 2014, the BJP, led by Narendra Modi, won 282 seats which was 12 more than the half-way mark in Lok Sabha. This was the first time after 1984 that a party had won majority on its own. The BJP did not need any regional ally to run the show, but made them part of the first NDA government. Five years later in 2019, the BJP went on to improve its performance and this time won 303 seats on its own. NDA 2.0 also had space for BJP's allies. However, since BJP was not dependent on the allies numerically, they had very little say in matters of governance and overall direction of the alliance.In 2024, the BJP went to the polls with the clarion call of ""400 paar"". The party and its allies were confident of another great electoral show and third consecutive clean sweep for the saffron party. But that was not to be. When the results were declared on June 4 this year, the BJP found itself short of the half-way mark. And that brought the NDA's regional allies back to prominence. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar emerged as the kingmakers propping up NDA 3.0 and ensured that Narendra Modi got record third term as Prime Minister.The Budget this year was dominated by special packages and announcements for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, states that play a crucial role in survival of NDA 3.0. After 10 years of complete dominance, the BJP seems to have adjusted well to the changed political dynamics and has managed to keep its allies in good humour, at least for now.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections , the BJP-led NDA faced a formidable challenge from the coalition of opposition parties which was led by the Congress. INDIA (Indian National Inclusive Developmental Alliance) bloc, which was formed in 2023 by several opposition parties to counter the BJP, faced a turbulent run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. However, despite all the contradictions within and the challenges it did manage to stop BJP from winning third consecutive majority mandate. The Congress, helped by allies in key states, managed to nearly double its tally in the Lower House but still fell short of the three-digit mark by one seat.INDIA bloc, which took shape after a lot of birth pangs, has been pulled in different directions with regionals leaders and the Congress continuously engaged in a game of one upmanship. Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal's differences with the Congress made headlines. Not only that, even within the regional bloc there was tussle over leadership. All these contradictions ensured that INDIA bloc could never function as a united entity. However, some of the key alliances that it forged, for instance the Samajwadi Party-Congress tieup in Uttar Pradesh, managed to ensure that the BJP fell short of the half-way mark. To that extent, it can be said that the coalition of regional parties played a key role in the return of coalition politics at the Centre.","The last time India saw a one-party majority in Lok Sabha was in 1984 when the Congress, under Rajiv Gandhi, won over 400 seats after the killing of Indira Gandhi.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary KC Venugopal on Tuesday sharply condemned the controversial ""Mini Pakistan"" remark made by Maharashtra BJP minister Nitesh Rane .

""Since millennia, Kerala has been a beacon of communal harmony and brotherhood among all religions and sects,"" he wrote.The controversy erupted after Nitesh Rane, during a rally in Pune, called Kerala ""Mini Pakistan"" and suggested that Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were elected due to support from ""terrorists"" in the state. His remark, which was widely condemned, specifically targeted the Congress leadership in Kerala, claiming that ""all terrorists vote for them."" Rane's comments sparked outrage, with critics accusing him of promoting hate and divisiveness.Following the backlash, Rane attempted to clarify his statement, stating that he did not mean to imply Kerala was outside India. Instead, he claimed that his comparison was based on the treatment of Hindus in Kerala, which he likened to the persecution of Hindus in Pakistan. ""I was just stating the facts,"" Rane said, defending his position by alleging that religious conversions and ""love jihad"" were issues growing in Kerala.""Kerala is very much part of India. However, the decreasing population of Hindus is something everyone should worry about. The religious conversion of Hindus into Muslims and Christians (Islam and Christianity) has become an everyday occurrence there.""""The love jihad cases, where Hindu women are targeted, are also increasing there. I was comparing the situation in Kerala with Pakistan. The way Hindus are treated in Pakistan, if such situations happen in our very own country, we must take action against that. That is what I was trying to say in my speech,"" Rane said.""The entire situation can be compared. I was just stating the facts. I was accompanied by a gentleman who has helped 12,000 Hindu women by stopping them from getting converted to Islam and Christianity. What I said about Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, you ask anyone in the Wayanad constituency,"" the BJP leader further added.Despite his clarification, opposition leaders continued to call for Rane’s removal from his ministerial position.

As we close the chapter in 2024, conflicts continue to rage across various regions worldwide. Despite ongoing efforts aimed at establishing peace, hostilities remain intense on multiple fronts, heightening the risk of a broader global confrontation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi repeatedly reiterated the country's commitment to the principle of ""no era of war,"" urging global leaders to embrace ""Peace, Dialogue, and Diplomacy."" However, India also recognised the necessity of bolstering its defence capabilities to assert itself as a recognised regional power.In addition, increasing disturbances in neighbouring regions amplified India’s imperative to enhance its defence strategy to safeguard its national interests.In response, India has made significant enhancements to its military arsenal in 2024 to address its security requirements.Notably, these advancements not only strengthened the nation's military capabilities but also advanced the ambitious Make in India initiative.Most of these enhancements were either fully domestically produced or comprised of substantial components manufactured within India.Following are the latest additions to the Indian armed forces:-The AK-203 is a modernised version of the renowned Kalashnikov series, chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. In 2024, the Indo-Russian joint venture, Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL), delivered 35,000 AK-203 rifles to the Indian Army , enhancing infantry capabilities with improved accuracy, reliability, and ease of maintenance.The ASMI is an indigenous 9mm submachine gun developed by the Indian Army's Infantry School and DRDO. Designed for close-quarter battles, it offers a compact and lightweight solution for counter-terrorism and special operations. In 2024, the Indian Army inducted 550 ASMI units into the Northern Command, bolstering its close-combat arsenal.BHISHM Cubes are innovative mobile medical units developed under Project BHISHM (Bharat Health Initiative for Sahyog Hita and Maitri ). They are designed to provide emergency medical care, particularly in conflict zones and disaster-affected areas. Equipped with trauma, burn, and surgical facilities, they operate autonomously with power and oxygen generation.It is a portable multi-target detonation device developed by the Indian Army's Corps of Engineers. This microprocessor-based innovation enhances the safety and efficiency of demolition operations, offering improved range and selective targeting. With a range of 2.5 km, Agniastra proves invaluable in conventional and counter-terrorism operations, such as room interventions, IED destruction and remote bunker or hideout destruction.It is Indian Army’s first indigenous loiter munition, aka suicide drone. A man-portable, electric UAV weighing 9 kg, it features a range of up to 30 km. Equipped with a 1 kg warhead, it offers GPS-enabled precision strikes and a low acoustic signature, making it effective in both day and night operations. It has over 75% indigenous content and its unique recovery and reuse capabilities set it apart from global counterparts.India’s defence sector marked a milestone with the rollout of 10 T-90 Mk-III tanks (upgraded version of T-90 Bhishma tanks) by Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited. Built at HVF, these tanks feature upgrades like an automatic target tracking system, a digital ballistic computer, and an indigenously developed commander sight. The full batch of 464 tanks will be delivered over five years.In 2024, the Indian Army inducted 24 Russia-made Igla-S MANPADS with 100 missiles to enhance its Very Short Range Air Defence (VSHORAD). This system targets low-flying aircraft, drones , and missiles. The deal includes domestic production through Transfer of Technology, replacing outdated Igla-1M systems.In 2024, the Indian Army introduced Akashteer, an advanced air defence system. It combines sensors from different sources to create a clear view of the sky, helping the army respond quickly to threats like aircraft and missiles. With over 100 systems delivered, the project will be fully deployed by 2027, strengthening India’s defence.The Indian Army introduced the Sirin Hexadrone, an advanced hexacopter drone designed for combat operations. With a 45-minute flight endurance, it can carry up to 1 kg of armament, including machine guns and grenades. Developed by Ikran Aerospace, it features advanced targeting, encrypted communication, and efficient electric propulsion, enhancing surveillance and reducing soldier fatalities.The Indian Navy commissioned INS Tushil, a multi-role stealth-guided missile frigate, marking a key milestone in enhancing India’s maritime capabilities. The seventh ship in the Project 1135.6 series, INS Tushil features advanced weaponry like BrahMos missiles and Shtil Surface-to-Air Missiles. It integrates 26% indigenous systems.The Indian Navy commissioned INS Sandhayak, an advanced survey vessel, in Visakhapatnam in 2024. This 110-meter vessel is equipped with cutting-edge sonar systems, enhancing the Navy's hydrographic survey and ocean research capabilities. With a speed of 18 knots, INS Sandhayak will bolster India’s maritime security and research.INS Triput is the first indigenously-built Talwar-class frigate of India and was launched in 2024. It was built by Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL). Part of India’s effort to strengthen its maritime defence, this 124.8-meter ship features advanced stealth technology and powerful weapon systems, including BrahMos missiles.India commissioned INS Arighat in 2024, its second nuclear-powered submarine, enhancing its strategic deterrence. Armed with K-15 (750 km range) and K-4 (3,500 km range) submarine-launched ballistic missiles, it joins INS Arihant in strengthening India’s nuclear triad. Powered by a pressurized light-water reactor, INS Arighat ensures survivability for retaliatory strikes, supporting India’s ""no-first use"" policy.INS Nirdeshak, the second ship of the Survey Vessel (Large) project, was commissioned into the Indian Navy in 2024. Built with over 80% indigenous content, it features advanced hydrographic systems for ocean mapping and navigation. The ship supports India’s maritime diplomacy and security in the Indian Ocean Region.Indian Navy launched Malpe and Mulki in 2024, the fourth and fifth ships of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Craft (ASW SWC) project, which are built by Cochin Shipyard Ltd. The ships, part of the Mahe class, feature over 80% indigenous content and are designed for coastal anti-submarine operations, with speeds of 25 knots and endurance up to 1800 nautical miles.India's Navy acquired its first indigenous medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drone, the Drishti 10 Starliner, developed by Adani Defence and Aerospace in collaboration with Elbit Systems. With 70% indigenous content, the drone offers 36-hour endurance, a 450 kg payload capacity, and adaptability for surveillance and reconnaissance missions.Indian Navy got destroyer INS Surat and frigate INS Nilgiri in 2024. These ships, built by the Warship Design Bureau and MDL, enhance India's naval capabilities, reflecting the focus on Aatmanirbharta. INS Surat, the fourth and final Project 15B destroyer, boasts advanced weapons , AI integration, and speeds over 30 knots.INS Nilgiri, the first Project 17A frigate, is equipped with cutting-edge missile systems. Both ships have 75% indigenous content.In addition to these inductions, India conducted various successful trials and tests of various other lethal advanced weapons this year.The country test-fired a domestically developed long-range hypersonic missile, capable of carrying payloads over 1,500 km at speeds exceeding Mach 5.The Navy tested an extended-range Brahmos missile, while the Agni Prime missile, with MIRV technology, also passed its trial.India signed agreements with several countries to acquire new weapons, including a Rs 28,000 crore deal for MQ-9B Predator drones with the US and the opening of Spain’s C-295 aircraft manufacturing plant in Gujarat’s Vadodara.The country has also sanctioned various upgrades for its existing arsenal to enhance its battle capabilities.For example, Sukhoi-30s, which are considered the backbone of IAF, will receive a major makeover to increase their life by 30 more years.IAF will also soon get its first batch of an upgraded version of its made-in-India LCA Tejas, Tejas MK-1A, which is being developed by HAL.","India has made significant enhancements to its military arsenal in 2024 to address its security requirements.

Congress under old guards: A hindrance to revival?



A year of mixed fortunes



NEW DELHI: The Congress party experienced a mixed trajectory in 2024, facing both significant electoral challenges and opportunities. The party navigated through crucial Lok Sabha elections and various state polls, achieving modest successes whilst encountering substantial setbacks in its bid to regain political prominence.At the national level, Congress improved its parliamentary presence, increasing its Lok Sabha seats from 52 in 2019 to 99 in 2024, strengthening the INDIA bloc 's position against the BJP. However, state-level outcomes presented a more nuanced picture, with victories often overshadowed by major losses, underlining the substantial work required for the party's restoration.The INDIA bloc emerged as a formidable coalition in the run-up to the 2024 elections, uniting opposition parties to challenge the BJP's decade-long dominance. Spearheaded by Congress, this alliance included regional heavyweights like the Samajwadi party, NCP (SP), TMC, and the DMK. The bloc's formation was initially catalyzed by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, who hosted the first meeting of opposition leaders, laying the groundwork for a unified strategy.However, Nitish Kumar later switched sides, aligning with the BJP to reclaim his position as Bihar CM. He eventually offered his support to the Centre's government formation, emerging as a key player in the process.With its ""big tent"" approach, the bloc sought to consolidate anti-BJP votes across states, focusing on states where regional parties had strongholds.The 2024 general elections marked a significant shift, as the INDIA bloc secured 238 seats, gaining over 100 seats compared to its pre-dissolution strength. And the grand old party just a seat short in scoring century. Despite this improvement, the Congress fell short of being a decisive force in the Lok Sabha, as the BJP-led NDA secured 293 seats, including 240 for the BJP.In Uttar Pradesh, Congress’s alliance with the Samajwadi Party bore fruit, with the bloc winning 44 seats, a major dent in the BJP’s stronghold where its tally fell from 62 in 2019. Other than UP, the alliance performed exceptionally well in key battleground state like Maharashtra , where it wrested the majority of seats from the BJP.In 2024, Congress saw its vote share increase by 1.74 percentage points, reaching 21.20%, up from 19.46% in 2019. This rise was reflected in its improved seat tally.Meanwhile, the BJP, despite contesting more seats than in 2019, saw a decline of 0.73 percentage points in its vote share, dropping to 36.57%, and is expected to fall short of the 272-seat mark.However, this success was offset by poor performance in states like Bihar, where the Congress-RJD alliance failed to make an impact, allowing the NDA to retain its grip.As the BJP's Lok Sabha tally dropped, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was forced to lean on key allies like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu to maintain his position in power.The Congress appeared heavily reliant on its allies in 2024. With the INDIA bloc's collective efforts, the opposition secured nearly 240 seats in the Lok Sabha, marking a strong revival. Among key contributors was Akhilesh Yadav 's Samajwadi Party, which clinched a remarkable 37 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, slashing the BJP's 2019 tally of 62 to just 33. The biggest shock came when the SP wrested Ayodhya's Faizabad seat from the BJP, despite the latter's high-profile Ram Mandir consecration ceremony led by PM Modi just months earlier.The alliance with DMK proved equally impactful, resulting in a clean sweep in Tamil Nadu, where the BJP failed to win a single seat. The DMK’s contribution of 21 seats became a major pillar for the INDIA bloc. Similarly, Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar's NCP added critical support, further denting the BJP’s dominance.In state assembly elections , regional allies carried much of the weight for Congress. In Jharkhand, Hemant Soren's JMM, fresh from his legal battles, won 34 seats, while Congress managed only 16. Together, the INDIA bloc limited the BJP to 21 seats in the state to continue Soren on CM's seat.In Jammu and Kashmir, the first assembly elections in over a decade—and the first since the abrogation of Article 370—witnessed stellar performance by the National Conference, which secured 41 seats in the valley. Despite Congress managing just 6 seats and the BJP achieving its best results in Jammu, the National Conference of Omar Abdullah led the charge, keeping Congress on board to claim leadership in the Union Territory.- Congress faced major defeat, winning only one of 60 seats as the BJP strengthened its hold with 46 seats.- The ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) swept the elections, leaving no space for the Congress or other opposition parties.- In the Andhra Pradesh polls, Chandrababu Naidu's TDP secured a historic win with 135 seats out of 144 contested. Allies Jana Sena and BJP won 21 and 8 seats, respectively, while the ruling YSR Congress was reduced to 11 seats. The Congress failed to win any seat.- In the Odisha polls, Congress won 14 seats, CPI(M) secured one, and independent candidates claimed three. However, the BJP emerged as the dominant force, crossing the majority mark with 78 seats, ending Naveen Patnaik’s 24-year reign and limiting the BJD to just 51 seats.- Congress put up a strong fight but fell short, securing 37 seats compared to the BJP’s 48, despite a close vote share.- In the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections, the Abdullah's National Conference (NC) led the alliance to victory with 42 seats, while Congress secured just six seats. The BJP performed strongly in Jammu region, winning 29 seats in the 90-seat Assembly.- The Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi suffered a crushing defeat as the BJP won 132 seats. The grand old party secured only 16 seats, while other MVA allies also struggled, including Sharad Pawar's NCP with 10 seats and Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena with 20 seats.- The Congress, as part of the JMM-led Mahagathbandhan, celebrated a comfortable victory. The coalition won 56 seats, with Congress contributing 16.The Congress' consistent decisions to support its veteran leaders has been widely regarded as a significant factor contributing to its declining performance in state elections.In October 2022, the grand old party handed over the presidential baton to veteran Mallikarjun Kharge , bypassing other frontrunners such as Shashi Tharoor, a London-educated, St Stephen's alumnus and social media favorite.In 2018, Kamal Nath was chosen over Jyotiraditya Scindia for the chief minister's seat in Madhya Pradesh. The government eventually collapsed in 2020, with Scindia subsequently joining the BJP, which gave him the post of Union minister.Similarly, in the same year, choosing Ashok Gehlot over Sachin Pilot for Rajasthan's top post deepened their rivalry, a rift that likely played a major role in the party's 2023 electoral defeat in the state.The party's backing of Haryana veteran Bhupinder Singh Hooda, a former chief minister, also led to internal rivalry, with tensions between Hooda and Kumari Shelja. This rift likely contributed to Congress’ shocking defeat, defying poll predictions.The party-under Kharge's leadership stumbled in several state elections, including losing its grip in states like Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.Nevertheless, the Congress showed improvement in the 2024 general elections, with the INDIA alliance securing 238 seats, marking an increase of over 100 seats from its previous position. The party itself came close to reaching 100 seats.The establishment of the opposition alliance INDIA, spearheaded by Congress, represented a notable attempt to present a unified front against the BJP. The coalition's achievements in the Lok Sabha demonstrated the effectiveness of opposition unity, yet setbacks in regions such as Maharashtra revealed the difficulties in sustaining political momentum and maintaining unity.The year 2024 demonstrated Congress's endurance alongside its weak points. In 2025, the INDIA alliance confronts the challenge of maintaining its unified stance and converting immediate achievements into enduring political advantages, particularly with significant electoral contests approaching in the coming year.","In 2024, Congress saw its vote share increase by 1.74 percentage points, reaching 21.20%, up from 19.46% in 2019. The INDIA bloc secured 238 seats, gaining over 100 seats compared to its pre-dissolution strength. Despite this improvement, the Congress fell short of being a decisive force in the Lok Sabha.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116818600,imgsize-1332888,width-400,resizemode-4/116818600.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a year where diplomacy danced on a tightrope and every handshake bore the weight of history, India navigated complex diplomatic waters amidst significant regional tensions. The icy thaw in its long-standing border dispute with China and emerging discord with Bangladesh required skilful diplomatic manoeuvring across the subcontinent.The relationship with Canada remained complicated, with Prime Minister Trudeau's leadership continuing for at least another ten months.Additionally, India faced the task of establishing diplomatic rapport with Sri Lanka's new Marxist leadership, despite their previous anti-India stance.India's diplomatic endeavours in 2024 presented both successes and significant hurdles. The nation's diplomatic capabilities were tested as it addressed historical conflicts whilst adapting to evolving global relationships.Here are some key moments that shaped the year’s diplomatic narrative:The ouster of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh’s politics in August was a shift that altered the dynamics of India-Bangladesh ties. A student-initiated movement resulted in violent clashes, leading to over 1,000 casualties. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus subsequently assumed leadership of an interim government.Bangladesh experienced substantial social upheaval following this political transition. The arrest of spiritual preacher Chinmoy Krishna Das sparked controversy, whilst increased attacks on minorities led to unrest in Chattogram, resulting in a lawyer's death. India expressed serious concerns regarding minority safety, particularly of Hindus, though Bangladesh consistently maintained this was an ""internal matter"".India’s relations with Canada plunged to new depths following accusations linking Indian officials to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations of Indian involvement sparked a chain reaction: tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats, suspension of visa services, and a chilling of trade discussions. India recalled high commissioner Sanjay Verma along with other diplomats.In November, the rift intensified after pro-Khalistani supporters allegedly attacked attendees of an Indian consular event at a Hindu temple in Toronto. The ministry of external affairs called out Canada for failing to protect Indian citizens and institutions, while Canada maintained its stance, claiming a “targeted campaign” by Indian agents against Canadian citizens.The winter session of the Parliament saw the government reiterate that Trudeau’s accusations were baseless, with no evidence being provided by the Trudeau administration to the Indian government.The United States charged Indian national Nikhil Gupta in connection with a foiled assassination attempt on Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Gupta was alleged to have acted on orders from a senior Indian official.A subsequent Washington Post report implicated Vikram Yadav, a former operative of India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), in orchestrating the plot. The Indian government dismissed the claims as ""unwarranted and unsubstantial."" Despite India’s denials, the US demanded “meaningful accountability,” signaling that the case was far from over.India’s relations with Iran also faced turbulence when Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei named India as a place where Muslims are ""suffering,"" calling for global solidarity among the Islamic community. The comment, made on the Prophet Mohammed’s birth anniversary, drew sharp criticism from the ministry of external affairs, which termed it ""misinformed and unacceptable.""In a major breakthrough, India and China resolved their 54-month eastern Ladakh military standoff in October, reinstating pre-2020 LAC patrolling arrangements. The disengagement process, finalized in October, restored pre-2020 patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Alongside the agreement, both nations explored ways to rebuild ties through cross-border cooperation, including the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and data-sharing on trans-border rivers.Eight former Indian Navy personnel, previously facing death sentences in Qatar, were freed following intensive diplomatic efforts. The successful resolution highlighted effective negotiations led by Indian officials, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledging this achievement as evidence of strengthening bilateral relations between India and Qatar.Subsequently, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and PM Modi engaged in discussions about potential partnerships in advanced sectors.The political landscape in Sri Lanka shifted with Anura Kumara Dissanayake's presidential victory. His leadership of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), traditionally known for its opposition to Indian influence since the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord, initially raised diplomatic concerns.Nevertheless, Dissanayake chose India for his first international visit after assuming office.India bolstered its regional influence by signing a 10-year agreement with Iran to manage and develop the strategic Chabahar port. This investment, worth $370 million, made India a key player in enhancing connectivity with Central Asia and Afghanistan. The deal represents a significant milestone as India takes charge of managing an overseas port for the first time.Prime Minister Modi’s diplomatic outreach extended to regions often overlooked in India’s foreign policy narrative. PM Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Kuwait in 43 years, with the trip focused on strengthening energy ties and boosting trade.PM Modi visited Nigeria after 17 years, with the focus being on expanding cooperation in sectors like agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and defense. The Prime Minister’s visit to Guyana, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 56 years, sought to deepen ties with the Indian diaspora and explore avenues for collaboration in natural resources and infrastructure.India’s relationship with Russia demonstrated renewed vigour, with President Vladimir Putin describing the ties as ""specially privileged."" The Prime Minister's diplomatic expertise was evident in his unprecedented visit to Ukraine, where he pursued peace initiatives during the current conflict.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested India host a summit to discuss resolution pathways for the Russian conflict, highlighting India's potential diplomatic role.Relations between India and Maldives, which experienced tensions under President Mohamed Muizzu's China-friendly administration, showed positive progress.During Muizzu’s first state visit to India, he reassured New Delhi that his government would prioritize India’s security interests.India extended financial aid worth $400 million, including a Rs 3,000 crore bilateral currency swap agreement, demonstrating its support for the Maldives’ economic recovery.India’s humanitarian instincts were on display through ""Operation Sadbhav,"" an initiative to deliver emergency relief supplies to Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam in the wake of Typhoon Yagi. The storm, deemed Asia’s most powerful of the year, caused widespread devastation, displacing thousands.",India's diplomatic endeavours in 2024 presented both successes and significant hurdles. The nation's diplomatic capabilities were tested as it addressed historical conflicts whilst adapting to evolving global relationships.

Mixed bag for Rahul Gandhi



NEW DELHI: In the United States, Donald Trump returned as president proving several political pundits wrong. On screens, Pushpa returned with Part 2, breaking all the box office records with over Rs 1,700 crore collection and counting. The year 2024, similarly, saw several political comebacks proving yet again that a seasoned politician can never be written off.When pushed against the wall, they rose like a phoenix, setting a fresh tone in Indian politics.Last year, when Chandrababu Naidu went to jail, the 74-year-old politician and his Telugu Desam Party (TDP) appeared to be in dire straits.Prospects were looking bleak when he was sent to jail for 52 days as an accused with multiple cases against him, enough to keep him behind bars for long.In a remarkable political resurgence, Naidu achieved significant success in 2024. He not only emerged as a king in the Andhra Pradesh assembly elections but also took the center stage as a kingmaker influencing the NDA government formation at the Centre.The TDP swept 135 of 175 seats in Andhra Pradesh while former CM Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSRCP could win only 21 seats.The TDP's success also extended to the Lok Sabha elections where it won 16 of 25 seats while the YSRCP won only 4 seats.Despite leaving the NDA alliance for the Congress-led UPA in 2019, Naidu rejoined the BJP-led coalition shortly before the 2024 elections. His arrest on September 9 in the Skill Development Corporation Scam case by the YSRCP government, followed by his imprisonment in Rajamahendravaram central jail, generated public sympathy.In 2019, Devendra Fadnavis famously said: ""Mera paani utarta dekh mere kinare pe ghar mat basa lena. Main samandar hun laut kar wapis aaunga (Watch my tide recede, don’t build your house on my shores. I am the ocean, I’ll return).""And what a comeback!Fadnavis, popularly known as ""Deva Bhau"", took oath as Maharashtra chief minister this year. The BJP , which had previously agreed to make Eknath Shinde the CM in 2022 after Shinde split from Shiv Sena , fielded Fadnavis once again after the elections.This came after the party’s impressive win in Maharashtra assembly polls with 132 of 288 seats.Fadnavis was promoted just five months after he offered to resign from his position as deputy CM, taking full responsibility for the BJP's poor showing in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP had seen a massive drop in its Lok Sabha seat count in Maharashtra, from 23 in 2019 to only 9 in 2024. Instead, he was asked by the BJP's central leadership to take charge of poll preparations while staying in government.After this, Fadnavis made an early intervention that turned out to be critical. He also reached out to the RSS seeking its help in countering MVA's narrative on caste and community which eventually helped Mahayuti win the election.For a politician who once expressed reluctance to contest another assembly election in J&K, Omar Abdullah's result day on October 8 began with anticipation of a crucial verdict. ""Counting day 7K done. Last time around it didn't end well for me personally. InshaAllah this time around it will be better,"" he shared on X at 9.24am, posting a selfie in a white polo against a natural backdrop. By 11.48am, his confidence had visibly returned, contrasting with his recent Baramulla Lok Sabha defeat.At 54, Omar Abdullah returned to the chief minister's position, 15 years after becoming the state's youngest CM. As Sheikh Abdullah's grandson and Farooq Abdullah's son, Omar has faced significant expectations. In a 2023 YouTube video, he reflected, ""I think a lot of people believe that because you come from a political family, everything is a bed of roses...It couldn't be further from the truth...You inherit enemies that you haven't made through your own actions...I found people disliked me but had no idea who I was.""In the J&K assembly elections, the first in a decade after revocation of the special status (Article 370), his Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) won 42 of 90 seats and its ally Congress a mere four seats.His recent political resurgence is particularly notable following his defeat in the Baramulla Lok Sabha elections just a few months ago.The biggest stunner of this year's Lok Sabha elections was the resurgence of Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav.The BJP faced a significant setback in Uttar Pradesh during the Lok Sabha elections, with SP under Akhilesh Yadav leading the political transformation. The BJP's performance in this crucial state, which holds 80 Lok Sabha constituencies, declined substantially from 62 seats in 2019 to 33 seats.Akhilesh Yadav's party demonstrated remarkable growth, advancing from just five seats in 2019 to becoming the state's dominant political force with 37 constituencies. The INDIA bloc collectively secured 43 seats. This outcome materialised despite the BJP's intensive campaign focusing on the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya.Akhilesh broadened the Samajwadi base deliberately by incorporating representatives from diverse backward communities. The SP allocated merely six tickets to Yadav candidates in Lok Sabha polls, while increasing representation for smaller OBC groups and Dalit subgroups including Jatavs who were seeking alternatives beyond a weakened Mayawati and an unreliable BJP.The saffron party, however, neutralised the loss to some extent in Uttar Pradesh bypolls which were held in November. The BJP managed to cling six of a total of 9 seats while Akhilesh's SP got only two seats.Ajit Pawar, who broke away from his uncle Sharad Pawar and retained the original NCP in Maharashtra, saw a few lows in the year 2024. But by the end of the year, he managed to sail through the political tsunami and managed to hold onto his deputy CM chair.In the Lok Sabha elections, the NCP was allotted only five seats within Mahayuti and managed to win only one, finishing last among the six major parties in Maharashtra. Ajit's decision to field his wife against Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule for the Baramati contest also failed miserably.But by the time assembly elections approached, Sharad Pawar played reverse Uno by pitching Ajit's nephew against him, setting up another prestige battle. The gambit, however, didn't pay off.The NCP faction led by Ajit significantly improved its performance, moving from just six assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha results to securing 41 MLAs. In direct confrontations with candidates backed by the senior Pawar, Ajit's group emerged victorious in 27 instances, while the latter managed to win only 7 such contests. Ajit also established a strong presence across western Maharashtra (22 seats), Marathwada (10) and Vidarbha (5) regions.Ajit and his experienced political associates, who joined him during the NCP split in 2023, demonstrated strategic acumen. They learned from their Lok Sabha election missteps, conducting a relentless campaign, particularly in rural areas. They also acknowledged the significant impact of Ladki Bahin Yojna, even incorporating pink, traditionally associated with femininity, as their campaign colour.What could have been the year of Rahul Gandhi, ended in 1-1 for the Congress leader as the party failed to capitalise on the gains made in the first half of the year.In the Lok Sabha elections, Congress won 99 seats and the opposition INDIA bloc managed to secure 240 seats. With the new strength, Rahul Gandhi was also elected the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha.This was in June, after which the party failed to carry the momentum and saw major setbacks in Haryana and Maharashtra bypolls.In the Haryana elections, BJP returned to power for the third consecutive term, despite anti-incumbency. The voters handed out a clear defeat to Congress whose infighting was out in the open. The BJP won the majority with 48 of 90 seats while Congress secured 37 seats.In Maharashtra, as Congress got the biggest ticket chuck in MVA, it failed to impress. The party managed to get 16 of 288 seats while the BJP alone secured 132 seats.","The year 2024 saw several political comebacks proving yet again that a seasoned politician can never be written off.

Exciting, but still a long way to go A major step forward for India’s space program

24 POEM Payloads

India on Monday got a step closer to becoming part of an elite group of nations with space-docking technology — ability to mate two spacecraft in space — with Isro ’s putting two small satellites weighing 220 kg each, into orbit.The satellites, part of the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, lifted off around little past 10pm on the PSLV-C60 from the first launchpad at the spaceport in Sriharikota.They were placed in a 475-km circular orbit some 15 minutes later. The first of the two satellites was separated 15.1 minutes after lift off, and the other happened at 15.2 minutes.As per M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), the satellites — ‘chaser’ and ‘target’ spacecraft — launched separately will initially be released with a small relative velocity between them.As reported by TOI earlier, the satellites, through a series of carefully choreographed manoeuvres, will distance from each other over the next few days before Isro attempts to dock them. If Isro manages this successfully, India would have taken the first serious step towards mastering the technology, something only the US, Russia and China boast of as on date.“The rocket has placed the satellite in the right orbit. The satellites moved one behind the other. Their distance will increase to about 20km over the next few days before we close the gap and attempt the docking. We’re hoping to complete docking in the coming week. The nominal date for this is Jan 7,” Isro chairman S Somanath said soon after the launch.The mission is crucial for India’s future space endeavors including Chandrayaan-4 and the planned Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS), as confirmed by Isro chairman S Somanath.In addition to the primary docking experiment, the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) carried 24 innovative payloads, including several groundbreaking experiments: India’s first astrobiology payloads are among the highlights, featuring RV College of Engineering’s microbiological experiment studying gut bacteria behavior in space, and Amity University's investigation of spinach growth in microgravity.Isro is also launching its own CROPS (Compact Research Module for Orbital Plant Studies) payload to demonstrate seed germination in space, a robotic arm designed to capture space debris and a sophisticated inter-satellite communication system. Isro will demonstrate a unique “walking” robotic arm with 7 degrees of freedom, intended for future space station operations.The private sector has also sent payloads on POEM: PierSight, an Ahmedabad-based startup, launched Varuna, a precursor to what could be India’s first private Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite for maritime surveillance. The company aims to establish a 32-satellite constellation by 2028 for comprehensive ocean monitoring.The other payloads are Mumbai-based Manastu and Bengaluru’s Bellatrix Aerospace, both testing their respective green propulsion technologies, while GalaxEye from Bengaluru is showcasing their SAR signal processing technology and TakeMe2Space from Hyderabad is demonstrating nanosatellite subsystems.Other educational institutions participating include SJC Institute of Technology and MIT World Peace University. SJC from Karnataka is sending a multimode message transmitter payload that can transmit audio, text, and image messages from a satellite to the ground using FM modulation and the VHF band. It is designed to provide amateur radio satellite services globally. It was designed in collaboration with Isro’s URSC.","Isro launched two small satellites weighing 220 kg each, into orbit.

NEW DELHI: India's economic growth remained resilient in 2024, with projections reflecting a strong trajectory despite global challenges. The finance ministry estimates a 6.5% GDP growth rate for the fiscal year 2024-25, while the World Bank's India Development Update forecasts an even higher 7% growth, solidifying India's position as the world's fastest-growing major economy.India is currently the fifth-largest economy in the world, with a GDP of $3.89 trillion at current prices, growing at an impressive rate of 8.2 percent in FY 23/24.India's finished steel imports reached an eight-year high, with China supplying a record 1.96 million metric tons in the first eight months of FY 2024-25, marking a 22.8% year-on-year increase. Total steel imports surged 26.6% to 6.5 million metric tons during the same period, raising concerns among domestic producers about the influx of cheap steel from China.India made significant diplomatic strides in 2024. Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the first Indian PM to visit Ukraine amid the Russia-Ukraine war, while President Droupadi Murmu made a historic visit to Fiji.India also hosted the third edition of the Voice of the Global South Summit, attended by 100 nations, and strengthened ties through a free trade agreement with Iceland and a bilateral investment treaty with the UAE.India's global stature was further bolstered by re-election to the UN Peacebuilding Commission and Modi receiving the Order of Excellence from Guyana.The manufacturing, trade, and services sectors added 11 million jobs in 2024, increasing total employment to 120.6 million, up from 109.6 million the previous year.The Reserve Bank of India maintained key interest rates, prioritizing a balance between economic growth and inflation control.In 2024, India surpassed China as Asia's leading market for IPOs, driven by strong equity fundraising and rising stock prices.The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) continued its dominance in digital payments, with transactions reaching an unprecedented Rs 18.41 trillion in January 2024. UPI has grown at a CAGR of 129%, from 92 crore transactions in FY 2017-18 to 13,116 crore in FY 2023-24. Between April and August 2024, transaction volumes totaled 7,062 crore, underscoring the platform's widespread adoption.The ministry of defence received its highest-ever allocation of Rs 6.22 trillion, marking a 4.79% increase from the previous year.

"Delhi LG writes letter over Kejriwal's 'temporary CM' remark, Atishi says 'I am amused'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/objectionable-personally-hurtful-delhi-lg-writes-to-atishi-over-arvind-kejriwals-temporary-cm-remarks/articleshow/116801658.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena on Monday wrote a letter to Delhi CM Atishi conveying his objections over ex-CM Arvind Kejriwal calling her 'temporary CM'.""I found it deeply objectionable and was personally hurt when your predecessor, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, recently declared you in the media as merely a temporary and stopgap Chief Minister,"" said the LG in his letter.""It was not only an insult to you, but also to your appointee, the President of India and to me as her representative,"" he added.Saxena further slammed the AAP supremo and said, ""The public characterisation of a temporary or stopgap chief minister, as articulated by Shri Kejriwal, has no constitutional basis. It is also a deplorable violation of the democratic spirit and values enshrined in the Constitution authored by Babasaheb Ambedkar.""The LG lauded Atishi for her approach in governance, contrasting it with her predecessor's alleged reluctance to take on administrative responsibilities. “For the first time during my tenure, I have seen a Chief Minister actively performing the duties of the office,” he wrote.The LG further outlined the challenges faced by the Delhi government, including the Yamuna pollution crisis , garbage management, and the poor state of infrastructure in industrial and slum areas. ""It is well known under what circumstances you were made Chief Minister. Whether it be the worsening state of the Yamuna over the past ten years, the severe shortage of drinking water, the issue of garbage mountains, the lack of basic amenities in industrial areas, the disrepair of roads and sewer lines, the crumbling healthcare system, the dire lack of facilities in unauthorized colonies, or the abysmal living conditions in slum areas—everyone understands how impossible it is for a Chief Minister, already declared temporary and stopgap, to address these issues in three to four months,"" the LG said adding, ""as chief minister, the responsibility for these failures will now rest on your shoulders"".The letter also took aim at Kejriwal for making unilateral announcements on government schemes during public events claiming, “Unauthorized announcements such as schemes for senior citizens and women have undermined the dignity of the chief minister’s office and the Cabinet.”Additionally, the LG condemned Kejriwal’s claims of alleged investigations against Atishi, including suggestions that she could face jail time. He referred to official communications from the Transport Department and the Vigilance Department, which have categorically denied any such probes, calling Kejriwal’s allegations ""baseless and misleading"".The letter also saw LG expressing his concern about the level of political discourse in the capital. “I am concerned about the level of public discourse and am deeply hurt by the narrative presenting the full-time chief minister of my government as a temporary Chief Minister,” he wrote.Atishi responded to the letter letter with a sharp critique, urging him to prioritise governance over politics. ""It is a testimony to the democratic principles of our country that all elected members of the government are in fact temporary and remain in office only till the duration of their term. I am amused by you taking offence at any statement highlighting this reality of an active democracy,"" she said.Addressing the LG, she added, ""As the Lieutenant Governor, though a nominated member, you are also a part of the Delhi government. It is disheartening to note that your letter focuses on criticism rather than constructive cooperation. I strongly believe that governance should remain above petty politics, and I urge you to work alongside us in this spirit.""She defended the legacy of her predecessor, Arvind Kejriwal, stating that his governance model has become a benchmark not just in Delhi but across India. ""The elected government led by the former CM Shri Arvind Kejriwal managed to do more work in its tenure of nine and a half years than collectively done by the previous governments. I respectfully request your office to play a facilitative role rather than one that creates impediments,"" she said. Further praising Kejriwal the Delhi CM added, ""The current work of the Delhi government is deeply rooted in the vision and legacy of former Chief Minister Shri Arvind Kejriwal. Be it the educational reforms, healthcare revolution, or infrastructural advancements, his model of governance has become a benchmark not just in Delhi but across India. The progress we are making today is a continuation of this legacy, and we remain committed to fulfilling this vision.""Accusing the LG of being aligned with BJP, she claimed, ""It is evident that the office of the Lieutenant Governor is now working as a proxy of the BJP, and in its enthusiasm to protect the interest of the BJP, is causing damage to the lives of ordinary Delhites,""adding that she ""do not see how anyone can be so caught up in politics that they do not care for the people at all.""Atishi then called for for a collective effort to respect the people's mandate and work towards the betterment of Delhi. She expressed hope that 2025 would mark a shift towards constructive governance, leaving behind the ""baggage of politics.""","Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena wrote a letter to Delhi CM Atishi conveying his objections over ex-CM Arvind Kejriwal calling her 'temporary CM'Saxena further slammed the AAP supremo and said, ""The public characterisation of a temporary or stopgap chief minister, as articulated by Shri Kejriwal, has no constitutional basis""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116801892,imgsize-1072624,width-400,resizemode-4/116801892.jpg"

Here’s how Isro will attempt historic rendezvous & docking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heres-how-isro-will-attempt-historic-rendezvous-docking/articleshow/116839913.cms,"Once docked, the satellites will demonstrate power transfer capabilities, with electricity flowing from one satellite to the other to power a heater, confirming successful connection

BENGALURU: Isro’s ambitious Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, which is scheduled to do the docking manoeuvre on January 7, will see the two satellites perform a carefully choreographed orbital dance before attempting to dock with each other.And here’s how:The launch has given a small difference in velocity between the satellites. At 10m/s rate, this distance will further grow and the satellites will grow apart by about 20km, as early as by the evening of December 31.Once the satellites reach this separation, Isro will begin controlling their relative positions.“We’ll start using the onboard propulsion systems on one of the two satellites to arrest the drift so that we maintain the 20km distance between the two satellites,” M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), said, explaining the intricate sequence of events that will unfold.And like twins, the satellites will go around in the same orbit with the same speed. The mission timeline includes a four-day waiting period to achieve optimal solar orientation, crucial for generating sufficient power during the docking procedure.“At this point again, we’ll initiate the drift of the two satellites. So that the 20 km distance is progressively reduced to 5km, 1.5km and so on. And after we reach 5km, we’ll enable the inter-satellite radio frequency (RF) link so that the satellites talk to each other and exchange their own position, attitude, etc, which’ll enable us to evaluate the software logics,” Sankaran said.Several new sensors developed by the Laboratory For Electro Optics Systems (LEOS) in Bengaluru will be evaluated for their fitness for initiating the docking sequence, which will start once the inter-satellite distance is reduced to 1.5km, utilising three different guidance algorithms.The docking mechanism involves a “hugging” action. “The final approach will be particularly delicate. With a constant velocity of about 10mm/s, the chaser satellite will go and enter into the target satellite. The latches will be released and clamps on both sides will try to grab each of the satellites,” Sankaran added....And once they hold each other together, the ring which has been extended on the chaser satellite will be retracted so that the target satellite will be pulled towards the chaser satellite and the two will become as a single unit.Once docked, the satellites will demonstrate power transfer capabilities, with electricity flowing from one satellite to the other to power a heater, confirming successful connection. The combined unit will then be controlled by a single satellite's control system, demonstrating technology crucial for future space station operations, including India’s planned Bharati Antriksh station .The SpaDeX mission represents a long journey from concept to reality. “This work, as a thought experiment, started around 1989 and at the time, nobody thought that this was required for us, but the tenacity was there. When the project was approved in 2016, we were able to realise it over several years,” Sankaran said.The mission has required extensive preparation and testing. Isro developed several testbeds to validate the mechanism as well as the docking sequence, the sensors, etc. It has been a combined effort of so many people across Isro centres and the industry,” noted Sankaran.The successful completion of this mission would mark a significant milestone in India's space capabilities, particularly in developing technologies necessary for future space station operations and satellite servicing missions. The ability to dock spacecraft in orbit is a crucial capability possessed by only a few space-faring nations, and India is now on the cusp of joining this elite group.","Isro’s ambitious Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission is scheduled to do the docking manoeuvre on January 7.

Isro lining up half-a-dozen big launches in first half of 2025: Space minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-lining-up-half-a-dozen-big-launches-in-first-half-of-2025-space-minister/articleshow/116841136.cms,"NEW DELHI: 2025 is set to be a busy and important calendar year for Isro as space minister Jitendra Singh announced on Tuesday that half-a-dozen big missions have been lined up for launches in the first half of the new year that will include sending a female robot to space in a prelude to the Gaganyaan manned mission and launching the world’s most expensive Indo-US co-produced earth imaging satellite, NISAR.During a press meet to list India’s space achievements in 2024 and informing about upcoming launches, Singh said Isro will first launch an advanced navigation satellite NVS-02 in Jan. The GSLV launch will mark Isro’s 100th mission. Thereafter, Isro will send Vyommitra, a female humanoid built by Isro, to space as part of the unmanned Gaganyaan mission . This will prelude the manned mission and will be exactly similar to the final manned mission, except for humans. “Once everything goes right in Vyommitra mission, astronauts will be sent to space,” the minister said.He also said the Indo-US joint mission Nasa-ISRO SAR (NISAR) Satellite, which is considered to be the world’s most expensive satellite at Rs 12,505 crore, will be launched around March. “This satellite will scan nearly all land and ice every 12 days and will have very high resolution,” the minister said.Singh also said Isro was born in 1969 when the US was busy sending humans to the Moon. But now the situation has changed as Isro is launching US satellites as he refers to the upcoming commercial launch of a satellite for an American customer, which will be used for mobile communication. “We have the LVM3-M5 mission scheduled for the first quarter for an international customer. India is also launching a satellite for direct mobile communication for the US by Feb or March, showcasing our evolving abilities,” the minister said.Isro has generated over $400 million in revenue from commercial satellite launches conducted over the past decade for the US and the EU, the minister said. Singh said the revenue figure is likely to ramp up in the coming years. “So far, Isro has generated $172 million in revenue by launching satellites for the US, and €292 million ($304 million) for the EU. Out of this, $157 million from US launches and €260 million ($271 million) from EU launches have come in the past decade alone. This shows the kind of progress that India has made in the space economy, and its current stature as a leading spacefaring nation,” Singh said.Isro chairman S Somanath said, “2025 will be a very exciting year as Isro will launch four GSLV rockets and three PSLV launches as well as an SSLV launch in the new year”.In 2024, India had launched 15 missions, including some technology demonstration missions and commercial launches, Dr Rajeev Jaiswal, associate director (EO division) of Isro, said.“We started the year with XPoSat mission on Jan 1, then Aditya L1 solar mission involving sending the Indian spacecraft to the halo orbit of the Sun was launched on Jan 6; INSAT-3DS mission was launched on Feb 17; third and final development flight of on-demand small rocket SSLV carrying an EOS-08 satellite was launched on Aug 16; NSIL’s commercial launch of Gsat-N2 happened on Nov 19; PSLV C59 carrying Europe's PROBA-3 mission was launched on Dec 5; and finally the SpaDeX mission successfully lifted off from Sriharikota on Dec 30,” he said.","Isro will first launch an advanced navigation satellite NVS-02 in Jan.

Pocso invoked 8 yrs after FIR: Gujarat high court slams probe agency for 'casual approach',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pocso-invoked-8-yrs-after-fir-gujarat-high-court-slams-probe-agency-for-casual-approach/articleshow/116840843.cms,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court called ""prima facie strange and also shameful"" invocation of charges under Posco Act in a case of sexual offence against a minor eight years after FIR was lodged and trial was nearing completion.This case is from Mehsana town , north Gujarat, where a 15-year-old lodged a complaint against four people for outraging her modesty in Jan 2016.The accused were charged under IPC provisions, but the fact that the survivor was a minor was overlooked.The investigating agency filed a chargesheet under IPC and trial commenced before a judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) in Mehsana. The victim testified in 2018, explicitly stating that she was 15 years old at the time of the alleged offence. It was only in 2024, when all the evidence had been documented and final arguments were imminent, that the public prosecutor brought to the court's notice that Pocso sections 11 and 12 should have been invoked and the case should be transferred to a special sessions court. Subsequently, Pocso charges were applied and the case was transferred to a special sessions court.The fresh development resulted in the issuance of a warrant against the accused, who approached the HC through advocate Keval Maharaja for quashing of the FIR and the case as well as against the invocation of Pocso charges.Justice Sandeep Bhatt sought clarification from the prosecutors, investigators and the court regarding such an oversight.After their responses to the court's queries, the judge stated that ""no action had been taken by the learned assistant public prosecutor nor had cognisance of such fact been taken by the learned presiding officer conducting the trial. Even the defence has failed to point out the relevant aspects before the concerned court."" The high court criticised the investigating agency for its ""casual approach"" and for conducting the investigation in a ""mechanical manner"".The HC declined to quash the case but permitted the accused to pursue their issue before a Pocso court.","The Gujarat high court called ""prima facie strange and also shameful"" invocation of charges under Posco Act in a case of sexual offence against a minor.

We are also steadfast in our support for the Indian Ocean Rim Association, the region's premier organisation,"" said the statement .The joint statement is significant for India as it prepares to host the next Quad summit in 2025. While there have been concerns about the incoming Trump administration's commitment to alliances and partnerships, foreign minister S Jaishankar has expressed confidence Trump will continue to support Quad like he did during his first term as president. Amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the region, successive US presidents have backed Quad. While the grouping was revived under Trump with meetings at the level of foreign ministers, his successor Joe Biden upgraded Quad to the summit level.Twenty years ago, as the statement recalled, in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Australia, India, Japan and the US came together in service to the people of the region for the first time as the grouping now known as the Quad. The tsunami was one of the worst disasters in history, claiming the lives of nearly a quarter million people and displacing 1.7 million across 14 countries.","India, Australia, Japan and the US under the Quad mechanism share a vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.

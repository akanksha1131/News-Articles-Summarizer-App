Why are they protesting?



NEW DELHI: Employees of Karnataka’s state-run transport corporations began an indefinite strike on Tuesday morning, disrupting public bus services across the state and causing difficulties for passengers.Buses stopped running from 6.00 am after workers of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation ( KSRTC ), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC), and Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC) went on strike.The strike led to long queues and confusion at bus stations, as many people were left looking for other ways to travel.On Monday, the Karnataka high court had directed transport workers to hold off on their strike plan. But all four corporations decided to go ahead with the protest.The strike is being held over demands including the release of 38 months of unpaid salaries, implementation of wage revision from January 1, 2024, opposition to privatisation, end to worker harassment, and a demand that company drivers be assigned to electric buses as well.Talks between the government and transport unions had failed before the strike.The high court had issued an interim stay on the strike on Monday, saying that a complete halt of public transport would cause hardship to the public. However, the unions have decided to go ahead with their protest.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah had urged the workers to cancel the strike. However, union leaders said the government’s offer to clear only two years of arrears was not acceptable and that there was no clear assurance on salary revision.KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation president H V Anantha Subbarao said, as quoted by PTI, ""We are not satisfied. We want full 38 months' arrears.""","Buses stopped running from 6.00 am after workers of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and three other corporations went on strike.

'Toughest days of my life': Hemant Soren pens emotional note after father Shibu Soren's death; recalls why he was called 'Dishom Guru',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toughest-days-of-my-life-hemant-soren-pens-emotional-note-after-father-shibu-sorens-death-recalls-why-he-was-called-dishom-guru/articleshow/123107733.cms,"(Photo credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday penned a heartfelt tribute to his father and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) founder Shibu Soren, following his death at the age of 81, calling it the ""most toughest time of his life. ""Shibu Soren, popularly known as ‘Dishom Guru’, was a towering figure in Indian tribal politics and played a key role in the movement for Jharkhand’s statehood.He passed away on Monday at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi after a prolonged illness.Sharing a post on X, Soren described the immense personal and public loss, stating that beyond losing a father, Jharkhand has lost a crucial leader.""I am going through the toughest days of my life. Not only has the shadow of a father been taken from me, but a pillar of Jharkhand's soul has departed,"" Hemant Soren posted on X.""I didn't just call him 'Baba,' He was my guide, the root of my thoughts, and that forest-like shade that protected thousands and lakhs of Jharkhandis from the scorching sun and injustice,"" he continued.Recalling his father's humble beginnings, he said that his father was, ""born in that small house in Nemra village, where there was poverty, there was hunger, but there was courage.In his childhood, he lost his father. The exploitation of the landlords gave him a fire that made him a fighter for his entire life.""The Jharkhand CM further reflected on how his father led not through words alone but by living the struggles of the people.""I have seen him tilling the fields, sitting among the people, not just giving speeches, but living the sorrows of the people,"" he said.Explaining the origin of the title 'Dishom Guru', Hemant shared a childhood memory saying, ""In my childhood, when I asked him, 'Baba, why do people call you Dishom Guru?' He would smile and say: 'Because, son, I only understood their pain and made their fight my own.'""""That title was not written in any book, nor was it given by Parliament. It came from the hearts of Jharkhand's people,"" Soren added.He also explained the meaning behind the name: ""'Dishom' means society, 'Guru' means the one who shows the way.""He also praised his father's fearless commitment to justice, saying that he was not afraid of ""taking on the mightiest of the mighty.""""I was scared, but Baba was never afraid. He would say: 'If standing against injustice is a crime, then I will be guilty again and again.' No book can explain Baba's struggle. It was in his sweat, in his voice, and in the cracked heels covered by his sandals,"" Hemant said.He recalled his father's humility even after Jharkhand achieved statehood. ""When Jharkhand became a state, His dream came true, but he never considered power an achievement. He said: ""This state is not a throne for me, It is the identity of my people.""Hemant ended his note by acknowledging his father's fighting spirit, stating that his presence would continue in every aspect of Jharkhand's existence.""The dream you saw is now my promise. I will not let Jharkhand bow down; I will not let your name fade away. Your struggle will not remain incomplete. Baba, now you rest. You have fulfilled your duty. Now we must walk in your footsteps. Jharkhand will remain indebted to you. I, your son, will keep your promise,"" the CM noted.Shibu Soren leaves behind a legacy of struggle, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication to the cause of tribal empowerment in India. The emotional tribute came, as leaders across the political spectrum paid their respects to a the veteran leader.The final rites of the three-time Jharkhand chief minister will take place in Jharkhand on Tuesday.","Shibu Soren, popularly known as ‘Dishom Guru’, was a towering figure in Indian tribal politics.

HC: Past overstays cannot be reason to deny furlough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-past-overstays-cannot-be-reason-to-deny-furlough/articleshow/123106118.cms,".

Nagpur: In a ruling underscoring the rehabilitative purpose of furlough, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court quashed prison department's refusal to grant leave to a life convict, stating that past overstays on furlough (leave of absence for a specified period to a convict from prison) cannot permanently disqualify a prisoner from exercising the right to temporary release.A division bench comprising Justices Anil Pansare and Mahendra Nerlikar was hearing a plea filed by Shankar Landge, a 38-year-old serving life imprisonment at Nagpur Central Jail, following his conviction by a Wardha court on murder charges in 2010.""The very object of the furlough is reformation and social integration and, therefore, if it is denied for years together, it would frustrate the purpose of incorporation of provisions in the rules,"" the bench stated in its order last week.The judges said the jail superintendent also lost sight of the fact that since 2014, the petitioner had not been granted furlough. ""Merely because he overstayed on earlier occasions, that by itself does not disqualify the petitioner from the grant of furlough leave,"" the HC ruled.The petitioner's furlough request was rejected on March 22 by DIG (Prisons), Nagpur, citing multiple instances of overstay between 2010 and 2014.Landge challenged the decision in high court. Opposing his plea, public prosecutor S Thakur informed the bench that the convict had overstayed his release by 18 days in 2010, 88 days in 2011, 265 days in 2013 and 56 days in 2014.The court, however, noted that Landge had not been granted furlough since Nov 18, 2014. His counsel argued that the past overstays - now over a decade old - should not weigh against him indefinitely. The petitioner also gave an undertaking that he would diligently perform his allotted prison duties, addressing another concern flagged by the prison authorities.Allowing the petition, the court directed Landge to be released on furlough for the period he had applied for, on terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the prison authorities."," Bombay high court quashes prison department's refusal to grant leave to a life convict.

"In motor accidents, claims not restricted to third party, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-motor-accidents-claims-not-restricted-to-third-party-says-sc/articleshow/123105796.cms,"New Delhi: Motor vehicle insurance protects a policyholder against claims made by a third party for damages due to the policyholder's actions, but what about the claim against injury/death of the policyholder themselves in a road accident? Holding that family members of such a policyholder can also claim compensation, Supreme Court has referred the issue to a larger bench since there are contradictory verdicts of the apex court on the matter.While hearing the compensation plea of a minor girl who lost both her parents in a car accident in which her father was on the driving seat, a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandran said section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act could be invoked for such a claim, as it is a special provision which overrides not only all the provisions of the Act but also any other law in force for the time being.In this case, the minor was awarded compensation by the insurance company for the death of her mother but not for her father as he was himself the insured party.The bench said: ""... a claim under section 163A, as per the words employed in the provision, according to us covers every claim and is not restricted to a third party claim; without any requirement of establishing the negligence, if death or permanent disability is caused by reason of the motor accident. This would also take in the liability with respect to the death of an owner or a driver who stepped into the shoes of the owner, if the claim is made under section 163A dehors the statutory liability under section 147 or the contractual liability as reduced to writing in an insurance policy"".The insurance company, however, took the stand that the petitioner, having succeeded to the estate of the owner of the vehicle who died in the accident cannot at the same time be the person who has the liability and is the recipient of the compensation.""It would override the provisions under sections 147 & 149 along with the other provisions of the Act and the law regulating insurance as also the terms of the policy confining the claim with respect to an owner-driver to a fixed sum. This according to us is the intention of incorporating the non-obstante clause under Section 163A providing for no-fault liability claims, the compensation for which is restricted to the structured formula under the IInd Schedule. It is a beneficial piece of legislation brought in, keeping in mind the enhanced chances of an accident, resulting from the prevalence of vehicles in the overcrowded roads of today. It was a social security scheme, brought about considering the need for a more comprehensive scheme of 'no-fault' liability for reasons of the ever-increasing instances of motor vehicle accidents and the difficulty in proving rash and negligent driving,"" the bench said.",The Supreme Court has referred the issue to a larger bench since there are contradictory verdicts of the apex court on the matter. A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandran said section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act could be invoked for such a claim.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123105808,imgsize-10596,width-400,resizemode-4/123105808.jpg"
SC proposes panel to manage Banke Bihari temple till HC decides on UP ordinance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-proposes-panel-to-manage-banke-bihari-temple-till-hc-decides-on-up-ordinance/articleshow/123105718.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Monday proposed an interim committee, headed by a retired high court judge and comprising the district collector and Goswamis (pujaris), for management of Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan till Allahabad HC decides the validity of UP govt's ordinance for all-round development of the temple area to provide facilities to pilgrims.A bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked additional solicitor general K M Nataraj to seek state govt's response by Tuesday morning, when it will take up a batch of petitions that have questioned the manner in which state govt, prompted by an SC order, had come out with a temple development project proposed to be implemented at a cost of Rs 500 crore.The Goswamis, through senior advocate Shyam Divan, said taking over of the temple through an ordinance was extraordinary as the issue was not before constitutional courts, which were only dealing with alleged mismanagement of Guriraj temple. In the guise of better management of temples in the 'Braj area', the SC passed an order without even hearing temple Goswamis, which prompted the state to issue the ordinance, they said.The bench agreed that such an order without hearing the Goswamis could not have been passed. However, the Justice Kant-led bench said, ""It is only for development of the temple and its surroundings. The state's intention does not appear to siphon out temple funds but to spend it on providing facilities to pilgrims.""Divan said Banke Bihari temple was a private temple and any law brought about by govt or any order passed by courts could not have been without hearing the Goswamis, who have been managing it for centuries.The bench saw a point in Divan's argument and said, ""The state cannot be seen coming to the court in a clandestine manner and getting an order set aside in a case which had nothing to do with Banke Bihari temple. We will set aside that part of the order, set up an interim committee to manage the temple and permit the HC to decide the legality of the ordinance.""However, the bench was in favour of development around the temple to provide space for parking and places to stay for pilgrims with all facilities. ""Religious tourism is assuming great importance. It can also be a big revenue earner and help in job creation. But there has to be adequate facilities to handle pilgrims,"" it said.The interim committee may also have to induct representatives of Archaeological Survey of India as well as independent architects proficient in ancient building restoration to protect the temple, the bench said.",Supreme Court proposes an interim committee for management of Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan.

Shifting of the home ministry and personnel department from North Block at Raisina Hills to the new address gains huge significance since these have operated from the iconic structure for nearly 90 years.In the next couple of months, the finance ministry will shift from North Block to another Kartavya Bhawan, and at a later stage, offices of the defence ministry and PMO will also move out from South Block to pave way for Yuge Yugeen Bharat museum.Govt has proposed building 10 new Kartavya Bhawans along Kartavya Path as part of the Central Vista revamp programme. Two of these buildings are expected to be completed by next month, which will pave way for shifting of more ministries and departments to these new office complexes.In a statement, PMO said Kartavya Bhawan was a state-of-the-art office complex spanning an area of around 1.5 lakh sq metres across two basements and seven storeys, including the ground floor.The building is designed to use 30% less energy. Solar panels on the roof of Kartavya Bhavan-3 will generate over 5.3 lakh units of electricity every year, and charging stations for electric vehicles are also provided, it said.The new facility will reduce repair and maintenance costs, boost productivity, improve employee well-being and enhance overall service delivery, govt said. It added the building would exemplify modern governance infrastructure featuring IT-ready and secure workspac-es, ID card-based access, integrated surveillance and a centralised command system.

Poll Do you agree with R Ashwin's criticism of Shubman Gill's captaincy? Yes, he lacks experience. No, he will improve over time. Partially, he needs to adapt. Not sure.

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Bad light and subsequent rain forced stumps to be called early on Day 4 of the fifth Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy Test at The Oval on Sunday. With the stage set for a thrilling Day 5, England need just 35 more runs to win, while India require four wickets for a miraculous victory.""Coming back to the topic of spinners not being used, I have felt in this series that there has been a lack of game awareness and, in many ways, our tactical acumen — both on and off the field. This is the main reason why England are ahead in this series and India are behind. We haven't been the sharpest,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.“I feel Shubman Gill will get much better as a captain. He will learn. But sometimes, if you feel that you can play spin really well, you might not bring spinners into the attack. And when you miss the right moment to introduce spinners in these conditions, they become a defensive option,” he added.Rain forcing the match into the fifth day means every Test of the riveting five-match series has now gone into the final day. England looked all set to complete the chase of 374 on Day 4, thanks to Joe Root hitting his 39th Test century — 105 off 152 balls — paying a fitting tribute to Graham Thorpe.His fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook struck a stunning 111 off 98 balls — his tenth century in the longer format — and made the most of a crucial reprieve on 19, dropped by Mohammed Siraj. Root and Brook shared a brilliant counter-attacking stand of 195 runs, giving England real hope of completing their second-highest run chase of all time — and the highest ever at The Oval.“When Harry Brook started taking it on, after 20 runs, you could have brought on the spinner to choke the run flow. From the other end, a pacer could have bowled. With all this in mind, Washington Sundar could have been introduced earlier into the attack,” Ashwin said.“Making these mistakes creates a huge gap. We don’t know whether the message is going from outside to the middle. We don’t know what’s being discussed in the dressing room. But in today’s day and age, these mistakes can definitely be avoided,” he added.","Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Bad light and subsequent rain forced stumps to be called early on Day 4 of the fifth Test at The Oval. England need just 35 more runs to win, while India require four wickets for a miraculous victory.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123085607,imgsize-151790,width-400,resizemode-4/123085607.jpg"

• August 15 (Friday) – Independence Day

• August 16 (Saturday) – Janmashtami

• August 26 – 28 (Tuesday – Thursday) – Onam

• August 27 (Wednesday) – Ganesh Chaturthi

Will there be a long weekend?

Note:

August is often a busy month for students across India, filled with academic schedules, Independence Day activities, and mid-term assessments. But it also offers a series of public holidays and regional observances that can bring a much-needed pause.August stands out because it includes national celebrations like Independence Day, along with various state-specific observances and religious festivals. While some holidays are limited to specific regions or communities, others bring long weekends that are useful for both rest and preparation. Whether you're planning a study break, or simply catching up on assignments, here’s a list of school holidays in August 2025 to help you plan better.Here are the major holidays that apply across most schools in India:Raksha Bandhan is widely celebrated in northern and central India to honour the bond between siblings. Schools in many states, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, usually declare a holiday on this day.Observed mainly in West Bengal, Odisha, and parts of eastern India, Jhulan Purnima celebrates the divine swing festival of Radha and Krishna.Some regional schools may remain closed during this period.Independence Day is a national holiday across all Indian states. Most schools observe the occasion with flag hoisting and cultural programs, followed by a day off.Janmashtami, marking the birth of Lord Krishna, is a public holiday in many states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Depending on regional tradition, schools may declare a holiday either on August 16 or the preceding/following day.Onam is Kerala’s biggest harvest festival, celebrated with cultural events, pookalam (flower rangoli), and traditional feasts. Schools across Kerala typically remain closed for multiple days, especially around Thiruvonam, the festival’s main day.Ganesh Chaturthi is an official holiday in states like Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Telangana. Schools in these regions remain closed to allow students to participate in rituals, home celebrations, and public processions.In addition to national holidays, several region-specific observances may apply based on your state’s academic calendar or school board guidelines.Yes, students may get a long weekend from August 15 to 17 if schools remain closed on Saturday, August 16. Additionally, if your school observes Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami holidays in succession, you could see shorter study weeks during mid to late August.While holidays are ideal for rest, many students also use this time to revise, complete pending assignments, or prepare for upcoming exams. If you're in senior secondary classes, this could also be a good time to begin short-term courses, practice mock tests, or explore college options if you’re in Class 12.Younger students can use the break for hobby classes, reading, or short family trips, depending on how your school has scheduled internal assessments.Check with your school’s official holiday calendar or circular, as some private and state board schools may differ in observance dates based on local declarations or weekend policies.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday reiterated the need for a fair and multipolar global order, stating, “Our collective desire is to see a fair and representative global order, not one dominated by a few. ”His remarks come amid global trade tensions, including US tariff threats and pressure on India’s oil trade with Russia.Speaking at the BIMSTEC Traditional Music Festival in Delhi titled SaptaSur: Seven Nations, One Melody, Jaishankar linked cultural traditions to the broader vision of global balance. “We live in complicated and uncertain times. Our collective desire is to see a fair and representative global order, not one dominated by a few. That quest is often articulated as political or economic rebalancing,” he said.Jaishankar noted that cultural traditions play a role in strengthening identity and guiding national direction. “Traditions are of particular value because ultimately they define identity. We must be assured about what we are if we want to be confident about shaping the future. For nations like us, traditions are truly a great source of strength,” he added.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s earlier commitments, Jaishankar said, “I also want to underline what Director General of ICCR has said, that this was a commitment which was made by Prime Minister Modi at the BIMSTEC Summit and I am so glad that like so many of his commitments, that has been kept and kept early.”He also reflected on his personal journey and how cultural exposure shaped his outlook. “In my own case, it was actually through music and to some extent books that I developed an interest in the world. There is so much that music is able to convey that it is understandably regarded as the soul of a society,” he said.“Music serves both as a bridge between nations and a powerful expression of their heritage and identity,” he concluded.Jaishankar’s remarks come as India faces economic and diplomatic challenges, including concerns over possible US tariffs and warnings related to India’s ongoing oil trade with Russia.While the minister did not refer directly to these developments, his emphasis on sovereignty, tradition, and multipolarity echoed India’s current diplomatic positioning."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke at the BIMSTEC Traditional Music Festival in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying ""Why is Modi afraid"" following US President Donald Trump’s remarks threatening increased tariffs on India over its continued oil trade with Russia.The party questioned PM Modi’s silence, alleging that foreign policy under the BJP government had become more about optics than national interest.Also read: 'They don't care': Trump says he will 'substantially' raise US tariff on India for buying Russian oil Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh in a post on X said, “So much for Howdy Modi. So much for Namaste Trump. So much for Ab ki Baar Trump Sarkar. So much for BJP MPs hailing Narendra Modi as India's trumpcard.”Jairam Ramesh added, “Despite all the hugs, all the handshakes, all the high-decibel bromance — ‘My friend Dolaand’ has delivered yet another jolt.” He questioned what came of the “much-vaunted” front-row seat at Trump’s inauguration or the prime minister being one of the first world leaders to visit the White House. “Tariffs are being slapped. Negotiations are going nowhere,” he said, also referring to Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir’s recent White House visit.“This is what happens when foreign policy becomes about image-building, not national interest,” Ramesh wrote.Also read: Trump tariff threat: No order for refiners from India to stop Russian oil imports despite US pressure, claims report Meanwhile, in a separate post on X, the Congress party directly questioned the Prime Minister, saying, “Now Narendra Modi's friend Trump has openly threatened India. Trump has said that he will impose even more tariffs on India.”“Trump claims India is buying large quantities of oil from Russia and making huge profits by selling it. India doesn’t care about those being killed in Ukraine. Trump is speaking out against India every day, and Narendra Modi is quietly listening to it all. Why is Modi so afraid of Trump?” the post read.The political row comes after Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, said India was profiting from the war in Ukraine and warned of a substantial tariff hike. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,” Trump wrote.The statement follows earlier warnings from Trump about a 25 per cent tariff on India for its energy and defence transactions with Russia.White House deputy chief of Staff Stephen Miller echoed the sentiment in a Fox News interview, accusing India of being “basically tied with China” in oil imports from Russia. “People would be shocked... This is astonishing,” Miller said, alleging India also imposed high tariffs on US goods and had violated immigration norms.Also read: 'Not acceptable': Trump's aide accuses India of financing Russia's war; claims New Delhi tied with China in purchasing crude oil Last week, Trump criticised India’s trade policies, calling its barriers “the most strenuous and obnoxious” globally. He also remarked that India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”While Trump later claimed India may have halted Russian oil imports, he added, “That’s what I heard... but I don’t know if that’s right or not.”India has not confirmed any change in its oil trade with Russia. On Friday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said energy decisions were based on market pricing and global conditions. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament that India will act to protect its national interest.","The party questioned PM Modi’s silence, alleging that foreign policy under the BJP government had become more about optics than national interest.

'Nazi' BJP Targeting 'Bengalis': TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Explosive Interview On Gurugram Crackdown

NEW DELHI: Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee has resigned from his position as the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha, news agency PTI reported on Monday, citing party sources. His resignation comes against the backdrop of an ongoing public feud with fellow party MP Mahua Moitra.Just minutes before the news of his resignation emerged, Banerjee, who represents Serampore in the Lok Sabha, took to social media platform X to criticise Moitra over her alleged remarks made during a recent public podcast. He accused her of using ""dehumanising language"" and compared her comments to “outright abuse.”“I have taken note of the recent personal remarks made by Ms Mahua Moitra in a public podcast... comparing a fellow MP to a 'pig' reflects a deep disregard for basic norms of civil discourse,” Banerjee posted.He defended his earlier statements, saying they focused on questions of public accountability and conduct, and were not misogynistic. He added, “Labeling a male colleague as ‘sexually frustrated’ isn’t boldness, it’s outright abuse.”Banerjee further claimed that Moitra was using personal attacks to deflect from questions regarding her performance as an MP. He said, “Those who rely on abuse instead of answers are not champions of democracy, they are its embarrassment.”The fallout between the two senior TMC leaders reportedly began in April, when Moitra confronted Banerjee inside the Parliament building after her name was left out from a party delegation memorandum. That incident reportedly led to a tense exchange in front of other MPs and party members.Following that, Banerjee accused Moitra of asking security personnel to arrest him and described her as ""rude"" and ""uncivilised."" He had earlier also raised personal questions about Moitra’s marital life while responding to her criticisms.TMC has not officially commented on Banerjee's resignation or the ongoing dispute.",Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee has resigned from his position as the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha.

‘What was the tearing hurry?’: SC questions UP govt on Banke Bihari ordinance; may put corridor nod on hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-was-the-tearing-hurry-sc-questions-up-govt-on-banke-bihari-ordinance-may-put-corridor-nod-on-hold/articleshow/123095831.cms,"Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision to question the Uttar Pradesh government's management of the Shri Banke Bihari temple? Yes, I support the Supreme Court's intervention. No, the government should manage it.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Uttar Pradesh government's move to take over the management of the Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan, stating that key stakeholders had not been heard before the May 15 order allowing the corridor project was passed.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi questioned the state’s decision-making, particularly the urgency with which it enacted the Uttar Pradesh Shri Bankey Bihari Ji Temple Trust Ordinance, 2025. “What stopped you from acquiring the entire land and properties from your corpus in public interest? What was the tearing hurry in enacting the ordinance, when the matter was sub-judice? Providing basic amenities and developing the area is the duty of the state. There are numerous instances where the state’s participation has helped in developing the religious places like in Golden Temple in Amritsar,” the bench observed.The court said it would pass orders on August 5 to put the May 15 direction in abeyance and appoint a retired high court or district judge to oversee daily management of the temple. The proposed committee would also include other stakeholders and focus on managing the temple and surrounding areas.The bench expressed concern about the state approaching the court without informing key parties. “Less said the better. How do you justify the directions passed by the court? The state in the most unfortunate way came to the court in the most clandestine manner without informing the court receiver or stakeholders... Get the directions behind their back and set aside the order of the high court. This is the least thing we expect from the state,” the bench said.At present, the court is not examining the constitutionality of the ordinance. That issue will be taken up by the Allahabad High Court. The top court will instead look into interim arrangements for managing the temple and adjacent developments.“This is the land of Lord Krishna. He was the first mediator known to the world. Let’s find a way out to resolve the dispute pending for years and develop the area in the interest of lakhs of devotees who visit these iconic religious places. Basic amenities need to be created as nowadays religious tourism is one of the biggest sources of revenue,” the bench added.During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General K M Nataraj, representing the state, said a member of the Goswami community had approached the court but was not supported by others. The bench questioned why all warring factions were not heard and asked whether the court receiver in charge of temple management had been consulted.The court also questioned the state’s use of temple funds for acquiring five acres of land for a holding area. It asked why public funds were not used instead and again raised concern about the urgency of the ordinance when the matter was already under judicial consideration.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the temple’s managing committee, said the order had been passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard. He said since it was a private temple, notice to them was necessary.The court responded by stating that the term “private temple” was not applicable in this context, given the scale of public involvement and the number of devotees who visit annually.The top court asked Nataraj to seek instructions from the state and adjourned the matter to August 5. It clarified that the High Court would examine the legality of the ordinance and that the Supreme Court would adjust its May 15 directions accordingly.Petitioners, including members of the managing committee, have been asked to submit suggestions on how the temple affairs should be managed during the interim period.The plea, filed through advocate Tanvi Dubey on behalf of the temple's management committee, challenges the ordinance which hands over control of the temple to a state-administered trust.On May 15, the Supreme Court had allowed the Uttar Pradesh government’s impleadment application and permitted the development of a temple corridor at Vrindavan, using temple funds. That order may now be placed on hold pending further directions.(With inputs form agencies)",The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Uttar Pradesh government's move to take over the management of the Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi questioned the state’s decision- making. The court said it would pass orders on August 5 to put the May 15 direction in abeyance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123095853,imgsize-117162,width-400,resizemode-4/123095853.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Private car owners in Telangana won’t be able to avail the Annual Toll Pass scheme for National Highways (NHs) and expressways to be launched by the Centre on Aug 15, as vehicles registered in the state have not yet been migrated to the Vahan database (central registry of vehicles). The annual pass, to be issued from next week, requires real-time validation of vehicle class through the Vahan portal.Union transport secretary V Umashankar, in a letter addressed to Telangana chief secretary last week, sought the “personal intervention” of the top state official to expedite the migration of the state’s vehicle data to Vahan portal and ensure “equitable access to the nationwide facility for road users”.In his letter, Umashankar highlighted how the Centre had reached out to the state govt in May this year for merger of state registers for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) of vehicles with the national registers —Sarathi and Vahan -- but the same has not happened yet.Except Telangana, all other states have come on board, officials said. They expect the state to act quickly, as the issue is crucial for dealing with DL and RC related matters at the national level.Umashankar has said that only vehicles registered as “non-commercial car/ jeep/ van” are eligible to get the FASTag-based pass by paying Rs 3,000, granting them 200 toll-free crossings on NHs in a year.Sources said the National Highways Authority of India is giving finishing touches to the scheme and putting all infrastructure in place for starting the registration process. A special team has been trained to handle queries relating to the scheme at their call centre.","The annual pass, to be issued from next week, requires real-time validation of vehicle class through the Vahan portal.

"Govt says National Medical Commission rules allow complaints against docs, but commission rejects them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-says-national-medical-commission-rules-allow-complaints-against-docs-but-commission-rejects-them/articleshow/123076303.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to a Parliament question on whether the National Medical Commission (NMC) was biased towards doctors, the health ministry has stated that the ethics regulation of 2002 provided for complaints against doctors. However, NMC’s ethics section has been rejecting all patient appeals claiming that the NMC Act prevails over the 2002 ethics regulation.The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions. Referring to this, the ethics section has been dismissing all appeals filed by patients claiming that only doctors can file an appeal, even though it is against the law.The NMC Act itself clearly states that “the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder”.Since the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 has not been replaced, it still stands. Clause 8.8 of the 2002 ethics regulation states: “Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council”.Yet, over 162 appeals of patients have been rejected by the NMC.In the reply to Parliament, minister of state for health Anupriya Patel stated that “to ensure that the NMC functions in a transparent and fair manner”, the central government appoints the chairperson and presidents of four autonomous boards as per the NMC Act 2019. However, there is no transparency as even the minutes of the meetings of the NMC and its autonomous boards are not available in the public domain as used to be the case with the erstwhile Medical Council of India. Moreover, all autonomous boards including the posts of presidents are currently almost entirely vacant with the government having failed to make appointments for over 10 months.The few minutes of commission’s meetings accessed using RTI show that most non-doctor ex-officio members hardly ever attend meetings and hence most decisions are taken by commission members, almost most of whom are doctors. Of the 33-member commission, about 20 are doctors.“I have complained to the health ministry and the law ministry by registered post about NMC rejecting patient appeals and hence I have proof. So, the health ministry cannot claim to have not received any complaints,” said Gokul Aneja, husband of a victim of alleged medical negligence, who appealed against the decision of the Punjab state medical council, only to have his appeal rejected twice.","The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions.

"To drive sale of EVs, government to clarify they are exempt from 15-year 'end of life' norm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-drive-sale-of-evs-government-to-clarify-they-are-exempt-from-15-year-end-of-life-norm/articleshow/123082925.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs.The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far.Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales.Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place.Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks.Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates.At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.","Government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' regulation isn't applicable to EVs.

NEW DELHI: Disappointing former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and his son, Supreme Court on Monday asked them to move high court to challenge Enforcement Directorate 's allegedly illegal practice of filing incomplete chargesheets in money laundering cases to keep the probe open-ended, and keep them apprehensive about their possible arrest at any time.Baghel said since 2019, there had been six ECIRs filed by ED under PMLA relating to Nagrik Apurti Nigam (PDS), income tax, District Mineral Fund, coal levy, Mahadev betting and Chhattisgarh liquor cases. In all these cases, there was a constant threat of his arrest, he said.Appearing for him and his son, senior advocates A M Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi told a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that filing of multiple incomplete chargesheets, on the specious ground that the probe was ongoing, was illegal since it was mandatory for ED to take permission of the magistrate to carry out further investigation.The bench said, ""This abnormality of rushing directly to Supreme Court is becoming chronic, especially when cases involve affluent and influential people. If you are seeking quashing of the FIRs or chargesheets on grounds of irregularity on part of the agency, then you must move the HC."" Singhvi and Rohatgi withdrew their petitions.In another petition by Baghel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told the bench that the former CM was challenging the constitutional validity of PMLA sections 50 and 63. ""The framework u/s 50(2) and 50(3) of PMLA infringes upon the fundamental rights against self incrimination guaranteed under Article 20(3)... The aforesaid provisions permit ED to summon any person and compel answers and production of documents under a threat of penalty u/s 63 of the Act and arrest under Section 19 of the Act,"" Sibal said.Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general S V Raju said these petitions were not maintainable as the former CM had not been named in any of the ECIRs.","Baghel said since 2019, there had been six ECIRs filed by ED under PMLA relating to Nagrik Apurti Nigam (PDS), income tax, District Mineral Fund, coal levy and Mahadev betting.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing logjam in Parliament, PM Narendra Modi will address the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday, a get-together of the alliance's MPs that is being held after a considerable gap, and the first during the current session of Parliament.The NDA meeting also holds significance as filing of nomination papers for the election to the vice-president of India's post begins from Aug 7. The BJP-led bloc will have to announce its candidate - whose election to the post will be a certainty due to the alliance's majority in the electoral college - by Aug 21, the last date of nomination-filing and the monsoon session of Parliament.The electoral college for the vice-president poll includes MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and its current strength is 782. If the opposition also names a candidate - a distinct possibility - then the poll is scheduled to be held on Sept 9.The meeting comes in the middle of a session which has been a washout so far, except for a two-day discussion on the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor, due to a united opposition's continuous protest against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar by Election Commission.PM Modi is expected to speak on a host of issues as the opposition has been raising the heat over the poll body's alleged partisan conduct favouring govt, and the terror attack and Operation Sindoor.Sources said Modi may ask alliance MPs to counter the opposition's narrative and also boost the 'Tiranga Yatra' being organised in view of Independence Day.The parliamentary party is also likely to felicitate the PM for the success of Operation Sindoor and neutralisation of the terrorists involved in the attack.Since the 2024 LS elections, when BJP lost its majority but comfortably crossed the halfway mark with allies, the meeting of the party's MPs every session was expanded to include its allies.

The candidates complained that the boards seem to be unaware or poorly trained in the new interim guidelines on ""functional assessment"" of persons with disabilities issued on July 19. With no appellate body being constituted by the National Medical Commission (NMC) or the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), as directed by the Supreme Court, the candidates are left with no forum for redress other than courts.According to the National Testing Agency, 753 of the 8,842 candidates with disabilities who sat for the NEET exam have cleared it. The interim guidelines state that legal and policy developments collectively emphasise the prioritisation of ""functional competency over rigid percentage-based disability thresholds"". They talk about facilitating reasonable accommodations, revisiting eligibility norms and adopting evaluation criteria focused on individual capabilities.Yet, according to a wheelchair-using candidate who was rejected, the board asked the person to perform seven physical activities including walking, standing and climbing stairs. Another candidate with missing fingers was rejected by a board in Tamil Nadu but went to Kerala for counselling for the All-India quota and was selected.The NMC has failed to identify at least one assessment centre in each state though the apex court order in Oct last year stated that ""the availability of medical boards should be increased so that there is minimum one medical board in each state and union territory for proper medical examination of students who have passed the examination"". With just 16 centres in 11 states, candidates are forced to spend considerable amounts on travelling, food and lodging.""There appears to be very poor sensitisation in the boards on how to deal with candidates with disabilities. A board in Chennai referred to the candidate as ""patient"" while rejecting her saying that she is ""wheelchair bound"". How will they select when they see her as a patient?"" said Dr Satendra Singh, founder of Doctors With Disabilities: Agents of Change, India's largest network of health professionals with disabilities.This is despite the Supreme Court order stating: ""To enable members of the Disability Assessment Boards to effectively apply the functional competency test, they must be adequately trained by professionals and persons with disabilities or those who have worked on disability justice"". It further mandated that each disability assessment board include at least one doctor with a disability.Although counselling commenced on 21 July 2025, no training schedule for members of the disability assessment boards has been published and no directive has been issued mandating the inclusion of a doctor with a disability on the boards.""The NMC had agreed in court to change the name of the boards from Disability Assessment Boards to Ability Assessment Boards to reflect the change in the focus of the assessments, but that term is nowhere there in the interim guidelines. Candidates with disabilities are paying the price and not everyone can afford to go to court,"" said Dr Singh, who has written to the NMC and the DGHS.He added that the interim guidelines were inadequate, though NMC's expert committee had taken nine months to frame them in time for the 2025-26 academic year.","Candidates with disabilities who cleared the NEET exam in 2025 have been rejected by many of the 16 medical boards across India.

Were you there on the border?

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, got a rap on his knuckles on Monday from the Supreme Court for his 2022 statement - Chinese are ""thrashing our soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh"" - while criticising the government for its handling of the Galwan Valley clash at the LAC. ""If you were a true Indian, you would not say all this,"" the apex court told him.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih lambasted Rahul for making allegations that China captured 2,000 sq km of Indian territory and asked him whether he was present there. It made it clear to him that as leader of opposition he cannot go on saying whatever he wants.Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Gandhi, defended him saying, ""if he cannot say these things which are published in the Press, he cannot be a leader of opposition"". However, he agreed that the statement could have been worded better.SC's censure came during the hearing on Rahul's plea for staying a defamation case filed against him over his claim about Indian jawans having been walloped by the Chinese during the Galwan standoff. After the hearing, the court stayed the defamation proceedings against him but not before giving him an earful.""Tell, Dr Singhvi, how do you get to know that 2,000 sq km of Indian territory was occupied by the Chinese? Were you there? Do you have any credible material? Why do you make these statements without any...Ifyou were a true Indian, you would not say all this if there is a conflict at the border,"" the bench said.The senior advocate responded by saying that it was also possible that a true Indian would say that 20 Indian soldiers were beaten up and killed as it was a matter of concern for the country.Singhvi argued that while some people may not agree with the statement, it was not prohibited under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which pertains to the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. He underscored that public interest was involved in the issue and it would be unfortunate if a leader of opposition could not raise and highlight such an issue.“Whatever you have to say, why don’t you say it in Parliament? Why do you have to say this in social media posts?” the bench asked.Challenging the defamation case proceedings, Singhvi said it was done to harass Rahul, and he also pointed out that the trial court did not follow section 223 of BNSS which said prior hearing of the accused was mandatory before taking cognisance of a criminal complaint. The court, thereafter, issued notice on Rahul’s plea and stayed the proceeding in the case, despite senior advocate Gaurav Bhatia, appearing for the complainant, opposing the stay order. The bench asked him to file a response.Rahul moved SC after the Allahabad high court on May 29 rejected his plea for quashing of summoning order passed in Feb by a court in Lucknow. The HC observed that freedom of speech and expression did not include the freedom to make statements which defame the Indian Army. The complaint was filed by former Border Roads Organisation (BRO) director Uday Shankar Srivastava against Rahul for making the allegedly derogatory remarks in Dec 2022 during his Bharat Jodo Yatra.“People will ask about Bharat Jodo Yatra, here and there, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot and what-not. But they will not ask a single question about China capturing 2,000 sqkm of Indian territory, killing 20 Indian soldiers and thrashing our soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh. But the Indian Press doesn’t ask a question to them about this. Isn’t it true? The nation is watching all this. Don’t pretend that people don’t know,” Rahul had said at a press conference during the yatra.","Supreme Court tells Rahul Gandhi that as leader of opposition he cannot go on saying whatever he wants.

'Unreasonable': India hits back at Trump tirade on Russian oil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unreasonable-india-hits-back-at-trump-tirade-on-russian-oil/articleshow/123104332.cms,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar (ANI file photo)

MEA: Nations slamming India themselves trading with Russia

In its first direct public pushback against US President Donald Trump's repeated targeting of India over trade with Russia, the Centre termed his criticism ""unjustified and unreasonable"". It said like any major economy, New Delhi will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.In an official statement, ministry of external affairs said the US itself continues to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry and fertilisers as well as chemicals from Russia.The response, a rare outpouring of frustration with Trump's rants, followed another outburst by the US president in which he accused India of buying massive amounts of Russian Oil and selling it in the open market for big profits, while threatening to substantially raise tariffs on imports from India.MEA added that India's imports are meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to Indian consumers and are a necessity compelled by global market situation. ""...It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are...indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion,"" said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia.Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.The official also recalled that the US had in 2022 encouraged Indian imports from Russia as it helped stabilise the global energy market.Trump’s blunt and open threat, which came on top of the 25% tariffs and unquantified penalty he has already announced last week, did not specify if there would be more or higher tariffs than he has already rolled out. But what seems certain is that he is angered by India’s obduracy in not concluding a trade deal on his terms and its insistence on continuing to buy discounted Russian oil.In a message he posted on his “Truth Social” platform, Trump also accused India of not caring “how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine”. Trump surrogates have alleged that India and China are virtually bankrolling the war because they are among the world’s top two oil importers, and revenue from hydrocarbons is what is funding the Russian military.The charge that New Delhi is re-selling Russian oil for profit appears to be a distortion, twisting India’s large refining capacity that makes Russian oil suitable for export, including to Europe.Trump is also irked by India’s repudiation of his repeated claim that he used the bait of trade to stop the India-Pakistan war, a claim he has made nearly 30 times in several fora. Unable to end the Russia-Ukraine war on “Day One” of his presidency as he had pledged, Trump is talking up his claimed role in the India-Pakistan cessation of hostilities in a transparent bid for a Nobel Prize, including gratuitously canvassing for it with anyone who listens.The extraordinary threat by the US president, who has weaponised tariffs for a range of objectives from gouging trade deals from poor and vulnerable nations to trying to bring about regime change (like in Brazil) to dismantling groups like Brics, which he sees as a threat to the US and the primacy of its currency, is unprecedented in history.Combined with Trump’s sudden love for Pakistan, ostensibly for its glib backing for a Nobel Prize for him, it evokes among some commentators memories of Washington’s infamous 1970’s “tilt” during the Nixon administration, when the US tried to bully New Delhi during the Bangladesh Liberation War by sending the US Seventh Fleet to the Bay of Bengal with the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise.While a much weaker India refused to be browbeaten by the Nixon-Kissinger threat at that time, New Delhi appears to be in as defiant a mood in the face of Trump’s belligerence, potentially risking what some experts have said could be a 2% blow to its GDP growth (currently clocking around 6.5%), but which some govt surrogates say could be as low as 0.2%.“India has been targeted by the US and the European Union for importing oil from Russia after the commencement of the Ukraine conflict. In fact, India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict. The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Such reactions by India were limited earlier to calls by the Europeans to shun trade with Russia. The ministry also said that the EU in 2024 had a bilateral trade of Euro 67.5 billion in goods with Russia. In addition, it had trade in services estimated at Euro 17.2 billion in 2023. This, added the official, is significantly more than India’s total trade with Russia that year or subsequently.“European imports of LNG in 2024, in fact, reached a record 16.5m tonnes, surpassing the last record of 15.2m tonnes in 2022,” Jaiswal said, adding that Europe-Russia trade includes not just energy, but also fertilizers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.","Nations slamming India themselves trading with Russia, says MEA.

Kerala police on Monday recovered more human remains from a 2.5-acre property in Pallippuram, Cherthala, as part of an ongoing investigation into the disappearance of several middle-aged women over the past two decades.Police sources told PTI that 20 charred bones were recovered from a new spot on the premises, separate from where body parts were first found last week.The discovery is part of an ongoing investigation led by the Kottayam unit of the State Crime Branch.Cadaver dogs and forensic experts were brought in as officers carried out a detailed search across the compound, including ponds and marshland. Some clothing items were also recovered from one of the ponds.The investigation centres around Sebastian, 68, a real estate broker, who was arrested last week in connection with the disappearance of Jainamma, a woman from Ettumanur who went missing in December 2024. He has since been remanded in judicial custody.The remains of a charred body were first recovered from Sebastian’s property as part of the probe into Jainamma’s case. Her siblings’ blood samples were collected for DNA testing, and the autopsy of the remains was conducted at Kottayam Medical College Hospital.Sebastian is also a suspect in the case of Bindu Padmanabhan, 47, a native of Cherthala, and is under investigation for possible involvement in at least three of the four missing women cases from the region between 2006 and 2025. One more person is currently in police custody in connection with the case.Among the women feared to have met with foul play are Ayesha, who went missing about a decade ago, and Jainamma, whose case reopened this chilling trail. Sebastian was brought to the site for evidence collection, but investigators say he has given contradictory statements so far.Police are now considering breaking open the floor of a recently tiled granite room inside the house as the search deepens. DNA testing will be crucial to establishing the identity of the victims.","20 charred bones were recovered from a new spot on the premises, separate from where body parts were first found last week.

TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025: Corporate leaders make case for sustainability; call for ground-level shift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-ecopreneur-honours-2025-corporate-leaders-make-case-for-sustainability-call-for-ground-level-shift/articleshow/123099589.cms,"TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025

At the TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025 held in Delhi on Monday, a thought-provoking panel titled ""From Boardroom to the Road: Integrating Sustainability into India's Growth Strategy"" brought together top industry leaders who outlined how sustainability is no longer a corporate accessory but a foundational growth driver for India’s future.The session featured Anjali Ravi Kumar, chief sustainability officer at Zomato; Ram Kuppuswamy, COO of Hero MotoCorp; Pankaj Verma, chief sustainability officer at Adani Green Energy Limited; and Abhijeet Sinha, program director at National Highways for Electric Vehicles (NHEV). Each panelist detailed how their organisation is embedding sustainability into core operations—beyond CSR—and why doing so is key to long-term success.“We have always embedded sustainability at the heart of our products, services, and customer outreach,” said Kuppuswamy, stressing that Hero MotoCorp has intensified its green efforts over the past decade. “It’s not just a responsibility but a strategic necessity for all stakeholders.”Pankaj Verma echoed this sentiment, highlighting how Adani Green Energy has built its business model around sustainability.“From strategy to execution, we’ve aligned everything with long-term environmental goals. Even our suppliers are improving on these aspects,” he said, adding that their roadmap is reviewed and approved by the Board.Zomato’s Anjali Ravi Kumar noted that Gen Z and younger consumers are driving awareness. “Sustainability matters, but the primary functionality like delivery speed or pricing cannot be compromised. Green practices are now a value addition,” she said. She cited Zomato’s success in offsetting plastic waste: “Each of our food deliveries is 100% plastic neutral. We’ve recycled about 45,000 metric tonnes of plastic. ”Abhijeet Sinha brought a philosophical lens, urging India to develop a model based on indigenous thinking rather than replicating Western frameworks. “India’s green future must emerge from its own wisdom. If we fail to do this, we risk losing our identity,” he warned.The discussion also touched upon urban challenges like the worsening condition of Gurugram. Kuppuswamy pointed out that personal responsibility must go hand-in-hand with systemic reform, while Verma stressed the need to embed sustainability from the planning phase itself. Sinha added that the issue has become a matter of civic and electoral concern.Together, the panellists highlighted that India's green transformation will require both top-down strategies and grassroots participation. As one panellist put it, “Sustainability is not a choice anymore—it is the roadmap.”","Panelists outlined how sustainability is no longer a corporate accessory but a foundational growth driver for India’s future.

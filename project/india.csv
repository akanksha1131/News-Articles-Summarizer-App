NEW DELHI: India is favourably considering an invitation by the Maldives for PM Narendra Modi to visit the strategically important Indian Ocean country in July, ToI has learnt. This follows a strong reiteration of President Mohamed Muizzu’s 2024 invitation to Modi by Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Khaleel during his visit to India last week.While it’s too early to talk about the programme or agenda, It’s learnt that one of the dates being considered for Modi’s visit to the archipelago is July 26, the Maldives Independence Day. If it happens, it will be the first visit by Modi to the country since Muizzu assumed office in November 2023.Khaleel was in India last week for the third time this year, signaling an intent on the part of the Maldives to deepen ties with India amid concerns both here and in the West about its ties with China. Along with his counterpart S Jaishankar, Khaleel reviewed bilateral cooperation in a range of areas including the development partnership, defence and security and trade and investment. Jaishankar said after the meeting that India remained committed to Maldives’ progress and development and also thanked him for the solidarity with India on the issue of terrorism.Muizzu has continued to strongly maintain that the Maldives will not do anything to hurt India’s security interests and that his decision to force Indian military personnel out of the country was based purely on the Maldivian people’s desire for independence and non-interference in internal affairs.In an interview to Ceylon Today last week, the president said the Maldives will not allow its geographical location to be misused by any country for deliberate attempts that undermine the peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region. “Our approach will always be for regional peace and sovereignty, and fair diplomacy with everyone,’’ he said.India sees Maldives as a key maritime neighbour and an important partner in India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions). According to the Indian external affairs ministry, the visit was aimed at strengthening the Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership between the two countries. As Modi and Muizzu had said in a joint statement after the latter’s visit to India in October, 2024, this partnership will be people-centric, future-oriented and will act as an anchor of stability in the Indian Ocean Region. Among the big takeaways from that visit was a decision to initiate discussions on a Bilateral Free Trade Agreement focusing on trade in goods and services between the 2 countries.",India is favourably considering an invitation by the Maldives for PM Narendra Modi to visit the strategically important Indian Ocean country in July.

Cash-strapped Congress to revive crowdfunding at district level,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-strapped-congress-to-revive-crowdfunding-at-district-level/articleshow/121558876.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Just over a year after Income Tax notices forced it to discontinue its newly launched ""crowdfunding"" platform for resource mobilisation, Congress is set to reintroduce the novel programme with a nationwide focus down to the district level, which would complement its move to empower the organisation's bottom rung.Congress has finalised a revamped crowdfunding plan where donations would be invited at the district level. A page dedicated to every district will be opened on the official party website, and each resident can pick his district to contribute to the Congress kitty.It will be different from the ""donate for desh"" launched in December 2023 ahead of the 2024 parliamentary elections.After it was launched on December 18, 2023, the initiative created a splash as a first of its kind in the political sphere, and made bigger news as the principal opposition party's bid to overcome the funding skew created by the later-scrapped electoral bonds scheme that was viewed to favour the governing party. Congress got Rs 25 crore in one and half months, through 3 lakh donors. But the donation platform had to be paused abruptly in view of the IT notices to Congress, that saw the department take massive ""liens"" on its accounts, which threatened to funnel the money generated through crowdfunding into the govt kitty.Congress treasurer Ajay Maken recently gave a plan to district presidents on how the party proposes to generate funds at district level which can be used by local units for their functioning and programmes.According to the plan, the money generated in a district will be turned into a corpus fund, and Congress will provide a matching amount, and interest generated on the money will help finance organisational activities. Sources, however, said donations will be to AICC account only, as it alone is legally entitled to accept donations.This is in sync with the big Congress decision to empower the district units to bolster its grassroots strength amid dwindling political fortunes in the face of BJP’s continued dominance for a decade. As decided at the Ahmedabad AICC session in April, Congress has pledged to turn the district Congress units into the hubs of its organizational work, and also plans to vest real decision-making powers in them.According to strategists, crowdfunding helps in more ways than monetary. The small donors feel a stake in the party which increases their political commitment. Besides, the donations will be updated on the website in real time and also ready the workers’ database automatically.Under the Representation of People’s Act, money up to Rs 20,000 does not require a donor to present his PAN Card and only money above that sum is required to be disclosed to the Election Commission annually.","Congress has finalised a revamped crowdfunding plan where donations would be invited at the district level.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Police defended the arrest of Instagram influencer Sharmistha Panoli, saying that legal action was taken not for her political views but for allegedly sharing a video that insulted religious beliefs and promoted communal disharmony.In a detailed statement posted on X, Kolkata Police dismissed claims circulating online that Panoli was targeted for expressing nationalist sentiments. “Some social media accounts are spreading false information that Kolkata Police has unlawfully arrested a law student for opposing Pakistan. This narrative is mischievous and misleading,” the statement read.The case against Panoli was registered on 15 May at Garden Reach Police Station. According to the police, the video in question was considered “insulting to the religious belief of a class of citizen of India and amounted to promoting disharmony and hatred between different communities.” The police said they had acted under relevant sections of the newly implemented Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Repeated attempts to serve legal notice to Panoli reportedly failed, with the police saying she was “absconding.”“Several attempts were made to serve notice u/s 35 of BNSS to the accused but every time she was found absconding,” Kolkata Police said. A court then issued a warrant for her arrest. She was apprehended from Gurugram, Haryana, during daytime hours and later presented before a magistrate, who granted transit remand. She was eventually sent to judicial custody.“Hate speech targeting any religious figure or community or any class of citizens of India which has potential to incite disharmony and hatred between different communities is a punishable offence... Hate speech & abusive language should not be misconstrued as freedom of speech & expression as enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,” the police said.Panoli, a 22-year-old law student from Pune, had deleted the video and issued a public apology on May 15. Her arrest on Friday night triggered political controversy and public debate. Actress and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut called the move excessive and said, “She should be released soon because she is a very young woman. She has her whole career and life ahead of her.”BJP’s Amit Malviya also criticised the arrest, accusing the state government of “appeasement politics” and questioned why no action was taken against chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her own allegedly divisive comments.","Kolkata Police defend arrest of Instagram influencer Sharmistha Panoli.

The plane circled the skies for a while before finally landing safely after weather conditions improved, ANI reported.The pilot announced that the wind speed was up to 80 km/hrs. With the announcement, he discontinued the approach for Delhi airport and climbed back till the weather cleared.The incident occurred as parts of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) were hit by a dust storm followed by light rain, shortly after the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast thunderstorms and gusty winds. The IMD said wind speeds were expected to reach 50 km/h due to an east-southeastward moving cloud cluster.The weather led to widespread disruption at Delhi airport, with four flights diverted, one each to Chandigarh and Amritsar, and two to Jaipur, between 5 and 5.30 pm, according to a PTI source.Flightradar24.com reported that over 350 flights were delayed through the evening, making it one of the busiest yet most chaotic periods at IGI Airport, India’s busiest aviation hub.The sudden weather shift highlights the vulnerability of air traffic operations to changing climate patterns, especially during the pre-monsoon season in North India.","IndiGo flight from Raipur to Delhi was forced to abort its landing due to a sudden dust storm and strong winds.

The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold the first meeting of the Council of Ministers this week after Operation Sindoor and just days before the completion of his first year in his third term in office.TOI has learnt that ministers were sounded out about the meeting on Wednesday, though its agenda has not been shared yet. In every Council of Ministers meeting, different government departments make detailed presentations about schemes and programmes, and their progress to apprise all the ministers.Sources said a discussion on the precision strikes on terror bases in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor and the thrust on public outreach to mark the 11th year of the Modi government are likely to feature in the meeting. Earlier, the PM had briefed cabinet ministers and had asked them to avoid making political commentary.Some time ago, Modi had advised his ministers to be thoroughly prepared before speaking on any issue in public and is said to have emphasised the importance of preparation by citing his own example, sharing that he meticulously reviews all details and prepares carefully before making any public address.Recently, some cabinet ministers were given a bunch of important articles published in newspapers and magazines on Operation Sindoor and its significance so that they get a full perspective of India’s all-out crackdown on terrorists and terrorism. The articles, including their Hindi translations, were shared with ministers after the last cabinet meeting held earlier this month.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold the first meeting of the Council of Ministers this week.

'We Had That Rectified': Shashi Tharoor Reveals What Led Colombia To Withdraw Remarks On Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations visiting various countries to expose Pakistan post the Pahalgam attack seem to be becoming a headache for the Congress with senior party leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid's recent remarks backing nullification of Article 370 in 2019 by the Modi government likely to discomfit the Congress. This comes after another delegation member, Shashi Tharoor, faced strong criticism from within the party for his statement that India crossed the line of control (LoC) to conduct surgical strikes ""for the first time"" under the Modi government.While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on Friday, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries. The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country.But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed.,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir, it is very unfortunate. It will give a setback to anybody,"" Khurshid further said.While the senior leadership made no comment on Khurshid's remarks, unease within the party has been brewing ever since the government announced the names for the 51 members of the all-party delegations. The Congress had accused the Modi government of ""complete insincerity"" and for playing ""cheap political games"" while highlighting that ""regrettably"" only one of the four names suggested by the Congress leadership has been included. However, the opposition party relented, allowing ""eminent"" party members selected by the government to go with the delegations and make their contribution.The Congress had submitted the names of Anand Sharma, Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain, and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. However, the delegation finalised by the government includes Shashi Tharoor who is leading a delegation.

NEW DELHI: The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%, amid concerns that Chinese goods may enter the market and hurt Indian steelmakers.""We have received complaints of Chinese players trying to blunt the impact of the safeguard action by circumventing it. We are mulling over various options,"" a senior government official told TOI.In late April, the government had notified a provisional safeguard duty of 12% for 200 days, and a detailed investigation will be required before a higher duty is imposed.With Chinese goods facing levies and other actions in several markets, especially the US, there are widespread fears of trade diversion with India seen as one of the markets where these goods could be dumped or sold at subsidised prices.India, the world's second-largest crude steel producer, was also a net importer of finished steel for the second consecutive year in 2024-25. Imports are estimated to have neared the 10 million tonne mark.Small players have, however, been complaining about the adverse impact of the safeguard action as they have to deal with higher cost due to a price hike by domestic manufacturers after the safeguard action. The government will seek to strike a balance between the two sides, sources said.","The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%.

'Kamalesan's behaviour was against secular norms of Army'

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental weekly religious parades on the grounds that he belonged to the Christian faith.Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity, and sought reinstatement in service. In a May 30 order, a division bench of Justice Navin Chawla and Justice Shalinder Kaur said: ""Our armed forces comprise personnel of all religions, castes, creeds, regions and faiths, whose sole motto is to safeguard the country from external aggressions... They are united by their uniform rather than divided by their religion, caste or region. ""Kamalesan was commissioned in Army in March 2017 as a lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, which comprises three squadrons of Sikh, Jat and Rajput personnel. He was made the troop leader of Squadron B, which comprises Sikh personnel.In his plea, Kamalesan stated that his regiment maintained only a mandir and a gurdwara for its religious needs and parades, and not a sarv dharm sthal, which would serve persons of all faiths.He noted that there was no church on the premises.The bench observed that while regiments in the armed forces may historically bear names associated with religion or region, it does not undermine the secular ethos of the institution or of personnel posted in these regiments.""There are also war cries which, to an outsider, may sound religious in nature; however, they serve a purely motivational function, intended to foster solidarity and unity among the troops. At the same time, the armed forces also give due respect to the religious beliefs of their personnel,"" the bench noted.HC observed that Kamalesan kept his religion above a lawful command from his superior, which was clearly an act of indiscipline. ""While, to a civilian, it may appear harsh and even sound far-fetched, the standard of discipline required for the armed forces is different,"" it said.The bench stated the termination order specifically noted that Kamalesan's undisciplined behaviour was against all secular norms of Indian Army and adversely affected the traditional camaraderie between officers and troops of the regiment.Noting that Army organised several counselling sessions for Kamalesan, the court concluded that the decision of termination was taken after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the case and potential consequences of different courses of action.","Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity.

Poll Do you believe the couple deserved a refund for their unused train tickets? Yes, they should be refunded No, it was their choice

BENGALURU: A senior citizen couple from Hoodi in Whitefield took on the railways and won after being denied refund for a train journey they never made, as their reserved coach was overcrowded and inaccessible, forcing them to return home. Bengaluru Urban II additional district consumer commission has pulled up South Western Railway (SWR) for deficiency in service and ordered a full refund along with litigation costs.The case, earlier dismissed by the forum on July 1, 2023, was challenged again by the couple at the state commission. The appeal was allowed, with the state commission setting aside the earlier order and directing the forum to readmit the complaint.The story began when Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13, paying Rs 892.5 for the trip. On the day of the journey, after reaching the station by auto (spending Rs 165), the couple was shocked to find their S2 coach - and the entire train - packed with passengers, making it impossible for them to board.With no railway staff around to assist, they were forced to abandon the journey and return home.Despite several representations and email follow-ups, the railways neither refunded the ticket fare nor offered any explanation or compensation. Left with no option, the elderly couple filed a consumer complaint citing service lapses.In their complaint, they said they informed the railways post-departure and expected a ticket deposit receipt (TDR) to be raised. But no TDR was filed and no refund or compensation issued.However, the railways, in its defence, denied any service deficiency, claiming that the train was not overcrowded when it arrived at the station. In their written response, railway officials acknowledged their tickets, further stating the train was fully reserved and unreserved travel was restored across the division after Covid. Therefore, they argued, the couple's claims of overcrowding by unauthorised passengers were ""false and baseless"".The railways said 134 passengers boarded from KJM on April 13 with no overcrowding complaints - except the elderly couple. Officials noted the duo didn't report any issue to the station master or RPF on duty, and no crowding was flagged by staff on board.Calling the duo's decision not to board a personal choice, the railways denied any service lapse. It also cited refund rules, saying confirmed tickets are non-refundable unless cancelled or a TDR is filed four hours before departure.However, the railways' own letter dated May 6, 2022, had admitted a spike in ticketless travel and called for issuing unreserved tickets to curb revenue loss - a point the consumer forum said backed the couple's claim.Holding the railways responsible for the couple being unable to board the crowded train during its two-minute halt at 11.53 pm at KJM, the panel said internal records can't override on-ground realities. It ruled the couple faced financial loss and mental agony due to a clear deficiency in service, especially when the full fare was collected.In March this year, the consumer commission ordered the railways to refund Rs 892.5 and pay the complainants Rs 5,000 for deficiency of service, mental agony, and Rs 3000 as litigation costs.","Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13.

India, the country that sends more students to the US than any other, young people who had hoped to pursue higher education in America this fall described feeling in a state of limbo after the Trump administration's decision to pause interviews with foreign nationals applying for student visas.Some are scrubbing their feeds, deleting comments and unfollowing accounts after the state department said that it would screen social media use. Others are exchanging news and information in newly formed encrypted group chats. And some have sought divine aid in ""visa temples"" - so called because Hindu devotees say prayers there provide a greater chance of getting a tourist, study or work visa.Career counsellors have become therapists, and the extended family networks that many Indians have in America, have set up war rooms online. Other students are revisiting their backup plans or rethinking their academic paths.""I have carefully built my profile to be able to get into the top policy programs in the US,"" said Kaushik Sharma, 28. He called it his ""dream"" to study in America but added that the current environment was making him nervous about applying. ""I don't want to go there and be in a constant state of fear,"" he said. He is now considering similar public policy programs at universities in Britain and Singapore, he added.Karan Gupta, a career counsellor said he had been inundated by calls in the past few days. ""There are students with admission letters who don't know if they will get visa appointments, and those in the US worried about their visa status.

Five days later, the state department said it would pause interviews with foreign nationals applying for student visas as it expands scrutiny of their social media posts.Although a judge has blocked the administration's step against Harvard, and the state department has said that student interviews scheduled before its order would proceed.American universities have produced leaders like Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft; and Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, both of whom grew up in India and attended US graduate programs.

She didn’t utter a word then.”Shah alleged that the recent violence in Murshidabad linked to anti-waqf law protests was a “state-sponsored” riot. “The state government did not seek help from BSF despite repeated alerts from us. Finally, BSF intervened after the high court’s order. Trinamool netas were accusing BSF and encouraging the rioters…The CM opposed the waqf amendments. Who was she trying to protect?” The home minister said the next elections in Bengal were not only about Bengal’s future, but also national security.“Mamata Banerjee has opened the nation’s borders to Bangladeshis.She is allowing infiltration. We asked her for land to fence the gaps. She isn’t providing it so that infiltration continues, her vote bank keeps growing, and her nephew becomes the CM. But this is not going to happen,” he said.Shah said it was painful to see Bengal plumb the depths, first under Left Front’s governance, and now TMC “For years, Bengal led India in every field. But then came the communists, and after that, Mamata Didi took charge with the slogan of ‘Maa, Mati, Manush’. She has since turned this great land into the hub of infiltration, corruption, atrocities on women, bomb blasts and injustice against Hindus,” he said.“During elections and even after Didi’s victory, hundreds of BJP workers were brutally killed. Didi, how long will you hide them? Mark my words — your time is over.” Shah said under UPA, Bengal received Rs 2.09 lakh crore, whereas under Modi, it received Rs 8.27 lakh crore in 10 years. But the money was “looted by the TMC syndicate”, he said.“Even if Modiji sends Rs 50 lakh crore, it won’t reach the people unless BJP is in government here. To get Modiji’s benefits and homes, you must bring a BJP government in Bengal,” Shah told the crowd.He later inaugurated a Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Rajarhat.","The era of ""appeasement politics"" in Bengal is over as BJP primes itself to form the next government in 2026.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court observed that a case in which the judgment was rendered by a foreign court, and was also sub judice in India, must be heard at length. The court of Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass made the observation on May 5 while hearing the submissions of Shravan Gupta, an accused in a money laundering case.Gupta was convicted by a court in Abu Dhabi last year for the same offences as charged by the Enforcement Directorate - fraud, deception, and embezzlement. Gupta and six others, including a private company, filed a revision petition against a magisterial court order of November 2024 in which the court issued them and others summons for the offences of fraud and cheating.Meanwhile, the court stayed proceedings in the matter until July 4, the next hearing date. The court also issued notice to the ED and the state to file a reply in the matter.The case is related to a complaint filed by Emaar India Limited against MGF Development Limited, Gupta and 11 others for large-scale fraud and siphoning of Rs 180 crore.In April, Gupta moved an application before the court, submitting that on February 27, 2024, a court in Abu Dhabi had convicted of the same offences as in the present case. ""Passing of the said judgment was concealed by the complainant from this court as well as from the trial court,"" the plea stated.Gupta pleaded that he cannot be prosecuted again, and the impugned order deserves to be set aside. The entire prosecution is bad in law in view of Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India as well as Section 300 CrPC, Gupta stated.","A Delhi court observed that a case in which the judgment was rendered by a foreign court, and was also sub judice in India, must be heard at length.

""We are committed to a path of responsible and inclusive development.

NEW DELHI: Empanelment of hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana has dropped significantly, from an average of 316 per month in 2024 to 111 per month in 2025, as of April.Data shared by National Health Authority (NHA) on scheme's dashboard shows that 443 hospitals were empanelled under the AB-PMJAY across India in four months - 161 in Jan, 187 in Feb, 40 in March and 55 in April. In May, the latest update shows, 20 hospitals were empanelled.Many healthcare associations point out that low package rates and delayed payments are key reasons behind the lukewarm response to government schemes from the private sector, especially large corporate hospital chains.However, a senior official of NHA - the implementing agency of the AB-PMJAY - said empanelment is taking place and that some of the new empanelments may not have been updated as they were migrating to a new system.AB-PMJAY, which is available in all states/UTs, except West Bengal, offers treatment worth Rs 5 lakh and, in some cases, more, per family for treatment of nearly 2,000 procedures involving specialties, including medical oncology (cancer treatment), emergency care, orthopaedic and urology (kidney-related ailments).The CEO of a top hospital chain in Delhi, the latest state to join the scheme, told TOI that package rates offered for various procedures under the AB-PMJAY were lower than their input cost. ""We may join the scheme if the package rates are increased,"" he said.The Indian Medical Association has also stressed on the need to increase package rates to make treatment under the scheme more sustainable. ""The rates should be raised to at least CGHS level,"" said an IMA office-bearer.As many as 609 private hospitals have opted out of the scheme since 2018, minister of state for health Prataprao Jadhav said in a written response to a Parliament question in March.""The reasons for hospitals voluntarily opting out include empanelment only for Covid period, hospitals were closed or non-functional, changes in hospital entity, hospital relocated, ongoing reconstruction or renovation, unavailability of specialist doctors, voluntary withdrawal from scheme, package rates, opting out due to certain treatment packages reserved for public hospitals only (Chhattisgarh and Gujarat), and no referral from public hospitals (Karnataka),"" he added.",Empanelment of hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana has dropped.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.The Sikh separatists last week called upon the Carney government to not invite the Indian PM, citing India’s alleged reluctance to cooperate in the investigations into the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau blamed the Indian government for the murder without backing up his claim, as Indian has repeatedly said, with any evidence. The diplomatic row that followed saw the relationship hitting an all-time low as both sides expelled each other’s diplomats for activities hostile to the host nation.Carney has so far not explicitly spoken on the Nijjar issue but, while talking about his plans to use trade to reset ties, has said that Canada is not responsible for the strain on the relationship with India. India is hoping that Carney will act more responsibly than Trudeau in his handling of the case and has said it is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity. India wants Canada to ensure foolproof security for Indian diplomats and also crack down on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities.",PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17.

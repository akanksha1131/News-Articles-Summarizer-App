NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday backed nationwide protests by workers and farmers demanding protection of their rights.He flagged concerns over labour reforms, trade policies, and potential changes to the rural jobs programme MGNREGA.""Workers fear that the four labour codes will weaken their rights. Farmers are apprehensive that the trade agreement will harm their livelihoods. And weakening or scrapping MGNREGA could snatch away the last lifeline of villages. When decisions affecting their future were taken, their voices were ignored,"" he said through a post on X.""Will Modiji listen now? Or is the “grip” on him too strong? I stand firmly with the workers and farmers on their issues and their struggle,"" Rahul added.An all-India general strike called by ten Central Trade Unions (CTUs) and backed by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday is aimed at opposing a range of government policies, including the four labour codes, privatisation and contractualisation measures, the Electricity Amendment Bill 2025, changes to MGNREGA and the proposed Seed Bill.Large-scale participation from farmers, agricultural workers and industrial unions is expected at protest sites across the country, with power sector employees, PRTC staff and other worker organisations also set to join.In a statement, the SKM said the strike seeks the withdrawal of the four labour codes, the Electricity Bill 2025, the Seed Bill 2025 and the VB-G RAM G Act 2025, among other demands. It also called for the restoration of the old pension scheme and the implementation of minimum wages for all workers, including scheme workers.Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) working president Binoy Viswam expressed full support for the nationwide farmers’ strike, describing it as a movement to defend people’s basic rights.Apple farmers in Himachal Pradesh have also intensified preparations to join the nationwide farmers’ strike on February 12 and announced a march to Delhi, warning that recent import duty reductions under India-US and other free trade agreements could hurt the state’s apple-based economy.They expressed concern that cheaper imports could impact local growers, despite repeated assurances from union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal that the interests of Indian apple farmers will be safeguarded.While several trade unions and farmer organisations have decided to join the strike, the National Front of Indian Trade Unions (NFITU) said it would not participate, describing the protest as “politically motivated.”","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi backs nationwide protests by workers and farmers.

Why the strike was called





Impact on key sectors





What is likely to remain open





NEW DELHI: Over 10 central trade unions called for a nationwide Bharat Bandh on Thursday against the government’s “anti-worker” policies. The bandh was supported by farmer organisations and other groups across sectors.The strike call was announced as a mark of “resistance to anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the central government.”Trade unions said nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to participate in the agitation.The protest was expected to partially affect services such as banking, insurance and transport, with unions serving strike notices across departments and industrial establishments.Also read | Bharat bandh today: Are banks shut amid nationwide strike on February 12? The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) called upon farmers to join trade union workers in making the all-India general strike a success.In a statement, the SKM said the strike sought the withdrawal of four labour codes, the Electricity Bill-2025, the Seed Bill-2025, the VB-G RAM G Act-2025, restoration of the old pension scheme and implementation of minimum wages for workers, including scheme workers.The platform of agricultural workers’ unions and the NREGA Sangharsh Morcha (NSM) supported and participated in protest demonstrations across the country.“SKM calls upon the people to resist all the new attacks launched by the BJP government on the farmers, the workers and common people,” the statement said.The SKM said the Electricity Bill would raise power tariffs for farmers and domestic users and impose peak-hour charges and smart meters. “SKM is demanding 'No to Smart Meters' and 300 units of free electricity to all as is also being promised in BJP election campaigns,” the statement said.It also opposed the Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Act, alleging that it would depose the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), and objected to the new Seed Bill, stating it would lead to black-marketing of seeds.The SKM opposed free trade agreements, calling them a blueprint of “economic colonisation” through the denial of minimum wages to workers, minimum support price (MSP) to farmers and the right to employment to unemployed youth.“The Modi government has surrendered the sovereignty and the self-reliance of India to the United States of America,” the SKM alleged.“SKM appeals to all farmers to join en masse in the protest demonstration, burn the effigies of Narendra Modi and Donald Trump and copies of the free trade agreements in solidarity with industrial workers and against all the anti-people, pro-corporate government policies,” it said.Insurance sector workers have also protested against the government’s decision to allow up to 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector and the implementation of new labour codes.“Services in electricity, banking, insurance, transport, health, education, gas and water supply will be affected due to the nationwide strike call on February 12,” All India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur told PTI.Public sector banks and insurance offices, state transport services in select states, government offices and public sector units, industrial and manufacturing hubs, coal, steel and other core sectors, mining and gas pipeline operations, and rural employment works under MGNREGA in protest areas are expected to see the impact of the agitation.However, all bank unions will not participate in the strike as their united front had already observed a strike on January 27. Bank workers’ unions such as AIBEA, AIBOA and BEFI participated in the protest.Hospitals, ambulance and emergency health services are expected to remain operational.

'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

Artificial intelligence has an exciting role to play in fields like drug discovery, scientific progress and disease treatment. But given the pace at which it is evolving, there is a real prospect of AI becoming more powerful than its creator, warns Tim Berners-Lee, British computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web.Humanity will have to figure out to how deal with super intelligence, says Berners-Lee, striking a note of caution at a time when companies and govts seem to be in a race to develop AI without really thinking through the consequences.Speaking to Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, Berners-Lee described ChatGPT as a ""phase change"", which surprised him with its conversational power. He emphasised that the critical question is who an AI works for.He argued for assistants that serve the user's best interests - analogous to a doctor's duty - rather than corporate incentives. He connected this to his Solid project and his company's work on user-controlled data ""pods"", aiming to restore agency by letting individuals control and selectively share their personal data, including in child-safe configurations with parental oversight.Berners-Lee also contrasted the early web's democratic spirit with today's platform-dominated experience. In the beginning, individuals could publish their own websites and participate on equal footing with major institutions.","Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, spoke at India AI Impact Summit.

Wangchuk drew comparisons with Chinese, Pakistani provinces: Govt

NEW DELHI: As the Centre justified on Wednesday the detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk by pointing out his alleged inflammatory speeches and the use of Gandhian principles as a facade, Supreme Court said that it was reading too much into his statements.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the govt won’t review Wangchuk’s detention order on medical grounds as he is “hale and hearty”. Mehta said that the activist was being taken care of in jail and had a minor infection. SC had last week asked the Centre to rethink his continued detention.Referring to one of the speeches, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale said that the activist was himself worried about people resorting to violent protest and that any conclusion has to be drawn by reading the entire speech. Additional solicitor general K M Natraj contended that the speeches and statements were meant to incite people to resort to violent means of protest against govt and he invoked the name of Gandhi and his principles to shield himself.The bench asked if it is objectionable if someone says that he is worried about people abandoning Gandhian principles and resorting to violence. As govt referred to his various speeches and interviews given in previous years, the bench asked it to refer to only those which led to the violence in Sept last year.The ASG alleged that Sonam Wangchuk tried to internationalise the domestic issue of Ladakh, made statements about referendums and plebiscites, and drew comparisons of Ladakh with Chinese and Pakistani provinces. The apex court had earlier directed the authority to conduct a medical examination of Wangchuk by a specialised doctor and file the report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail.

"Not just HCs, CJI nudges Supreme Court judges on delayed verdicts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-just-hcs-cji-nudges-supreme-court-judges-on-delayed-verdicts/articleshow/128235297.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Amid mounting unease of SC over the practice of judges inordinately delaying pronouncing verdicts reserved by them, a two-judge bench of apex court has set Thursday as the day to deliver a verdict it reserved a year and two months ago.SC had recently criticised HC judges who reserve verdict and forget to pronounce their decisions, terming it an ailment in justice system.An SC bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Manoj Misra on Dec 3, 2024 reserved verdict in the case “B Prashanth Hegde vs State Bank of India and Another” after hearing senior advocate A M Singhvi for appellant and additional solicitor general N Venkataraman. The case centred on failure to repay alleged bank dues of Rs 300cr and a counter-claim challenging the IBC proceedings. It might be a coincidence that the case showed movement soon after an SC bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Feb 3 criticised Jharkhand HC judge Rongon Mukhopadhyay for keeping judgments reserved for years.Terming it as “challenge” and an “ailment of the justice delivery system,” the CJI said such delays “must be cured and not allowed to infect the system”.When contacted for comments on his concerns over the judgment being kept reserved for long, the CJI office said, “the CJI is aware of the issue and that he is contemplating consultation with his colleagues for issuance of a general internal guidelines for prompt delivery of judgments.Overwhelming majority of judges in the SC do not keep judgments reserved for a long period. Compared to the HCs, the SC judges must get a little more time to contemplate and deliberate before delivering judgments as these become the law of the land. ”On inquiry with the SC registry, TOI learnt that Justice Misra had agreed to author the judgment on behalf of the bench and that it is pending with him for more than one year. CJI Kant had earlier said the best way to avoid reserving decisions in too many cases is to dictate the orders in the courtroom immediately after hearing the two sides to a litigation.CJI, in most cases, dictates judgments in the courtroom. Because of the pressure of administrative work that eats into his judicial time, the bench led by the CJI sits beyond the scheduled business hours to compensate the litigants and complete the day’s work, sources said.In 2001, the SC in Anil Rai case flagged the practice of some HC judges reserving verdicts and then failing to pronounce them, or issuing only the operative portions of the verdict with a promise to provide detailed reasons later — a commitment which was often observed in the breach.SC had ruled that if the judgment remained reserved for over six months, the litigants could make an application to the CJ concerned for listing the case for fresh hearing before another bench. SC could lay down guidelines for HCs, but it has done little to tackle similar delays in SC. Justice A S Oka, close to his retirement last year, had delivered the judgment on a long-pending dispute between two ISKCON factions after keeping it reserved for almost a year.","SC bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Manoj Misra on Dec 3, 2024 reserved verdict in the case “B Prashanth Hegde vs State Bank of India and Another” The case centred on failure to repay alleged bank dues of Rs 300cr and a counter- claim challenging the IBC proceedings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128235384,imgsize-50612,width-400,resizemode-4/sc.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Arguments on sentencing of Kashmiri separatist Aasiya Andrabi and her two associates, convicted last month under UAPA for conspiring to wage war against India and for membership of a terrorist outfit, could not begin on Wednesday as the question of jurisdiction has not yet been decided.Andrabi, founder of women separatist organisation Dukhtaraan-e-Millat, and her aides Sofi Fehmeeda and Nahida Nasreen were arrested by NIA in a 2018 case and held guilty on Jan 14 by additional sessions judge Chanderjit Singh.However, the sentencing remains stalled pending clarity on jurisdiction.The impasse traces back to Nov 2025, when judge Singh was transfersred from NIA court to Karkardooma family courts. Since the verdict in the case had already been reserved, he retained the file and convicted the trio last month.The confusion over sentencing, however, resurfaced after the matter was transferred back to Singh by NIA court judge Prashant Sharma, who had earlier held that the judge delivering the conviction should also decide the quantum of punishment. Singh had been hearing the matter since 2024 before his transfer.However, since the case falls within the NIA court’s jurisdiction, his present posting as a family court judge has added to the procedural complexity. The HC had held in another case that where a sessions case had been heard in its entirety, the predecessor judge was “duty-bound to pronounce the judgment”. The next hearing on Feb 17, 2026 will determine how to further proceed on the matter.Arguments on sentencing in Aasiya Andrabi’s criminal conspiracy case was put off as a Delhi court must first decide if judgment passed on Jan 14 includes both conviction and sentencing.

Why Bharat Bandh announced today?

What students and parents should do?

A nationwide Bharat Bandh called by a joint forum of 10 central trade unions began at midnight on Thursday, triggering concerns among students and parents across the country. With large-scale participation expected and road disruptions reported in several regions, the key question this morning is clear: Are schools and colleges closed today?The 24-hour strike is planned to protest the four new labour codes that are to be enacted in 2025, which unions believe undermine the rights of workers and employment security of workers. Privatisation action, wage issues, and the suggested India-US trade accord are also the subjects of the protest, and farmers' organisations have joined forces.As of Thursday morning, there is no nationwide order directing the closure of schools and colleges. Most states have not issued any official notification declaring a holiday for educational institutions.By Thursday morning, there is no national decree that guides closure of schools and colleges. The majority of states did not give any official message stating that there is a holiday in educational facilities.The most recent state-by-state report is as follows:The schools in the national capital are not closed. The Delhi Education Department has not declared any shutdown of government and non-government schools. The institutions are operating according to the schedule, yet the parents have been asked to keep in touch with the school authorities, in case of any disruption locally.Educational institutions are working normally. There are no formal guidelines that have been made to suspend classes.Lawmakers have not declared a vacation. Colleges and schools are operating normally unless the individual schools or colleges make a decision to the contrary.The schools of the Maharashtra government are not shut down.Schools are active. There is no blanket order of closure.Academic shutdown is not announced on a statewide level, and schools are not closed.With no disruption of transport for taking local decisions, schools in Chennai and the state are operating normally.The states where disruptions can be increased.The states like Kerala, Odisha, and Karnataka will experience greater involvement in the strike based on the participation of the trade unions. Nonetheless, such blanket school and colleges closure has not officially been confirmed as yet, even in these states.In Karnataka, there has been some confusion in some districts as government officials are still keeping vigil on the situation.These 10 central trade unions, such as the INTUC, AITUC, HMS, and CITU, among others, have headed the strike. The demonstrators are also demanding that the four new labour codes that were introduced to replace 29 existing labour laws should be withdrawn. According to them, the new framework simplifies the firing of employees by employers and undermines social security cover.They too have been demanding the repeal of the Draft Seed Bill, the Electricity Amendment Bill and the SHANTI Act. The bodies of the farmers have also participated in the protest, citing issues of trade agreements with the fear that such agreements would affect Indian agriculture.The number of workers, according to the claims of the organisers, may be over 30 crore, and the demonstrations are to be organised in over 1,000 locations all over India.As much as schools and colleges are generally open nowadays, one cannot exclude the possibility of localised transport and traffic disruptions. Students would be encouraged to monitor the official school communication media and keep in touch with their respective institutions to get real-time updates.At this point, learning institutions in key states are mostly operating normally, despite the Bharat Bandh being witnessed in the whole country.","A nationwide Bharat Bandh called by a joint forum of 10 central trade unions began at midnight on Thursday.

Gold price prediction

today:

are extending their rally this week, and remain well supported in the long term, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. The expert lists out the top factors that will decide direction of gold prices in the coming days:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold was seen struggling for direction this week, with overall trading activity subdued in the absence of fresh market-moving catalysts. It briefly slipped below the $5,000 psychological level during the early session today, but is still holding above the same.Global equities extending their rally this week is seen weighing on the Bullion in the near term. At the same time, a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) and softer US Treasury yields are helping to cushion the downside, keeping losses limited and keeping Gold rangebound in near term.Gold witnessed a sharp two-way move last week, initially extending its correction from record highs as profit booking, higher exchange margins and a rebound in the U.S. dollar triggered heavy liquidation, before stabilizing near key technical support around the 50-day moving average. Spot prices rebounded nearly 4% on Friday to close near $4,965 after successfully defending the $4,700–4,750 demand zone, indicating institutional buying and bargain hunting rather than panic selling, while geopolitical risk premiums eased slightly amid improving US–Iran diplomatic signals.Central Bank Demand Still Strong: China’s PBOC added gold for the 15th consecutive month, reinforcing sustained official-sector buying — a key structural pillar behind gold’s multi-year rally and a strong floor during corrections.Structurally, gold remains well supported in the long term by central-bank buying (700–750 tonnes expected in 2026), ETF inflows, reserve diversification and easing-rate expectations.The yellow metal is trying to build a base, with $5,000 now the pivotal near-term pivot, holding above it would strengthen the case for a move toward resistance at $5,090–$5,140, while failure risks a slide back toward $4,750 support.Markets are focused on US jobs and inflation data for clarity on Fed rate cuts, dollar direction, and lingering concerns over Fed independence, while continued central-bank buying, especially from China, keeps the broader bullish structure intact despite near-term range trading.Traders showed a muted reaction to the latest US Retail Sales figures, with Headline Retail Sales flat in December. Attention now turns to the delayed Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Wednesday, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on Friday.China has urged domestic banks to curb their exposure to US Treasuries on market-risk concerns, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. In response, US Treasury yields remain under pressure across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield extending its decline for a second straight day and hovering near 4.18%.","Gold was seen struggling for direction this week, with overall trading activity subdued in the absence of fresh market-moving catalysts.

But what he didn’t say matters more. On October 4, 2014, Epstein emailed Hardeep: ‘Did Reid meeting happen?’ Hardeep replied within hours: ‘I am in SF for meeting this afternoon. You, my friend, make things happen. Any advice?’ Epstein responded: ‘Tell him you will organize his trip to India, to meet with science and tech people and social networking gurus.’”Khera then raised six questions:He also added a post-script which read, “Almost surreal watching Hardeep lose his composure and stutter in anger. Hard to believe this is the same man who once represented India as a diplomat - what a dramatic fall in stature!”In a separate post, Khera accused Puri of trivialising Epstein’s conviction.“Did he just attempt to trivialise Epstein’s crimes? He says that in 2008 Epstein pleaded guilty to ‘soliciting favours of a woman who was underage. That’s it? An ‘underage woman’ is a minor. Basically, a child. And you reduce sexual exploitation of a child to ‘that’s it’? Epstein didn’t just face rumours. He pleaded guilty in a Florida court and was convicted. The crime was established in law. Yet you say ‘many of you had doubts. ’ Doubts about what - his own confession?"" he wrote.The Congress leader strongly criticised what he described as an attempt to downplay the seriousness of Epstein’s conviction and questioned the minister’s remarks on the issue.He wrote, “Must God descend from the heavens personally to confirm Epstein’s crime to you? It is deeply disturbing to hear an Indian Union Minister speak about sexual crimes against minors with such casual detachment. Public office demands moral clarity, not minimisation of abuse. Do us a favour, keep this monstrosity at home, and don't ever come out justifying crimes against women and children like this!”At a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Puri accused Gandhi of making “baseless allegations” and said that his remarks in Parliament had “elements of buffoonery” and “entertainment value”.Clarifying his position, Puri said, “There are references to possibly three or four meetings in eight years… Any contact I had with him has no connection to the serious allegations of sexual abuse filed by victims.”He added, “My interaction had nothing to do with that,” stressing that the meetings were linked to his work as India’s Ambassador to the United Nations and later engagements with the International Peace Institute.The controversy began after Rahul Gandhi claimed he had “verified information” and alleged that “there are Department of Justice files on Epstein naming Hardeep Puri.” The exchange has since triggered a sharp political face-off between the ruling BJP and the Congress.","Party leader Pawan Khera raised six pointed questions and accused the minister of playing down the seriousness of Epstein’s crimes. The row escalated after Puri, responding to Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, said that he had met Epstein “three or four times” over eight years in a “professional capacity”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128214461,imgsize-732799,width-400,resizemode-4/128214461.jpg"

However, on a petition by Heena where she challenged the validity of talaq-e-hasan, which she said left Muslim women destitute as there was no provision for maintenance, SC noted that it was handed over to her thro-ugh her husband's counsel.Heena said she could not remarry as she did not have a valid divorce under Muslim personal law. When Shamshad said his client had given her a valid divorce, Ahmed contested this and termed the second round illegal.The bench said, ""There is an urgent and dire necessity to refer parties to mediation for amicable resolution of their marital disputes and whether talaq-e-hasan was given validly and to explore any alternative solution.""It referred the parties for mediation before former SC judge Kurian Joseph, who incidentally was with the majority verdict by a five-judge Constitution bench that declared instant triple talaq unconstitutional in the Shayara Bano case on Aug 22, 2017.In another petition filed by Delhi-based Aasma questioning the validity of talaq-e-hasan given to her, the bench found that her husband, Mohd Anshar, had not responded to the court's notice seeking a response. It directed the SHO of Karawal Nagar to produce Anshar at the next hearing.After SC passed the two orders, Shamshad said it should not give the impression that talaq-e-hasan was an invalid mode of divorce among Muslims. The bench said it had expressed no opinion on the validity of talaq-e-hasan and that it was facilitating exploration of the possibility of an amicable settlement.",Supreme Court put on hold an advocate's two attempts to divorce his wife through talaq-e-hasan and sent them to mediation for an amicable settlement.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday fully matched Rahul Gandhi 's aggression on the floor of Lok Sabha, terming his allegation about govt selling out the national interest in the trade agreement with the US a blatant lie, painting him as a leader filled with bitterness and hatred who would go to any extent to harm the country in his attempt to target the ruling alliance.Hitting out at Rahul, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said it was Congress govt which surrendered India's interest before international organisations, including WTO, and ""sold"" the interest of the poor and farmers. She said the UPA govt had compromised the interest of farmers at Bali on agriculture, and had agreed to the trade facilitation deal, without securing India's interests.She also referred to the Sharm el-Sheikh Joint Statement and accused the Manmohan Singh govt of diluting India's position on sovereignty and security in its engagement with Pakistan.Reacting angrily to Rahul's ""sellout"" charge against PM Narendra Modi, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said no ""mai ka laal' has the audacity to do so and lauded Modi as India's strongest PM. Rijiju, who stood up to challenge Rahul's charges against govt and dared him to authenticate his claims, also said that a privilege motion may be brought against the Congress leader for making false allegations. ""You are levelling serious charges without any proof.You are making wild allegations. Please make substantive points,"" he said.BJP, in any case, would not have let Rahul's claims go unchallenged. But on Tuesday, it was enthused by a ""fact-sheet"" issued by the Trump administration which showed that India got better terms than what the bilateral statement suggested.Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnav took on Rahul for claiming the deal had compromised the ownership of data, saying it was protected under a strong legal regime.Former Anurag Thakur said in Lok Sabha that successive electoral losses had filled Gandhi with hatred. ""He hates parliamentary rules, he hates the Speaker, he hates constitutional institutions, he hates the PM and now he has started hating India.""Thakur alleged that it is Rahul, who accused govt of caving in to the US pressure, who is guided by ""visible and invisible"" foreign players working against India. Rahul raised the issue of ""vote chori (vote theft)"" whereas the reality is that the people have stopped voting for thieves, he said.BJP chief spokesperson Anil Baluni offered pointed rebuttal to Rahul's allegations, accusing him of misquoting and misinterpreting documents, including the budget and agreement with the US, to mislead Parliament and the country.""Rahul has once again chosen theatrics over truth.

NEW DELHI: South Block, home to all major decisions in govt for over five decades, will see the prime minister’s office (PMO) move out of the British-era building on Friday afternoon and shift to the newly constructed Seva Teerth.PM Narendra Modi will chair the last Cabinet meeting in South Block scheduled on that day before the inauguration of the new administrative building, which is less than a kilometre from the iconic structure on Raisina Hill.TOI has learnt that after the Cabinet meeting, Union ministers and top bureaucrats will go from South Block to Sewa Teerth, which houses the new PMO, cabinet secretariat, office of National Security Adviser and India House, the new venue to host high-level delegations. Officials said the first Cabinet meeting under PM Jawaharlal Nehru was held in South Block.Cabinet secretariat has already shifted from Rashtrapati Bhawan to Seva Teerth-2 and the shifting of NSA’s office from Sardar Patel Bhawan to Seva Teerth-3 in the new executive enclave is underway.South Block and North Block on Raisina Hill were built in 1931. The history of PMO traces to a small PM’s secretariat (PMS) in 1947 to provide basic administrative help to the PM.The first major structural change happened in 1964 after Lal Bahadur Shastri became PM when PMS got statutory status via Allocation of Business Rules. The authority of the office increased significantly during Indira Gandhi’s tenure and in 1977 it was renamed PMO during Morarji Desai’s tenure.PMO’s shift will be followed by the ministries of defence and external affairs from South Block to multiple offices over the next few weeks. The movement to the new complex means the country's power centre is completely moving out of Raisina Hill. North Block has been vacated completely with ministries moving out of the iconic building to new buildings along Kartavya Path, which was earlier called Raj Path.","PM Narendra Modi will chair the last Cabinet meeting in South Block scheduled on that day before the inauguration of the new administrative building.

'Met Epstein 3-4 times': Harpdeep Puri sets record straight after Rahul Gandhi's charge in Lok Sabha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/met-epstein-3-4-times-harpdeep-puri-sets-record-straight-after-rahul-gandhis-charge-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/128204848.cms,"Rahul Gandhi and Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri lashed out at Lok Sabha leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi over Congress’s repeated attacks over the infamous Epstein files, saying he met Jeffrey Epstein only ""three or four times"" in a professional capacity as part of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism.Puri said the meetings took place before he joined the Union Cabinet in 2017 and are already in the public domain.""I want to remind you that today, during the Parliament session, my name was mentioned in the context of some developments elsewhere—the Epstein files. I just want to share some information... I want to clarify that these facts are all public,"" Puri said at a press conference.He futher added: ""Three million emails have been released, covering the period from May 2009, when I joined as India’s Ambassador to the UN in New York, until I became a minister in 2017. During this period, there are references to only three or four meetings, and my interactions were entirely professional"".Puri said, ""After I resigned as India's ambassador to the UN, I was invited to join the International Peace Institute (IPI) a few months later. I was not part of the IPI per se. I was secretary general of the Independent Commission (ICM) on Multilateralism, set up in the IPI as a project.""""My boss in the IPI, Terje Rod-Larsen, was the person who knew this particular infamous person Mr Epstein and it is as part of a delegation of the IPI or the ICM that I met Mr Epstein on a few occasions, three or maximum four,"" he added.Taking a vile dig at ""yuva neta"" (young leader) Rahul Gandhi, Puri said: ""Epstein Files, the Yuva Neta should know, are about wrongdoing, criminal offences. The Epstein Files are about charges that he had an island where he used to take people to indulge their sexual fantasies, charges of paedophilia, and there are victims of this. Those victims have brought cases against people in authority. My interaction had nothing to do with that. ""Amid the criticism from the opposition over the India-US trade deal, Hardeep Puri said the pact was the best given the tumultuous global situation and that it was just a trailer.Further defending India's economic growth and slamming Rahul Gandhi for echoing Trump's ""dead economy"" claim, Puri said: ""On the one hand, you have leaders who dedicate their lives to transforming the country and work around the clock, and then you have elements of buffoonery. I am choosing my words carefully, elements of buffoonery. I did not call him (Rahul Gandhi) a buffoon; I said elements of buffoonery.”The Union minister also took a dig at Gandhi's conduct in the Lok Sabha, noting, ""Today, Rahul ji was supposed to speak on the budget. While speaking, he started reading the Economic Survey. It's as if there's a pause. Hey, my brother, please read a little. It's very important for India that we have international agreements and trade agreements.""Hardeep Puri's remarks come after Rahul Gandhi alleged that he possesses verified information, saying that ""there are Department of Justice files on Epstein naming Hardeep Puri and Anil Ambani.""""There's an industrialist whose name is also mentioned, but why hasn't he been arrested? Why are you linking him? The camel is somewhere, and the dog is barking in another city. What are you linking to what? I've already said, there are elements of vulgarity in this. It's only for entertainment value,"" Puri said on Rahul's remark on Anil Ambani.""I have said that I will authenticate the data I have. There are Department of Justice files on Epstein files naming Hardeep Puri and Anil Ambani,"" Gandhi told reporters at parliament premises.Speaking with reporters outside the new Parliament building, Gandhi claimed that the names of Union minister Hardeep Puri and businessman Anil Ambani have figured in the 'Epstein Files' released in the US.He said summons have also been issued in the ongoing case against Adani and the Indian government has not responded to them for the past 18 months.""There is direct pressure on PM Modi. Without any pressure, no prime minister of India would ever compromise on matters concerning the country's farmers, data, energy security, and defence. No one would do this unless there is heavy pressure and a very chokehold over them,"" Gandhi told reporters.In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said, ""India-US Trade Deal has mortgaged the future of 140 crore Indians. Youths’ jobs are at stake, farmers’ crops are on the negotiating table, and energy security is being surrendered to the terms of a foreign country.""""No Prime Minister surrenders like this without massive pressure. India understands - this deal is not one of equals, it is one of compulsion.

What explains the Left's right turn?

Anti-incumbency

Rise of saffron wave

The ‘watershed’ local body polls

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condemned his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma's ""point-blank"" video, terming it ""communal hate mongering"". However, it was only weeks ago when he himself remained at the center of a controversy for supporting a communal statement in his state.Kerala's Left has, for decades, projected itself as an ideological outlier in Indian politics — secular, class-driven, and resistant to the communal polarisation that has reshaped much of the country.Alternating in power with the Congress-led UDF, the CPM-led LDF built its dominance on welfare politics, strong grassroots organisation, and a firm rejection of identity-based mobilisation. Yet, as the state heads toward another high-stakes electoral cycle, that self-image appears increasingly strained.Recent years have seen the Left navigating a far more complex political terrain.Anti-incumbency pressures after two consecutive terms, the steady expansion of the BJP’s footprint, and shifting demographic and electoral calculations have forced recalibration. In response, the LDF’s politics has begun to display sharper edges — marked by strategic outreach to majority sentiment, selective engagement with religious institutions and a willingness to deploy rhetoric it once distanced itself from.It is against this backdrop that a spate of communally charged statements and controversies has moved to the centre of Kerala’s political discourse. What was once confined to accusations of covert alliances and backroom deals has now acquired a distinctly communal framing, raising questions about whether the Left is merely reacting to new political threats — or consciously adopting elements of the very playbook it long criticised.Jamaat-e-Islaami Hind has once again found itself at the centre of a political storm in Kerala — but this time, the sharper focus is on the surge of communal rhetoric that has accompanied the controversy.The socio-Islamic organisation was dragged into a political spat after the CPM and the BJP accused the Congress-led UDF of accepting support from Jamaat. While Jamaat’s political wing, the Welfare Party of India, does not wield significant electoral power, it maintains a presence across social, religious and educational institutions — a footprint that often becomes politically contentious.What has amplified the row, however, is the language used in attacking the alleged association. CPM leader AK Balan made a communally charged statement while criticising the UDF, warning that if the Congress alliance came to power, Jamaat would control the state’s home ministry and that it could lead to a repetition of incidents like the Marad riots of 2002-03. The reference to a past episode of communal violence immediately escalated tensions and sharpened political divides.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not shy away from voicing his support for Balan’s remarks. But the fallout was swift. The CPM’s top leadership later attempted damage control, describing Balan’s remarks as his “personal view” after the party faced criticism for rhetoric that opponents said it echoed ""Sangh Parivar"" campaign.The Congress seized on that line of attack. “What the CM has said is a kind of communalism that even Sangh Parivar does not express,"" AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said , framing the controversy as a troubling departure from the CPM’s professed secular stance.The CPM pushed back, arguing that the debate was being deliberately mischaracterised. Party leader MV Govindan said BJP and Sangh Parivar organisations were trying to present CPM’s criticism of the RSS as an attack on Hindu believers. ""Society should understand that criticism against religious fundamentalists is not against religion,"" he said, adding that Mahatma Gandhi was a true believer and Nathuram Godse was a religious fanatic.""How can one argue that criticism against a religious fanatic is criticism against religion? CPM will continue to expose this contradiction and work among people to expose and oppose both minority and majority communal extremists,"" Govindan said.Despite defending its ideological position, the CPM eventually distanced itself from Balan’s original statement, reiterating that it reflected his “personal view.”Even as the Left sharpened its outreach to the majority community, it simultaneously moved to reinforce ties with influential Muslim bodies, most notably Samastha, signalling a calibrated dual-track political strategy.The nomination of Samastha Mushawara member Ummer Faizi Mukkam—known both for his proximity to the Left and his vocal criticism of the IUML—to the reconstituted Kerala State Waqf Board underscored this approach.Faizi’s inclusion, despite past controversies and objections from pro-IUML quarters within Samastha, was widely read as an attempt to strengthen engagement with sections of the influential Islamic scholars’ body that are either sympathetic to or seeking distance from the IUML.Communist CM Pinarayi Vijayan, far-right UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s message and a Hindu event - Kerala witnessed it all last year.The Left government in Kerala organised Global Ayyappa Sangamam. But why did it stand out? As the name suggests, the event is meant for Ayyappa devotees. Sabarimala temple, which remains controversial, earlier for restricted women's entry, and now for gold theft, is devoted to the Hindu deity Ayyappa. Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) manages the temple and organises Global Ayyappa Sangamam. However, last year, the CPM government’s move to “assist” TDB in organising the Ayyappa event raised a lot of eyebrows.Why?The Left government was upfront in supporting the SC 2018 verdict allowing the entry of women of all ages in the Sabarimala temple. It even provided police protection to the two women of menstruating age who entered the Ayyappa temple.Protests erupted. Those who opposed the move- Sabarimala Karma Samtihi and BJP among others- took to the streets.BJP even accused the Left government of using the SC verdict to “diminish the prominence of the Sabarimala temple.”BJP and RSS both maintained the stance that while they supported “equal rights for men and women to worship in all temples”, they also affirmed that “unique rituals and beliefs should be protected"".By 2019, the Left government took a U-turn. It felt that aggressively facilitating women’s entry, as the year before, could again trigger unrest and large-scale protests during the pilgrimage season. Moreover, the party leadership concluded that pushing the issue could be politically costly, especially after past backlash and violence.As a result, Left’s move to organise the Ayyappa event is seen as nothing but a “majority appeasement” move, at least by the opposition.In fact, CPM received backing for the Sangamam from influential community organisations, including the Nair Service Society (NSS)—which led the 2018 agitation against the Vijayan government—as well as the SNDP, KPMS and the Malayaraya Mahasabha.The Sabarimala gold theft case is another major corruption charge that the Left has been accused of. The case revolves around the alleged pilferage and misuse of gold from the inner shrine of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple. Moreover, the opposition has alleged that investigative lapses have allowed key accused to walk out on bail — an outcome the Congress says marks another low for the Left government in Kerala.Picture this: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor sharing a stage to mark the largest private investment in a communist state, after a slew of opposition by the locals citing environmental concerns.It was 2015. The UDF government in Kerala laid the foundation stone for the Vizhinjam port. 'Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone' (APSEZ) signed the agreement with Kerala to build the port and operate it for 60 years.LDF, which was in opposition then, had rejected what it called a ‘sell-out’ PPP framework that favoured the sole bidder, Adani Ports and SEZ.Cut to 2025. LDF government, led by CM Pinarayi Vijayan shared the stage with Gautam Adani to congratulate for the “excellent execution of this mission”.However, this change in stance wasn’t just theatrics. On the ground, too, the shift was unmistakable.Despite sustained protests by fisherfolk and environmental groups, the LDF government stood firmly behind the project.Legal challenges against the port were contested in court, but construction was allowed to proceed.Prolonged protests, including a 140-day agitation in 2022, were met with police action and criminal cases against protest leaders.Claims of coastal erosion, displacement and loss of livelihood were rejected by the government, which backed the developer’s compliance reports and pushed the project forward, even as local opposition continued.The CPM went beyond backing the project and turned its fire on the protesters themselves. Through its mouthpiece, the party branded the Vizhinjam agitation as violent, motivated by vested interests, and led by forces seeking to destabilise the region.Protesters were accused of attacking police and the media, vandalising equipment, and defying court orders, even as the government refused to pause construction.The paper insisted that most demands had already been conceded, ruled out any rethink of the project, and portrayed protest leaders as irresponsible actors prolonging unrest despite talks and assurances—effectively shifting blame from the project to those resisting it.And that’s how a communist state got its largest ever private investment.Anti-incumbency has historically been a decisive factor in Kerala politics, and the numbers from past assembly elections make clear why the Left Front is apprehensive ahead of 2026.Looking at the electoral record, the LDF has experienced sharp swings after being in power: in 2001, it won only 41 seats compared to the UDF’s 100, but bounced back to 102 in 2006 after a term out of office. Similar patterns recur in 2011, when the LDF’s seat count fell to 70 from 102, illustrating the electorate’s tendency to punish prolonged rule regardless of performance. These cycles show that voter fatigue and anti-incumbency are embedded in Kerala’s political DNA, particularly against fronts seeking consecutive terms.The concern is amplified by the LDF’s recent tenure. Having governed since 2016 and securing 94 seats in 2021, the Left is now eyeing for a third consecutive term, a period historically vulnerable to voter backlash. With past trends showing that even strong governments can be significantly reduced after two terms, anti-incumbency presents a major hurdle for the LDF as it seeks to retain power in 2026.Another major challenge confronting the Left in Kerala is the steady rise of the saffron wave, reflected clearly in the BJP’s expanding influence in the past two decades.The BJP finally opened its account in Kerala in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning its first-ever parliamentary seat in the state.The CPI(M) too was left with just one seat, secured as part of the INDIA bloc, but the result carried little sense of achievement for the Left. For a party that once commanded double-digit representation from Kerala, repeating a single-seat tally for the second consecutive general election highlighted not stability but a prolonged erosion of influence.Alongside the seat win, the NDA raised its vote share to 19.4 per cent from 15.6 per cent in 2019, signalling that the party’s support base had reached a level where it could no longer be dismissed as electorally marginal.The CPM, which had won 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2004, saw its tally fall to four in 2009 and five in 2014, before being reduced to just one seat in 2019—a position it failed to improve upon in the 2024 elections.The contrasting trajectories underline a shift in Kerala’s national-level political landscape, where the Left’s once-dominant presence has steadily weakened even as the BJP has begun converting vote share into representation.Local body polls painted another scary picture for the Left, reinforcing concerns about the growing saffron wave ahead of the 2026 assembly elections.Seen as a semi-final to the state polls, the results delivered a sharp setback to the governing LDF, cutting through its welfare claims and governance pitch and reducing it to its weakest grassroots performance in years.While the Congress-led UDF mounted a sweeping comeback across all tiers of local self-government, the BJP-led NDA expanded beyond its traditional confines, transforming Kerala’s familiar bipolar contest into an increasingly triangular one.The most dramatic rupture came in Thiruvananthapuram, where the BJP-led NDA ended the CPM’s three-decade grip on the city corporation. Emerging as the single-largest front with 50 of 100 wards—just one short of an absolute majority—the NDA pushed the LDF down to 29 seats, while the UDF nearly doubled its tally from 10 wards in 2020 to 19.The result, hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a watershed moment in Kerala politics, underscored how the saffron surge has moved from the periphery to the centre of the state’s political contest, posing a direct challenge to the Left’s long-standing dominance.Demographically, Hindus constitute 54.73% of Kerala’s population. Muslims account for 26.56% and Christians 18.38%, both remaining influential but more regionally concentrated.As the Left confronts shrinking margins and the rise of new competitors, especially in Hindu-majority regions, it has increasingly sought to complement its long-standing minority outreach with calibrated appeals to the majority community.","Kerala's Left has, for decades, projected itself as an ideological outlier in Indian politics. But as the state heads toward another high-stakes electoral cycle, that self-image appears increasingly strained. Anti-incumbency pressures, the steady expansion of the BJP’s footprint, and shifting demographic and electoral calculations have forced recalibration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128202245,imgsize-1315252,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

BJP MP Counters Rahul Gandhi’s Trade Deal Attack, Anurag Thakur Says Grip Talk Exposed Weakness

NEW DELHI: Minutes after accusing the Centre of having ""sold out Bharat Mata"" from the floor of the House, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , went on to interrupt the ministers outside.The interuption happened when ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Joshi stood outside the House, speaking to the reporters. Vaishnaw was speaking about the safety of data of the Indians and how Rahul Gandhi should authenticate the statements before making big charges against the Centre in the House.As the IT minister spoke, Rahul Gandhi walked up to him from behind and started speaking.""Come, let's stand together. Let's do it together,"" the Congress leader said as the ministers walked away.Earlier the day, Rahul alleged that the India–US interim trade deal amounted to a ""wholesale surrender"" and accused the Centre of having ""sold Bharat Mata"", compromising the country’s energy security and farmers’ interests.Speaking in the debate on the Union Budget, Rahul said he did not believe that any Indian prime minister, including Narendra Modi, would agree to such a deal unless there was a ""chokehold"" on him.""Why has he (Modi) sold India - because they (the US) are choking him. They have a grip on his neck,"" Gandhi said, beginning his speech with a martial arts analogy in which a grip is followed by a chokehold until the opponent taps out.He referred to earlier remarks by PM Modi and NSA Ajit Doval that the era of war is over. ""In fact, we are moving into the era of war. War is there in Ukraine, war was there in Gaza, war is there in the Middle East, threat of war is there in Iran, we had Operation Sindoor.""""We are moving into a dangerous world. We have to understand our strengths, and the central strength of our country is our people,"" he said, stressing the need to safeguard the country’s people, data, food supply and energy systems.Rahul said that had an INDIA bloc government negotiated the agreement, it would have insisted on parity with the United States.""The first thing we would say (to Trump) is that the most important asset in this equation is Indian data. If the US wants to protect the dollar, it must recognise that Indian data is the biggest asset. Second thing, we would say to President Trump is that ‘if you want access to it, then you will talk to us as an equal, not talk to us as if we are your servants’,"" he said.He added that an INDIA bloc government would have declared energy security non-negotiable. ""The third thing, we would have told President Trump is that ‘we understand you have agricultural voter base, you need to protect farmers, but we will also protect our farmers’,"" he said.""An INDIA bloc government would say that data is our biggest strength, and now let us talk. We would go there (for negotiating) as an equal. We will not be made equal to Pakistan. If President Trump decided that Pakistan Army chief will have breakfast with him, we will have something to say about it,"" he added.Tje Congress claimed that under the interim deal, India’s energy security had effectively been ceded to the US.""They will decide who we buy oil from, our PM will not decide. They will monitor, and if India buys oil (from where they don't want us to), they will punish us and take tariffs to 50 per cent,"" he said.Accusing the government of enabling ""energy and financial weaponisation"", Gandhi said it had allowed Americans to weaponise ""our finance and our energy against us"".""How can you come to this House and defend this? Are you not ashamed of what you are giving away?"" he asked.""I am saying you have sold India. Are you not ashamed of selling India? You have sold our mother - Bharat Mata.

'Either Naravane Or Penguin Is Lying': Rahul Gandhi Reacts To Publisher's Statement On Memoir

What Penguin said

What is the controversial excerpt?

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, whose unpublished memoir has triggered a major political controversy, on Tuesday backed his publisher Penguin’s statement on the matter.“This is the status of the book,” Naravane wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of Penguin’s statement.General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book, ""Four Stars of Destiny."" An excerpt from the unpublished memoir was sought to be quoted by Lok Sabha leader of opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in the House on February 2, but he was blocked by the treasury benches, triggering the controversy.The treasury benches argued that House rules do not permit members to cite unpublished material. They also pointed out to Gandhi that he was not speaking on the listed subject — the Motion of Thanks to President Droupadi Murmu’s address, which marked the commencement of Parliament’s Budget session on January 28.The controversy has led to repeated adjournments of the Lok Sabha. Opposition parties have moved a no-confidence motion seeking the removal of Speaker Om Birla, accusing him of repeatedly siding with the government and “blocking” Gandhi from speaking at the government’s behest.As the controversy escalated, Penguin said in a statement on Monday: “We hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny. We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies have been made available to the public by Penguin Random House India. Any copies currently in circulation constitute an infringement of PRHI’s copyright and must immediately be ceased. PRHI shall be exercising remedies available in law against the illegal and unauthorised dissemination of the book. ”The memoir is yet to be vetted by the Ministry of Defence.The excerpt was published by an online portal. In it, Naravane, who was the 28th Chief of Army Staff from December 2019 to April 2022, quotes defence minister Rajnath Singh as conveying Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s message: “Jo uchit samjho woh karo” (take whatever action you deem appropriate).The purported remarks were made in August 2020, at the height of the India–China military standoff in eastern Ladakh.The Opposition has claimed that the vagueness of the alleged instructions amounted to an “abdication” of responsibility by PM Modi during the crisis.",General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book.

NEW DELHI: District-wise data of deletions made in the final electoral roll of Assam published on Tuesday, show a decline in the electorate of 25 of the state's 35 districts as compared to the draft roll.While Cachar district witnessed the maximum decline of electors in absolute terms, with a total 33,536 shaved off the draft list, Karimganj reported the maximum percentage of deletions, with 3.2% less electors as compared to the draft roll.As per data exclusively accessed by the TOI, Udalgiri and Darrang district had 2.7% electors struck off, while the deletions in Lakhimpur, Cachar and Kamrup Metro districts were around 2.4% each.Among the 10 districts where electors rose in number as compared to the draft list, Barpeta had the highest additions both in absolute (28,625) and percentage (3%) terms.Nagaon district now has the highest number of total electors at 15.5 lakh, followed by Cachar at 13.8 lakh. The districts with the smallest electorate are the tribal-dominated Dima Hasao, with less than 1.6 lakh electors ,and West Karbi Anglong with 2.3 lakh electors.Indicating the decisive role of women in choosing the next govt in Assam, female electors outnumber their male counterparts across 86 of the state's total 126 assembly constituencies, even though the overall sex ratio of the state's electorate (female voters per 1000 male voters) is 1000. Doom Dooma assembly constituency (AC) in Tinsukia district leads the way with a sex ratio of 1118, followed by Jalukbari AC in Kamrup Metro district at 1113 and Makum AC in Tinsukia at 1100. However, the sex ratio is most skewed against women in Algapur-Katlicherra AC in Hailakandi district at 910, followed by Chenga AC in Barpeta district at 918.As per the final electoral roll for Assam published on Tuesday after summary revision, the state's total electorate stands at around 2.5 crore after the deletion of 0.97% electors included the draft list. The final electorate, however, is higher than the state's 2.4 crore electorate in 2024 general elections.Unlike the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise undertaken in the other poll-bound states/UT of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry, summary revision does not involve filling up of enumeration forms or establishing a link with the electoral roll from the last SIR. However, the summary revision in Assam did include house-to-house verification of the electors.","District-wise data of deletions made in the final electoral roll of Assam published on Tuesday, show a decline in the electorate of 25 of the state's 35 districts.

New Delhi: Chief minister Rekha Gupta on Wednesday distributed financial assistance to 15,700 construction workers' children to mark the first anniversary of the BJP government in Delhi.Addressing a gathering of workers at Thyagraj Stadium, Gupta said her government will disburse a corpus of Rs 12.40 crore to help realise the education dreams of the workers' children.The financial assistance was credited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through direct benefit transfer.Under the scheme, workers' children from Classes 1 to 8 receive Rs 500 per month, those in Classes 9 and 10 receive Rs 700 per month, and students in Classes 11 and 12 are given Rs 1,000 per month.Undergraduate students are eligible for Rs 3,000 per month, while those pursuing technical and professional courses such as ITI, polytechnic, engineering, medical and MBA programmes can receive up to Rs 10,000 per month.Gupta took oath as the chief minister of Delhi alongwith her Council of Ministers on February 20 last year.The BJP government has been launching welfare initiatives and development projects marking the anniversary.She said that her government has launched a number of initiatives, such as 'Palna', a creche for children of working women, and Atal Canteen that offers meals at Rs 5 per person.Gupta said that the Delhi government was the first to adopt the four Labour Codes of the Centre to safeguard the interests of the workers.The Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board has registered over two lakh workers, and every penny of Rs 5,400 crore with it will be spent on the workers' welfare, she said.Delhi labour minister Kapil Mishra said the government on a scheme to provide financial assistance to workers in cases of emergency, such as accidents at work.The chief minister also inaugurated newly constructed panchayat buildings in two villages and laid the foundation stone for 59 development projects across 37 villages.The projects worth Rs 134 crore, will boost infrastructure and civic amenities in rural Delhi, said a statement from the CMO.","Chief minister Rekha Gupta distributed financial assistance to 15,700 construction workers' children to mark the first anniversary of the BJP government in Delhi.

Delhi HC grants bail in MCOCA case over 24-hour production violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-grants-bail-in-mcoca-case-over-24-hour-production-violation/articleshow/128214424.cms,"Delhi high court (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In a significant ruling, the Delhi high court has granted bail to an accused charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), citing a violation of his fundamental constitutional rights regarding the timing of his production before a magistrate.The appellant, Harsh Pal Singh alias Rubal, was allegedly involved in an organized crime syndicate and faced charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and the Arms Act. Justice Chandrasekharan Sudha delivered the judgment on February 10, 2026, setting aside a previous trial court order that had denied him bail.The core of the legal dispute centered on the timeline of the appellant's arrest and subsequent production in court. Singh was detained at Amritsar Airport on the night of September 25, 2025, while attempting to travel to Bangkok.He was subsequently handed over to the Delhi Police Special Cell and produced before a Special Court on September 27, 2025.The defense team led by, Advocate Rajani and Nishant Rana, argued that the total time he spent in custody before being presented to a magistrate exceeded the 24-hour limit mandated by Article 22 (2) of the Constitution and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.While the prosecution claimed Singh had been briefly interrogated and released on a notice to join the investigation the next day, the high court found these claims ""quite doubtful"". General Diary entries indicated that Singh’s belongings, including his passport and bag, were handed over to the Delhi team, who then left with him in a government vehicle, making a formal release unlikely.The court emphasized that the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours is a peremptory constitutional mandate. Citing Supreme Court precedents, the court noted that any detention beyond this period without judicial authority renders the custody illegal.Despite the prosecution's concerns regarding the gravity of the offences and Singh’s perceived attempt to abscond by booking a flight shortly after receiving a police notice, the court maintained that procedural law must be strictly followed. Consequently, bail was granted on stringent conditions, including a personal bond of Rs two lakhs.","Delhi high court has granted bail to an accused charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) Harsh Pal Singh alias Rubal was allegedly involved in an organized crime syndicate and faced charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and the Arms Act.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

THRISSUR: CPM on Tuesday launched efforts to pacify pro-Left writer and Sahitya Akademi president K Satchidanandan , who caused embarrassment to LDF govt ahead of assembly polls by warning against dangers of returning the same political formation to power repeatedly.Party district secretary K V Abdul Khader and Sahitya Akademi vice-president Asokan Charuvil met Satchidanandan at his residence, in an apparent conciliation bid.After the meeting, Khader and Charuvil sought to underplay the row. According to them, Satchidanandan clarified that he was making a general observation and wasn’t referring specifically to the situation in Kerala. They said Satchidanandan also alleged that media had distorted some of his remarks.However, Satchidanandan said he stood by his statement on the dangers of returning a party to power repeatedly. He said he had personally witnessed the disastrous consequences of such an experience in West Bengal.“I have seen the degeneration of Bengal communist party. As the party came to power repeatedly, more and more corrupt and power-hungry people flocked into the party. Dictatorial tendencies can take a firm grip over a party which remains in power for a long period.This is true, not just for CPM, but for any party,’’ he said.“I wasn’t suggesting a change of ruling party every five years. I’m not referring to a particular time limit at all, but I’m raising my concerns of dangers to democracy if any political formation remains in power for a long period,’’ he said, referring to former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac’s criticisms against him.He chastised suggestions that he shouldn’t criticise govt, which was paying him as president of Sahitya Akademi. “That is only a reminiscence of reactionary thinking that the relationship between Akademi president and govt is akin to feudal landlord and a tenant,’’ he said.Satchidanandan dismissed cyber attacks against him by Left sympathisers, saying, “It is evident that virtual fools’ paradise of cyber crowds didn’t even try to understand the implications of what I was trying to convey and which was completely lost in the verbal bullfight on this Lilliput.”General education minister V Sivankutty alleged that Satchidanandan had criticised without doing proper homework and analysis of political ground realities.Unlike CPM leaders, CPI functionaries took a softer approach to Satchidanandan’s criticisms of ruling LDF. CPI state secretary Binoy Viswam and minister K Rajan said LDF considered Satchidanandan a genuine ally and his criticisms would be heeded with utmost respect. There won’t be any attempt to stifle dissenting voices from friends of the Left like Satchidanandan, they said.Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan continued to support criticisms by Satchidanandan and activistwriter Sarah Joseph against the CPM-led govt and said the cultural leaders were actually giving voice to the opinions of a vast majority of people.",CPM on Tuesday launched efforts to pacify pro-Left writer and Sahitya Akademi president K Satchidanandan.

The white paper estimates that “Indian-born professionals are estimated to account for around 15% of the UK’s technology workforce.”In the post-Brexit and post-pandemic period, the fourth wave is described as strategically significant. “Indian professionals have become strategically important in addressing critical skills shortages,” the report states.Describing the Indian diaspora as “among the most economically successful ethnic minority groups in the UK,” the study underscores the community’s continued role in healthcare, technology and entrepreneurship.","Migration of the Indian Diaspora to the UK has evolved in four distinct waves since 1947.

Sonam Wangchuk Slams Govt After FCRA Cancellation, Calls It ‘Witch Hunt’

NEW DELHI: The central government on Wednesday opposed Sonam Wangchuk 's release on medical grounds, saying the climate activist was ""hale and hearty and just suffering from a minor infection.""The government said it was not desirable to review Wangchuk's detention as suggested by the court. The Ladakh-based climate activist is detained by authorities under the National Security Act (NSA) in connection with the violent protests in Leh last year, in which four people were killed and more than 150 were injured.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta made the submission before a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PB Varale in response to the Supreme Court ’s earlier query, asking the authorities to consider Wangchuk’s release on medical grounds over his deteriorating health issue.“He has been examined periodically some 24 times as per the jail manual. He is fit and hearty. He had a digestive issue, an infection. If we start making such exceptions (to release him), it will not lead to a positive outcome. The grounds on which the detention order was passed continue. It will not be possible to release him on health grounds. It may not be desirable, either. Since it has fallen from your lordships, we have given utmost consideration, ” Tushar Mehta, representing the government, told the Supreme Court.Observing that the medical condition of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, who has been in detention for more than four months, is not very good, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre last week to rethink/relook its decision to continue to keep him in custody.SC had earlier directed authorities to conduct Wangchuk’s medical examination by a specialised doctor and file a report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail. The medical report was placed before the apex court during the last hearing.Wangchuk was detained on September 26 last year under the National Security Act following protests in Leh over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh. SC is hearing the plea moved by Wangchuk’s wife, Gitanjali Angmo, against his preventive detention.Earlier, the government had told the court that the activist was trying to create political and social turmoil and unrest in Ladakh, and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",The government said it was not desirable to review Wangchuk's detention as suggested by the court.

Why was the no-confidence motion submitted?

NEW DELHI: The Opposition’s no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla , submitted by Congress and backed by 118 MPs, has hit a procedural snag even before it can be formally tabled. ANI sources highlighted the specific technical shortcomings in the notice that could have led to its outright rejection under Lok Sabha rules.However, despite the shortcomings, the Speaker has asked the Lok Sabha Secretariat to get the 'faulty' notice to remove him ""rectified"" to prevent its rejection.News agency ANI, citing its sources, revealed that the notice repeatedly referenced events from February 2025 and had the incidents mentioned a full four times. The notice should have had the incidents from the ongoing Budget Session cited accurately.This clerical error pertaining to dates is a serious procedural lapses Lok Sabha rules mandate precision in such submissions; any ambiguity or factual inaccuracy in the notice can provide grounds for the Speaker to dismiss it summarily without further consideration.Speaker Om Birla, however, has refrained from rejecting the motion outright based on these shortcomings and instead issued clear instructions to the Secretariat to facilitate corrections and advance the process “expeditiously” as per established parliamentary norms.On what ANI sources describe as principled “moral grounds,” Birla has voluntarily decided to recuse himself from presiding over Lok Sabha proceedings until the no-confidence motion against him is fully resolved, a move that underscores his intent to maintain the House's impartiality during this sensitive period.The revised notice, once submitted, will undergo prompt examination in accordance with the rules and is slated for listing after the second phase of the Budget Session commences — with discussions likely kicking off on March 9, the very first day of that part, according to Lok Sabha Secretariat insiders.The Congress-led Opposition, excluding the TMC, levelled serious charges of “blatantly partisan” conduct against Speaker Birla, accusing him of systematically stifling their voices in the House and filed the motion citing four specific, high-profile incidents from the recent Budget Session.They pointed to the denial of permission for Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi to speak on February 2 during the crucial Motion of Thanks debate on the President’s Address, particularly when he sought to reference former Army chief General MM Naravane’s revelations about the 2020 India-China border aggression in Ladakh — a moment the Opposition views as a deliberate muzzling of critical national security discourse.Birla’s public observation, made a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped his scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks, deemed a group of Congress women MPs as “posing a threat” to the PM and could precipitate an “unprecedented incident."" This was remarked as biased and inflammatory by the opposition.Also, the suspension of eight Opposition MPs, the opposition argues, was disproportionately harsh and reflective of the Speaker’s one-sided enforcement of House discipline.The opposition also claimed the Speaker had selective tolerance, citing Birla's alleged inaction against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, who reportedly unleashed “wholly objectionable and personalised attacks” targeting two former Prime Ministers, despite repeated demands from Opposition benches for reprimand or further action.",The Opposition’s no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has hit a procedural snag even before it can be formally tabled.

The Supreme Court has reduced compensation awarded to a woman over a “faulty haircut” at a luxury hotel salon from Rs 2 crore to Rs 25 lakh, ruling that damages must be supported by material evidence.A bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and Manmohan, in a judgment delivered on February 6, said “deficiency in service” had been established, but compensation in consumer disputes cannot be based on the “mere asking” or “whims and fancies” of a complainant.Justice Bindal, who authored the 34-page judgment, said, “The damages cannot be awarded merely on presumptions or whims and fancies of the complainant. To make out a case for award of damages, especially when the claim is to the tune of crores of rupees, some trustworthy and reliable evidence has to be led.”The verdict said the case was not a minor dispute where the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission could award compensation using a thumb rule or rough estimation.""Claim of compensation was for crores of rupees, for which some loss suffered by the respondent because of deficiency in service was required to be established. This could not be established by merely producing photocopies of the documents. Even the discrepancies in the photocopies produced on record by the respondent, as pointed out by the appellant, have been noticed … Thus, even after remand, the respondent has not been able to make out a case for award of such huge compensation,"" the verdict said.The court said the apex consumer panel erred in awarding Rs 2 crore in compensation based on photocopies of documents. It rejected the panel’s view that reliance on photocopies was justified because the complainant may not have retained originals due to trauma, noting this could not justify such a large award.The verdict added that even if only photocopies were available, there were other ways to substantiate the claim.""Even if the Code of Civil Procedure may not be strictly applicable, the Commission has not assessed as to how the respondent suffered loss to the tune of Rs 2,00,00,000/-. General discussion in the impugned judgment may not justify the same,"" the verdict said.Aashna Roy visited the hotel salon in 2018 and asked the staff to trim about four inches (10 cm) from the ends of her hair. However, the hairdresser cut off most of her hair, leaving only about four inches from the top, with her hair barely touching her shoulders.The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had awarded compensation on the grounds that Roy was an established model and that the haircut affected her career. The court had said at the time that the incident led to a “severe mental breakdown and trauma.”",Aashna Roy visited the hotel salon in 2018 and asked the staff to trim about four inches (10 cm) from the ends of her hair.

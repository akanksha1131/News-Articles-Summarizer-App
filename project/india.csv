NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday smilingly opened his address in Japanese during the signing of memorandum of understandings (MOUs) with Japan's Yamanashi Prefecture .The ceremony held in Lucknow, was attended by Kotaro Nagasaki, governor of Yamanashi, who led the Japanese delegation.The MoUs aim to strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between Uttar Pradesh and Yamanashi, symbolizing a deepening partnership between the two nations.Addressing at the event, CM Yogi pointed out the robust economic ties between India and Japan. “India and Japan are countries with big economies. The state government is keen to cooperate with Japanese companies. Uttar Pradesh is a state of unlimited potential. After this MoU, relations between India and Japan are going to gain new strength,” he said.The partnership reflects the broader ""Special Strategic and Global Partnership"" shared by India and Japan, a relationship rooted in centuries of cultural and spiritual connections. This bond dates back to 752 AD when Indian monk Bodhisena consecrated the iconic Buddha statue at Todaiji Temple in Nara, Japan.Over the years, prominent Indian figures such as Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, and Subhash Chandra Bose have played key roles in strengthening India-Japan relations.In modern times, economic and academic exchanges have further enriched this partnership. The growing Indian community in Japan , particularly in IT and engineering sectors, brings out the close ties between the two nations. The Nishikasai area in Tokyo, often referred to as ""mini-India,"" is home to over 40,000 Indians.Japan also hosts over 150 Indian professors, 50 research visa holders, and around 282 Indian students pursuing advanced degrees, fostering cultural and academic collaboration.","The MoUs aim to strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between Uttar Pradesh and Yamanashi.

World's most expensive Indo-US NISAR satellite likely to be launched in March: Nasa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worlds-most-expensive-indo-us-nisar-satellite-likely-to-be-launched-in-march-nasa/articleshow/116610692.cms,"An illustration of NISAR satellite

NEW DELHI: After much delays, Nasa has announced that the world’s most advanced and expensive earth observation satellite NISAR, jointly developed by India and the US for over a decade, is “likely to be launched in March” next year. It was earlier scheduled for launch in 2024.In a statement, the US space agency said, “Nasa and Isro are looking at a likely launch date in March 2025. Short for Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar, NISAR will scan nearly all of Earth’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days to measure changes in the planet’s ecosystems, its land and sea ice, and its solid Earth. The NISAR satellite will launch from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India’s southeastern coast.”The 2.8-tonne Nisar satellite, whose development started after India and the US signed an agreement in 2014, is designed to monitor planetary changes with unmatched precision. The over Rs 5,800-crore imaging satellite is first of its kind in the world as it features dual-frequency radar—Nasa’s L-band (1.25 GHz) and Isro’s S-band (3.20 GHz), which will deliver unparalleled data accuracy. Its critical components were transported from the US to India in Oct 2024, marking a significant logistical feat. However, the mission faced delays due to technical complexities with its 12-metre radar antenna reflector.NISAR's data can help people worldwide better manage natural resources and hazards, as well as provide information for scientists to better understand the effects and pace of climate change. It will also add to the scientists’ understanding of the Earth's hard outer layer, its crust.Observations from NISAR will benefit humanity by helping researchers around the world better understand changes in the Earth’s surface, including its ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice. It will also capture changes in its forest and wetland ecosystems as well as movement and deformation of the Earth’s crust such as earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity, Nasa said.The global and rapid coverage from NISAR will provide unprecedented opportunities for disaster response, producing data to assist in mitigating and assessing damage, with observations before and after disasters in short time frames. Its data will also help scientists understand solid Earth movements and their implications, it said.The satellite’s key capabilities include generating high-resolution images using radio signals, functioning effectively in darkness and adverse weather, detecting surface changes as small as one inch, and penetrating dense vegetation for comprehensive mapping.","NISAR will scan nearly all of Earth’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days.

He cited Ambedkar's resignation letter, which criticised then PM Jawaharlal Nehru for ""focusing on Muslim appeasement"" while neglecting the welfare of SCs.""I have been wondering whether there is any other parallel in the world to the condition of Scheduled Castes in India. I cannot find any. And yet, why is no relief granted to Scheduled Castes? Compare the concern the govt shows over safeguarding Muslims. The PM's attention is devoted to the protection of Muslims. I yield to none, not even the PM, in my desire to give Muslims of India the utmost protection. But what I want to know is, are Muslims the only people who need protection?"" Prasad quoted Ambedkar as asking in his resignation letter.Prasad demanded an unconditional apology from Congress for its ""historical ill-treatment of Ambedkar"", branding its recent actions as mere political tactics that the public would see through. He accused Congress of double standards, especially in light of recent events in Parliament where a scuffle resulted in injuries and legal action against Rahul Gandhi, which Congress netas have portrayed as a stand for Ambedkar's honour.Prasad accused Congress of historical bias by not awarding Ambedkar honours like Bharat Ratna or Padma awards while honouring those who opposed him, like Narayan Sadooba Kajrolkar. He said BJP planned to expose Congress' ""hateful attitude"" towards Ambedkar through a series of pressers.","Senior BJP neta Ravi Shankar Prasad highlighted several instances where he said Congress disregarded Ambedkar's contributions and dignity.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s mandir-masjid take draws major dissent from seers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rss-chief-mohan-bhagwats-mandir-masjid-take-draws-major-dissent-from-seers/articleshow/116610356.cms,"LUCKNOW: Seers' organisation Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti (AKSS) criticised on Monday RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat 's recent remarks cautioning against 'an unacceptable trend of wannabe Hindu leaders raking up temple-mosque disputes at various sites'.AKSS general secretary Swami Jitendranand Saraswati said such religious matters should be decided by 'dharmacharyas' (religious leaders) rather than RSS, which he described as a 'cultural organisation'.""When the subject of religion arises, it is for religious gurus to decide. And whatever they decide will be accepted by Sangh and VHP,"" Saraswati said. He said despite Bhagwat's similar comments in the past, temple structures have been identified at 56 new sites, underscoring ongoing interest in these disputes. He said religious organisations often act in response to public sentiment than political agendas.Also read: Wrong understanding of dharma leads to atrocities in its name across the world, says Bhagwat This marks the first time Bhagwat has faced major dissent from within the saffron ecosystem. Religious gurus like Jagadguru Rambhadracharya believe that Sangh should defer to spiritual figures in decisions related to religion. Analysts suggested the seer's backlash reflects a larger struggle within the Hindu religious community over RSS's influence in matters of faith. Bhagwat's remarks came after Hindu groups filed legal petitions seeking the demolition of mosques they claim were built on temple sites, including Shahi Jama Masjid in UP's Sambhal. In response, Bhagwat warned that 'no one will become a leader of Hindus by raking up temple-mosque disputes and spreading communal divide'.Rambhadracharya challenged the RSS chief's authority, saying: ""Let me make it clear, Mohan Bhagwat is not our disciplinarian, but we are."" He said the recent unrest in Sambhal, where a temple-mosque dispute led to violence and five deaths, highlight the importance of judicial and democratic processes in resolving such issues.""The positive side is that things are being uncovered in favour of Hindus. We will secure this through the courts, through the ballot, and with public support,"" Rambhadracharya said.",AKSS general secretary Swami Jitendranand Saraswati said such religious matters should be decided by 'dharmacharyas' (religious leaders) rather than RSS.

"Allu Arjun told about stampede death, didn't leave: Cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/allu-arjun-told-about-stampede-death-didnt-leave-cops/articleshow/116576623.cms,"Congress netas snipe at Allu, BJP claims conspiracy



HYDERABAD: A day after Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Allu Arjun over the Dec 4 stampede at the premiere of his film, ' Pushpa 2: The Rule ', Hyderabad police alleged Sunday that the actor insisted on sitting through the show even after being told that a woman had died in the crush outside.The stampede at Sandhya Theatre left 39-year-old Revathi dead and her minor son severely injured. Arrested and granted bail, the actor claimed at a presser Saturday that no cop had asked him to leave the theatre. He called it ""character assassination by spreading misinformation"".Despite being briefed about the situation outside, the actor refused to leave the theatre. He was adamant on watching the entire film. We not only told him about the fatality but also assured to clear the road outside for him to leave as he is a celebrity. Even then he refused to leave. It was only after the DCP stormed inside and gave him a deadline of 15 minutes to clear out, did he budge from there,” ACP L Ramesh Kumar said Sunday at a presser with colleagues.Telangana DGP in-charge Jitender emphasised that public safety supersedes film promotion. “With regard to Allu Arjun, we have nothing against any individual. At the same time everyone should be responsible towards the state. They should understand that safety and security of citizens is of utmost importance. They are heroes in films but on ground they should understand the problems of society. Promotion of films is not as important as the safety of citizens.” Jitender said.City police chief CV Anand released a 6.5-minute video to chronicle sequence of events that unfolded on Dec 4, with some visuals purportedly showing the actor being escorted out of theatre by cops.B Raju Naik, SHO of Chikkadpally area in which the theatre falls, also addressed the presser, echoing his senior colleagues and asserting that the crowd was “out of control”. “I somehow managed to escape death. But for the past 15 days, the fact that one woman (Revathi) died in my hands, and that we could not save her, has been haunting me. I pray for the soul and speedy recovery of her child,” Naik said, fighting back tears.As Revanth defended cops, some of the CM’s Congress colleagues insinuated Sunday that Allu had lacked empathy for the stampede victims and urged him to behave like “a real hero, not a reel hero”.“How can he prioritise box office collections over public safety? The actor should be a role model both on and off the screen,” said Congress MP Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy. Congress MLC Balmoori Venkat questioned Allu’s statements that he and the film brought pride to Telugu people. However, CM Revanth’s rivals slammed his criticism of Allu in the assembly Saturday. Junior Union home minister Bandi Sanjay accused the Congress govt of collaborating with AIMIM to target Tollywood as part of a “calculated conspiracy”.Sanjay pointed out that Allu had informed the cops beforehand and blamed the govt for the chaos. “An AIMIM member was prompted to raise a scripted question in the assembly, weaving a narrative like a movie plot to reignite this issue. This is shameful,” Sanjay said in a statement, referring to AIMIM’s MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi and his tirade against Allu.",Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Allu Arjun over the Dec 4 stampede at the premiere of his film.

Crippling IAF gaps force government to set up panel for new road map,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crippling-iaf-gaps-force-government-to-set-up-panel-for-new-road-map/articleshow/116576095.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the IAF grappling with an acute shortage of fighter aircraft as well as force-multipliers, the govt has constituted a high-level committee under defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh to chalk out a roadmap to plug the major operational gaps in the force.The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects. ""Among the three Services, IAF has the most critical capability voids. The committee will submit its report by the end of Jan,"" a source said.DRDO chief Samir V Kamat, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and IAF deputy chief Air Marshal Tejinder Singh, among others, are the members of the committee.The need to fast-track projects has been reinforced by the way the Chinese air force has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at all its airbases facing India, like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping, after upgrading them with new runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities.With the IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised to tackle the threat from China and Pakistan, one of the major challenges before the committee will be to break the logjam over the long-pending project to manufacture 114 new 4.5-generation fighters, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration. ""Some jets will be directly acquired, while the bulk will be produced in India,"" a source said.Then, there is also the induction of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which has taken a hit primarily because of the continuing delay in supply of engines by US major General Electric.Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will be able to deliver only two to three Tejas Mark-1A fighters instead of 16 promised to the IAF in the 2024-25 fiscal, under the Rs 46,898 crore deal for 83 such single-engine jets inked in Feb 2021. The order for another 97 TejasMark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.Meanwhile, GE has promised to begin the deliveries of the contracted 99 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by March 2025 now, around two years behind schedule.HAL and GE, of course, are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 aero-engines in India for the planned induction of at least 108 Tejas Mark-II fighters, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.Induction of force-multipliers is also crucial. IAF, for instance, has just six IL-78 mid-air refuelers, inducted in 2003-04, when it requires at least 18 such aircraft to extend the operational range of its fighter jets.In the ""eyes in the sky"" arena, India is even behind Pakistan, let alone China. IAF has just three indigenous 'Netra' airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, apart from the three Israeli Phalcon AWACS inducted in 2009-11. Consequently, the plan to develop six Mark-1A and six Mark-2 versions of the Netra aircraft also needs to be fast-tracked.","The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects. The need to fast-track projects has been reinforced by the way the Chinese air force has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at all its airbases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116576124,imgsize-467630,width-400,resizemode-4/116576124.jpg"

The three men were killed in a joint operation by Punjab and Uttar Pradesh police on Monday morning.The official file photos of the accused show them with similar white backgrounds in the exact outfits they wore during the encounter, adding to their families' doubts about the encounter and their involvement with KZF. A police officer told TOI that the men were ""intercepted while attempting to cross the Nepal border on a stolen bike"".Pilibhit SP Avinash Pandey dismissed concerns about the photos. ""Information about the three was shared by Punjab police with us at around 4.30am on Monday. Thereafter, a joint operation was enforced. There is nothing to doubt about the police action in reference to their outfits."" By 5am, some 30 minutes after that, the encounter was underway.

""He left for Batala to find work, and we searched everywhere, even in Amritsar. Today, the police came to our home and informed us that he was killed in an encounter,"" she said.

Gurvinder had previously been implicated in a case involving the drowning of another boy, with a court hearing scheduled for next month.The home of Varinder, 23, in Agwan village, was locked.

"Khalistan Zindabad Force chief hails from J&K, is now in Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khalistan-zindabad-force-chief-hails-from-jk-is-now-in-pakistan/articleshow/116609434.cms,"NEW DELHI: Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), to which the three pro-Khalistan terrorists killed in UP are being linked, is a radical Sikh outfit founded in 1993 by Ranjeet Singh @ Neeta, hailing from Simbal camp in Jammu, but currently ensconced in Pakistan. The outfit's aim is to establish a sovereign Khalistan state. It mostly drew its cadre from among radicalised Sikhs based in the Jammu region.According to former J&K DGP S P Vaid, Neeta had developed strong links with Pakistan's ISI during the eighties, when Punjab militancy was at its peak. He would head-hunt members of the sizeable Sikh population in the Jammu region, particularly the Simbal camp and R S Pora, and brainwash them into embracing violent extremism. In the nineties, when Neeta had struck a deal with ISI and taken shelter to Pakistan, KZF's modus operandi was to target buses/trains plying on the roads to Jammu, Punjab or Delhi.In 2009, the group turned to targeted killing of religious leaders in Punjab - Rashtriya Sikh Sangat chief Rulda Singh in July 2009 - and even abroad (Sant Ramanand of Dera Sachkand Ballan in Vienna). Since 2017-18, there have been intelligence inputs about Neeta using KZF cadre to target police facilities in Punjab. The UP encounter shows that the terrorists, after having carried out the recent bomb blasts at police facilities in Punjab, headed for Pilibhit where there is a sizeable Sikh community. ""It's a very positive development. Apart from putting the Khalistanis on the backfoot, the encounter highlights the good coordination between the Punjab and UP police,"" a former top officer of the Punjab Police told TOI.KZF is listed as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. With international presence and associates spread across Pakistan, the UK, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, the US, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Nepal and Malaysia, it is also banned in European Union nations. These associates, as per the Union home ministry, carry out radicalisation of Sikh youths in Khalistan ideology , mostly through social media.Neeta was declared as an individual terrorist under the UAPA in 2020. As per a gazette notification, Neeta has been aiding, abetting, spearheading, operationalising and funding terrorist activities and pushing in consignments of arms, ammunition, explosive materials laced with narcotics from across the border into India to promote terrorism and support their actions against India. An Interpol Red Corner Notice had been pending against Neeta since 2000.Among attacks in India, in which KZF activists have been involved, are bomb explosions in two buses at Pathankot in April and June in 1997, which had killed and injured several passengers. A bomb was exploded by KZF on the Shalimar Express train in June 1998.One of the 20 terrorists that India wants Pakistan to deport, Neeta is alleged to have been involved in the killing of DSP Devinder Sharma in Kathua in J&K in Oct 2001.","Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) is a radical Sikh outfit founded in 1993 by Ranjeet Singh @ Neeta, hailing from Simbal camp in Jammu, but currently ensconced in Pakistan.

This town is 360km from Bhopal and barely 20km from the Rajasthan border. It seems to have travelled 50-60km out of Kuno's protected perimeter and is around 70km from Ranthambore.The forest department is closely monitoring its movements. The cheetah is currently establishing its own territory outside Kuno National Park, said officials. They have opted not to tranquilize the animal, hoping it will return safely to Kuno.Residents of Sheopur were thrilled to catch a glimpse of the cheetah as it moved through the area. Locals excitedly shared videos on social media, celebrating this rare sighting outside the protected habitat.It seems to be following in the footsteps of cheetah Pawan aka Oban, the original ghumakkad, who kept wandering beyond Kuno's confines, keeping foresters on the tenterhooks. It was tranquillised in April 2023 to stop it from crossing over to Uttar Pradesh. This April, female cheetah Veera was rescued by foresters after going for a stroll in Jaura, Pahargarh, and Kailaras areas of Morena for 25 days.Rajasthan's forest officials have been alerted to the wandering cheetah's movements.

Another potential route involved taking the Raimangal River to Hemnagar in Hingalganj, or reaching Khulna via Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas district,” a senior STF officer said, as quoted by PTI.Munshi was arrested by the West Bengal Special Task Force (STF) in a joint operation with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. The arrest took place near Canning in South 24 Parganas district, approximately 60 km from Kolkata, late Saturday night.The suspect was acting under the instructions of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group, according to the STF. The 58-year-old, described as an IED expert with extensive training in Pakistan, had been residing in the area disguised as a shawl seller for two days before he was arrested.“This individual appears to have been deeply involved in jihadist activities and was likely attempting to recruit people in the area,” the officer added. The STF is currently analyzing the call records from the mobile phones to identify potential collaborators and uncover more details about Munshi’s plans and movements.According to officials, Munshi’s notes, which are now being decoded, could provide valuable insights into his network and future plans.“Bangladesh was a strategic choice for Munshi as it could serve as a transit point to Pakistan. His journey from Kashmir to Bengal was part of a carefully calculated escape strategy,” the officer elaborated.Investigators disclosed that Munshi was the second-in-command of the TuM and had ties to other terror outfits operating in the Kashmir Valley, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Seized during the arrest were an Aadhaar card listing a Srinagar address, Rs 50,000 in cash, and two mobile phones. Officials believe Munshi had visited Bangladesh several times in the past and maintained close contact with senior LeT members.",Javed Munshi was wanted for his alleged involvement in a 2011 cleric's murder in Jammu and Kashmir. The suspect was acting under the instructions of the Lashkar- e-Taiba (LeT) terror group. Munshi had been residing in the area disguised as a shawl seller for two days.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116603869,imgsize-962355,width-400,resizemode-4/116603869.jpg"

AbbVie did not respond to an email sent for clarification on the matter by TOI.However, according to an order issued by the pharma department, a copy of which is with TOI, the company justified its breach as “acceptable industry practice”. Later, AbbVie claimed that the company had entered into a professional service agreement with the doctors to compensate them for their services, which again did not cut ice with investigators from the apex committee for pharma marketing practices that comes under the pharma department.“The agreements entered by M/s AbbVie do not clarify why such highly trained healthcare professionals (HCPs) need to be provided with foreign travel opportunities to gain knowledge about simple procedures in medical aesthetics...

AbbVie rejected the committee’s offer on Dec 10, following which the pharma department issued orders to assess the company’s tax liability on account of the violation.","AbbVie Healthcare took 30 doctors to Paris and Monaco to improve their ""knowledge"" on Botox and Juvederm.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H.

"500 years on, Vasco da Gama hailed in Lisbon, ignored in Kochi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/500-years-on-vasco-da-gama-hailed-in-lisbon-ignored-in-kochi/articleshow/116609965.cms,"Post-colonial takes depict Da Gama as glorified pirate



KOCHI: At St Francis Church in Fort Kochi, history seems to have been dead, buried and forgotten. There is just a nondescript blue board at the church that reads, ""Remembering Vasco da Gama , Portuguese navigator; he arrived in Cochin ...where he died and was first buried"".On Tuesday, it will be 500 years since the man who discovered the sea route to India in 1498, and thereby revolutionised global trade and cultural exchange, died during his third voyage to India. As ceremonies to commemorate the 500th anniversary are in full swing at Jeronimos Monastery in Lisbon, where his remains were repatriated from Kochi in 1539, in the actual place of his death amnesia reigns. There are no commemorative events, not even a candle lit as votive offering.The reason for this could be an attritional process of historical revisionism. Once hailed as the man who catalysed the East-West entente (the incredible exchange of goods and ideas) and paved the way for the Estado da India (the Portuguese maritime empire), post-colonial studies are increasingly depicting da Gama as a glorified pirate, a pillager who treated the Malabar coast's natives brutally, and as an unabashed tool of imperialism and religious persecution. Historian Fr Pius Malekandathil, an expert in Indo-Portuguese history, said that when da Gama came for the last time to Kerala, he was ageing and ill. ""At the time of his death, Kochi was still the capital of Portuguese establishments. It was moved to Goa only later,"" he said. Fr Pius added that a commemoration may not have been possible in Kochi because of the existence of communities who have faced great suffering due to the Portuguese. ""Back in 1998, when there was an attempt to celebrate 500 years of the arrival of da Gama in India, there was strong opposition. The question was about whether it was domination or subjugation that was to be celebrated. People may not be able to see the multi-layered reality at times. A similar issue arose when there was a celebration of the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus. Many were there also who asked whether exploitation was being celebrated,"" he said.Even as da Gama's voyage paved the way for colonialism, it also triggered the movement of ideas, commodities, plants, and culture.""When we ask what early modernity is, scholars say that it was cultural, geographical, and societal connectedness. All this began with this pioneering voyage of da Gama,"" said Fr Pius. The channel that was opened up by da Gama eventually led to the arrival of plants from South America, like papaya, pineapple, etc, to Kerala. ""If not for that explorative voyage, the Indian agrarian landscape itself would have been different,"" he said.Most Fort Kochi residents in the church's vicinity, especially the young, know little of who da Gama was, or his significance. Vasco House, believed to be the house where he stayed during his visits to Kochi, right until his death in 1524, is now a homestay. Santhosh Tom, who runs the homestay, says that the building came to his family at the time of his grandfather. ""I didn't hear anyone talking about any memorial. We only know the story, which is that da Gama stayed here, died here, and he was buried at the church which is close to the house,"" said Tom.St Francis Church itself is now under the Church of South India (CSI). Since CSI lacks any Portuguese influence, unlike the Latin Church here, a memorial from the side of the church also became unlikely. Clergy Secretary of the Cochin Diocese of CSI, Rev Praise Thaiparambil, said that for the church da Gama doesn't hold much significance other than the fact that the tomb exists in their church. ""At the time of the Portuguese, it was a Catholic church and the burial happened then. The Dutch then took over the church and it became a Dutch Reformed Church. Later, during the time of the English, it became an Anglican church. When they left, the English churches were handed over to CSI. That is how this church came to us,"" said Thaiparambil, who added that the church's name was not changed by CSI.Fr Pius said that history shouldn't be forgotten and it was the access, openness, connectedness, and arrival of global culture initiated by Vasco da Gama that needs to be celebrated.","On Tuesday, it will be 500 years since the man who discovered the sea route to India in 1498, died during his third voyage to India.

"After Kejriwal's Delhi snub, Congress stares at RJD challenge in Bihar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-kejriwals-delhi-snub-congress-stares-at-rjd-challenge-in-bihar/articleshow/116606298.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress, which had mixed electoral fortunes in 2024, braces for a challenging 2025 - with assembly elections scheduled in Delhi and Bihar. While the Congress failed to open its account in Delhi in the last two assembly elections, in Bihar, the grand-old-party won 19 out of 243 seats in 2015 with a vote share of around 10%.From the high of Lok Sabha gains in June, the Congress was pushed to the corner by the end of 2024 after first losing Haryana to the BJP followed by a humiliating defeat in Maharashtra - where the grand-old-party could win only 16 of the nearly 100 seats it contested as part of INDIA alliance.Riding high on its success in Lok Sabha elections in the two states, the Congress spurned Arving Kejriwal's AAP in Haryana and did hard bargaining with its allies Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP(SCP) in Maharashtra. However, after its dismal performance in the two states - the Congress came under severe attack from its allies - with some even questioning its leadership position within the alliance.During the just concluded winter session of Parliament, the Congress found itself isolated by regional allies - like the Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress - who refused to toe the line of the grand-old-party on some key issues.The Congress faces an uphill, if not impossible, task in Delhi where AAP supremo Kejriwal has already said no to any tieup for the assembly elections. However, Bihar may offer a glimmer of hope for the grand-old-party provided it can manage to reach seat-sharing deal with Lalu Prasad's RJD and other INDIA bloc partners in the state.The assembly elections in Bihar are almost a year away, but the INDIA partners have already raised the pitch. We all heard Lalu Prasad not just backing West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as leader of the INDIA bloc but also making light of any objections that Congress would raise over the issue. The message was loud and clear for the Congress. Lalu's remarks had perhaps not much to do with the national politics of the INDIA bloc but was possibly a reaction to the remarks made by some Congress leaders who had started seeking parity in seat sharing for assembly elections in Bihar by citing the party's strike rate in the Lok Sabha elections.The RJD had contested 23 Lok Sabha seats and won four, yielding a strike rate of 17%, while the Congress fought on nine seats and won three, achieving a strike rate of 33%. The CPI (ML), with the highest strike rate, contested three seats and won two, marking 67% success. However, the RJD has been the single largest party in the state in the last two elections winning 80 seats in 2015 and 75 seats in 2020.Congress leader Shanawaz Alam, who is also the Bihar co-incharge, raised the pitch earlier this month by asserting that there was no big brother in Bihar coalition, obliquely referring to the RJD which has been the dominant partner in the state.“We must reinforce the ideological foundation of the coalition, rather than a hierarchy of power. Congress workers should not view themselves as subordinate to other alliance partners. Any decisions within the alliance would incorporate the input of Congress workers,” Alam had said at a meeting of party workers.The AICC secretary also demanded that the distribution of seats in assembly elections should be based on the strike rate—a metric reflecting the performance of parties in recent elections, particularly the Lok Sabha polls.He then fired another salvo at the Bihar ally saying his party would like to have ""two deputy chief ministers, including a Muslim"" if the coalition formed the next government in the state.All these statements irked the RJD, which criticised Congress for ""violating coalition dharma"". The fallout perhaps was Lalu's strong remarks against the Congress.The Congress has suffered in states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh by allowing its leaders to take a strong pitch against the allies. While the Congress needs to assert for rightful share from the RJD, it will have to ensure that strong posturing does not result in snapping of ties in the state.Two assembly elections was all it took for the Congress to lose its Lok Sabha advantage not just as the principal challenger to the BJP but also as the leader of the opposition's INDIA bloc. The big question is: Has the grand-old-party learnt from its mistakes?","The Congress failed to open its account in Delhi in the last two assembly elections. In Bihar, the grand-old-party won 19 out of 243 seats in 2015 with a vote share of around 10%. From the high of Lok Sabha gains in June, the Congress was pushed to the corner by the end of 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116606954,imgsize-1784689,width-400,resizemode-4/116606954.jpg"

Addressing these concerns, he stated, “The knee too is improving,” while walking gingerly with the aid of assistants.Despite his age and health issues, he continues to bless hundreds of visitors weekly, demonstrating resilience and dedication to his followers.Born in 1935 and identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at just two years old, the 14th Dalai Lama’s spiritual leadership has been central to the Tibetan cause. Since fleeing to India in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule, he has lived in exile, advocating for Tibetan autonomy through a “Middle Way” approach that emphasizes peaceful negotiation.China insists it will determine the Dalai Lama’s successor, but the spiritual leader has suggested his reincarnation could occur in India, rejecting any Chinese-appointed successor. Tibetan Buddhists believe in the reincarnation of learned monastics, a tradition that continues to hold profound significance.The Zurich-based Gaden Phodrang Foundation, established by the Dalai Lama in 2015, is tasked with overseeing the selection and recognition of his successor.The Dalai Lama’s return to public audiences in September, after a three-month hiatus for recovery, has provided solace to his followers.The Tibetan leader’s influence extends beyond his religious role. He remains a symbol of resistance against Chinese authority in Tibet, a stance that has earned him both admiration and criticism.The Dalai Lama has long been a unifying force for Tibetans, championing substantial autonomy and safeguarding Tibetan culture. However, his absence casts uncertainty over the continuity of these efforts. Penpa Tsering, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile , candidly remarked, ""Post-fourteenth Dalai Lama we don't know what will happen.""As the spiritual leader ages and China takes an assertive stance on his succession, concerns about a leadership vacuum loom large over Tibet’s future.","Dalai Lama says he dreamt of living for 110 years.

At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,"" the ministery of external affairs spokesperson said.Last month, Bangladesh's interim head Muhammad Yunus had announced that the government would seek Hasina's extradition from India. Hasina fled to India on August 5 this year after mass protests against her regime.The Nobel Laureate while addressing the nation on his 100th day in office, said that his administration would prosecute those accountable, including Hasina, for the numerous casualties during the student protests that concluded her 15-year leadership.""We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,"" Yunus said.""I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan,"" he added.Muhammad Yunus-led interim government, under the extradition treaty with India, plans to bring Hasina back ""to try her for mass killings during the student-led protests in July and August"".Md Tajul Islam, the newly-appointed chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), has said that Dhaka will file an application with ICT to issue an arrest warrant against Hasina. The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character.""However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty.

The bills were adopted by Lok Sabha with 269 votes in favour and 198 against.The lack of support, however, highlighted the govt's challenge as a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds majority in both Houses.Opposition parties, including Congress, DMK and others, have criticised the legislations as an assault on federalism and the democratic ethos of India. They also pointed to logistical challenges, including the need for extensive constitutional amendments and procurement of electronic voting machines on a massive scale.The JPC will have 90 days to scrutinise the legislation, review feedback and propose recommendations. The govt's argument for simultaneous elections centres on reducing the financial and administrative burden of frequent polls, minimising disruptions to governance, and allowing more focus on development rather than perpetual electioneering.","The panel, led by BJP's P P Chaudhary, aims to delve into the implications and benefits of synchronising elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies.

3 of pro-Khalistan group killed in UP encounter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-of-pro-khalistan-group-killed-in-up-encounter/articleshow/116609933.cms,"Large cache of arms suggests suspects’ plans of bigger operations



PILIBHIT: Three alleged operatives of the Pakistan-sponsored Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), wanted for their involvement in a series of grenade attacks in Punjab in the past month, were killed in an encounter with a joint team of Punjab and UP police on the towpath of the Hardoi feeder canal off Sharda river on NH-730 around 5.30am Monday.Two constables injured in the encounter are stable and recovering at a hospital.Gurvinder Singh, Varinder Singh alias Ravi and Jasanpreet Singh were believed to be involved in eight grende attacks on police outposts, including the one on Bakshiwal police post in Kalanaur and in Wadala Banger police station last week.Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav told TOI: ""The ISI-directed operatives were attempting to destabilise the region. Varinder was specifically chosen to lead the grenade attack module due to his close ties with a top operative, Jaswinder Singh Manu, in Greece, and his ability to coordinate operations with handlers abroad. KZF's network relies heavily on international operatives for strategic planning. Further investigations are underway to trace their connections and dismantle the network.""Acting on intelligence provided by Punjab police, a UP police team in Pilibhit launched an operation to intercept Gurvinder, Varinder, and Jasanpreet, all of them from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district. Two modified AK-47 rifles, two Glock pistols, and a large cache of bullets were recovered from the site, police said.SP (Pilibhit) Avinash Pandey said, “A team of Punjab police approached the SHO of Puranpur and informed him that a few terrorists from Punjab who attacked a police outpost were hiding in the area. We started an intensive search operation and barricaded all the routes in the district. A picket team shared information about three suspects on a bike. A joint team of Punjab police and Pilibhit police chased them, but the suspects on the bike opened fire at us. In retaliation, police officials also opened fire at them.”Pandey added: “The suspects sustained bullet injuries and were admitted to a hospital by us. At the hospital, all three were declared ‘brought dead’ by doctors.” Two police constables were injured in the exchange of fire. Both were immediately taken to the Puranpur Community Health Centre before being transferred to Pilibhit district hospital. Their condition is stable.Police said, “A large cache of ammunition suggested the suspects were planning a bigger operation. These weapons were consistent with the group’s attempts to carry out high-profile attacks.” Ramit Sharma, ADG, Bareilly zone, said the suspects were part of a module led by Pakistan-based Ranjit Singh Neeta, the chief of KZF. “The trio operated under direct instructions from Manu in Greece and Jagjit Singh alias Fateh Singh Baghi in the UK. Varinder Singh maintained regular communication with Baghi, who remotely coordinated their actions. The suspects stole a bike from Puranpur city on Sunday night.“ Preliminary findings suggest suspects had local contacts aiding their movements,” Sharma added.","Gurvinder Singh, Varinder Singh alias Ravi and Jasanpreet Singh were believed to be involved in eight grende attacks on police outposts.

One of them was to stop ‘wasooli' at toll barriers. We were getting complaints about this and we are putting an end to it. We will not tolerate corruption. Govt till take action at any level required,"" the CM said, adding that good governance is a priority.The CM's promise of action comes at a time when Lokayukta's Special Police Establishment (SPE) has uncovered crores in cash, jewellery and property from the house of a retired RTO constable, Saurabh Sharma , in Bhopal.SPE's Bhopal unit has formed a three-member team to probe the alleged disproportionate assets of Sharma and his associates. This decision follows income-tax department's seizure of 54kg gold biscuits, Rs 10 crore in cash and documents revealing transactions worth over Rs 150 crore.Lokayukta is now collaborating closely with I-T department to examine these assets and incorporate them into the ongoing investigation. I-T sources said they have found documents indicating transactions of more than Rs 20 crore per month.The Lokayukta investigation , being conducted under Prevention of Corruption Act, centres around allegations of corruption and illegal accumulation of wealth by Sharma.DG Lokayukta Jaideep Prasad confirmed that investigations are on and Sharma's family members, including his wife, have been summoned for questioning.Sharma was granted compassionate appointment as a constable in the transport department following the death of his father, govt doctor R K Sharma, in 2015. During his service, Sharma was posted at various check posts across the state and allegedly accumulated significant wealth through corrupt means. He opted for voluntary retirement in June 2023Investigators say Sharma used his ‘illicit earnings' to purchase benami properties in the names of his wife, mother, sister-in-law, and close associates, including Chetan Singh Gaur and Sharad Jaiswal. Sharma is also linked to businesses, including hotels and a school in Bhopal.The investigation began after a tip-off, and the Lokayukta team obtained a search warrant for Sharma's properties. On Dec 19-20, 2024, search operations were carried out at two of Sharma's houses in Arera Colony. In one house, investigators found assets worth over Rs 3.8 crore, including foreign and Indian currency valued at Rs 1.1 crore, gold and diamond jewellery worth Rs 50 lakh, and household items and vehicles valued at Rs 2.2 crore. At the second house, used for official purposes, daily-use items and luxury goods worth Rs 30 lakh, 234kg of silver valued at Rs 2.1 crore, and Rs 1.7 crore in cash were discovered. The total inventory from the second property amounted to Rs 4.12 crore.Preliminary investigations suggest Sharma's total movable assets could be worth Rs 7.9 crore. Summons have been issued to Sharma's wife, mother, and close associates, including Sharad Jaiswal and Chetan Singh Gaur.Additionally, income-tax department uncovered further evidence adding another layer to the investigation. The department seized a significant amount of cash and gold from an Innova registered in Gaur's name.Investigators are scrutinizing bank accounts linked to Sharma and his aides. The probe is expanding to include a review of the operations of the hotels and school linked to Sharma and his associates.Some politically influential individuals are said to be under scrutiny. There are allegations that I-T officials did not receive support from local police during the searches. In order to recover the car loaded with gold and cash, they had to rely on SAF jawans deployed for other cases.Speculation is swirling among higher ups about how Lokayukta missed the car during its searches. Even more intriguing is who tipped off the I-T department about the abandoned SUV loaded with cash and gold late at night.","Lokayukta's Special Police Establishment (SPE) has uncovered crores in cash, jewellery and property from the house of a retired RTO constable, Saurabh Sharma.

NEW DELHI: The road transport and highways ministry is planning to take up the construction and maintenance of national highway stretches directly rather than giving the tasks to public works departments (PWDs), a move that may lead to a face-off between the Centre and states.At present, around 63,000-odd km of the 1.45 lakh km NH network is managed by central govt agencies NHAI and NHIDCL, while the remaining 60% is managed by state PWDs on behalf of the ministry.The ministry gets the development and maintenance of around 80,000 km of NHs done by PWDs. It funds such works and pays agency charges to PWDs. Most of these NHs are two-lane roads or two-lane with paved shoulders.TOI has learnt that the fresh move is aimed at speeding up construction and better maintenance. They added that the plan is to bring NH networks with PWDs of only a few states directly under the ministry. “This will be done only in the case of states where the pace of construction and award is very slow. This will not be applicable for all states,” a source said.For this, it plans to set up project units for different stretches that would be taken up for widening. States such as Karnataka and Punjab may be the first few to be brought under this scheme of things.But sources said this may face backlash as states play a key role in land acquisition and forest clearances, the two most important pre-conditions for a project to take off and its completion. “If states don’t provide enough support, we won't be able to execute wider highway and expressway projects, as these require fresh land acquisition. Only time will tell how the move will play out and how states would take it,” an official said.At present, the maximum construction and award of highway stretch come from roads managed by state PWDs.","At present, around 63,000-odd km of the 1.45 lakh km NH network is managed by central govt agencies NHAI and NHIDCL.

He said that building a robust infrastructure to counter these threats, from headquarters to police stations and constables is the responsibility of young officers.In order to achieve a fully developed India by 2047, we must visualise all potential threats and prepare a comprehensive roadmap to safeguard the nation from them, he said.Shah said that inclusive development, along with peace and stability in the country, is only possible if we reshape our work under this expanded definition, prepare anew, and remain vigilant.Over the past 10 years under the Modi government, significant successes have been achieved in combating terrorism, Naxalism, insurgency, narcotics, and anarchic elements, he said.He said that under the current government, a major focus has also been placed on improving coordination between states and agencies and they have been strengthened with the backing of the law and amendment to several legislations.Shah said the Modi government introduced three new criminal laws starting from July 1 after discussing with all the stakeholders in many meetings over the last five years.He said he was involved throughout in the drafting of the laws.Once they are fully implemented, India's criminal justice system will become the most modern in the world, justice will be delivered within three years of the filing of any FIR, right up to the Supreme Court, the minister claimed.","Amit Shah said a country where social unity does not exist cannot progress in any meaningful way.

The protest was aimed at demanding the protection of farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal’s life, who is on hunger strike unto death since November 26, repression against farmers heading towards Delhi, immediate release of all farmers from Luksar Jail in Noida and Greater Noida, withdrawal of the national agricultural market policy , and an immediate dialogue with farmer organizations and others. The protestors submitted a memorandum to Mohammad Imran Raza, deputy commissioner of Jind district quoting president Draupadi Murmu.

The NDA-2 government shamelessly violated the agreement signed with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha on December 9, 2021, which had assured the repeal of the three farm laws, in the wake of the historic farmer struggle at the borders of Delhi. Following the formation of the NDA-3 government after the 18th Lok Sabha elections, SKM had submitted memorandums to the Prime Minister, opposition leaders, and members of both houses of Parliament on July 16 and18, 2024.

The charges against these farmers are baseless, and they should be immediately released from jail.The NDA-3 government is introducing a new National Agricultural Market Policy, which is part of a corporate agenda strategy to reintroduce the three farm laws through the backdoor. Farmers have clearly stated that they will never accept this. Therefore, the farmers are demanding that the government should engage in talks with farmer organizations and ensure the safety of farmer leader Jagjit Singh DallewalI, immediately engage in talks with all farmer organizations and resolve all pending issues as per the agreement made on December 9, 2021, they said.","Farmers gathered at Ambedkar Chowk and take out a procession till the Mini Secretariat despite inclement weather in Jind.

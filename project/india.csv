'Unwilling to work hard even with Rs 1 crore salary': US-based CEO post on 'engineers for Indian office' creates stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unwilling-to-work-hard-even-with-rs-1-crore-salary-us-based-ceo-post-on-engineers-for-indian-office-creates-stir/articleshow/117872762.cms,"NEW DELHI: IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Varun Vummadi , CEO of the US-based tech company Giga ML , ignited a debate on work ethic and work-life balance in the tech industry after he claimed in a post on X that many Indian engineers are unwilling to work hard despite being offered high salaries.“I’ve noticed a pattern in hiring engineers for our Indian office. Even with a base salary of Rs 1 crore, many are unwilling to work hard. A significant number of engineers with 3–8 years of experience are reluctant to work six days a week,” Vummadi wrote in a post.Vummadi expressed frustration over the attitude of engineers in India, particularly those in the early and mid-stages of their careers. He later doubled down on his stance, referencing his own family’s work ethic. He added, “My dad and mom are government teachers. They still work 6 days a week. 6*8 hrs for a Rs 1 crore base salary, which is significantly above benchmark for 3-8 year experienced people, is extremely fair.”He further added, “So work-life balance is what cuts it for attention and press in Indian crowd. People who are willing to work hard—hope they don't get eaten up by this virus. Many successful startups did 6 or 7 days a week. @elonmusk is a living example of where you can be if you work hard.”His comments triggered mixed reactions online. While some agreed with his observations, others pointed out that productivity does not necessarily correlate with longer working hours. Many argued that sustainable productivity and mental well-being should not be compromised for financial incentives.“Work ethic isn’t just about hours—it’s about impact. If talented engineers are hesitating despite a Rs1 crore base salary, it might be worth considering whether expectations align with modern work culture . Sustainable productivity often beats sheer hours,” one user commented.Another user pushed back against the notion of overworking for money, saying, “You can't buy cracked folks. They appreciate money, don’t worship it!”",IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Varun Vummadi ignited a debate on work ethic and work-life balance in the tech industry.

The tithi for the third major holy dip began at 9.14am Sunday and will continue until 6.52pm Monday.Nearly 90 lakh devotees had already taken a dip at Sangam by noon and a much larger turnout is expected Monday when all 13 akharas and Naga sadhus begin their Amrit Snan in phases at dawn.The heightened vigilance follows the tragic stampede on Mauni Amavasya Amrit Snan on Jan 29, which claimed 30 lives and left 60 injured.

The mela area, spanning 44 ghats spread over 4,000 hectares or 40sqkm, has been continuously prepared to regulate crowds. A key aspect of these preparations is Operation 11, a specialised crowd-control plan featuring a one-way traffic system, strategic barricading, and increased police presence at crucial points.To prevent overcrowding, devotees have been advised not to linger at the ghats after bathing or eat food and drinks in the area. Special holding areas have also been set up at key points to manage crowds efficiently.

Tensions in Manipur amid drug crackdown

In a show of solidarity, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh expressed his support for Assam’s fight against illegal opium poppy cultivation , following a significant operation by Assam Police. The destruction of 170 bighas (over 56 acres) of poppy plantations in Goalpara was reported in January, with an estimated value of over Rs 27 crore.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took to X on Sunday, uploading a video of the operation, which saw a tractor racing across the poppy fields with heavy police presence. Sarma issued a stern warning to local drug lords, referencing infamous Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar: ""Dear Local Pablo Escobars, sorry to spoil your planned Udta Assam party,"" he wrote, adding that the poppy crops were destroyed by Goalpara Police.Sarma's post also invoked the 2016 Bollywood film Udta Punjab, which tackled drug addiction.In a supportive message, Manipur CM N Biren Singh expressed his appreciation for the strong actions taken by Assam against the poppy trade. ""We stand together in our shared goal of building a future free from the shadow of drugs,"" Singh wrote. He also noted that Manipur had destroyed over 25 acres of illegal poppy plantations in Tengnoupal subdivision's Khudei Khullen hill range, with a first information report (FIR) filed today.Manipur has been grappling with ethnic violence between the Meitei community and Kuki tribes since May 2023.

Government’s debt management plan

Capital expenditure and growth focus

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday cited India’s “unblemished track record” of fiscal consolidation , even as credit rating agency Moody’s decided not to upgrade the country’s sovereign rating.Sitharaman said that India has never deviated from its fiscal consolidation and debt reduction targets.She also defended the government’s strategy of balancing fiscal prudence with growth, highlighting tax reliefs and a clear debt management plan outlined in the Union Budget for 2024-25.""Despite all these we have shown a commitment and following the commitment to the last word as regards fiscal deficit and the glide path that we should follow,"" Sitharaman said. ""We have, not one year have we failed (to meet our commitment).""Global credit rating agency Moody’s has maintained India’s sovereign rating at “Baa3” with a stable outlook, the lowest investment-grade rating. The agency ruled out an immediate upgrade, citing concerns over the country’s debt burden and fiscal deficit levels.""While we view the government's sustained fiscal discipline and narrower fiscal deficits as credit positive, we don't expect these improvements in the debt burden or 'debt affordability' to be enough to trigger a sovereign rating upgrade at this time,"" Christian de Guzman, Senior Vice President at Moody’s Ratings, told PTI.Moody’s evaluates a country’s creditworthiness, assessing its ability to repay debt. A higher rating generally translates to lower borrowing costs and increased investor confidence, while a lower rating signals higher risks.Sitharaman stressed that India had to borrow more during the Covid-19 pandemic due to global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical conflicts but has remained committed to reducing debt levels.""The government has volunteered to say that it will manage the debt,"" she said, adding that India has been steadily working towards reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio in line with expert recommendations.She also highlighted that while focusing on fiscal discipline, there has been no reduction in public spending on essential sectors such as social welfare, education, and healthcare.She defended the government’s approach to capital expenditure , which has been pegged at Rs11.21 lakh crore for 2024-25, a modest increase from Rs 10.18 lakh crore in the revised estimate for the current fiscal year.""If we are looking at the numbers, because we've got used to 16 per cent, 17 per cent increase (in capital spending) every year from 2020, and saying you have not increased it by that number (in the Budget for 2025-26), I would equally want to ask you to please look at the way in which the quality of spending has happened, particularly capital expenditure,"" she stated.Sitharaman also praised states for effectively utilising the 50-year interest-free loans provided for capital expenditure, contributing to overall infrastructure growth.The spending for the ongoing fiscal was lower than initially budgeted due to a slowdown in expenditure during the general election period. However, Sitharaman remains confident in the government’s strategy of balancing fiscal responsibility with economic expansion.","Sitharaman said that India has never deviated from its fiscal consolidation and debt reduction targets.

Budget paves the way for India-US Harley diplomacy as customs duty on bigger bikes slashed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/budget-paves-the-way-for-india-us-harley-diplomacy-as-customs-duty-on-bigger-bikes-slashed/articleshow/117861538.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of PM Modi’s upcoming visit to the US, the Union Budget may have paved the way for Harley diplomacy between the two countries with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman slashing the import duty on bigger bikes -- the move set to directly benefit the iconic American bike company Harley-Davidson -- paying heed to an often-repeated tariff reduction rant of President Donald Trump.The Budget also seemed to offer benefits for Tesla, the electric vehicle giant run by Trump’s confidant Elon Musk, but this relief appears to be more of a lip service with the effective tax rate remaining the same.On motorcycles, the Budget slashed the customs duty not just for the big bikes with engines above 1600cc, but even the smaller ones, making it a widespread and substantial relief (the move will also benefit other makers such as Honda, Suzuki, Ducati, and KTM).For the 1600cc and above motorcycles, the customs duty was slashed significantly from 50% to 30% for the fully-built imported bikes. For the ones coming in through semi-knocked down (SKD) kits, the duty comes from 25% to 20%, while for the completely-knocked down (CKD) ones, it comes down from the current 15% to 10%.For bikes where the engine is smaller than 1600cc, the customs duty comes down from the existing 50% to 40%. On SKDs, it comes down from 25% to 20%, and for CKDs, it gets reduced from 15% to 10%.The move will see the price of the bigger bikes come down significantly -- by at least a few lakh rupees -- in a direct benefit to the products that are made in the US (Harley is making smaller-engine bikes in India –about 440cc – in partnership with Hero Moto).It is believed that the govt decided to slash the import duty to please the new US administration as President Trump has almost been admonishing various countries, especially China, India and Brazil, for being “tremendous tariff makers”. With Trump threatening that “we’re not going to let that happen any longer”, govts across key trading nations have been looking at ways and means to soothe the nerves.On the other hand, the duty cut for Tesla (and other imported cars) is not tangible in its actual sense.The Budget cut the headline customs duty on imported cars costing upwards of $40,000 (around Rs 35 lakh) from the current 100%, to 70%, a measure that would seemingly benefit a car company like Tesla that has spoken about having a presence in India, but is yet not ready to invest in a local factory.However, while reducing the basic customs duty by 30%, the budget replaced the Social Welfare Surcharge of 10% on the previous customs duty with a 40% Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC).In effect, the cumulative duty on any new car – priced above $40,000 -- that is being imported to India continues to be 110%.So in effect, there is no effective change in duty on the ground in case Musk decides to begin his electric car business in India through the import route.Govt had already welcomed the maverick American businessman with a special electric vehicles manufacturing policy, that many saw as a ‘Tesla package’. The package, which was announced around March last year, promised any company investing over $500 million for a factory with a highly-subsidised 15% import duty for around 8,000 cars annually as they began work for a manufacturing base. However, while the govt waited anxiously, Musk backed out at the last minute, in a big setback to the plans.Will the new lower headline tariffs help India in negotiating better with the US during the trade talks, only time will tell.","The Union Budget may have paved the way for Harley diplomacy between the two countries.

If Kerala is behind other states in education, infrastructure, and social welfare, the Centre will allocate funds accordingly.""Kurian’s comments, made to reporters in the national capital, come amid strong criticism of the Union Budget 2025-26 by both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress in Kerala. The two parties accused the central government of overlooking the state’s critical demands.Vijayan, Balagopal, and Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan expressed their disappointment, claiming that key state demands—including a Rs 24,000 crore special financial package and rehabilitation aid for Wayanad—had been ignored in the budget. The trio described the budget as ""condemnable,"" ""extremely disappointing,"" and ""unfortunate.""The CPI(M) quickly responded, condemning both the Union Budget, presented by Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Kurian’s comments. CPI(M) State Secretary M V Govindan and senior leader E P Jayarajan accused Kurian of adopting an “anti-Kerala” stance in the allocation of funds to the state.The CPI(M) intensified its criticism, alleging that the BJP-led Centre had deliberately sidelined Kerala in the budget, pushing what they termed an “anti-Kerala” agenda. Govindan claimed that despite Kerala’s strong performance in human development, health, and education, the BJP had consistently worked against the state’s interests.“The BJP’s aim is to make Kerala poor and backward. After their failed attempts to tighten their grip on the state, they are now trying to push Kerala backward by denying it the funds it deserves,” Govindan said.Echoing these views, Jayarajan accused the Centre of political discrimination in fund allocations, violating federal principles, and undermining secular values. He called for a united Kerala to protest against Kurian's statement, urging the Centre to recognize India as a united nation where all states are treated equally.“The people of Kerala must unite and protest against the Union minister’s statement that the state must regress in all areas of development to receive central allocations,” Jayarajan said.This criticism follows earlier claims from Kerala’s leadership that the state’s key demands—such as the special financial package and Wayanad rehabilitation aid—were disregarded in the Union Budget.","Kurian's comments come amid strong criticism of the Union Budget 2025-26 by both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress in Kerala.

""It is my dream and expectation that someone from outside the tribal community should be appointed for their welfare. Let a Brahmin or a Naidu take charge—there would be significant change. Likewise, tribal leaders should be given the portfolio for the welfare of forward communities.""He further said that such a change should occur within the democratic system and revealed that he had personally requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allocate the tribal affairs ministry to him. However, he acknowledged that ""certain precedents"" governed portfolio allocations.Currently, BJP leader Jual Oram, a well-known tribal leader from Odisha, heads the ministry of tribal affairs in the Modi-led cabinet.Gopi’s remarks have drawn strong criticism across Kerala, particularly from opposition parties and tribal leaders. CPI state secretary Benoy Viswam condemned the minister’s statements, labeling him a ""piper of the chaturvarna"" ( caste system ) and demanding his removal from the Union ministry.Viswam also called for the resignation of union minister of state George Kurian, accusing him of undermining federal principles and insulting Kerala. Kurian had earlier suggested that Kerala should declare itself backward in education, infrastructure, and social welfare to receive more funds from the Centre.""These two ministers are living examples of the challenges facing the Indian Constitution under the RSS-led BJP regime,"" Viswam said, urging the President, as the custodian of the Constitution, to take the matter seriously.

Will faith 'trump' uncertainty? 'Visa temples' give hope to H1-B applicants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-faith-trump-uncertainty-visa-temples-give-hope-to-h1-b-applicants/articleshow/117841961.cms,"Ashok Sundar had just struck out '108' on the little chequered sheet standing inside the Chilkur Balaji temple - 20km from Hyderabad's skyscraper-studded Financial District. His beaming face, glossy polyester shirt and bright red vermilion tilak running right up to the hairline meant that the ""visa god"" had smiled upon him. Ashok got his passport stamped with H-1B a day earlier and was at the temple to show his gratitude.He leaves for his new tech job in New Jersey in April.There were many Ashoks in the sea of people chanting 'Govinda, Govinda' as they walked around the deity at the temple, less than a fortnight after Donald Trump took over as the 47th President of the US. Since taking office, Trump has threatened to send back ""millions and millions of criminal aliens"", send troops to the southern border, and has even ordered the revoking of citizenship status for children of temporary visa holders. The announcements have sent a chill down the spine of the immigrant community, both within the US and among those anxious to go there.Indians dreaming of a new life in the US are now clinging to faith in the hope of a miracle - whether it is the Chilkur Balaji temple near Hyderabad, the Chamatkari Hanuman temple at Ahmedabad or the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir in Delhi. ""Eleven of us had applied last year,"" says Ashok, after completing his 108th pradakshina (circumambulation) of the temple dedicated to an avatar of Vishnu. ""I am the only one who got the visa. It is only because of Lord Balaji,"" adds the IT executive. He had prayed at the temple after submitting his visa papers in June 2024.Ahmedabad's Chamatkari Hanuman temple, also called 'Visa Hanuman', has swelling crowds during the weekend, with just two prayers on their lips. Either it's ""Lord, please grant me a visa"" or it's ""Lord, thank you for the visa."" The 300-year-old temple has earned a ""visa friendly"" reputation, drawing devotees from as far as J&K and Meghalaya.Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa after the pujari. The applicant is also asked to visit any Hanuman temple once a week and repeat the Hanuman Chalisa. ""It's all about one's 'shraddha'. If there is faith, all things are possible. If doubts creep into one's mind, then one is bound to face disappointment,"" says the priest, adding that he has been witness to instances where a visa has been secured within an hour of conducting the ritual, even after three or four visa denials. One such Ahmedabad resident whose US visa has been rejected once, got to know from friends that praying at the Chamatkari Hanuman temple will work wonders. ""I have complete faith that I will be granted a US visa in my next interview,"" he says, before going through the temple rituals.Down a dusty lane filled with hardware shops stands the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir at Delhi's Neb Sarai. Pandit Narayan Mishra, who has been officiating at the mandir for the last five years, says people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days in their quest for the elusive visa stamp. ""They write their manokamna (wish) on a piece of paper. We take the slip of paper and make the idol 'read it' and chant the mantras. It is then placed in a box next to the deity,"" Mishra says.But what makes people come from across the country to the temple? ""Perhaps because Hanuman is considered the first god to have travelled outside the country to Lanka without any paperwork,"" he adds with a smile. Folklore or an attempt at humour, people in the area attest to the ""magical powers"" of the shrine. ""People come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true. Just last week, an applicant who got his US visa in only two weeks came to the temple for a puja to thank God,"" shares Mishra.Though Andhra software engineer Chandana C confesses to being crestfallen after Trump's success in the elections, she is now hopeful that her 25 visits to the Hyderabad temple in the last 25 months will not go in vain. ""I have been coming here every month since I applied for the visa through a local consultancy. I know things aren't looking bright right now, but I have faith I will eventually get it,"" says the 26-year-old desperate to realise her American dream, just like all her other relatives did.Not just for themselves, some even go through the ritual motions for their beloved kin. Kaushik R, on his 56th pradakshina, says that he is there to pray for his older brother living in North Carolina. ""I am praying that his name is selected in the lottery process, and he gets his H-1B. If all goes well, I will also join the University of Cincinnati for a MS programme later this year,"" says the freshly-minted engineering graduate - pinning his hopes on his talent and Lord Balaji in equal measure. ""But I will pray for myself later. This is for my brother,"" Kaushik adds, before quickly returning to his place in the queue. Right behind him is Ravindra R, who has landed himself his dream job in Texas. There's just one step for him to clear now: the visa interview. ""When I go for it, I know I will have Lord Balaji's blessings with me. Nothing can stop me,"" the IT professional says.With additional reporting from Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad(Applicants' names changed on request)","Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa.

"Complaint filed against Sonia, Rahul, and Priyanka Gandhi over remarks on President Murmu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/complaint-filed-against-sonia-rahul-and-priyanka-gandhi-over-remarks-on-president-murmu/articleshow/117852946.cms,"NEW DELHI: A complaint has been filed against Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over remarks made about President Droupadi Murmu. The complaint, lodged by Muzaffarpur-based lawyer Sudhir Ojha, accuses them of disrespecting India's highest constitutional authority and seeks legal action under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).The case will be heard in a Bihar court on 10 February.The controversy erupted following Sonia Gandhi’s comment after the President’s address to Parliament to mark the beginning of the Budget session. Speaking to reporters, the former Congress chief remarked, “The President was getting very tired by the end… she could hardly speak, poor thing.” Rahul Gandhi, in a separate clip, dismissed the speech as “boring,” while Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present during the exchange.The Rashtrapati Bhavan responded strongly, calling the remarks “unacceptable” and asserting that Murmu was not tired. In an official statement, the President’s office said, “Some prominent leaders of the Congress party have made comments that clearly hurt the dignity of the high office, and therefore are unacceptable.” The statement further clarified that Murmu was fully composed throughout her speech and that speaking for marginalised communities “can never be tiring.”The remarks triggered a sharp political backlash, with the BJP launching an all-out attack against the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the party’s “shahi parivar” (royal family) of insulting Murmu, a tribal leader. Speaking at a rally in Delhi, he said, “One member called her speech ‘boring,’ and another went further, calling her ‘poor’ and ‘tired.’ This is an insult to 10 crore tribal brothers and sisters and every poor person who has risen from the ground.” BJP chief JP Nadda also criticised Sonia Gandhi’s choice of words, calling them “deeply disrespectful.”Several NDA ministers demanded an apology from Sonia Gandhi, with Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju leading the charge. “The Congress must apologise to the nation and the President for this insult,” Rijiju said.Congress leaders, however, defended Sonia Gandhi, alleging that the BJP was twisting her words for political gain. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge countered by pointing out that the government had disrespected President Murmu by not inviting her to the inauguration of the new Parliament building and the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “The BJP had deliberately kept our current President and the previous President away from these historic moments,” Kharge said.Priyanka Gandhi also came to her mother’s defence, insisting that Sonia Gandhi had the “utmost respect” for Murmu and that her comments were being misrepresented. “My mother simply said that the President must have been tired after such a long speech. It is unfortunate that the media twisted her words,” she stated.As the political storm intensifies, the Bihar court’s decision on 10 February will determine the legal course of action against the Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the controversy continues to be a focal point in the BJP’s ongoing campaign against the opposition.","Complaint filed against Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

There was a huge crowd of advocates for an important case preceding my case. I struggled through the crowd and reached the front row to seek a Passover. But my vocal cord failed me. I struggled to make the request to the CJI,” he said.Apart from his legal acumen, he was known for his lighter vein comments to diffuse tense debates inside the courtroom, especially in sensitive and important issues before constitution benches. So much so that, CJI D Y Chandrachud always gave him the opportunity to speak the last word, which invariably was a joke rhyming with the issue.CJI Khanna modified Sibal’s statement that Justice Roy was a complete judge. The CJi said Justice Roy was a complete man, as apart from legal knowledge, reasonableness and a sense of justice, he was an allrounder being a voracious reader and golfer. Justice Kumar said Justice Roy was a champion hockey player and a footballer for DPS during his school days.

Army gearing up to induct more heavy-duty drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-gearing-up-to-induct-more-heavy-duty-drones/articleshow/117847274.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army is chalking out a long-term roadmap to expand its fleet of heavy-duty drones for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) as well as precision-strike missions, with their sheer operational utility being reinforced by the Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan conflicts amid the ongoing shift towards unmanned and autonomous technologies in modern warfare.The force is basically looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions, fly at altitudes over 30,000-feet to evade detection, and have an endurance of over 24 hours at a stretch, top sources told TOI on Thursday.As per estimates, China has well over 2,000 top-notch UAVs, which includes combat drones like the Cai Hong-4, CH-5, CH-7, Wing Loong-II and the stealthy Hongdu GJ-11 `Sharp Sword’.China is also the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs , and has stepped up supply of the armed CH-4 and Wing Loong-II drones to Pakistan, which in turn has around 150-200 drones, including the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci drones.The Indian Army, in contrast, has only around 50 Israeli-origin Heron Mark-I and Mark-II as well as Searcher-II medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drones. Amid the military standoff with China, the force inducted four new satcom-enabled Heron Mark-II drones to boost surveillance along the Line of Actual Control.While the Army Aviation Corps operates these fighter-size UAVs for surveillance and precision-targeting, infantry battalions use a wide array of smaller drones for tactical reconnaissance, logistics and other tasks.While IAF and Navy have their own UAV fleets, there is an overall requirement of at least 150 new MALE drones for the three Services. Towards this end, the Army is focusing on indigenous development of MALE drones by DRDO as well as private sector companies, including through collaboration with friendly countries.DRDO has developed the Rustom series of UAVs, including the Tapas-BH-201 drone but it failed to fully meet operational military requirements, as was first reported by TOI. “Efforts are now underway to enhance the capabilities of Tapas,” a source said.The first flight of Archer-NG, a weaponised MALE drone developed by DRDO, in turn, is expected soon. With a maximum altitude of 30,000-feet, the UAV can carry 300 kg of payload, including anti-tank guided missiles and smart anti-airfield weapons. “With a 1,000-km range, Archer-NG is designed for ISR missions, target acquisition and precision-strikes,” he added.In the arena of the much more capable high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) drones, the armed forces of course will get 31 armed MQ-9B `Predators’ under the Rs 32,350 crore contract inked with the US last Oct. The delivery of these drones, armed with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs and other weapons, will begin in 2029.“The Army also needs advanced MALE drones because of the two long `active’ borders with China and Pakistan, both of which require continuous real-time intelligence-gathering and monitoring,” another source said.“UAVs and RPA systems reduce risk to soldiers, allow longer operational endurance and provide precision-strike capabilities. They also enhance counter-terrorism operations by tracking cross-border infiltrations and carrying out strikes on terrorist hideouts,” he added.","The force is looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions.

Even just 10-12 years ago, during the Congress era, if you had a salary of Rs 12 lakh, Rs 2,60,000 would have gone as tax. But after yesterday's BJP government budget, those earning Rs 12 lakh will not have to pay a single rupee in tax,"" PM Modi highlighted.Launching an attack on the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, PM Modi accused it of making false promises and indulging in corruption, which he claimed has led to the closure of factories in the capital. He warned that those responsible for ""looting the people"" would be held accountable.""While on one hand is 'AAP-da', which stands for false promises, on the other is 'Modi’s guarantees',"" he said, taking a swipe at the ruling party.PM Modi also linked the Budget’s welfare measures to his broader governance vision, stating that his government at the Centre has focused on strengthening four key pillars: the poor, farmers, youth, and women. He asserted that the Budget reflects his commitment to fulfilling these guarantees.PM Modi expressed confidence in the BJP's victory, asserting that Delhi has suffered under AAP rule for 11 years and now seeks a ""double-engine government"" that prioritizes development. He assured that under a BJP-led government, no slum would be demolished, nor would any welfare schemes be discontinued.""You can note it down: the BJP government will be formed in Delhi on February 8, and by March 8, on International Women’s Day, women will start receiving Rs 2,500,"" he stated, highlighting BJP’s welfare promises, particularly for senior citizens and women.PM Modi also sought to connect with the significant Purvanchali population in Delhi, referencing his Lok Sabha constituency, Varanasi, and reaffirming the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's commitment to Bihar’s development through various Budget proposals.PM Modi reiterated that his government makes decisions in alignment with their aspirations. He highlighted the Budget’s focus on employment-generating sectors such as tourism and manufacturing, emphasizing that these initiatives would directly benefit the youth.Taking a jibe at AAP leader and former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, PM Modi said, ""Those who live in 'sheesh mahal' (glass palaces) cannot relate to a poor family's jhuggi or a middle-class family’s 2BHK flat."" He accused AAP of corruption in every sector, including healthcare, and claimed that even AAP leaders, including sitting MLAs denied tickets for the elections, were deserting the party due to growing public resentment.""Feeling jittery, the AAP is making false announcements every day,"" he added.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lauded the Union Budget, calling it the ""most middle class friendly Budget in India's history"" PM Modi pointed out the significant relief offered to those earning up to Rs 12 lakh, saying that such benefits have never been granted since India’s Independence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117857489,imgsize-905232,width-400,resizemode-4/117857489.jpg"

MUMBAI: As 18 of 140 patients with the debilitating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), are on ventilator support in Pune, there is some cold comfort in knowing this isn't the worst outbreak in the world - yet. It could, however, be considered one of the largest GBS outbreaks as medical literature classified 30 to 50 cases as an outbreak until 2019 when Peru registered the worst flare-up.The South American country had 1,120 cases in 2019, with 683 cases reported in two months.Its annual caseload stood at 59 in 2017 and rose to 262 in 2018 before peaking in 2019. Cases were recorded from across the country, but there is little data on deaths. The story didn't end there; Peru witnessed an outbreak again in 2023, when 130 suspected cases were reported between June 10 and July 15.The problem with GBS, as a professor of medicine in a medical college in Mumbai said, is that it is an autoimmune condition that technically doesn't seem like an epidemic-causing condition. ""GBS has been seen as an independent disorder that is sporadically seen across the country, but we now need to change our mindset and accept it can emerge as an outbreak and study it epidemiologically to look for links between the patients,"" he said.The only link between Peru and Pune is microbe Campylobacter jejuni . Smaller studies from across the world show GBS following this infection is linked with higher disability and mortality rates.GBS has been so rare - India has a reported annual incidence of 1.75 to 2 per lakh population - that there are few in-depth studies. The first-ever detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of GBS was conducted in 2021. Using data between 1990 and 2019, the analysis showed that Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Mexico had much higher than expected burdens, while countries and territories such as China, Fiji, Taiwan, and Guam had much lower than expected burdens.","18 of 140 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome are on ventilator support in Pune.

explained the macroeconomic context of her

to TOI's Diwakar & Surojit Gupta. In an exclusive interview, she rejected the criticism that the concessions would further shrink the tax base, while asserting that strong fundamentals would help the economy weather global uncertainties

Through income-tax relief, you appear to betting on rise in consumption. Was that the only consideration?

And spurring consumption could be a byproduct?

The salaried middle classes keep complaining that while they honestly pay taxes, they do not get bang for their buck because they do not get to use public schools or hospitals, there is no unemployment benefit or pension. How do you view this criticism?

How do you see the prospect of growth in the immediate term, given the global uncertainties?

How do you plan to provide relief to those who are outside the ambit of this tax relief. For example, in rural and urban centres?

Also Read:

Commentators have expressed concern over capex allocation.

There has been worry about the private sector not investing. What is holding them back?

The Economic Survey also spoke about wage growth not keeping pace with rise in corporate profits. How much does that have to do with weak demand?

They are also not passing on their profits to their employees and that has created this wage stagnation.

Privatisation of state-run companies has slowed down. Do you see the process taking off?

What other initiatives does the govt have in mind for creating jobs?

But there is criticism that quality employment is not being created.

India needs industrial growth as well as agricultural growth, but rural India is witnessing migration and now, we increasingly have only the elderly in villages.

There are worries about inflation.

What about fuel rates?

Is there any possibility of bringing fuel under GST?

Will GST rates be rationalised, particularly of essential commodities?

Will the Centre nudge states towards that end?

Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time... (On customs duty) We have been engaged in rationalisation for the past 2 years. We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new(Trump) regime coming in and our rationalisation Sitharaman

You were already having to deal with a lot of uncertainties. Now, you have a new factor in the unpredictable US President, Donald Trump. It has been said that the Budget did not factor in the Trump presidency.

What is going to be the mandate for the committee on deregulation that you have talked about?

You have pursued a new IT law since July. Will the changes be limited to simplification of language or go beyond?

In your speech, you hinted at a culture shift, saying the authorities have to first trust the assessee and then only scrutinise. Right now, the presumption, at least in practice, seems to be that you are guilty unless proven innocent. Will the bill shift the onus?

You have reduced customs duty on premium bikes. Is it a signal to the new US administration?

When do you plan to introduce the insurance bill?

You have followed the path of fiscal consolidation. Do we have the firepower in case the global situation turns adverse?

There is concern about the shrinking tax base which has further shrunk after the latest concessions. How do you see that? It is said the narrow tax base will lead to a longterm problem.

The finance ministry had very strong views on Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). You have now signalled a revamp. What is the intent behind this?

An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up Sitharaman

The focus on Bihar has been linked to elections which are due in Nov. So, was it the only consideration?

The govt has been fiscally prudent. When you spoke to the PM on the tax relief issue, what was his response

You have announced an asset monetisation plan. How will that proceed?

Will it cover the pending ones like

Hotel Ashok

, Stadia?

What about the choice of a sari with Madhubani art on Budget day?

The main consideration was that we should honour taxpayers, honest taxpayers who have been contributing to nation building.It can be. It can boost savings too.I also wish public services moved commensurately, but they are not just in the central govt’s hands. They are also in the local bodies’ hands, and in the state govt’s hands. There are elected representatives in all these places. They are all not run by the central govt. But I do sincerely wish that they improved for the sake of people.The World Bank and the IMF have clearly indicated that India will continue to be the fastest growing economy and despite all the odds and challenges resulting from extraneous reasons, we still have a very buoyant, strong economy. Our macroeconomic fundamentals are very strong. So, our growth will continue.We have several schemes to provide them relief such as Kisan Credit Card, whose limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Another Rs 50 crore will be brought in the ambit of the revamped Stand-Up India loans. Banks are giving record number of loans at discounted rates for affordable housing, while start-ups are getting another Rs 10,000 crore through the Fund of Funds. More than 2 lakh start-ups had registered for the hand-holding assistance in 2016. So, each sector has got affordable credit. At the grassroots, SHGs are getting a corpus for doing business.We will continue with our public sector expenditure. Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time.It is a commercial decision, which industries have to take as to when they want to get into the market to expand their capacity or build new capacities. So, beyond this, I may not be in a position to answer.Is true that after corporate tax rate was brought down in 2019, a lot of cleaning up of the books has happened. The twin balance sheet problem between companies and banks has been addressed. So, the companies are, I'm told, making profits but probably keeping it as passive investments, earning interest on the money but yet not feeling that at this time, it is adequate or proper for them to invest and expand capacities. So, they may take a call depending on how demand and export possibilities arise. It's also true that globally, exports are facing challenges and they want the pace of growth of exports to pick up a lot more, even that would be part of their considerations for taking the call.That's the point which the chief economic advisor has made.Privatisation will happen at least for those for which have been cleared by the cabinet. It’s quite a long list. We'll have to keep those units running profitably, professionally, to ensure they are vibrant units. We cannot neglect them just because they were put on the disinvestment list. We have been taking steps and that’s why many of the companies have now got good valuations; whether they are listed or not, at least they are being run professionally. Just as disinvestment is my responsibility, I am also responsible for keeping them in robust health. That’s what we are doing.The July Budget came up with five different schemes, four of which looked at employment generation in MSMEs and also in large corporations for which the govt scheme would come and support in terms of EPFO registration and so on. Of the five schemes, one was aimed at giving internship opportunities in top 500 companies. The pilot run of Phase 1 is over, the second pilot has begun; and so, the internship scheme is moving and students and young adults from very distant areas are benefitting without having to move out of their district. They are being placed with companies in their own districts. There are some who, by choice, want to go to Bengaluru or to Haryana, to Gurgaon or any other place. And have located them as well. They are all going through their internship. Besides that, Rozgar Melas are filling up all the vacant positions in the govt. In this Budget, which I've given for the leather industry, toy sector, for textiles, for critical minerals, for lithium ion batteries, I have already made enough number of announcements which are all labour intensive.Companies are in search of skilled workers. They tell me I want these many people with such skill sets. Job positions are available. The issue also is how many youth are available with required skill sets? Expectations are not being fulfilled because of this mismatch. Companies are not able to get such workers and those who have the skill sets are not able to reach the companies. We are trying to find a way to provide some exposure. We are working on this. Actually, this internship scheme is also about telling people what kind of jobs are available.Agricultural growth has been steady all over the country. Even during Covid, agriculture contributed significantly to India's GDP. In this Budget, we have provided two schemes for promoting rural livelihood and prosperity. The PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana has so many components that it should ensure that migration becomes an option rather than a compulsion. If you are getting an opportunity, there is no need for them to go out. If we create lots of opportunities, as the PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana intends to do, in rural districts with low productivity, by using high yielding and hybrid seeds, then they will find jobs there itself. They can be helped also by better handholding for marketing, and by value addition for those products.Inflation is not going up, it’s coming down. The data is released every month. Inflation is something which both the Reserve Bank of India and the Govt of India continuously monitor and try to bring down. Prices of products go up because of input costs and it is something which affects the entire buyer and seller market. But govt takes supply side measures to ensure adequate availability of goods, even perishable ones.State govts play a role. The data on inflation in states clearly shows those states which have not cut fuel prices are the ones who are suffering from higher inflation.GST Council turned down the suggestion. We suggested that at least aviation turbine fuel can be brought under GST and petrol and diesel remain outside, but state finance ministers did not agree. So, the question should be put to the state finance ministers, not to me.There is a discussion going on in the GST Council. We will let you know once they take the call.Centre is part of the GST Council and our inputs go into the eventual decision... meaning we'll discuss. The Centre's viewpoint will also go into it.You answered the question yourself. We will not get to know what the US administration or, for that matter, any other administration in the world is going to do about India unless they take a call. So, what exactly should I prepare for? We can only be mindful of and watchful about it. But what action can I take when there is no announcement about anything concerning India?Well, the details will be worked out, but they include items like, when licences have to be given or inspections are to be conducted or a certificate has to be issued for a product of a certain standard. Currently, there is lack of clarity. The industry or the manufacturers are asked one thing at one point in time, and quite another at some other point. The overall sense is that there is not a common approach; no SOP even if there is one. Manufacturers too have concerns about regulators. So, should there be a way to approach a problem from a manufacturer's point of view, from a trader’s point of view. So that we can go beyond merely saying ‘oh no, here is my rule and you have to follow’. Else, you are not going to get the licence. Another fellow says that I have to inspect you. And there is yet another who says I have to visit you each month. Such things are completely avoidable. So we want to bring some coherence in the way this is handled.It will be a comprehensive approach to making the Income Tax Act relevant to the 21st century; relevant to an era which is technology-driven; relevant to times where the taxpayer is most often doing the assessment and filing himself. So, for a citizen to be able to deal with income tax on his own, the system should be simple enough for him to handle. It is also something we are working on because of the looseness and ambiguity of language. There are also several issues in courts where both sides appear to be right. That is because of the language used in the Act. And why should it be like that? The Act came in 1965 and India has since seen major changes; in 1991, the economy opened up, liberalization came in. Then, in 2020, Covid struck. So many changes have happened, and there have only been additions to the Act in response. Are they all consistent? Are the additions aligned with the original intent of the law? All of this has necessitated a comprehensive relook.Even now, when it comes to the question of this Budget proposal on the people who have more than one residence or one house, we have said that selfdeclaration, whether one is being used for personal purpose or whether one has been rented out is fine with us. It is for the tax assessee to say what he wants to say, and for us his word is final. That is already on.Trust is what we want and, therefore, trust is what we are trying to use as a first step. Self-declaration, yes, trust is the first thing.We have been engaged in rationalisation of customs duty for the past two years We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new regime coming in and our work on rationalisation.We will let you know once we have something on this. At the moment, I have said that we will be bringing the income tax bill this week.Our fundamentals are strong even now. So my fiscal deficit is continuously assessed. The deficit number is given in the glide path and that is what I am following. Not one single year have I failed. And that would not be possible if my fundamentals were not strong.So, is it wiser to keep loading the narrow base with taxes because that is the only set of people I have for paying taxes? Even that's not right. Therefore, we have said that we need to give relief. We will give relief because that's honouring the taxpayer and he has been contributing all the while. But it is also equally upon us to widen the tax base and keep newer people coming in who have not been earlier paying taxes, who are probably in the tax payable net. So, we will draw them in.We want to have the draft BIT to be a bit more investor friendly. That’s why I want to do it.In the July Budget too, we announced schemes for Bihar when elections were not on the horizon. An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. That is why we revived fertiliser plants in the region. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up. Bihar is part of the Buddhist tourism circuit but lacks a big international airport. Is giving it one greenfield airport an excess? I am surprised by the criticism. I don't think we need an opposition which is opposed to the progress of such a state. They should say openly that they are against Bihar's development. Don't do anything for Bihar because we don't want you to develop Bihar, is this what they are trying to say? The PM has repeatedly said that a state needs to improve irrespective of the party in office. Else, it will become a drag and pull you down. So, I'm happy we are doing this.Right from the beginning, his guidance was to find out how you would be able do it , what is going to be the formulation and, so, we worked with the department of revenue, CBDT and only then went with the proposal. Various different.The first plan went well and we are bringing the second edition and under that we will plough back about Rs 10 lakh crore under that and I have mentioned this in the budget speech. We will take it forward.I wouldn't name individual items but yes it will cover a whole lot of sectors.This is a very interesting story. I had gone to Madhubani in Nov when I was introduced to Dulari Devi, who is known for her paintings. She belongs to the fishing community, an EBC, and she gave this sari to me and told me to wear it on Budget day. I offered to pay but she would not let me. She said it is our custom to give sari and other gifts when a daughter visits home. On Budget day, I remembered her and so....",FM Sitharaman explains the macroeconomic context of her Budget. She rejects the criticism that the concessions would further shrink the tax base. She asserts that strong fundamentals would help the economy weather global uncertainties.

"Most pro-middle class Budget in history, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/most-pro-middle-class-budget-in-history-says-pm-modi/articleshow/117870756.cms,"NEW DELHI: Exuding confidence about BJP 's prospects in Delhi polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Union Budget presented a day earlier ""the most pro-middle class in India's history"", highlighted measures announced by the finance minister and wooed govt employees by pointing to the announcement of the new Pay Commission.""See you at the victory celebrations on Feb 8,"" Modi said, as he addressed a public meeting, his last before the polls, in the middle-class colony of R K Puram on Sunday, claiming that AAP was headed for a defeat. ""Today is Basant Panchami. With Basant Panchami, the weather starts to change. In three days, on Feb 5, a new spring of development is about to arrive in Delhi. AAP-da party of Delhi has ruined the last 11 years here. Now, let's not allow them to ruin the next five years,"" he said.In a hardsell of the middle class-friendly budget, Modi said, ""Earlier, the country's hard-earned money went into scams, and a few people pocketed it. But BJP govt is dedicating this budget for the welfare of citizens. To build a 'Viksit Bharat', I gave guarantees to strengthen four key pillars - farmers, youth, poor and women. This budget ensures that my guarantees are fulfilled.""He made a jibe at AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal who is engaged in an outreach to the middle class . ""Those who live in 'Sheesh Mahal' can't relate to the jhuggis of the poor or the 2BHKs of the middle classs,"" he said.Stating that only BJP respected the middle class, Modi said, ""I want to present a picture to you. If you earned Rs 12 lakh during the time of Nehru, the govt would take back one-fourth of your salary as tax. Under Indira Gandhi's govt, Rs 2 lakh of it would go in taxes. Even 10-12 years ago, under Congress govt, if you earned Rs 12 lakh, you would have to return Rs 2,60,000. But now, under BJP govt, someone earning Rs 12 lakh won't have to pay a single rupee in extra tax.""Modi also made a pitch for govt employees who are an important part of the electorate in the South Delhi constituency. ""After the setting up of the 8th Pay Commission, salaries of govt employees and who help me implement plans for the development and pensions of those who have retired, are going to rise.""Targeting AAP, the PM accused the party of spreading falsehoods. ""No jhuggis will be demolished in Delhi and no welfare schemes will be shut if BJP comes to office,"" he said, as the crowd erupted in cheers. The air was filled with chants of 'Modi hai toh mumkin hai' and 'Bharat Mata ki jai'.Calling Kejriwal's party AAP-da (disaster) once again, the PM said, ""Even before voting in Delhi, the jhaadu (AAP symbol) is falling apart as AAP-da leaders are abandoning it, realising the growing discontent among the people.""""People from AAP-da even indulge in scams with your treatment and medicine... they loot you. I promise, those who looted Delhi will have to return what they've taken. AAP has given Delhi diseases - pollution is causing harm, respiratory diseases are on the rise, and look at the state of the Yamuna. There is no section of society that hasn't been negatively impacted. The BJP govt will bring an end to all of this. This is Modi's guarantee,"" he added.In the middle of the address, the PM paused twice to admire sketches made by children in the crowd. The kids were holding up their artwork for him, prompting him to ask them their names and addresses so he could write to them.Reaching out to people from Poorvanchal, the PM said, ""Poorvanchalis made me an MP, they also made me the PM. But AAP and Congress have a problem with them. They work in Delhi and contribute to its development. But when Covid hit, AAP spread lies and forced our brothers and sisters from Poorvanchal to leave Delhi. The BJP govt will support the people of Poorvanchal in every possible way.""","PM Narendra Modi addressed a public meeting, his last before the polls, in the middle-class colony of R K Puram on Sunday.

"Terror kingpin deported from Philippines to India, arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/terror-kingpin-deported-from-philippines-to-india-arrested/articleshow/117869656.cms,"NEW DELHI: July 8, 2024. It was unusually rainy, hot and humid that night in Bacolod City, Philippines. The Bureau of Immigration assembled a crack team of select agents from their Fugitive Search Unit (FSU) to hunt down a high-value suspect. The target was an ""Indian-Nepalese"" national, the subject of a red-corner notice, located by Indian agencies in their country.The subject, Joginder Gyong, 41, was described as a ranking kingpin of a separatist terror group and a wanted criminal in India. He was tipped to be hiding in an apartment in Barangay Tackling locality in Bacolod. The police in Delhi and central agencies identified the alias ""Kanta Gupta"" that Geong was using to stay undercover.Acting on real-time information from their Indian counterparts, the FSU sleuths carried out a clean operation, apprehending their suspect in an ""in-and-out"" sweep.However, this was just the beginning of a tedious process of getting a fugitive back. Delhi Police 's Special Cell, CBI, Intelligence Bureau and Haryana Police followed Geong closely for months. As deportation proceedings began, Geong was detained at BI warden facility in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, in high security. There was a chance that Khalistan groups could try to free him.It took almost six months for the Indian authorities to get hold of Geong as he was flown in from Manila to Bangkok two days ago and, finally, to India, where he was arrested by Delhi Police's Special Cell early on Sunday.The events started to unfold early in 2024 when Indian agency sleuths shared information with their counterparts in Manila, said a source. The immigration subsequently issued a 'mission order' for Geong's arrest. Geong was heading an organised crime syndicate and was sentenced to life imprisonment in India. After cops got hot on his trail, Geong fled to the Philippines, where he assumed a fake identity and re-established his gang. Interestingly, he fled to South Africa in mid-2000 and was deported in 2007 too.""He is the younger brother of Surender Geong, who died in an exchange of fire with Haryana Police in 2018. Geong spread his tentacles in Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal, Gurgaon and Delhi and was attempting to re-establish a network for extorting money from doctors, contractors, liquor vendors and other financially well-off businessmen,"" said a senior cop.After settling down in the Philippines, he reorganised his gang and started his criminal enterprise and further got fully involved in the terror network of Arsh Dalla, a designated and wanted terrorist of KTF.The Davinder Bambhia gang, currently operated by wanted fugitive Lucky Patial, also came on board, having a fraternal relationship with Kaushal Chaudhary's gang. Soon, Geong rose to be a key planner and organiser of manpower, harbouring fugitives and moving narcotics and weapons as a logistical hub to facilitate the activities of these criminal networks.This network then carried out sensational killings of Youth Akal Dal leader Vicky Midhukhera, Gurlal Brar and Kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian in recent years. According to police, Geong's criminal history spans 24 cases, with convictions in 15 cases, including five murder cases. A reward of Rs 1.5 lakh was declared on him.Geong's arrest is expected to reveal new information about the terror-criminal nexus, their international connections, and potential links with hostile foreign entities.""The arrest marks a major milestone in the collaboration between Delhi and Haryana Police forces to combat the terrorist-gangster nexus with help from central agencies,"" said Additional Commissioner (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha. A team comprising Inspector Maan Singh and ACP Ved Prakash are interrogating Geong in custody at present.","Joginder Gyong, 41, was described as a ranking kingpin of a separatist terror group.

In an exclusive interview to TOI, a day after she presented her 8th consecutive Union Budget, Sitharaman asserted that the tax relief unveiled by her was meant to honour the honest taxpayer. She said it was not wise to keep loading the narrow tax base with taxes. ""But it is also equally upon us to widen the base and keep newer people coming in,"" she added.On the proposed revamp of the I-T Act, she said, ""It will be a comprehensive approach to making it relevant to the 21st century, to an era which is technology-driven, where the taxpayer is most often doing it himself. For a citizen to be able to deal with the income tax on his own, the system should be simple enough for him to handle. This is what we are working towards.""She added that the effort was also to build trust between the tax department and the taxpayer and detailed several measures unveiled in the Budget towards that end.Sitharaman said govt would implement the 8th Pay Commission from Jan 1, 2026.

"Barbed wire to blue indigo, Indian art shines at Art Dubai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/barbed-wire-to-blue-indigo-indian-art-shines-at-art-dubai/articleshow/120918047.cms,"Gallery espace showed Manjunath Kamath's wor among others

<p>Artist Imran Qureshi and Alserkal director Nada Raza<br></p>

With M F Husain becoming the first Indian artist to have broken the Rs 100 crore barrier in March, it was fitting that his works created a buzz in the only other place he called home. At this year’s Art Dubai , DAG curated a solo booth of his works that showcased not just his trademark horses but also his versatility.While Husain shone brightly in the Modern masters section, Indian contemporary art , too, proved that it could draw collectors, not just in India but across the world.Priyanka Raja, founder of Experimenter which started in Kolkata and has since expanded to Mumbai, said the gallery had its best opening day in Art Dubai's almost two-decade history, selling over 80 per cent of their presentation in the first hours to institutions and private collections in the US, Europe and West Asia.Experimenter was one of 11 Indian galleries which had booths at the fair that has set itself apart from other global offerings with its mix of grit and glamour. Where else will you see Palestinian artists, whose works tell stories of displacement and grief? Or a cutting-edge digital section that shows you new ways in which art and technology can intersect? “At most fairs, you see the same works and the same people but not here,” points out Art Dubai’s executive director Benedetta Ghione.Though its many skyscrapers have their windows tightly shut and almost no one is drying their chaddi-banians on the balcony, Dubai still feels like home to visiting Indians like me. Familiar faces, a familiar khichdi of accents and flavours, and even in the curated environs of an art fair, themes that resonate.At the booth of Gallery Espace , artist Ishita Chakraborty uses barbed wire as a metaphor for the struggles and challenges of migrants while veteran and eternally playful Manjunath Kamath creates a fictional language while referencing temple art, Yakshagana plays and Indian epics.Right opposite was Blueprint12 which dedicated an entire booth to the works of textile artist Kaimurai whose indigo hues have a deeply meditative quality. “Though I live in Bengaluru, I have spent many years in Chennai and Carnatic music has a deep influence on my art,” says Abhishek Ganesh who goes by the name Kaimurai. Though Blueprint12, a gallery from Delhi, was a first-time participant at the fair, it almost sold out Kaimurai’s works.Within hours of the VIP preview opening, several works had been snapped up at Shrine Empire’s booth as well. And these were not the usual ‘pretty pictures’ that sell well with buyers who want artworks that go with the décor rather than raise uncomfortable questions. One of the highlights of the booth was work by the self-taught artist duo of Baaran and Moonis Ijlal who captured the stories of women who lived through the partition of 1947.Shrine Empire, co-founded by Shefali Somani and Anahita Taneja, like many of the Indian galleries showed not just Indian artists but from across South Asia. And this wasn’t their first time. Long before demand for Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi art took off, the gallery has been championing artists like Anoli Perera and Tayeba Begum Lipi.Mumbai gallery Jhaveri Contemporary’s booth showed how diverse and rich South Asian art is. There was Ali Kazim from Lahore whose brushwork reminds of the finesse of miniature paintings, Sri Lankan Lionel Wendt’s photographs, Marseille-based Vasantha Yogananthan’s Ramayana-inspired works and much more.And the exchange went both ways with global galleries showing Indian artists. One of them was Galleria Continua from Paris, which has had a long relationship with Indian artists such as Subodh and Shilpa Gupta as well as British-Indian artist Anish Kapoor, and shows them at many international fairs.But there was more outside the fair too. Imagine getting to plonk on a humble charpai in hipsterized Alserkal Avenue, one of Dubai’s buzzy art districts where the trendy come to down matcha smoothies and avocado toast. Except that this was no ordinary cot but a vital piece of Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi’s installation supported by an Indian gallery and the Dubai-based Alserkal Arts Foundation. Nada Raza, director of Alserkal Arts Foundation who put together the show, says the exhibition came together through sheer serendipity.“Nature Morte gallery had been waiting for the opportunity to support a major international exhibition for Imran. Imran happened to be in Dubai more often because of his cultural Golden Visa. So, it’s an Indo-Pak collaboration amongst old friends who’ve had the opportunity to find a generous home at Alserkal Avenue. It’s a real Dubai story,” she says.The layered charpai work resonated not only with the artsy crowd but also with the workers installing the show, most of whom were South Asian migrants. “When we were done installing, the crew spontaneously gathered round and asked for a photo with Imran bhai. I then found two of the installers looking carefully at the photographs together and having a pretty intense discussion,"" says Raza, adding that she also found people just sitting on stools that are part of the installation to grab a moment of respite.Walk a few metres into Ishara Art Foundation’s space and there was Mumbai artist Shilpa Gupta with her first solo in West Asia, reminding you of the arbitrariness of border walls with these evocative lines: ‘I tried very hard to cut the sky in half, one half for my lover and the other half for me, but the sky kept moving and clouds from his territory came into mine…’ Gupta’s work might be spare relying largely on lines and maps to question how nation-states exert control. In a darkened room, microphones recite the lines of silenced and dissident poets. ‘Hum Dekhenge’ by Faiz Ahmed Faiz floats through the air, an anthem of protest that reminds you that tyranny can be fought in many ways.","M F Husain became the first Indian artist to have broken the Rs 100 crore barrier in March.

Modi-Putin phone call

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday credited party stalwarts and former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi for laying the groundwork for India's close ties with Russia, a day after a phone call by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Pahalgam terrorist attack .""Today Russia stands with India, and this is the result of a foreign policy which has been followed by every government,"" Congress spokesperson Shrinate told news agency ANI.""The foundation of this foreign policy was laid by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Today India has good relations with Russia, and this is the contribution of Pandit Nehru and Indira Gandhi,"" she added.The ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, Shrinate said, is ""more a fight between humanity and inhumanity.""""This is more a fight between humanity and inhumanity than India and Pakistan, which keeps giving protection to anti-India forces. PM Modi should give a befitting reply to such forces,"" she stated.On Monday, Putin spoke to PM Modi and ""strongly condemned"" the Pahalgam attack, in which 26 male tourists were gunned down by Pakistan-backed terrorists on April 22.The Russian leader also expressed his country's ""full support"" to India in the fight against terrorism, according to a statement by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).Putin further emphasised that the Pahalgam perpetrators and their supporters ""must be brought to justice.""The MEA also noted that during the conversation, both leaders reiterated their commitment to deepen the India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership.PM Modi was to visit Russia for the May 9 Victory Parade in Moscow. It was later decided that defence minister Rajnath Singh would attend the parade on India's behalf.However, now Singh, too, is unlikely to go to Moscow.

NEW DELHI: Pakistani troops fired without provocation in eight forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, violating ceasefire agreements, news agency ANI reported. Meanwhile, Army responded to the firing in a ""proportionate manner."" This is the 12th straight night of such firing along the LoC, amid tensions between India and Pakistan after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people.""During the night of 05-06 May 2025, Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked small-arms firing from posts across the Line of Control in areas opposite Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani and Akhnoor in J&K,"" a defence spokesperson was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.""Indian Army responded in proportionate manner:"" he said.The firing began in five border aread – Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani and Akhnoor – during the night.Since April 24, just after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty following the Pahalgam terror attack , Pakistan has been firing in different areas along the LoC, starting from the Kashmir valley.On April 24, Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian aircraft, shut the Wagah border crossing, stopped trade with India, and warned that any move by India to divert water from the Indus River system would be treated as an ""Act of War.""These firings have affected the ceasefire agreement from February 2021, with several violations reported in many sectors along the 740-km LoC.In February 2021, India and Pakistan had agreed to follow the 2003 ceasefire understanding to keep peace along the LoC.Moreover, as tensions between India and Pakistan grow, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) held a closed-door meeting where representatives urged both sides to exercise restraint and engage in dialogue.The 15-member Council met for about an hour and a half on Monday afternoon, but did not release any official statement following the discussion.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry has directed all states to carry out mock drills on Wednesday due to ""new and complex threats"" that have emerged following increased tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack.As per a communication from the ministry, the drills will involve activating air-raid warning sirens, training civilians in civil defence to help them protect themselves during a ""hostile attack,"" and cleaning existing bunkers and trenches.India shares a 3,323 km-long border with Pakistan, divided into three parts: the International Border (IB) of about 2,400 km from Gujarat to Akhnoor in Jammu; the Line of Control (LoC) of 740 km from Jammu to Leh; and the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) of 110 km in the Siachen area, from NJ 9842 to Indira Col.On April 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged strong action against those responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack, saying the terrorists and their conspirators would be punished in ways beyond their imagination. He asserted that the attackers had not just targeted unarmed tourists, but had challenged the very soul of India.During a high-level meeting with senior defence officials on April 29, PM Modi said that the armed forces have full operational freedom to choose how, when, and where to respond to the attack, news agency PTI reported quoting government sources.","Pakistani troops fired without provocation in eight forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.

Prolonged tension to hurt Pakistan's economy: Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prolonged-tension-to-hurt-pak-eco-moodys/articleshow/120913946.cms,"NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses. We assume that flare-ups will occur periodically... but that they will not lead to an outright military conflict.""","A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability.

BENGALURU: While Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) lit up Chinnaswamy Stadium with high-octane cricket action Saturday, drama of a different kind unfolded off the pitch - right inside the elite Diamond Box. The families of two high-ranking govt officials, one a senior IPS officer and the other an income tax commissioner, clashed over who was entitled to which seat!The clash of egos quickly spiralled into a full-blown showdown, turning the VIP box into a war zone of words and tempers. The duel escalated so dramatically that it spilled beyond the stadium and landed both parties at Cubbon Park police station, turning the cricket fever into a criminal case. The IPS officer's family charged the income tax commissioner's family with intimidation, sexual harassment and outraging modesty, which the latter has denied.""But what's more shocking is it all took place in the complimentary hospitality box even as several senior govt officials watched without intervening,"" a senior cop said. The incident happened when the IPS officer's daughter and son were at the seating area enjoying the game. ""The daughter stepped away to use the washroom, leaving her purse on the seat to indicate it was occupied. That is when a man came and occupied her seat. When the brother told him to vacate as his sister was all set to return, the man did not budge and an argument broke out between the two. Soon, the sister joined her brother while the man was joined by his wife, the income tax official, and their son. The argument intensified with each hurling abuse at the other. At one point, the confrontation between the IPS officer's daughter and the man almost went out of control as the man was arguing in her face,"" the cop elaborated.The brother-sister duo called their parents, who were watching the match at home on television. The IPS officer and his wife rushed towards the stadium, and worried about their children, called senior police officers in the city to intervene. With no help coming, the IPS officer's wife told her kids to move out of the stadium as she rushed to Cubbon Park police station and lodged a complaint. She accused the man ""of making unwelcome physical contact and intruding on her (daughter's) privacy with an intention to offend her"". She stated that visuals of the rowdy behaviour of the man was captured by her son on his mobile phone. She also pointed out that there were no cops on duty in the Diamond Box when the incident took place, between 9.40pm and 10.20pm.Based on her complaint, police registered a case against two unknown persons under BNS Sections 351 (criminal intimidation), 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 75 (sexual harassment which includes physical contact involving unwelcome overtures), and 79 (insulting a woman's modesty).After two hours, the man in question and his wife were summoned to the police station, and they were later allowed to leave. When contacted, the police brass chose not to comment and claimed necessary action would be taken after investigation. A police officer claimed helplessness, stating: ""One is a senior IPS officer and another is a senior income tax officer, we are in a spot.""","Families of two high-ranking govt officials clashed over who was entitled to which seat.

"Maternity payout covers just 20% of births, claim activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maternity-payout-covers-just-20-of-births-claim-activists/articleshow/120912531.cms,"NEW DELHI: Right to Food activists have expressed concern over barely 20% of births each year being covered by govt's maternity benefit scheme, despite the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, guaranteeing Rs 6,000 as legal entitlement of all pregnant women.Data given to RS in March showed that only 54 lakh beneficiaries were paid in 2024-25, much lower than almost 73 lakh in 2022-23, but an improvement over 22.5 lakh beneficiaries in 2023-24. The estimated number of births per year in India is 270 lakh.Giving maternity benefit of Rs 6,000 per child for 90% of the 270 lakh births would require an annual expenditure of over Rs 14,500 crore. However, the allocation for the maternity benefit scheme, Prime Minister's Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), has stagnated below Rs 2,000 crore in the last few years. The entitlement has not been revised since 2013, which means in real terms it has gone down after adjusting for inflation. Even by a very conservative estimate, maternity benefits should have been raised to at least Rs 12,000, argued the Right to Food activists.In April 2017, the women and child development ministry told Supreme Court that all pregnant women would receive Rs 6,000 under Section 4 of the NFSA. But instead, the PMMVY was implemented, reducing the benefit to Rs 5,000, restricting it to the first child (or second if it's a girl), and imposing multiple conditionalities.To get Rs 3,000 (first instalment), pregnancy must be registered and one ante-natal check-up done within six months at an approved facility. For Rs 2,000 (second instalment), childbirth must be registered and the child vaccinated with the first cycle of immunisations.Eligibility is limited to disadvantaged women who must prove it with documents like ration or BPL cards. Further, women below age of 18 years and seven months are not eligible. Many documents are required, including Aadhaar card, Aadhaar-mapped bank/post office account details, mobile number, eligibility proof, Mother and Child Protection card or Reproductive and Child Health card, date of last menstrual period, date of ante-natal check-up, child's birth certificate, and child immunisation details.Due to these conditions, most women are excluded. In 2023-24, only 2.7 lakh women (about 1%) received the second instalment. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Odisha provide Rs 18,000 and Rs 10,000 per pregnancy, with 84% and 64% birth coverage respectively.","Right to Food activists have expressed concern over barely 20% of births each year being covered by govt's maternity benefit scheme.

NEW DELHI: Limited flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir—are being undertaken by India in an immediate move to prepare them for storing and regulating flow of water to Pakistan during the winters. More dams will undergo the process in coming days to ensure better storage in India.The move is part of the country’s detailed roadmap, prepared after suspension of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) following the Pahalgam terror attack last month, to prevent and regulate flow of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - to the neighbouring country.Flushing is a process to clear sediments from the reservoir by operating it in a particular way using high water flow whereas desilting can be done through dredging to remove large deposited sediment.“Since the Treaty is on pause and there is no obligation to follow its provisions, we may do flushing on any project without any obligation. It will ensure longer effective life of such projects,” Kushvinder Vohra, former chairman, Central Water Commission, told TOI.He said typical projects like Baglihar and Kishanganga with smaller live poundages may complete the flushing process in about one to two days.Desilting/flushing of reservoirs is part of short-term measures under the roadmap whereas expediting under construction hydro-power projects such as Pakal Dul (1000 MW), Ratle (850 MW), Kiru (624 MW) and Kwar (540 mw) would be the medium-term measure.Curbing flow of nine cusecs of water from Kishanganga as required as per earlier award and using it for production of more power for India would be another measure that can be taken up in short-term, Vohra said.There are four more power projects which are in the pipeline as long-term measures which will make it possible for India to utilise adequate water from the western rivers using accompanying reservoirs. These projects will not only increase India’s hydro-power capacity in Jammu & Kashmir from nearly 4,000 MW to over 10,000 MW but also increase the water storage capacity which can be used in the UT and neighbouring states.Other measures under the roadmap include taking up Tulbul project on Jhelum which was stalled earlier; works on Wuller lake and Jhelum for better flood management; lift projects which may take comparatively lesser time to use water; and adequate use of existing Ranbir and Pratap canals to ensure more water for Jammu region.“Many other things can also be done which may unfold at an appropriate time,” said Vohra.","Flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is continuing with its state policy of fuelling cross-border terrorism through state and non-state proxies, and attacks like Pahalgam destabilise and jeopardise regional peace and security, defence minister Rajnath Singh told his Japanese counterpart General Nakatani on Monday.With Pakistan on Saturday testing the 450-km Abdali ballistic missile system in a reckless, escalatory and provocative move, the delegation-level meeting saw India also point to Pakistan's active role in nuclear and missile proliferation, which is a source of insecurity and instability for countries around the world, sources told TOI.The meeting saw both sides condemn ""terrorism in all its forms"" and emphasised the need for enhanced global cooperation and joint efforts to counter cross-border threats. ""Nakatani San expressed solidarity with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and offered full support to India,"" Singh said.While the two ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen the defence and security pillars of their bilateral 'special strategic and global partnership' and contribute towards regional peace, the major focus was on terrorism and Pakistan's role in promoting it.Singh condemned Pakistan's state policy of cross-border terrorism against India, perpetrated through state and non-state actors. He called for a unified stand against terrorism and the ""state-sponsored actions that perpetuate it"".Sources said the Indian side stressed that ""everyone needs to be mindful of the fact that terrorists coming out of terror training factories in Pakistan"" have committed attacks in several countries.Gen Nakatani, on his part, said terrorism could not be justified on any grounds, and Japan remained determined to resolutely fight the menace jointly with the international community, including India. He also expressed hope the countries concerned would take responsible actions for the sake of peace and stability in South Asia. On the proliferation front, China has played a major role in facilitating the clandestine network that has enabled Pakistan and North Korea to progressively strengthen their nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals.India and Japan have full strategic convergence on China's aggressive expansionist moves in the Indo-Pacific region, and along with the other 'Quad' countries of the US and Australia have openly declared their intent to deter any coercion in the region. Japan regularly takes part in the top-tier Malabar naval exercise, which began as a bilateral exercise between India and the US in 1992 but now includes all four 'Quad' countries.The two also conduct the Dharma Guardian exercise between their armies, JIMEX between navies and Veer Guardian between air forces, and have also operationalised their reciprocal military logistics pact. ""The ministers welcomed the growing diversity and frequency of defence exercises and exchanges, and concurred to enhance the scope and complexity of these engagements. They agreed to add new dimensions to the robust bilateral maritime cooperation,"" an official said.

Don’t want to reserve any judgment: Outgoing CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Monday passed the baton to incoming CJI B R Gavai for deciding the validity of the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, and said certain points and figures about waqf properties raised in the affidavit filed by the Centre to oppose the plea for pausing the law needed detailed hearing even for the purpose of passing interim orders.Heading a bench also comprising Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan, CJI Khanna at the outset, with the consent of counsel for the rival sides, referred the bunch of petitions challenging the Act to CJI-designate Gavai and fixed hearing for May 15, a day after the new CJI takes oath. CJI Khanna retires on May 13.CJI Khanna told solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the court had gone through, even if not minutely, the Union govt’s preliminary response to the petitions. “The govt has raised certain points with regard to registration of land (for a valid waqf) and some figures about waqf properties. These require some consideration. There are some aspects, which require clarification also,” he said.Mehta said the govt had answers to every apprehension expressed by the petitioners and that the Act was intended to benefit individuals in the Muslim community and streamline the management of huge waqf properties. Lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal who had pressed for the law to be stayed, responded sarcastically, “He has an answer for everything.”The CJI brought this to an abrupt end by informing the counsel that he did not want to reserve any judgment, or even an interim order for that matter.Tushar Mehta said govt had answers to every apprehension expressed by the petitioners and that the Act was intended to benefit individuals in the Muslim community and streamline the management of huge waqf properties.

On April 17, Mehta had pre-empted the SC from staying certain provisions of the law by assuring that the Centre would make no appointments to the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards and maintain status quo on waqfs, including ‘waqf by user’, already registered or declared under the Waqf Act, 1995.Defending the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025 as a secular law, Centre in its 1,332-page response, which included 1,100 pages of documents, had said the objection to mandatory registration of waqf properties, including ‘waqf by user’, was baseless as it had been in vogue for more than 100 years. It had also given data about huge increase in waqf properties in the last 12 years. All India Muslim Personal Law Board , in its rejoinder affidavit, accused Centre of misleading the SC by giving figures of properties which though were part of waqf prior to 2013 but had not been entered in the centralised portal, Waqf Management System of India.","CJI Sanjiv Khanna passed the baton to incoming CJI B R Gavai for deciding the validity of the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, 2025.

Show material to link C’garh scam accused to proceeds of crime, SC tells additional SG

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday flagged what it called the Enforcement Directorate making allegations against accused in money laundering cases without backing them with evidence, and said it has witnessed this trend in many cases.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed concern over the investigating agency not substantiating its claims with material to link the accused with proceeds of crime . ""This is what we have seen in umpteen number of cases filed by the ED. This is the pattern, just make allegations without reference to anything,"" the court said. Additional solicitor general S V Raju responded to the remark by saying he would submit evidence to ""dispel the court's impression"" that the agency had been filing cases without having necessary evidence.The court made the observation while hearing the bail plea of one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam case, Arvind Singh, after it was not convinced with the agency's submission linking the accused with Rs 40 crore proceeds of crime. Raju said Singh was involved in the multi-crore liquor scam.Additional solicitor general S V Raju said Chhattisgarh liquor scam case accused, Arvind Singh, was involved in the multi-crore liquor scam and he was instrumental in procuring empty liquor bottles through a company Anurag Traders. The ASG said he was running a parallel liquor business in the state causing a scam of over Rs 2,000 crore.The bench asked the ASG to show material to link Singh with the company and with Rs 40 crore proceeds of crime unearthed by the agency. When the court noted that Singh was neither managing director nor director nor held any post in the company, Raju said he was indirectly managing the affairs of the company.As the bench seemed unconvinced, Raju, who was arguing online, sought time to appear in court and place relevant documents to substantiate the allegations against Singh and dispel the bench's impression that allegations were made without proof.Pressing for bail, senior advocate Siddarth Agarwal said his client had already spent 10 months in jail and trial was unlikely to commence in the near future as the probe was still on. He said there were 21 accused in the case and documents running into 25,000 pages had been filed with over 150 witnesses named.Raju, however, said bail could not be sought on ground of filing of voluminous documents and probe was complete on Singh's role. He said the accused had not spent one year in jail, a timeframe considered by the court for granting bail. The bench, however, said there was no such yardstick that bail could be granted only after an accused had spent one year in custody.Interestingly, while speaking at ED's foundation day a few days ago, Raju, who has been the agency's main counsel, cautioned ED not to rush to arrest an accused and said it should be done at a later stage (of investigation) after making a watertight case. ""Gather evidence before arrest and make sure the accused has been linked to 'proceeds of crime' rather than the predicate offence alone,"" he had said. If an accused was arrested at an early stage of investigation, it may not meet the requirement of the law and the accused may get relief from courts, he had suggested, adding that extracting confessions and collecting evidence were easier before an accused was arrested for alleged money laundering, rather than after his arrest. ""Material evidence can be gathered when ED is still investigating a case, so get evidence before arrest. Don't be in haste in arresting,"" he had said.",The court made the observation while hearing the bail plea of one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam case.

India firmly dismissed these allegations as ""absurd"".Relations worsened when Ottawa connected several Indian diplomats, including High Commissioner Sanjay Verma, to Nijjar's death. In October last year, India withdrew Verma and five colleagues, whilst expelling an equal number of Canadian diplomats from New Delhi.Recently, security officials from both nations resumed communications, exploring possibilities for appointing new high commissioners, reported news agency PTI.Trudeau's departure was viewed as a chance for diplomatic improvement.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU:

Authorities have since Sunday restricted flows through Jammu’s Baglihar and Salal hydroelectric dams on the Chenab that runs on to Pakistan, causing such an unprecedented drop in water levels that residents in downstream areas were able to walk across the river for the first time in recent memory.The actions demonstrate India’s ability to regulate timing of water releases and comes after the Centre’s decision to suspend Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists. Under IWT, India would have had to inform Pakistan before regulating Chenab’s waters.Sources said the authorities had closed all five main gates of Baglihar Dam and those of Salal Dam downstream. Water released from Baglihar typically flows to Salal before the Chenab rolls into Pakistan, where it serves as a critical lifeline for its Punjab province. By closing both dams, authorities effectively stopped the river’s flow.Officials downplayed the moves, saying the dams’ gates were first opened to flush out silt and mud and then closed under a “continuous process”.In Jammu’s Akhnoor, dozens walked across the river, something they said they had never experienced before. Children collected coins from the bed as water levels dropped to 1.5-2ft from 25-30ft. “For the first time in my life today, I was able to walk across half the Chenab. It’s unbelievable,” an Akhnoor resident said on Monday.Many welcomed PM Narendra Modi’s decision to put IWT on hold. “We do not want even a single drop of water to be supplied to Pakistan. We stand with Indian Army and PM Modi,” said Akhnoor’s Vinay Gupta. Fellow resident Kamal Langer echoed the sentiment: “Our govt is giving Pakistan a befitting reply in a lot of ways.”According to Luv Puri, former UN counter-terrorism official and a Kashmir expert, the implications of placing IWT in abeyance are becoming increasingly evident. “It shows this was preceded by significant preparation,” Puri said.IWT gives India exclusive rights to use waters of “Eastern Rivers” -- Sutlej, Beas and Ravi -- and their tributaries before they enter Pakistan, while the latter secured rights over the waters of the “Western Rivers” -- Chenab, Jhelum and Indus.“Earlier analyses suggesting India lacked the infrastructure to exert pressure through water management have proven inaccurate. The impact of suspending IWT reveals that India has, in fact, developed the infrastructure needed to leverage water strategically,” Puri said.Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister and president of J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), had on Saturday reiterated his party’s opposition to IWT. He argued that the 1960 treaty had harmed J&K’s interests and called for diverting Chenab’s waters to Jammu and harnessing Jhelum’s waters to generate power in Kashmir. NC has long claimed that the rights over the region’s rivers were given to Pakistan under IWT without consulting J&K. “We have been saying that this treaty has to be reviewed,” Abdullah said.",Authorities have since Sunday restricted flows through Jammu’s Baglihar and Salal hydroelectric dams on the Chenab that runs on to Pakistan.

Agreeing with PM Narendra Modi on the need for an “uncompromising” fight against terrorism , Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with PM Narendra Modi stressed that the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack and their supporters must be brought to justice.Putin, who had written to Modi on the day of the attack (April 22) expressing hope the perpetrators will get deserved punishment, strongly condemned the massacre in remarks seen as a strong endorsement of India’s position, at a time the Indian government is considering military options to defang the threat of cross-border terrorism from Pakistan.Putin’s remarks also came in the middle of calls by the West and India’s important Gulf partners for de-escalation and restraint. Russia’s own foreign minister Sergey Lavrov spoke to counterpart S Jaishankar last week and urged India to resolve “disagreements” diplomatically and politically, in line with the Simla Agreement that Pakistan has threatened to put in abeyance.There was no mention of restraint or use of diplomatic means in the Kremlin readout on this occasion as it said that Putin again expressed his sincere condolences over the death of Indian citizens because of the “barbaric terrorist attack” on April 22 in Pahalgam in southern Kashmir. “Both sides emphasized the need for an uncompromising fight against terrorism in all its manifestations,’’ it added.Expressing the same sentiment in its own version of the talks, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) quoted Putin as emphasising that the perpetrators of the heinous attack and their supporters must be brought to justice. “President Putin called PM Narendra Modi and strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam, India. He conveyed deepest condolences on the loss of innocent lives and expressed full support to India in the fight against terrorism,’’ said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Putin’s call for action against the perpetrators and their backers echoed US President Donald Trump’s initial reaction to the attack in which he expressed full support for India’s efforts to bring the Pahalgam terrorists to justice. In the past week or so, there has been pressure on India from the US to work with Pakistan for de-escalation, as evident from the State Department’s readout of secretary of state Marco Rubio’s last conversation with Jaishankar.In the talks on Monday, Modi also reiterated the invite for Putin to visit India for the annual India-Russia summit and the latter accepted it “with gratitude”. According to Russian authorities, the strategic nature of Russia-India relations as a special privileged partnership was emphasized. “These relations are not subject to external influence and continue to develop dynamically in all areas,’’ said the Russian readout.Modi also congratulated Putin for the upcoming May 9 Victory Day celebrations. Russia had invited Modi for the event, but the government had nominated defence minister Rajnath Singh to represent India. However, Singh’s junior minister Sanjay Seth will now visit Moscow as Singh stays put here in the middle of rising tensions with Pakistan.",Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with PM Narendra Modi stressed that the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack and their supporters must be brought to justice. Putin had written to Modi on the day of the attack (April 22) expressing hope the perpetrators will get deserved punishment.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday modified an order by Bombay high court to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) under Lakhmi Gautam, the joint commissioner of police, Mumbai, to probe allegations against policemen in the Badlapur 'fake' encounter case and directed Maharashtra's director general of police (DGP) to supervise the probe.Seeking modification of HC order, solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the state, told a bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and P B Varale that the govt has no issue with the constitution of the SIT but submitted that it should be under the supervision of the DGP. Allowing the plea, the bench modified the high court's direction and said Maharashtra's DGP will constitute an SIT to probe allegations against five policemen for the custodial death of Badlapur sexual assault case accused Akshay Shinde.Shinde, accused of sexually assaulting two minor girls at a school in Badlapur in Thane district, was allegedly shot in a police van on September 23, 2024, when he was being taken to Kalyan from the Taloja prison for questioning in another case.Supreme Court said, ""...it is directed that the SIT shall be constituted by the DGP consisting of officers as he may deem appropriate.""

Modifying the high court's direction, the apex court said the Maharashtra DGP would constitute the SIT which would continue the probe.Since Shinde's father, who had moved the HC for an SIT or CBI probe into the death, had withdrawn himself from the proceeding before the HC, the SC bench decided not to issue a notice to him. ""We may clarify that the complainant, if he has any grievance, may approach the competent court i.e the magistrate concerned or sessions court as the case may be for appropriate relief,"" the judges said.","Bombay HC had ordered an FIR against five policemen and the setting up of an SIT under the supervision of JCP Lakhmi Gautam.

Since the 2024-25 academic session must have progressed significantly, it would not be expedient to grant him admission to that session, concluded the court. The court also stated that in view of the high marks secured by Kabir in the NEET UG 2024 examination (542 out of 720), he shall not be required to undergo the 2025 examination.The court held that denial of admission to Kabir was ""grossly illegal, arbitrary"", and violative of his fundamental rights. ""Such action not only reflects institutional bias and systemic discrimination but also undermines the principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination enshrined in our constitutional framework. The constitutional mandate of substantive equality demands that persons with disabilities (PwD) and PwBD (people with benchmark disabilities) be afforded reasonable accommodations rather than subjected to exclusionary practices based on unfounded presumptions about their capabilities,"" stated the court in its order.Kabir Paharia had cleared class X with 91.5% and class XII with 90% marks without the help of a scribe to write the exams.

Three of the fingers on his left hand are half-grown, as are two on his right hand. On his left foot, two toes are half-grown.

""How long can this go on,"" he asked.The bench of Justices Kant and N Kotiswar Singh perused the ACRs of Prem Kumar, who was a direct recruit to the post of additional district and sessions judge in Punjab in 2014, and said his track record and integrity was termed good by the supervising judge.

The HC appealed against the division bench's order before the SC.Dismissing the appeal, Justice Kant-led bench said, ""Just because he belongs to a lower caste, he is being targeted.

Pakistan has accused India of preparing to launch an attack on the country despite its own warmongering that has seen it test firing missiles twice in past few days.External affairs minister S Jaishankar has been in touch with council members, including Greece which holds the presidency of the council for May, to drive home India's point about Pakistan's use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy and to mobilise support for India's efforts to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack to justice.The UNSC closed-door consultations are of informal nature and unlikely to lead to any substantive outcome in this case - except allowing Pakistan a shot at diplomatic grandstanding - much like the closed consultations Islamabad sought through ally China in 2019 after India revoked the special status of J&K.The discussions - expected to begin around 12.30am IST Tuesday - will take place not under the India-Pakistan Question that involves J&K but the more generic ""threats to international peace and security"".

Pakistan is expected to raise the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty that India put in abeyance after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.While most council members have been supportive of India's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism, India remains wary of China's support to Pakistan in UNSC. This was obvious in the way Pakistan worked with China to water down the council's condemnation of the terrorist attack. Unlike its condemnation of the Pulwama attack in 2019, the council did not ask State to cooperate specifically with the Indian govt and didn't name the terror group that had taken responsibility for the attack.Pakistan said last week that as a member-state it has the right to convene a meeting when it feels appropriate because of the threat to regional and global peace.",UN security council was scheduled to hold closed-door consultations on the rising India-Pakistan tensions.

A native of Damaria village in Seoni Malwa tehsil of Narmadapuram district, he was accused of fraudulently securing his post by using a proxy to appear in the 2013 Professional Examination Board (PEB) recruitment test.The case against him was initiated in Oct 2021, when a confidential complaint reached the additional director general of police, STF Bhopal, alleging that Thakur paid Rs 5 lakh to a proxy exam-taker - referred to as a 'Munna Bhai' - with financial help from his brother, Pappu Thakur.STF investigators collected Thakur's handwriting and fingerprints, retrieved original recruitment documents, and sent them for forensic analysis. The prosecution claimed there were discrepancies, indicative of impersonation.An FIR was registered in Dec 2022, and Thakur was arrested in March 2023. He was granted bail while the trial progressed. A chargesheet was submitted before the special court in Aug 2024, and he was subsequently suspended.On May 2, 2025, the CBI special court dealing with Vyapam cases ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove charges beyond reasonable doubt. Citing inconclusive forensic results, lack of eyewitness testimony, and unproven elements of conspiracy and intent, the court acquitted Thakur.Speaking to TOI after the judgment, advocate Gopesh Sikkewal, counsel for Thakur, said, ""The prosecution was unable to provide substantial explanations on several technical issues during cross-examination. Since he has been acquitted of the charges, we will be filing a petition to get him reinstated in the police force, along with all financial benefits that he deserves till date.""The court ordered Thakur's acquittal under IPC sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120B, and provisions of the MP Recognised Examinations Act, 1937. His bail bond was cancelled, and a copy of the judgment was sent to the Bhopal district magistrate. The prosecution is likely to file an appeal in the case.This case is among hundreds tied to the Vyapam scam, a massive network of exam fraud that rocked Madhya Pradesh, involving the rigging of entrance exams for medical colleges, govt jobs, and professional courses. Over the past decade, the scam has exposed a nexus of candidates, impersonators, officials, and politicians - undermining public trust in the recruitment process and triggering national outrage.","Sajan Singh Thakur, 32, is a police constable posted at Kotwali police station in Harda.

Police seized counterfeit admit cards, AI-edited photographs, Bluetooth earpieces, SIM cards and Rs 50,000 cash, which was allegedly received as advance payment.Two candidates, Rohit Gora and Sanjay Chaudhary, were taken into custody later for being involved in the plan.DCP Amit Kumar, who led the operation, said the racket was masterminded by the two PG students, motivated by the prospect of quick money. Sharma was allegedly prepared to impersonate Gora in NEET and Chaudhary in an upcoming paramedical test.In Bihar, Dr Ranjit Kumar, a doctor posted at Begusarai jail, and Rambabu Malik, a resident of Darbhanga, were arrested in Samastipur district on Sunday for being part of a cheating operation that involved tampering with admit cards and sending proxies to take the exam on the behalf of the candidates.""Two people were found sitting near an exam centre in a suspicious manner, and were questioned.

MUMBAI: Observing that a parent suffering from mental illness is not per se disqualified from custody unless it is shown to endanger the child's welfare, a sessions court dismissed a man's plea to take custody of his 16-year-old son. The man had filed an appeal against a magistrate awarding custody to the mother.""...It is evident that the magistrate interacted with the child, considered the best interest and welfare of the minor, and directed the parties to undergo mediation before passing the order. The magistrate, while granting temporary custody, considered the curriculum course of the child and the natural affection of the mother in the right prospect,"" the judge said.The judge said it is well settled in matters of custody that a minor's welfare is paramount and not parents' legal rights. ""...The minor is nearing adulthood, and the order is only for temporary custody...The magistrate did not commit any jurisdictional error or perversity warranting interference.""The mother had filed a complaint against the father under Domestic Violence (DV) Act in 2022. In March and April this year, orders were issued granting temporary custody of the son to the mother till May 15, and the father was directed to present him in court in Mumbai every month after visitation. A production warrant was also issued following the father's alleged failure to produce the child.The father's counsel said the magistrate's order was passed without giving him a fair opportunity to be heard, thus violating the principle of natural justice. The appeal also said the lower court failed to prioritise the child's welfare, who was already in the father's care in Patna, where he is studying in Class 11. The father's counsel questioned the magistrate's jurisdiction under DV Act to issue such custody orders and said there was no change in circumstances warranting a transfer of custody. Concerns were also raised about a potential trauma to the child due to the sudden change in custody without proper assessment.The mother's advocate highlighted the father's alleged non-compliance with the initial custody order and that he filed the appeal only after the production warrant was issued. Allegations regarding the mother's mental health were dismissed as unsubstantiated and defamatory, with a medical report presented as evidence of her sound mental state. The court was also told that the father had previously filed a transfer application before the chief metropolitan magistrate, which was rejected in Dec 2024, and that he had not complied with similar custody directions in the past.The sessions court found no evidence to support the father's claims that the magistrate ignored the child's academic commitments or that the mother has a mental illness.",A sessions court dismissed a man's plea to take custody of his 16-year-old son.

BHUBANESWAR: An Odisha govt probe has dismissed allegations that surplus wood from Puri Jagannath temple had been used to craft idols at the newly consecrated Jagannath shrine in Bengal's Digha, with officials attributing the controversy to a servitor's 'slip of tongue' in a television interview.Servitor Ramakrushna Dasmohapatra, who attended the Digha temple's inauguration, had claimed during a TV interview in Kolkata that he used surplus wood from the 2015 Nabakalebara to craft the Digha shrine idols.""We got it investigated by the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) and found no truth in his claim. Dasmohapatra was summoned and asked by SJTA. Dasmohapatra admitted that it was a slip of tongue,"" law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said.The minister confirmed that SJTA officials spoke to temple craftsmen, who verified that excess wood was not taken out of the Puri shrine for the construction of Digha temple idols.An investigation revealed that Dasmohapatra had commissioned a Bhubaneswar-based artisan for the Digha idols. The SJTA's questioning of the artisan confirmed that he had sourced neem wood from a timber supplier for the project.""Dasmohapatra's lies and wayward media statement hurt the sentiments of devotees. It is now officially clear that our temple's surplus wood was not taken outside for any other purpose. Dasmohapatra has been asked to submit a written explanation. He is likely to face action (possible suspension for some days) as per the temple act,"" a SJTA official said.Minister Harichandan also announced enhanced security measures for Daru Ghara (where surplus wooden logs are stored) inside the shrine. ""In 1995-96, following a faulty govt decision, the Daitapati Nijog had stored some surplus wood in their office within the temple premises. Now, we have decided to streamline the system.

Will bring SOPs for Jagannath temples outside Puri: Odisha

BHUBANESWAR/KOLKATA: Odisha government threatened on Monday legal action against Bengal for naming a newly inaugurated Jagannath temple in Digha as ""Jagannath Dham"", escalating an already bitter row that now spans religious tradition, regional pride, and political rivalry.Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee hit back, accusing BJP-governed Odisha of ""jealousy"" and of targeting Bengalis, while social media campaigns flared with hashtags like #BoycottPuri and #BoycottOdisha.Odisha law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan declared that ""Dham"" can only be associated with four sacred places - Badrinath, Dwarka, Rameswaram, and Jagannath Puri - and said using it for Digha has ""created anguish among devotees everywhere"".""We will also ask Bengal to stop referring to the beach near the Digha temple as Mahodadhi, a term found in scriptures describing the beach at Puri,"" Harichandan said.Puri's titular king and Lord Jagannath's chief servitor Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb condemned the use of the term ""Jagannath Dham"" for the Digha shrine, which was inaugurated on April 30. He said the term is exclusive to Puri. Citing ancient scriptures and Muktimandapa Pandit Sabha, Deb urged Digha temple authorities to ""desist from calling it Jagannath Dham"".Odisha announced it would introduce SOPs for all Jagannath temples outside Puri, defining the roles of servitors after some participated in the Digha temple's consecration - a move seen by many in Odisha as a breach of sacred tradition.For her part, CM Banerjee lashed out at Odisha and other BJP-governed states, accusing them of hostility and discrimination. ""When Mamata Banerjee builds skywalks at Dakshineswar or Kalighat, nobody raises a question. When I celebrate Durga and Kali puja, there's no outrage. Then why this animosity over Jagannath Dham?"" she asked. ""Why is there so much jealousy?""Speaking in violence-hit Murshidabad, Banerjee accused Odisha of ""thrashing"" Bengali-speaking people and said Bengalis are being assaulted in several BJP-governed states, including Maharashtra, Bihar, and UP.""You are attacking our migrant workers for speaking Bengali but we will not do the same. That is the difference between you and me,"" she said. ""We have reached out to Odisha, Bihar, and Rajasthan. Our DGP has spoken to Odisha's DGP. Our chief secretary is writing to the Union home secretary. I hope good sense prevails.""TMC MP and former cricketer Yusuf Pathan claimed that 20,000 Bengali workers fled Odisha after recent assaults - a charge Odisha revenue minister Suresh Pujari dismissed, advising Pathan to ""stick to cricket commentary"". Odisha police reported no complaints of such attacks.Banerjee reminded Odisha of Bengal's support during natural disasters. ""You seek engineers from us during cyclones. Bengal sends the maximum number of tourists to Puri. So why the outrage if we build a Jagannath Dham in Digha?"" she asked.Odisha government earlier notified that people should not visit the Digha temple, a move Banerjee condemned. ""We all visit Puri, but never ask questions. Why is this bothering them so much?"" she said. ""I love Puri. I love Odisha. But please, don't behave like this.""","Odisha threatens action against Bengal over 'Jagannath Dham' in Digha. Will bring SOPs for Jagannath temples outside Puri: Odisha law minister.

‘Orders reserved for eternity’: Supreme Court asks HCs for pending cases data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/orders-reserved-for-eternity-supreme-court-asks-hcs-for-pending-cases-data/articleshow/120910396.cms,"SC bench seeks details of 75 appeals disposed of in a week by J'khand HC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday termed as ""very disturbing"" the practice of certain high court judges ""reserving judgments for eternity"" in breach of litigants' fundamental right to speedy justice and asked registrars general of all 25 HCs to submit details of cases in which orders had been reserved before Jan 31 and verdicts were yet to be pronounced.The SC's move had a dramatic fallout as Jharkhand HC, according to a petitioner's lawyer, delivered verdicts later in the day in two appeals where it had reserved judgements since 2022 and acquitted the convicts. The HC has scheduled final orders for Tuesday in two other cases where it had reserved verdicts long ago.There are at least two judges, one each in Telangana HC and Gauhati HC, who have between them reserved judgments in hundreds of cases and are yet to deliver final orders.Telangana HC's T Vinod Kumar, heading a division bench, has kept more than 50 judgments reserved. Sitting as a single judge, he has reserved verdicts in over 150 cases - 13 in 2020 and over 70 each in 2022 and 2023, SC sources told TOI based on a complaint circulated among senior SC judges including the CJI.The SC order stemmed from a petition argued by advocate Fauzia Shakil, who informed the court that four lifers had filed appeals against their conviction between 2012 and 2018 in Jharkhand HC, which had not pronounced verdicts even three years after reserving judgments.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, which had called for details of such instances from the Jharkhand HC registrar general, expanded the scope and wanted to know the state of affairs in every HC.""We would like to lay down some mandatory guidelines to expedite delivery of judgments. It cannot be allowed to go on like this (reserving judgments and forgetting about it),"" Justice Kant said.The Jharkhand HC registrar general's report, without mentioning the four appeals, said division benches had reserved judgments in as many as 56 matters between Jan 2022 and Dec 2024, but no final order had been passed yet.Single judge benches had reserved orders in 11 cases between July-Sept 2024 in which verdicts were yet to come.The court also referred to a newspaper report which said that Jharkhand high court had disposed of 75 appeals within a week of the apex court order of April 23 seeking details of four cases in which judgments were reserved without pronouncing judgments.The bench sought details of the 75 appeals disposed of in a week and soft copies of the judgments. It also asked the high court to inform about the fate of the four appeals, which advocate Shakil had mentioned.Expanding the ambit of adjudication from Jharkhand to all high courts, the bench asked registrars general of all 25 high courts to submit within four weeks reports on cases in which division benches and single judge benches had reserved verdicts before Jan 31 and were yet to pronounce verdicts.However, it decided to hear the Jharkhand related issue on May 11 while asking the Jharkhand Legal Services Authority to take immediate steps to find out those who have not been able to appeal against conviction in Supreme Court because of the HC indefinitely reserving orders on their appeals.","Jharkhand HC delivered verdicts later in the day in two appeals where it had reserved judgements since 2022 and acquitted the convicts.

Cash at judge's house: Panel submits report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-at-judges-house-panel-submits-report/articleshow/120910387.cms,"Cash at judge's house: Panel submits report

Panel's findings not binding, ball now in CJI's court

NEW DELHI: After a 40-day inquiry into the alleged discovery of cash at Justice Yashwant Varma 's residence on the night of March 14, a three-member judicial panel has submitted a voluminous report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna , reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The report details the sequence of events after the fire incident and the mysterious disappearance of cash captured in a video shot by first responders.However, there was no information about the nature of the voluminous report or its findings. The report is learned to have annexed statements of over 50 witnesses examined by the panel.The witnesses included the Delhi police commissioner, the Delhi Fire Services chief who had given contradictory statements, some Delhi high court staff, the first responders to the fire as well as the security personnel deployed at the judge's residence.Eight days after the incident, the CJI had constituted a panel comprising Punjab & Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman to conduct an inquiry into the allegations against Justice Varma. Under the memorandum of procedure, the CJI is the sole authority to decide the course of action depending on the contents of the report even though the panel's findings are not binding. If the report is adverse to Justice Varma, who has since been repatriated to Allahabad HC, the CJI could order lodging of an FIR for a formal investigation by police.The CJI, if he thinks fit, may also recommend to Union govt to initiate removal motion against the judge in case the panel has recorded specific findings of wrongdoing and his prima facie involvement in stashing of cash in the outhouse of his residence that caught fire.If the panel detects no evidence of wrongdoing on part of judge, then, too, the CJI could order a formal investigation or decide to close the case and allow Justice Varma to resume judicial work, which has been withdrawn since March 22.The fire broke out at 11.30pm on March 14. Delhi Police commissioner informed Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay the next day at 4.50pm, who in turn informed the CJI on March 16. Police also handed over to the Delhi HC CJ photos and videos of burning cash inside a room.Later, CJI Khanna uploaded the video of burning cash to SC's official website. He also asked Justice Varma not to delete any data from his personal phones. In his response to the HC CJ, Justice Varma had said, ""I unequivocally state that neither I nor any of my family members had stored or kept any cash or currency in that storeroom at any point of time. What baffles me is the absence of any sacks of allegedly burnt currency which were ever recovered or seized.""","A three-member judicial panel has submitted a voluminous report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna.

7-year-old dies of rabies despite getting vaccine in Kerala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-year-old-dies-of-rabies-despite-getting-vaccine-in-kerala/articleshow/120910373.cms,"'Deep wound on nerve-rich area lead to death'

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A seven-year-old girl from Kunnikode in Kollam, succumbed to rabies at SAT Hospital in the city on Monday morning.She is the third child to have died of rabies infection despite receiving vaccination in Kerala in a month. Bhagyalakshmi, 13, from Pullad, Pathanamthitta, died on April 9, and Ziya Faris, 6, from Thenhipalam, Malappuram, died on April 29. Niya, who was bitten by a dog on April 8, received three doses of the anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin serum.Soon after the dog bit her, Niya was taken to a primary health centre and later referred to Punalur taluk hospital after a medical examination found the wound to be deep. She was administered the anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin serum at the taluk hospital. However, she was referred to SAT Hospital after she developed a fever on April 28 and diagnosed with rabies.Hospital authorities said a deep dog bite on the nerve-rich part of Niya's elbow and the anterior part of the elbow joint led to her death.This was a direct injury to the nerve and hence chances of the virus reaching the brain before the vaccine could act were very high. The cubital fossa is a junction through which major nerves and blood vessels travel, Dr S Bindu, superintendent of SAT Hospital, said.Niya's body was laid to rest at Alenchery Muslim Jamaat mosque. As part of the protocol, her body was not taken home or kept for public viewing. Her mother has been placed under quarantine.The back-to-back deaths of three children owing to rabies despite receiving vaccination have reignited the debate over stray dog menace and the effectiveness and quality control of vaccines in the state.The opposition accused the govt of mismanagement, while MB Rajesh, state minister, blamed the Centre's ""impractical"" animal birth control norms for the situation. According to health department statistics, 22 people have died of rabies in the state since 2021, despite receiving the vaccine.Dr KV Viswanath, joint director of medical education, said the vaccine could not be blamed for the tragic outcome. The vaccine's effectiveness depends on the wound's severity and the rate of viral transmission, he said. Niya was given three doses of the vaccine but succumbed to the rabies virus before she could be administered the fourth dose on May 6. A bite on areas like the face, neck, and elbow could lead to the virus reaching the brain and spinal cord before the vaccine can generate antibodies, the doctor said.","Niya, who was bitten by a dog on April 8, received three doses of the anti- rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin serum.

“Pretend you don’t know me”: Wayne Gretzky caught in crossfire as Donald Trump friendship sparks Canadian backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/pretend-you-dont-know-me-wayne-gretzky-caught-in-crossfire-as-donald-trump-friendship-sparks-canadian-backlash/articleshow/120874470.cms,"Wayne Gretzky, a Canadian icon, faces backlash for his friendship with Donald Trump (Image via Getty Images)

Wayne Gretzky's Donald Trump ties spark anger during politically sensitive moment

Hockey legend’s recent actions raise eyebrows north of the border

Wayne Gretzky , long celebrated as Canada ’s greatest hockey icon, is now facing an unfamiliar role—not on the ice, but in the center of a political firestorm. The backlash against “The Great One” has intensified in recent weeks as Canadians grapple with his increasingly visible friendship with former U.S. President Donald Trump The controversy erupted following Donald Trump’s recent interview with The Atlantic, where he addressed Wayne Gretzky’s situation head-on. “I love Canada,” Trump said, before revealing a private conversation with the hockey legend . “I said to Wayne, ‘I’m gonna give you a pass, Wayne… Just pretend you don’t know me.’” The remark, meant to shield Gretzky from the fallout, has only fueled the perception that the former NHL star is too close to a deeply unpopular figure in Canada.The timing of this revelation couldn’t be more explosive. Canadian political tensions with the U.S. are already at a boiling point. Donald Trump’s past statements suggesting Canada could become America’s 51st state, coupled with escalating trade wars and inflammatory rhetoric, have frayed nerves across the border. According to a Politico/Focaldata poll, 75% of Canadians hold an unfavorable view of President Trump.Wayne Gretzky’s decision to give a thumbs-up to American players and skip wearing Canadian colors during the 4 Nations Face-Off final in February didn’t go unnoticed. Critics saw the gesture as unpatriotic, especially after images surfaced of Gretzky donning a MAGA hat at Trump’s 2024 election celebration at Mar-a-Lago. His attendance at Trump’s inauguration alongside his wife further fanned the flames.Though Gretzky has yet to comment publicly, Canadian sentiment has shifted sharply. Once untouchable, he’s now the subject of social media scrutiny and national debate.In his victory speech after a surprising Liberal Party comeback, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney directly addressed Trump’s growing influence. “President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never, ever happen,” Carney said defiantly.Also Read: Throwback to a historic moment: Semyon Varlamov’s record-breaking shutout streak remains a defining chapter in Islanders history Whether Wayne Gretzky speaks out or stays silent, the damage may already be done—for his reputation, and perhaps for Canada’s perception of one of its most beloved sons.",Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky is facing backlash for his friendship with Donald Trump.

Shreyas Iyer's tactical call to promote Josh Inglis pays off: Ricky Ponting

During the 55th IPL 2025 league match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Monday, a run-out incident involving Vipraj Nigam sparked animated reactions from SRH owner Kavya Maran , which have gone viral on social media.The dismissal occurred in the 13th over of DC's innings when a miscommunication between Nigam and Tristan Stubbs led to Nigam's run-out while attempting to take two runs. Nigam had scored 18 runs off 17 balls, including one four and one six.Maran's expressive reaction to the dismissal was captured on camera and quickly became a talking point on social media platforms, with multiple Twitter users sharing clips of her response.Before his dismissal, Nigam had formed a crucial 33-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Stubbs, helping Delhi Capitals recover from a precarious position of 29 for 5 in 7.1 overs.The incident gained significant attention as Star Sports, the official broadcaster, highlighted Maran's reaction with the caption: ""IPL Race 2 Playoffs got everyone excited: Kavya Maran's face says it all. Watch the LIVE action on Star Sports 1, Star Sports 1 Hindi & JioHotstar!""Sunrisers Hyderabad won the toss and opted to bowl first against Delhi Capitals, a decision that paid immediate dividends.

Only SRH’s own 24 for 4 against Mumbai Indians at the same venue ranks lower.

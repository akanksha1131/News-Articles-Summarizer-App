'Read history from books not WhatsApp': Raj Thackeray on row over Aurangazeb's tomb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/read-history-from-books-not-whatsapp-raj-thackeray-on-row-over-aurangazebs-tomb/articleshow/119784194.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Navanirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday condemned efforts to stir communal tensions over Aurangzeb's tomb and urged the people to refer to books to learn history and not WhatsApp.""Don't we want to let the world know that these people sought to destroy the Marathas but were wiped out instead. Stop reading history on WhatsApp and rather delve into history books,"" he said, addressing his annual Gudhi Padwa rally in Mumbai.Referring to the recently released Chhaava movie, he asked, ""We have forgotten the real issues of the present time.

DEHRADUN: In a cluster of high-altitude villages near the India-China border in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi district , households are shaped by absence. Across eight settlements - Harsil, Mukhba, Bagori, Dharali, Sukhi, Purali, Jhala and Jaspaur - the presence of young women and children has steadily thinned. The migration hasn't been forced, nor has it followed economic distress. It stems from a quieter reckoning: the recognition that local schools cannot meet the expectations families now place on education. In response, women have moved with children to towns like Dehradun and Uttarkashi, leaving behind men to manage apple orchards and tourism businesses.Anupriya Rawat, who once lived in a border village near Harsil, now resides in Dehradun with her child. Speaking to TOI, her voice held no resentment, only resignation. ""Ideally, I would not like to stay in a city away from my husband, but we are forced to make this sacrifice for the future of our children,"" she said. ""Several other women also left the village for their children's sake.""At the heart of this shift lies education - or the lack thereof. Across the eight villages, there is only one inter-school. Many of the settlements have a single primary school, but Bagori doesn't even have that. In those that do, the same two teachers are often responsible for all subjects, across all grades. Villagers said the schools fail to meet basic standards.""The schools are fraught with issues like lack of hygiene and absence of teachers,"" said Asha Panwar, a resident of Dharali who left years ago to raise her children in Uttarkashi. Her husband continues to live in the village, but she remains in town with her children, now 16 and 11. ""Almost all our villages are emptied due to this problem. You will not find any young daughter-in-law or school children back there,"" she said.Despite this dislocation, the families are not necessarily broken. Many are economically secure, even prosperous. Apple farming remains a strong source of seasonal income, and the pilgrimage economy surrounding the Char Dham route brings in consistent earnings. The men manage their lands and lodges, either alone or with elder relatives.""It's no doubt tough staying apart from one's wife and kids, but the silver lining is that we are getting economic independence by staying back in our villages,"" said Madhvendra Rawat, a resident of Harsil. ""Sometime back, one of our villagers hired a chopper to ferry his father to a private hospital during a medical emergency, which reflects prosperity. However, staying sans family has its own fallout, especially during medical emergency and festivities.""Officials acknowledge that the shift to towns has been happening, but claim education facilities in the villages are not to blame. ""The availability of teachers, school infrastructure and other facilities in govt schools in the region is not below par,"" said Harsha Rawat, block education officer, Bhatwari, Uttarkashi. ""These are 'vibrant villages' wherein special funds are being provided for the upkeep of facilities, yet families are migrating because they can afford education in towns. The community needs to show inclination towards their native places too rather than getting drifted.""A source in the education dept recalled a visit by education minister Dhan Singh Rawat to Bhatwari in Oct 2024. ""He expressed apprehension regarding the closure of the intermediate school in Harsil given the rampant migration of mothers and children from the area,"" the source told TOI. ""People have to understand migration is not the solution.""Still, for mothers who pack up their lives and take their children down to the towns, that argument may ring hollow. Back in the hills, the sound of school bells may echo, but classrooms remain half-empty.","Across eight settlements, the presence of young women and children has steadily thinned.

Mumbai residents show 'will to pay' for mangrove conservation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-residents-show-will-to-pay-for-mangrove-conservation/articleshow/119779108.cms,"Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with EID Wishes, Messages and quotes !

Mangroves contribute to Mumbai in a host of ways. They protect the city from storm surges, nurture fish breeding grounds, absorb air pollution, and help filter coastal waters. But these services rarely find a place on balance sheets or cost-benefit analyses - in part because they aren't easy to quantify.Now, a new study tries to do precisely that. According to an analysis by IIT Bombay researchers, benefits provided by mangroves are worth at least Rs 1,700 crore a year to Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). For Greater Mumbai alone, mangroves provide Rs 1,155 crore worth of services annually, the study found.The findings highlight the economic value of these ecological systems, says researcher Naman Gupta. ""It allows us to consider mangroves as not just a barrier to development, but as assets.""The MMR is home to some 22,300 hectares of mangrove, while Mumbai hosts about 6,522 hectares, according to some estimates.Gupta interviewed 150 households across rural (Vasai), semi-urban (Uran), and urban (Navi Mumbai) settings - and asked whether they would be willing to pay to conserve them. About 80% of rural and urban respondents said they would be willing to pay to conserve mangroves. That willingness was lowest among the semi-urban residents in Uran (58%). However, the actual amount these Uran residents were willing to pay was the highest of the three sites - an average Rs 214 a month compared with Rs 154 among rural residents and Rs 146 among urban respondents. The willingness to pay was used to arrive at an economic valuation.Semi-urban residents might have been willing to pay more, researchers suggest, due to an increase in wealth from compensations received for acquisition of land for infrastructure projects. Many also saw how mangroves shielded their lands from cyclones .According to researchers who interviewed households across rural, semi-urban and urban settings in MMR and conducted discussions with officials and community leaders, people understood the importance of mangrove conservation and when educated about their benefits, were willing to pay to conserve them.Over half of the 150 households the researchers spoke to were aware of the protective role of mangroves against climate change as well as other benefits. This awareness was highest in rural areas where 83% of interviewees showed knowledge of climate change and 70% knew of the protective role of mangroves. About 80% of rural and urban respondents said they would be willing to pay some money every month toward conserving mangroves. That willingness was lowest among semi-urban residents in Uran (58%). However, the actual amount these semi-urban residents were willing to pay was the highest of the three sites - an average of Rs 214 a month.One reason semi-urban residents might have been willing to pay more, researcher Naman Gupta suggests, is an increase in wealth in recent years due in part to compensations received for acquisition of land for infrastructure projects. They had the highest mean income among the groups. Also, many residents in Uran saw how mangroves shielded their lands from cyclones Nisarga and Tauktae.Rural residents were willing to pay the second highest amount per month - Rs152 - despite averaging the lowest incomes, the survey found, perhaps reflecting the greater impact of weather change on rural livelihoods. ""Rural communities working in fisheries and farming are able to make the connection between climatic changes and their own lives,"" says Gupta. By contrast, urban residents were willing to pay the least amount, the survey found. Residents interviewed in Navi Mumbai were aware of the importance of mangroves, but felt the govt should be doing the job of conservation. ""Many of them said the govt has the resources and we shouldn't have to contribute,"" said Gupta.However, urban residents were willing to volunteer more time for conservation - an average of ten hours a month compared with five hours offered by rural respondents and less than an hour a month by semi-urban residents.These differing responses show there can be no single strategy in mangrove conservation, Gupta says. She hopes her assessment will provide a reference point for policymakers or spur them to undertake a detailed assessment.","Mangroves protect Mumbai from storm surges, nurture fish breeding grounds, absorb air pollution, and help filter coastal waters.

HYDERABAD: On the day Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy hailed fine rice distribution as a historic welfare scheme, Union minister and Karimnagar MP, Bandi Sanjay, on Sunday asked him to display PM Narendra Modi's photo at ration shops, citing the Centre's Rs 40 per kg contribution compared to the state's Rs 10 per kg.""We decided to supply fine rice so that every day feels like a festival for the poor.

India now 2nd-largest host of international schools as parents seek to future-proof kids’ future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-now-2nd-largest-host-of-international-schools-as-parents-seek-to-future-proof-kids-future/articleshow/119777823.cms,"MUMBAI: Once a rarefied choice for the elite few, international schooling in India has quietly become a national conversation. Today, India hosts the second-largest number of international schools worldwide — not just in name with a tag, but in affiliation with global education boards.Over the past decade, middle-class families from every corner India have found themselves at a crossroads: Should their children follow the familiar path of Indian boards or chart a new course with a foreign curriculum?At the turn of this century, the school education sector was rather different: there were merely eight institutes offering the IB programme , and the count of schools offering the Cambridge course ( IGCSE ) was so insignificant that the board did not even have records of its presence in India in 2000. By 2011-12, the two boards - Cambridge International and International Baccalaureate - had 197 and 99 schools respectively.Fresh data from ISC Research, a think-tank that tracks the world's international schools' market, shows that India, home to 884 schools in 2019, now in Jan 2025 has 972 schools, reflecting a five-year growth trajectory of 10%. For comparison, the total number of international schools grew by 8% in this time frame and now stands at 14,833. Maharashtra now leads with 210 schools aligned with IB or IGCSE programmes. Karnataka follows, while Tamil Nadu and Telangana are quickly catching up.""More Indian families, expatriates, and NRIs are choosing international schools, which is why cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi are seeing more investment from international school chains. Parents now have higher incomes, and they see global curriculums as a way to future-proof their children's careers, making sure they study in systems that match Western universities and open doors to global opportunities,"" said Abishek Pandy, ISC Research field research manager, India.What's striking is the in-roads these boards have made - reaching far beyond the cities where they first landed. International schools now dot the map in places like Hatkanagale in Sangli, Tholahunse in Davangere, and Sonaghati in Betul. ""Every year, Cambridge is adding 100 schools, and 30 to 40 new schools of IB are coming up each year. The aspiration of the middle class is at an all-time high. The phenomenon is not limited to metro cities but tier 2 and 3 cities, where the major growth now is coming from,"" said Mahesh Srivastava, former regional director (South Asia), Cambridge Assessment International Education.""The global exposure and the rising income are in short the two reasons why Indians are opting for the international boards,"" added Srivastava, capturing the dual engine driving this shift: aspiration and access.But it is not only the destination that draws them - it is also the design. Former IB representative for South Asia, Farzana Dohadwalla, believes that what draws parents in is the architecture of the learning itself.""Personalised learning, which is the smaller class sizes, is one of the main reasons according to me that parents are demanding international schools. Most schools have 25-30 students to a class. Additionally, very different strategies of teaching-learning take place; it is not didactic where a teacher stands in the front and teaches students,"" she said.Added Kunal Dalal, managing director, JBCN Education, ""The international curriculum emphasises inquiry-based learning, interdisciplinary thinking, and real-world application, fostering essential skills for future career aspirations. Furthermore, international education places a strong emphasis on experiential learning, global perspectives, and learner-led initiatives, empowering learners to become proactive problem-solvers and changemakers."" It is not just the syllabus that has changed - it is the structure, the culture, and the people. What began as a foreign transplant has rooted itself firmly in Indian soil. ""Now, 60%-70% of students who study in an international school pursue their college education in India itself,"" said Dohadwalla.The faces at the front of the classroom are also changing. Where once foreign heads guided these institutions, today it is largely Indian educators - trained, upskilled, and attuned to both global standards and local sensibilities - who are shaping the direction. International schooling may have once stood apart from India's educational tradition; today, it has become part of the tapestry, said most experts.But in the quiet calculus of modern education, perception also outweighs pedagogy for many. Educationist Francis Joseph captures this shift with candour: starting an international school, he explained, simply makes strategic sense. The process of affiliation is smoother, the branding more aspirational, and the tuition - strikingly higher - is met with little resistance. ""Will a parent pay four lakhs a year for a CBSE school? No,"" he said. ""But give it the international tag, and no one blinks.""It's not just about curriculum - it's about optics too. ""In a world where educational institutions are also real estate investments, international schools align neatly with the land-and-building models of private owners. They're more than schools; they're signals of status, carefully constructed to appeal to ambition and aspiration,"" said Joseph.Also, what began as a quiet experiment has now become a full-fledged business model - one that echoes the playbook of consumer giants. Much like FMCG companies learned to tailor their products for every price point, schools too are learning to segment their offerings for a layered marketplace like India. The result? A surge in institutions offering multiple curricula under one roof.""As cities expand and stratify, the expectations of parents evolve just as quickly,"" said Joseph. ""With spending power fluctuating , schools have learned to adapt. Dual boards - once a novelty - are now a strategic staple. A national curriculum runs alongside an international one, often within same campus, designed to appeal to families across socioeconomic spectrum.""",India hosts the second-largest number of international schools worldwide.

India boosting covert warfare capabilities of special forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-boosting-covert-warfare-capabilities-of-special-forces/articleshow/119775174.cms,"NEW DELHI: From midget submarines, loiter munitions and nano drones to specialised weaponry, surveillance and communication equipment, India is progressively strengthening the capabilities of its Special Forces to undertake covert warfare deep behind enemy lines as well as counter-terrorism operations .The upgrade in the gruelling combat training, which will include “augmented reality/virtual reality mission planners and simulators” in the near future, as well as “specialised equipping” of the Special Forces in the Army, IAF and Navy is part of an ongoing process, sources told TOI.There are now 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions (each has around 620 soldiers) in the Army, 27 `flights’ of around 1,600 Garud commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.A major shortcoming, however, is the lack of a full-fledged Special Operations Command, which would bring the disparate Special Forces together under a unified command and control structure for planning and executing strategic operations instead of merely tactical ones.Nevertheless, the creation of a truncated Armed Forces Special Operations Division (AFSOD) has somewhat addressed the issue of “jointness and synergy” among the Para-SF, Garuds and Marcos.The induction of advanced software-defined radios, including manpack versions, and satellite-communication systems, for instance, have ensured “uninterrupted and seamless” long-range communications for joint operations among the three forces, the sources said.The Special Forces already have a wide array of specialized weapons, ranging from Finnish Sako long-range sniper rifles, American M4A1 carbines and Israeli TAR-21 Tavor assault rifles to Swedish Carl Gustaf lightweight rocket launchers, Russian VSS suppressed sniper rifles and Italian Beretta pistols with silencers.“The induction of loiter munition systems has boosted the precision-targeting capabilities of Para-SF units. Similarly, remotely-piloted aerial vehicles, nano drones, surveillance copters and lightweight drones with FLIR (forward-looking infra-red) payloads have been inducted for advanced short and medium-range surveillance up to 10-km,” a source said.With stealth being paramount for insertion behind enemy lines, advanced indigenous `combat free-fall parachute systems’ and other such equipment have been inducted, while procurement of new `integrated combat diving kits’ is also underway. “Guided aerial delivery systems are now available to ensure commandos can operate independently behind enemy lines for longer durations,” another source said.Given their maritime role, the Marcos in turn have midget submarines or sea chariots, underwater scooters, remotely-operated underwater vehicles for explosive disposal, open-circuit diving equipment and air-droppable rubberized inflatable boats, among other such things.Also read: Op Brahma: India's first relief package lands at Myanmar The selection and training for the Para-SF, Marcos and Garuds, which have a rejection rate as high as 70-80%, also remains a major focus area. The training, in which the volunteers are stretched to their physical and mental limits, includes operations for surgical strikes, hit-and-run missions, strategic and tactical surveillance of vital enemy targets, intelligence-gathering, laser-designated bombings and other such clandestine tasks.The Army’s first vertical wind tunnel to enhance ‘combat freefall’ skills of its Special Forces and others is fully operational at the Special Forces Training School at Bakloh in Himachal Pradesh. “Simulators are now increasingly being used. The plan is to also induct AI-based systems soon to make the training more realistic and economical,” a source said.","There are now 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions in the Army, 27 `flights’ of around 1,600 Garud commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.

KOCHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Malayalam superstar Mohanlal expressed Sunday regret over distress caused by political & social themes in his movie Empuraan. His statement follows backlash over film's alleged portrayal of the '02 Gujarat riots, leading CBFC to mandate 17 changes.""As an artist, it is my duty to ensure that none of my films harbours animosity towards any political movement, ideology or religious group,"" Mohanlal wrote in an FB post. ""I have come to understand certain themes introduced in Empuraan have caused distress among many who care for me... We've collectively decided to remove such themes from the movie."" However, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan (CPM) and VD Satheesan of Congress defended Empuraan, condemning alleged efforts by Sangh Parivar to pressure changes to the film.The film Empuraan, starring Mohanlal, released worldwide on March 27 and grossed over Rs 100 crore at the box office, has drawn sharp criticism from BJP and RSS members in Kerala.RSS-affiliated publication Organiser claimed that some scenes were ""purposefully designed to reinforce the image of Hindus as the primary aggressors during the 2002 riots"".BJP's Kerala unit president Rajeev Chandrasekhar said he would no longer watch the movie. ""I had said that I would watch the movie Empuraan when I heard it was a sequel to Lucifer. But now I have come to know that the makers of the movie themselves have made 17 amendments in the movie and that the movie is undergoing re-censorship. I understand that there were topics in the movie that disturbed Mohanlal fans and other viewers,"" Chandrasekhar wrote on Facebook.""A movie should be watched as a movie. It can't be seen as history. Also, any movie that tries to build a story by distorting the truth is doomed to fail. So, will I watch this sequel to Lucifer? No. Am I disappointed by this type of moviemaking? Yes.""However, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan of CPM and opposition leader VD Satheesan of Congress defended Empuraan, condemning alleged efforts by Sangh Parivar to pressure changes to the film.Vijayan, who watched the film Sunday, praised its impact on the Malayalam film industry and denounced the backlash. ""I watched it amidst widespread hate campaigns unleashed by the Sangh Parivar and communal forces against the film, its actors, and its crew,"" he posted on social media.The CM accused Sangh-linked groups of attempting to suppress the film for depicting historical realities. ""The film references one of the most brutal genocides the country has seen... functionaries of BJP and RSS are issuing open threats. It is not a tribute to democracy when communalists can destroy a work of art and viciously attack artistes for taking a stand against communalism and depicting its horrors,"" he said.Congress's Satheesan accused Sangh of attempting to distort history. ""They believe that freedom of expression means the freedom to create narratives that favour them. Their agenda is to celebrate distorted creations,"" he said.He said coercing filmmakers into altering their work amounted to an attack on artistic freedom. ""It is a sign of utter failure and cowardice.

Sources said govt has also prepared a strategy to link higher insurance premiums, if one has at least two pending challans from the previous financial year.The details have been worked out following a Supreme Court order directing 23 states and seven UTs to file compliance reports indicating the implementation of electronic monitoring as provided in Central Motor Vehicles Act. Section 136A of the Act specifies deployment of advanced technologies, such as speed and CCTV cameras, speed-guns, body-worn cameras and automatic number plate recognition systems, to ensure better traffic management and enforcement of traffic laws.TOI has learnt that among the states and UTs where traffic rule violation cases are high, Delhi has the lowest rate of recovery of fines at barely 14%, followed by Karnataka (21%), Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh (27% each), and Odisha (29%). Rajasthan, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana are among the major states that have recorded a recovery rate of 62%-76%.Sources said there are several reasons why people don't pay fines quickly.

NEW DELHI: Maintaining status quo, Centre on Sunday declared the entire state of Manipur - excluding areas within the jurisdiction of 13 police stations across five districts - as 'disturbed' under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) for an additional six months.The move comes when the state has not seen any major or prolonged bout of ethnic violence for the past seven months, contrary to the trend of recurrent clashes between its two dominant ethnic groups since May 2023. Also, the political landscape has changed since the last notification under Afspa was issued on Nov 14, 2024, with CM N Biren Singh having stepped down in Feb, followed by the imposition of President's rule in the state.In separate notifications that also maintain status quo, Centre Sunday extended the validity of Afspa in parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh until Sept 30, 2025, ""unless withdrawn earlier"". As per the notification with respect to Nagaland, eight districts and 21 police stations spread over five other districts would continue to remain in the 'disturbed areas' list. Similarly, Afspa will continue to apply in Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts as well as areas falling within the jurisdiction of three police stations in Namsai district.According to home minister Amit Shah, there is now a semblance of normalcy in Manipur, with shops and markets having opened and prices kept in check, and talks between the sparring ethnic groups also on track, with one round already held at the level of the home ministry and another expected soon.In the last Afspa notification for Manipur issued on Nov 14, 2024, six police stations across the state's five districts were declared as 'disturbed' till March 31, 2025, barely one-and-a-half months after they were included in the notified list of 19 police stations kept out of Afspa purview. In a break from the usual practice of the state govt notifying the 'disturbed areas' under Afspa, the notification was issued by Centre.The move to declare six additional police stations as 'disturbed' in Nov had bucked the trend since 2014; for the first time since Modi govt assumed office at Centre, the area under Afspa within a state was being expanded.Now extending Afspa validity further till Sept 30, ""unless withdrawn earlier"", Centre Sunday notified the entire state as 'disturbed area' except 13 police stations.","Maintaining status quo, Centre on Sunday declared the entire state of Manipur as 'disturbed' under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) for an additional six months.

JAMMU: Security forces continued their “seek-and-shoot” operation Sunday in the forested Sufain area of Kathua district in Jammu division, days after a gunfight left four policemen dead. The confrontation, which erupted Thursday when a search team was ambushed by Pakistani terrorists hiding in the woods, lasted more than 20 hours and also resulted in the deaths of two attackers affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed J&K police said some of the terrorists may have escaped and are moving through the mountainous terrain, an area frequently traversed by local herders in search of pasture for their livestock. Officials have urged residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.The forces have deployed bulletproof vehicles, drones, and sniffer dogs in an effort to track the fugitives, who may be using remote mountain huts built by nomadic herders for shelter.The attackers are believed to be part of the same group that evaded capture last Sunday after a brief shooting near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain forests are about 35km from Sanyal village. A village couple had spotted five armed men moving in the area and alerted police.Security operations have since expanded, with similar searches conducted near Kathera village in Kathua tehsil and Gharh in Billawer.Kathua district has been a key route for militants for over three decades due to its strategic location. It connects Doda and Udhampur districts to the north, providing a passage to Kashmir valley. Experts said the district’s proximity to the Pakistan border and its rugged terrain with dense forests provide ideal hiding spots for terrorists.Police dismissed social media reports suggesting that terrorists had seized service weapons from the fallen policemen. “All weapons and their belongings have been accounted for,” a police spokesperson said. “Some people are spreading rumours. Strict legal action shall be taken against them.”Among those wounded in the gunfight were DSP Dheeraj Katoch, two other policemen, and a soldier from Army’s 1 Para (Special Forces). Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha visited Sunday the govt medical college and hospital in Jammu to check on the wounded men and met their families, assuring them of full support.",Security forces in Jammu continued their operation in Kathua district's Sufain forest after a deadly gunfight with Pakistani terrorists.

CUTTACK: A 22-year-old man from Bengal died and more than 30 passengers were injured Sunday when 11 coaches of Bengaluru-Kamakhya AC Express derailed near Manguli-Choudwar passenger halt on the outskirts of Cuttack.The train, carrying more than 1,000 passengers, had departed Cuttack station at 11.43am and derailed 11 minutes later after crossing Kendrapada Road station. Most of the injured are from Bengal and Assam.The derailment follows Odisha's biggest railway disaster on June 2, 2023, when the Coromandel Express rear-ended a stationary freight train in Balasore district and three of its derailed coaches whiplashed the tail end of the Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express crossing the station at the same time. The crash killed 296 people and injured 1,200.Railway officials said the cause of Sunday's derailment is under investigation, though preliminary reports suggest a track defect in an area where maintenance work was underway.Police sources said the lone fatality - Subhankar Ray of Alipurduar - occurred when he jumped from the train in panic. An autopsy is underway. Railway ministry announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the families of the deceased, Rs 2.5 lakh for those seriously injured, and Rs 50,000 for passengers with minor injuries.Dr Jayanta Kumar Panda, a professor of medicine at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, said 30 injured passengers were admitted, including three in serious condition.Residents, first responders from NDRF, Odisha fire and emergency services, and RPF helped evacuate passengers, many of whom suffered from dehydration in the heat. Rescue and restoration efforts are ongoing, with teams from NDRF and SDRF at the site.Memories of the 2023 Balasore crash prompted an immediate local response. ""Luckily, the coaches did not overturn. They had veered off the track. Had they capsised, the casualty could have been more,"" said Smitarani Swain, one of the first responders.By the time locals arrived, many passengers had already left the train. ""We provided them with assistance,"" said Swain, a volunteer with a local NGO.Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi directed top officials to oversee relief and rescue operations.

Medical colleges, which save crores each year by not paying MBBS interns any stipend or paying a stipend much lower than what govt colleges in the state pay, have been threatened with a penalty of Rs 50,000 by National Medical Commission. NMC issued a public notice on Friday about the penalty for not submitting details of stipend paid to MBBS interns.According to the notice, the commission had issued four public notices in Nov and Dec last year asking medical colleges to submit details of stipends paid to MBBS interns and resident doctors for the financial year 2023-24. This notice, more than three-and-a-half months after the last one, comes a week before the next hearing of the case on payment of stipends in the Supreme Court on April 8.The notice stated that the information was sought on the directions of the Supreme Court which ordered NMC in Sept 2023 and on April 1, 2024, to submit details of stipends paid to medical interns and residents.

The regulation allows NMC to levy a ""monetary penalty not exceeding Rs one crore per violation or act of omission by any medical institution"" after issuing ""warning with direction to comply/rectify"".

NAGPUR: PM Modi's visit to RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar's memorial at Smruti Mandir in Nagpur's Reshimbagh reaffirmed Sunday unity between BJP and its ideological fountainhead, while also suggesting consensus-building over the party's next president. This also marked Modi's first visit to Smruti Mandir in a decade since assuming office in 2014.His meeting with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat dispelled speculation of a rift between the two entities as BJP prepares for assembly polls in Bihar and Bengal.The visit coincided with the RSS's 'pratipada' programme, commemorating Gudi Padwa and the Hindu New Year. Modi and Bhagwat's interaction, their first public engagement since the consecration of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya in Jan 2024, drew scrutiny for its potential impact on the selection of BJP's next national president.The question of BJP's next president has garnered attention as the party's current chief JP Nadda has been serving an extended term since joining the Union cabinet in June 2024. With BJP's national council scheduled to convene in Bengaluru in April, discussions in Nagpur may shape the trajectory. RSS has historically played a crucial role in this process and Modi's visit highlighted its continued influence.He paid homage to RSS founder Hedgewar and the organisation's second sarsanghchalak Madhav Golwalkar. In a post on X, the PM described his visit as deeply personal & inspiring. ""Visiting Smruti Mandir on 'varsha pratipada' is special, as it is also the 'jayanti' of param pujya doctor sahab (Hedgewar). Countless people like me draw strength from the vision of doctor sahab and Guruji,"" Modi wrote.Adding another dimension to his Nagpur visit, Modi also stopped at Deekshabhoomi, the site where Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in 1956. Calling the shrine a symbol of social justice and empowerment, the PM reiterated his govt's commitment to Ambedkar's vision for India. ""Deekshabhoomi stands as a beacon of dignity and equality. Generations of Indians remain indebted to Dr Ambedkar for giving us a Constitution that safeguards our rights,"" he wrote on X.PM's visit to the RSS headquarters reaffirmed the party's ideological alignment with the Sangh.

His words seemed aimed at bridging divides, presenting festivals as a unifying thread amid the diversity of traditions and languages.The debate over the three-language policy in Tamil Nadu, as part of NEP, has been a contentious issue between DMK and BJP. DMK, led by CM M K Stalin, has accused BJP-led Centre of attempting to impose Hindi on Tamil Nadu under the guise of the three-language formula, claiming it threatens Tamil culture, identity and state autonomy. In response, top BJP members have mounted a robust counter-narrative, arguing that the policy was misunderstood, misrepresented, and politicised by DMK for electoral gains.Home minister Amit Shah last week accused TN govt of using the language issue to hide its corrupt activities, scams and scandals, stating that BJP govt at Centre is not opposed to any south Indian language.","PM Narendra Modi cites greetings sent to him in different languages for New Year and upcoming festivals in several parts of the country.

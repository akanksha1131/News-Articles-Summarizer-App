Supreme Court seeks Election Commission response on EVM verification SOPL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-seeks-election-commission-response-on-evm-verification-sopl/articleshow/118161210.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amidst continued criticism of Electronic Voting Machines by opposition parties, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Election Commission to explain whether it scrupulously followed the SC-laid down SOP for verification of authenticity of EVMs by engineers after the completion of polls.Asking the Election Commission not to delete data from the concerned EVMs, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta sought an affidavit from the EC by March 3 as Congress candidate Sarv Mitter, who lost to INLD candidate Arjun Chautala in the Rania assembly constituency of Haryana, complained through senior advocate Devadatt Kamat that the EC was “reluctant to allow scrutiny of burnt memory/microcontroller of EVMs"" and alleged that one EVM which was taken up for scrutiny showed the data empty.The same bench in its April 26, 20024 judgment in Association of Democratic Reforms had ordered that on the written request of candidates coming second and third in an election within seven days of declaration of results, “the burnt memory/microcontroller in 5% of the EVMs, that is, the control unit, ballot unit and the VVPAT, per assembly constituency/assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency shall be checked and verified by the team of engineers from the manufacturers of the EVMs, post the announcement of the results, for any tampering or modification.”The SC had also directed that “The District Election Officer, in consultation with the team of engineers, shall certify the authenticity/intactness of the burnt memory/microcontroller after the verification process is conducted. The actual cost or expenses for the said verification will be notified by the ECI, and the candidate making the said request will pay for such expenses.”Kamat said the SC in its April 2024 judgement had directed EC to devise a mechanism for checking and verification of the burnt memory and microcontroller of the EVMs but the EC “has completely failed to devise a proper mechanism and on the contrary issued directions contrary to the SC decision.”For the EC, senior advocate Maninder Singh said the SC has time and again reposed faith in the EVMs and their working and repelled attempts to take the country back to the days of paper ballot, which saw massive rigging and booth capturing by goons employed by politicians.He said the EC has scrupulously followed the SC-laid down mechanism for testing authenticity of the EVMs and argued that the other petitioner, Congress candidate Karan Singh Dalal who was defeated from Palwal assembly constituency, has filed another petition despite withdrawing an identical petition. The bench agreed with Singh and refused to entertain Dalal’s petition.Kamat said when Mitter sought verification of authenticity of EVMS in nine polling stations in Rania assembly constituency, the district election officer resorted to conducting a mock poll on the EVM used for the constituency and testing its burnt memory/microcontroller.The petitioner sought a direction to the EC to lay down a policy/memorandum for the checking and verification of original burnt memory/ microcontroller of the four components of the EVM (Control Unit, Ballot Unit, VVPAT and Symbol Loading Unit) in terms of the April 2024 judgment.","The Supreme Court asked the Election Commission to explain whether it scrupulously followed the SC-laid down SOP for verification of authenticity of EVMs. A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta sought an affidavit from the EC by March 3.

SC refuses to test validity of state laws against cow trafficking and slaughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-test-validity-of-state-laws-against-cow-trafficking-and-slaughter/articleshow/118161110.cms,"Supreme court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a PIL, which alleged spiraling incidents of violence against Muslims by cow vigilante groups, saying it has already laid down mandatory guidelines for police to act against incidents of mob-lynching and that aggrieved persons must move jurisdictional High Courts for relief.“Sitting in Delhi we cannot monitor incidents happening in different areas of various states of the country. Such micromanagement is not feasible,” said a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran.However, it said that infraction of the guidelines to deal with incidents of mob-lynching laid down in the 2018 judgment in Tehseen Poonawalla case , which is bound to be implemented in letter and spirit by police and all other concerned authorities, then the aggrieved parties can move the concerned HCs seeking redressal of their grievances.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Bhartiya Nyaya Samhita has incorporated mob-lynching as a specific offence and it is the responsibility of the states to implement the criminal laws. “For every incident happening in the nook and corner of the country, a Pil cannot be filed directly in the Supreme Court bypassing the jurisdictional HCs,” he said.Appearing for petitioner National Federation of Indian Women, the women’s wing of CPI, advocate Nizamuddin Pasha told the bench that after the petitioner pointe out large number of incidents of cow vigilante groups targeting Muslims and the police registering cases against Muslims and not against those who indulged in violence, the court had sought affidavits from all states. The responses show non-implementation of Tehseen Poonawala guidelines.The bench turned to the other plea of the petitioner demanding minimum uniform compensation for victims of mob-lynching. It refused to do so saying the compensation cannot be the same for those suffering minor and grievous injuries. Fixing a minimum uniform compensation would take away the discretion of the courts and authorities to provide adequate amounts to victims, it said.The petitioner had also challenged provisions in laws enacted by 13 states which authorize even private persons to inspect premises on the suspicion of it being used for cow slaughter or cattle smuggling. It said statutory duties cannot be delegated to private people.However, the bench said each statutory provision must be tested individually and that the SC cannot enter an exercise for generic testing of validity of all these laws. Those aggrieved by the provisions these laws would have to move concerned state HC to challenge their validity.","Supreme Court refuses to entertain a PIL alleging spiraling incidents of violence against Muslims by cow vigilante groups.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

Thai Pusam 2025: Significance



Thaipusam Rituals and Celebrations

Kavadi Attam

Piercing the Body

Fasting and Prayers

The festival honors Lord Murugan, the god of war, victory, and wisdom, and is a profound expression of devotion, faith, and penance. Thaipusam is celebrated on the full moon in the Tamil month of Thai, this year it is being celebrated on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, which corresponds with the Pusam star in the Tamil calendar.Poosam Nakshathram Begins - February 10, 2025 - 06:01 PMPoosam Nakshathram Ends - February 11, 2025 - 06:34 PMThe origin of Thaipusam is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology, specifically in the story of Lord Murugan, the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. According to Lord Murugan, a powerful and courageous warrior, was created by Goddess Parvati to destroy the demon Soorapadman and his army, who were wreaking havoc on the heavens and earth.To defeat this evil force, Goddess Parvati presented her son Murugan with the Vel, a divine spear that symbolized both power and righteousness. The Vel is believed to have magical properties, imbued with the energy of the gods. With the Vel, Murugan vanquished Soorapadman, restoring balance and righteousness. This event is commemorated during Thaipusam, marking the day when Lord Murugan received the Vel from his mother to battle the forces of darkness.Thaipusam is more than just a celebration of Lord Murugan's victory over evil; it carries deep spiritual significance for the devotees. The festival is considered a day for devotees to seek Lord Murugan's blessings, guidance, and protection. It is also a time for spiritual purification, penance, and self-reflection. People participate in the festival to honor Lord Murugan's strength, courage, and commitment to justice. The festival serves as a reminder that good always triumphs over evil, and that personal sacrifice, devotion, and perseverance are essential in overcoming challenges in life. Through fasting, prayers, and offerings, devotees express their gratitude to Lord Murugan and renew their commitment to righteousness and dharma.The most iconic and visually striking ritual of Thaipusam is the Kavadi Attam, or burden dance. Devotees carry a Kavadi, a physical structure that is often elaborately decorated, which they offer to Lord Murugan as an act of devotion and penance. The Kavadi can be a simple wooden structure or a more elaborate frame adorned with flowers, peacock feathers, and religious symbols.Another important and unique feature of Thaipusam is the practice of body piercing, where some devotees pierce their bodies with hooks, needles, and even the Vel itself. These acts of bodily pain and sacrifice are seen as an expression of devotion and penance, symbolizing the devotee's willingness to suffer in the name of their faith.They may abstain from food, drink, and other pleasures in order to prepare themselves spiritually for the festival. On the day of Thaipusam, devotees gather at temples dedicated to Lord Murugan, offering prayers, lighting oil lamps, and making offerings of fruit, flowers, and coconuts to the deity.","Thaipusam is celebrated on the full moon in the Tamil month of Thai.

: The CBSE board exams are on the horizon, it is high time for students to intensify their preparation for the pivotal academic milestone. The English exam scheduled for February 15, 2025, is more than just an assessment of language proficiency- it nurtures creativity, fine-tunes writing abilities, and possesses immense value in both academic and professional domains. Having a grasp of English is not merely an exam necessity but a timeless asset.The exam comprises three key sections: Reading Comprehension, Writing & Grammar, and Literature. The Writing section carries 10 marks. Article writing is an important segment of the writing section. It not only analyses a candidate’s writing prowess but also their analytical mindset and the ability to dive deeper into the concepts.To aid students in excelling, Ritu Sharma, a Post Graduate Teacher at ITL Public School, Delhi, has curated a set of practice questions mirroring the exam format. These thoughtfully designed exercises enable students to develop a deeper understanding of article writing techniques, enhancing their ability to construct well-articulated responses under timed conditions.Students attending online schools with the CBSE curriculum can apply these preparation strategies effectively. Despite the difference in learning environments, the exam requirements remain unchanged. Utilizing digital tools for group study, participating in virtual discussions, and accessing online resources can enhance their understanding. A disciplined approach and dedicated effort will help them confidently excel in their Science exam.Students must effectively practise the article writing questions by simulating an exam-like environment. Here are 5 important questions as suggested by Ms.Sharma:: Emma, a class VIII student, has always struggled with her self-esteem. Constant comparisons with her peers and the pressure to fit in have left her feeling insecure. This negative self-image is exacerbated by social media, where she constantly sees ""perfect"" images of others. Emma’s anxiety grows as she believes she is falling short in comparison to her classmates. Her struggles with body image and self-worth begin to affect her mental health, leading to feelings of depression and isolation. Write an article on ""The Importance of Mental Health Awareness Among Students"" highlighting the need for mental health education and the role of schools in supporting students' well-being. You are Veronica Mathew from Pune.: You are Sarah , living in Bangalore, you have recently attended a local climate change awareness event where she learned about the impact of individual actions on reducing carbon footprints. After the event, you decided to make some changes in your daily routine to help mitigate climate change. Write an article on ""The Role of Individuals in Combating Climate Change,"" emphasizing personal actions that can help reduce carbon footprints and protect the environment.: Jessica is a university student who has been attending online classes for the past year. While she enjoys the flexibility of learning from home and can access recorded lectures at her own pace, she often feels isolated and struggles to stay motivated. Her university has incorporated various online learning tools, such as discussion boards and virtual group activities, but Jessica finds it difficult to connect with her peers and engage meaningfully in group discussions. Sign yourself as Jessica of 105,Block Trinity, Kolkata. Write an article on ""The Shift to Online Education: Challenges and Opportunities,"" discussing the pros and cons of online learning and its impact on students, teachers, and the education system.”: Sarah is a travel enthusiast who has always loved exploring new destinations. Recently, she became more conscious about the environmental impact of her travel choices and decided to switch to more sustainable tourism practices. On her next trip to a coastal city, she chooses to stay at an eco-friendly resort that uses solar energy and has a zero-waste policy. She also decides to take a local train instead of flying and supports local artisans by purchasing handmade crafts. During her trip, Sarah notices that many tourists are not respecting the environment, such as leaving trash on the beaches and disturbing wildlife in national parks.

Write an article on ""The Role of Science in Addressing Global Challenges,"" highlighting advancements in science that can help solve pressing global issues like climate change, health crises, and food security.Mastering article writing for the CBSE Class 10 English exam requires a blend of creativity, clarity, and structured thought. Here are some unique and impactful tips to help you stand out:Do not rush to write the answers. Dive deeper and identify your target audience. A piece meant for students should be in a conversational tone, while an informative article requires a more formal approach.Jumping straight into writing can lead to disorganized thoughts. Instead, draft a rough outline, noting key points under Introduction, Body, and Conclusion. This helps maintain coherence and ensures logical progression.It is the index of the book that first catches our attention. The introduction of your article is of huge importance. If it fails to catch the attention of the evaluator, you might end up losing marks. Begin with an intriguing fact, a rhetorical question, or a compelling quote related to the topic. A strong introduction sets the stage for an engaging read.Each paragraph should transition smoothly to the next. Use linking phrases like ‘Furthermore,’ ‘In addition,’ or ‘On the other hand’ to enhance readability. Avoid abrupt topic shifts, as they disrupt the flow.An article without supporting evidence lacks impact. Use real-life examples, statistical data, or expert opinions to validate your points. This not only makes your writing persuasive but also reflects analytical thinking.Stuffing your article with complex vocabulary and technical jargon can reduce its effectiveness. Keep your sentences short, crisp, and straightforward. A well-structured, concise article is more impactful than a verbose one.To make your articles memorable, adopt a distinct style. Use varied sentence structures, employ literary devices like metaphors or alliteration sparingly, and maintain an engaging yet professional tone.A compelling conclusion should summarize key points and leave a lasting impression. Instead of merely restating facts, conclude with a call to action, a prediction, or a question that sparks further thought.Never submit an article without proofreading. Check for grammar errors, clarity, and sentence structure. Reading the article aloud helps in identifying awkward phrasing and refining expressions.","CBSE Class 10 English Board exam is scheduled for February 15, 2025.

Professional setback

NEW DELHI: The massive uproar over content creator Ranveer Allahbadia 's ""sex and parents"" remark at comedian Samay Raina 's "" India's Got Latent "" show only intensified on Tuesday, with people across the spectrum stepping in to condemn Allahbadia's crass comment.Allahbadia, widely popular for his YouTube channel ""BeerBiceps,"" landed trouble after a clip of him from Samay Raina's show went viral. What began as backlash from netizens quickly escalated into a national debate, drawing criticism from political leaders, a body for women's rights and other public figures.Hours after facing criticism on social media on Monday, Allahbadia issued an apology but the matter did not subside. Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske on Tuesday raised the matter in Parliament during Zero Hour, calling for a law to regulate social media. He said there was a need to enact a law to regulate social media platforms where influencers are posting ""all kinds of nonsense"" in the name of freedom of speech .""The inappropriate things they said yesterday should be censored. There should be censorship on influencers' content, and today I also raised this issue in Parliament, suggesting that action should be taken against them. If such individuals continue to spread negativity, action should be taken against them,"" Mhaske told news agency PTI.The NCW also urged information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to take immediate regulatory measures to address the prevalence of obscene content on various over-the-top (OTT) platforms and social media streaming sites.The Maharashtra Cyber Department registered the case under relevant sections of the IT Act, BNS and sought the removal of all 18 episodes of Raina's comedy show. A team of Mumbai Police was also spotted outside Allahbadia's residence on Tuesday.The Assam Police also registered an FIR against five people, including podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia and comedian Samay Raina.Allahbadia is already facing police complaints in Guwahati and Indore. Summonses are being sent to about 30 guests who have participated in the show from the first episode till now, a police official said.The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Tuesday expressed strong concern and asked Allahbadia, Samay Raina, Apoorva Makhija, Jaspreet Singh, and Ashish Chanchlani, as well as the show's producers Tushar Poojari and Saurabh Bothra to appear before it on February 17 in New Delhi.The summons came after women and child development minister Annapurna Devi said her ministry will seek a report from the NCW in this regard.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, a member of the parliamentary committee on Communications and Information Technology, said she will raise the issue for the kind of ""vulgar, blasphemous content that is passed off as comedy"".""We need to set boundaries since these platforms influence young minds and they are passing off absolute rubbish as content. The language used by Ranveer Allahbadia, which was also actively encouraged by others on that 'comedy panel', is unacceptable,"" she told news agency PTI.Calling the whole episode sad, BJP leader Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan said: ""The experiment that they have done, they have broken the law. I don't know but if the parliamentary committee has taken a decision, then they will be called"".Women and Child Development Minister Annapurna Devi said her ministry will seek a report from the NCW in this regard.Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali said mistakes by immature should not be taken seriously.""I feel people should do what they enjoy doing. Obscenity is a subject that looks bad and anybody would agree. But people are immature so their mistakes should also not be taken seriously,"" Ali said in an interview.Actor Manoj Bajpayee suggested that one achieving success at a young age should understand the environment.""This is why I say, please read the newspaper,"" Bajpayee added.Veteran actor Raza Murad told PTI: ""Some people say such vulgar things, some people abuse and there is no restriction on them yet. But anyway, better late than never. I would like to say that democracy does not mean spreading vulgarity, our constitution does not allow this.""Mukesh Khanna, who played the popular roles of Bheeshma in Mahabharata and Shaktiman, said Allahbadia's remark was ""vulgar and irresponsible"".""The problem is the youth of today has been given too much liberty in the name of 'freedom of expression'. There needs to be a limit to everything, even freedom of expression... I saw the video. He made a shameful statement, and all of them present around him, they all laughed. Nobody cared to object him,"" Khanna.Allahbadia suffered a setback for his show as singer B Praak called off an appearance on the influencer's podcast.""I was supposed to appear on a podcast, on Beer Biceps, and we cancelled that. Why? Since we are all seeing how pathetic his thinking is...

No, it's just political talk Yes, it seems likely

NEW DELHI: Is Arvind Kejriwal , who suffered a humiliating defeat in the just-concluded Delhi assembly elections, planning a rejig in Punjab? Well, both the BJP and the Congress claim that the incumbent Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is under pressure after the party's Delhi debacle.BJP leader and Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu on Tuesday took digs at Bhagwant Mann after the Punjab chief minister and his 91 MLAs met AAP chief Kejriwal in the national capital. ""A meeting was called to change the chief minister, but today’s media frames tell a different story. Have you ever seen Bhagwant Mann with his cabinet ministers? He used to speak alone in front of the media. For three years, no minister was ever seen with him in any media frame, but today, there was a large gathering with ministers standing proudly. This photo reveals what’s happening within the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab,"" Bittu said.BJP's newly-elected MLA from West Delhi's Rajouri Garden, Manjinder Singh Sirsa also took a dig at Kejriwal for holding a meeting with Punjab MLAs despite AAP's defeat in Delhi. ""He is dreaming of becoming Punjab chief minister. Just like a fish out of water, Kejriwal can not live without power and luxury,"" Sirsa said. ""The people of Punjab are self-respecting and have mellowed the arrogance of many, so, Kejriwal should stop dreaming about becoming Punjab's CM,"" he added.The Congress also targeted Kejriwal and claimed that the AAP government in Punjab may soon see a change. Congress MP Gurjit Singh Aujla wondered why Punjab MLAs were called for meeting after a loss in Delhi.""He has lost Delhi, so he should call Delhi leaders and brainstorm, but Punjab MLAs have been called. Both his models, Punjab and Delhi, have failed. Arvind Kejriwal wants to become the chief minister or wants some changes. The people of Punjab are fed up with him, no matter how many meetings he holds, it will not make any difference,"" Congress MP Gurjit Singh Aujla said.Congress MP Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa claimed that the meeting shortly after the elections only showed that AAP would break soon. ""The results were declared on February 8 and the movement has already started. Calling a meeting so soon shows that they will break soon. There will be mid-term polls in Punjab. When a party loses, there is a discussion within the state, other states are not called. They are worried that what happened in Delhi may be repeated in Punjab,"" Singh said.Kejriwal's meeting with Punjab MLAs took place amid rumours of dissent within the state unit of the party.Bhagwant Mann, speaking to reporters after his meeting with Kejriwal, dismissed speculation about dissent within AAP's state unit, asserting that Congress leaders have a history of switching parties while AAP leaders remain dedicated. Mann's remarks came after Punjab Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party.""Switching sides is Congress' culture; they talk about others but do not worry about themselves. I will ask Pratap Singh Bajwa how many MLAs they have in Delhi."" Mann said.""Bajwa has made such claims for years, let him say it ... He should not count our MLAs and instead, see how many MLAs Congress has in Delhi,"" he said.After losing Delhi, AAP has government only in Punjab. There are speculations that Kejriwal may play a bigger role in Punjab politics. AAP leaders have dismissed such reports.AAP, which ruled Delhi for a decade, suffered a major setback in the February 5 elections, losing 40 seats and its government in the national capital. The AAP could win only 22 seats in the 70-member assembly, while the BJP with 48 seats is all set to form its government in Delhi.Assembly elections are due in Punjab in about two years time in 2027. AAP, which had won 92 seats and decimated the Congress to come to power in the state, faces a stiff challenge in the state after losing Delhi.(With inputs from agencies)",BJP leader Ravneet Singh Bittu took digs at Bhagwant Mann after the Punjab chief minister and his 91 MLAs met Arvind Kejriwal.

Poll Should Paper Trails Be Used More In Elections? No, EVMs Are Enough Yes, Adds Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission of India 's (ECI) response to the pleas seeking verification of the burnt memory and symbol loading units in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in compliance with its judgement.A special bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta asked the poll panel to avoid erasing or reloading data during the verification process.The pleas sought a direction to the ECI to check and verify burnt memory/micro-controllers and the symbol loading unit (SLU) of the EVMs.The SC bench asked the poll panel to file its response within 15 days and explain the procedure adopted and posted the matter in the week commencing March 3.NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), in a new plea, had argued that the Election Commission’s standard operating procedure for EVM verification did not align with the court's ruling in the EVM-VVPAT case .In its April 26, 2024, judgment, the top court had dismissed the demand for a return to paper ballots, affirming that EVMs were secure and had helped eliminate booth capturing and fraudulent voting.However, the ruling provided an opportunity for candidates who finished second or third in the elections to request verification of micro-controller chips in 5 per cent of EVMs per assembly constituency.This verification could be sought through a written request and by paying a prescribed fee to the Election Commission of India.On Tuesday, the bench sought clarification from the Election Commission regarding the erasure and reloading of polling data.It emphasized that the court’s ruling did not require such measures but only called for verification of EVMs by an engineer from the manufacturing company.""What we intended was that, if after the polls somebody asks, the engineer should come and certify that, according to him, in their presence, there is no tampering in any of the burnt memory or microchips. That's all. Why do you erase the data?"" asked the CJI, according to news agency PTI.""We didn't want such a detailed process that you reload something. Do not erase the data, do not reload the data - all you need to do is have someone verify and examine,"" he further said.The top court also refused to entertain a fresh petition from former Haryana minister and five-time MLA Karan Singh Dalal, expressing displeasure over the concealment of details regarding a similar plea that had been withdrawn earlier.The court also directed that, starting May 1, 2024, the symbol loading units be sealed in a container and stored alongside EVMs in a strongroom for at least 45 days after the election results were declared.The bench also raised concerns over the cost of verification set by the EC after being informed that Rs 40,000 was charged for verifying one EVM.""Reduce the cost of 40,000 - that's too high,"" it said.Seeking the poll panel's response, the bench recorded its assurance that no modification or correction of EVM data would take place during the verification process.""Mr Singh (ECI counsel) states that they will clarify the position by filing a short affidavit explaining the procedure adopted by them. He also states they won't be doing any modification/correction of the data,"" it said.","The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission of India's response to the pleas seeking verification of the burnt memory and symbol loading units in Electronic Voting Machines.

NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday accused the Trinamool Congress (TNC) administration of fostering systematic corruption and weakening governmental institutions.During her reply to the debate on Union Budget 2025-26 in the Lok Sabha she said, ""It is ironical that Trinamool Congress, a party which prides itself on being rooted in the grassroots (Trinamool), now symbolises harassment and denial of rights to the people living at the grassroots.""""Trinamool Congress has institutionalised corruption, gutted institutions and Trinamool has become a by-word for exploitation,"" she added.The finance minister also alleged issues in the implementation of PM Awas Yojana and MNREGA execution. ""Like every other state, PM Awas Yojana is being implemented since 2016-17. The government has released Rs 25,798 crore towards central share. However, complaints of irregularities in PM Awas Yojana (Gramin) including selection of ineligible households were received,"" she said. Additionally, ""There have been similar complaints about MNREGA and the Ministry of Rural Development is engaging with West Bengal for satisfactory reply,"" she said.

The state's contribution to industrial production diminished from 24 per cent in 1947 to 3.5 per cent in 2021, with below-average per capita income growth spanning two decades.Further praising her government for working of the development of Bengal, the finance minister referred to several Union government initiatives in West Bengal, including the recently opened AIIMS Kalyani in February 2024. She noted the significant railway infrastructure funding of Rs 13,955 crore and mentioned the country's first Gati Shakti Cargo Terminal , which began operations in the Asansol Division.She further stated that since 2014, the Modi government has developed 38 km of metro lines, investing Rs 23,050 crore, alongside constructing more than 2,309 km of National Highway across West Bengal.Additionally, she announced that in August 2024, the CCEA gave its approval for establishing a New Civil Enclave at Bagdogra Airport in Siliguri, with a projected expenditure of Rs 1,549 crore.Apart from her jab at TMC, Sitharaman also talked about the state of India's economy. She highlighted that India is experiencing a ""speedy rebound"" from slower GDP growth, with the economy projected to grow at 6.4% in the current fiscal year.Sitharaman also emphasized inflation management, noting that retail inflation remains within the 2-6% tolerance band, and food inflation appears to be moderating. She also addressed the concerns around depreciation of the Indian rupee, which has fallen 3.3% against the US dollar, highlighting that this decline is less than some Asian peers.Additionally, regarding GST, Sitharaman dispelled concerns about rate hikes, asserting that no items have seen an increase since GST's implementation. She explained that GST rates have been reduced, with the average rate falling from 15.8% to 11.3%. She urged state finance ministers to engage with the public and emphasized the GST Council's role in recommending rates.","Nirmala Sitharaman accused Trinamool Congress (TNC) administration of fostering systematic corruption and weakening governmental institutions. The finance minister also alleged issues in the implementation of PM Awas Yojana and MNREGA execution.

India-France strategic ties to get major boost with Rafale & Scorpene deals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-france-strategic-ties-to-get-major-boost-with-rafale-scorpene-deals/articleshow/118127294.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's expansive strategic partnership with France is set to get a further boost with two mega deals being virtually finalised for direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters, as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines, which will collectively be worth almost Rs 1 lakh crore (Euro 10.6 billion).As PM Narendra Modi left for Paris on Monday, government sources told TOI that the Rs 63,000 crore deal for 22 single-seat Rafale-M jets and four twin-seat trainers for Navy is now with the cabinet committee for security (CCS), awaiting the final nod.The Rs 33,500 crore deal for 3 additional diesel-electric Scorpene submarines, to be constructed by Mazagon Docks (MDL) in collaboration with French Naval Group, in turn, will soon head for CCS after inter-ministerial consultations. ""CCS will take up the Rafale-M deal after the PM returns from France-US trip. The cost negotiations for Scorpenes took a little longer because MDL had originally quoted a high price. The aim is to ink both deals before this fiscal ends on March 31,"" a source said.The two countries are also discussing a possible collaboration between French major Safran, which already makes helicopter engines in India, and DRDO to co-develop the 110 kilonewton jet engine for the Indian fifth-generation stealth fighter project, AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft). But that is in the future. The impending government-to-government Rafale-M deal includes weapons, simulators, crew training and five-year performance-based logistics support as well as spares for the 36 Rafales already inducted by IAF under the Rs 59,000 crore contract in Sept 2016.The 26 Rafale-M jets manufactured by Dassault Aviation, with ""specific enhancements"" to operate from the deck of indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, will be delivered in 37 to 65 months after inking of the contract. ""The new inter-governmental agreement mirrors the one inked in the IAF deal. All jets are to be delivered by 2030-31,"" a source said.The first of the three additional Scorpenes, in turn, will roll out of MDL in six years, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each, after the contract is inked. The deal's cost does not yet include the price of fitting them with the fuel cell-based air-independent propulsion (AIP) developed by DRDO for greater underwater endurance.The three new Scorpenes will have ""some design modifications and improvements"" over the first six such Kalvari-class vessels constructed at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore. The plan is to fit them with the indigenous AIP, while the first six operational Scorpenes will progressively get it when they come for their scheduled refits.","Two mega deals being virtually finalised for direct acquisition of 26 Rafale- Marine fighters, as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines.

AAP Punjab netas will attend along with party members from Delhi.Stirring the pot, BJP's Tarun Chugh claimed ""countdown for Mann's government has started"", while party MLA Majinder Sirsa cautioned the CM on ""plans afoot to remove him"".Congress talked about the imminent prospect of mid-term polls in Punjab. ""More than 30 AAP MLAs in Punjab are in touch with us,"" said leader of opposition in Punjab, Partap Singh Bajwa, while Congress MP from Gurdaspur Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa predicted mid-term polls. ""It depends on how many AAP MLAs switch sides. Congress is the only option for AAP MLAs as BJP has no future in state,"" he said.AAP senior spokesperson Neel Garg, however, accused Sirsa of ""rumour mongering"" to please BJP leadership as he was in race for Delhi CM's post. ""Mann is leading a stable AAP government in Punjab and Sirsa should now worry about delivering BJP's pre-poll promises in Delhi,"" he said.""Bajwa is dreaming impossible dreams - just like 'Mungerilal'.

""Delhi got rid of 'AAP-da'and now Punjab also want to get rid of it.

NEW DELHI: BJP scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital. In particular, it was the party's performance in outer Delhi, areas bordering Haryana, that helped it rout AAP and storm back to power after 27 years. AAP, for its part, continued its impressive run in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated seats apart from winning isolated pockets with a higher number of JJ clusters and unauthorised colonies.BJP triumphed in nine of the 10 seats in the West Delhi parliamentary constituency, eight each in North West Delhi and East Delhi and seven in New Delhi. The remaining seats came from Chandni Chowk, where six of its candidates emerged victorious, and five each in South Delhi and North East Delhi.In the 2020 assembly polls, when BJP tallied just eight seats, the party had failed to win a single seat in New Delhi, West Delhi, South Delhi and Chandni Chowk. While one BJP candidate was elected from North West Delhi, three each returned from East Delhi and North East Delhi.BJP, thus, not only made inroads in urban pockets of central Delhi and New Delhi this time, but also almost swept the outer Delhi areas and rural parts of the city. ""Of the 13 seats that share a border with Uttar Pradesh, we got seven while of the 11 constituencies on the border with Haryana, we won nine,"" smiled a BJP functionary.Narela, Mundka, Badli, Najafgarh, Palam, Bijwasan, Matiala, Chhatarpur and Mehrauli were some of the prominent rural seats where BJP had failed to do anything impressive in the last two elections but where it performed extremely well this year. Surender Solanki, chief of Palam 360 Khap, said the rural voters came out in large numbers to support BJP. ""The villages, be it rural or urban, were completely ignored by Delhi govt. We ran a campaign, visited every single city village, interacted with the residents and prepared a list of demands. We approached all political parties. While AAP continued to ignore us, the PM called us as did the Union home minister and assured us our issues will be addressed. The Khap, accordingly, supported BJP,"" said Solanki.The Khap chief added that BJP managed to wrest several seats with the support of the villagers from AAP, which itself had grabbed them from Congress in 2013.AAP held on to its support base in reserved constituencies. While the party had won all 12 SC seats in 2015 and 2020, it retained eight seats this time. Similarly, people came out in large numbers in constituencies dotted with unauthorised colonies in its support. Gokalpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Kondli, Okhla, Badarpur, Tughlaqabad, Deoli, Kirari, Burari and Sultanpur Majra are known for having large clusters of unauthorised colonies.An AAP functionary explained why. ""In our campaign, we highlighted the work done by our govt to improve the amenities in the city's 1,797 unauthorised colonies. We connected these colonies with sewer and water pipelines, laid down roads, built drains and improved overall living conditions. The support we got from the residents of some of such colonies is a validation of our work.""While the Muslim vote showed signs of division in a couple of constituencies, it largely went in the favour of AAP, getting big victories for its candidates. Except Mustafabad, where the Hindu votes consolidated against a trifurcation of Muslims votes, AAP won comprehensively in Okhla, Seelampur, Matia Mahal and Ballimaran. It also performed reasonably well in areas where Muslims live in large numbers but are not the deciding force, such as at Kirari and Seemapuri.Despite being the partners in the INDIA bloc, a grouping of opposition parties at the national level, AAP and Congress contested the assembly election separately. This was to BJP's advantage. According to an analysis, there are 14 seats that BJP won because Congress garnered more votes than the margin between the winner and the closest rival. These seats are Timarpur, Badli, Nangloi Jat, Madipur, Rajendra Nagar, New Delhi, Jangpura, Kasturba Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Mehrauli, Chhatarpur, Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash and Trilokpuri.Some political observers believed that had Congress and AAP contested the election as alliance partners, the results could have been different. Although the vote cutting by Congress was evident in its candidates saving their security deposits only in Kasturba Nagar, Badli and Nangloi Jat, a Congress functionary refused to accept the theory. ""We contested the Lok Sabha election jointly and the result was we failed to win a single seat. Theoretically, one can say that the alliance could have prevented the BJP juggernaut, but the results could have been totally different too,"" the Congress member argued.","BJP scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital.

He instead assumed a new identity of Dharmendra Dave and started English-speaking classes in Chotila.In Aug 2018, Trivedi trapped one of his students, and took her to various locations in India and Nepal. He identified himself as Satnam Singh, Mukhyar Singh and Surjit Singh at different places. He sexually exploited the victim on the promise of marriage and impregnated her. She delivered a baby boy at a hospital in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand.The victim revealed the details to CBI --- which was probing her disappearance on Gujarat high court's order ---- after she finally managed to return home in June 2020.

Though the father has re-married, it cannot stand against the claim for custody; especially since otherwise, there would have been a question raised as to how the child would be taken care of; the father being engaged in his work,"" the court said.It also noted that paternal grandfather has also deposited an amount of Rs 10 lakh in the child's name and he also has also taken out a life insurance policy of Rs 25 lakh, the beneficiary of which is the minor child and it showed that the family cared about the child.""We cannot but observe that the learned Single Judge (of HC) has not endeavored to elicit the child's attitude towards his father. Admittedly, the child, after his birth, was with his parents for about 10 years till the death of his mother. He was separated from the father in 2021 and has been living with his grandparents, who cannot have a better claim than the father, who is the natural guardian. There is no allegation of any matrimonial dispute when the mother of the child was alive nor a complaint of abuse perpetrated against the wife or son,"" the bench said.","A father had his minor son taken away by in-laws after the death of his first wife.

Centre plans stiffer fines for those entering India illegally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-stiffer-fines-for-those-entering-india-illegally/articleshow/118159070.cms,"NEW DELHI: Any foreigner who enters India without a valid passport or visa could invite a jail term of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh. In case entry and stay in or exit from India by a foreigner is with a forged passport or travel document, the imprisonment will not be less than two years, but may extend to seven years, and the fine, Rs 1 lakh, can go up to Rs 10 lakh.These are provisions of the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, set to be introduced in Lok Sabha in this session, that seeks to repeal four Acts with overlapping provisions on the related subjects of immigration and foreigners, and consolidate them into a single, comprehensive legislation. The four Acts are Foreigners Act, 1946; Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939; and Immigration (Carriers' Liability), 2000.As of now the maximum penalty for a foreigner entering the country without a valid passport or travel document, including visa, is five years in jail and fine. For those entering on a forged passport, the maximum penalty is eight years in jail and up to Rs 50,000 fine.The bill also seeks to make all higher educational institutions and universities liable to share information on any foreigner admitted, with the registration officer specified for such category of foreigners. This provision will also apply to all hospitals, nursing homes and other medical institutions with lodging facilities on their premises.It is proposed under the bill that any foreigner overstaying his/her visa or violating conditions of the visa, or accessing a prohibited or restricted area, will be punished with up to three years in jail or fine of up to Rs 3 lakh, or both.The bill also proposes to hold a carrier responsible for ferrying a foreigner found by the immigration officer here as not having a valid passport or travel document/visa.The immigration officer can impose a penalty of up to Rs 5 lakh on the carrier, though not without hearing its version. If the penalty is not paid, it may be recovered by seizing or detaining the carrier that may be an aircraft, ship or any other mode of transport.The proposed legislation provides central govt powers to restrict entry of a foreigner or class of foreigners, to not depart from India, not enter a specified area, exit from India at his own cost and require him to allow his photograph and biometrics to be taken.","Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025 is set to be introduced in Lok Sabha in this session.

right to liberty

violated: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that investigating agencies are duty-bound to inform grounds of arrest to the accused while taking them into custody and failure to comply with it would render the arrest illegal. It said the requirement to inform the grounds of arrest is not a ""formality but a mandatory constitutional requirement"".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and N K Singh quashed an arrest made by Gurgaon police, saying the accused had not been not informed of the grounds of his arrest. Though the court refrained from passing an order on the mode of communication of grounds of arrest, it said it would be better if it was communicated in writing as the burden would be on the police to prove that the grounds of arrest were communicated.In a concurring but separate order, Justice Singh said the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest in writing is not only to the arrested person, but also to friends, relatives or such other person as may be disclosed or nominated by the arrested person.. The court said the right to be informed about the grounds of arrest flows from Article 22(1) of the Constitution and any infringement of this fundamental right would vitiate the process of arrest and remand. It said a police officer cannot ""casually"" arrest a person in a cognisable offence, and that it could be done only when credible information was received.The bench said, ""Thus, the requirement of informing the person arrested of the grounds of arrest is not a formality but a mandatory constitutional requirement. Article 22 is included in Part III of the Constitution under the heading of Fundamental Rights . Thus, it is the fundamental right of every person arrested and detained in custody to be informed of the grounds of arrest as soon as possible.""If the grounds of arrest are not informed as soon as may be after the arrest, it would amount to a violation of the fundamental right of the arrestee guaranteed under Article 22(1). It will also amount to depriving the arrestee of his liberty. The reason is that, as provided in Article 21, no person can be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law.""It further said, ""The procedure established by law also includes what is provided in Article 22(1). Therefore, when a person is arrested without a warrant, and the grounds of arrest are not informed to him as soon as may be after the arrest, it will amount to a violation of his fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 as well.""The court said the grounds of arrest must be informed in a language which the arrestee understands and held that it is the duty of the courts to ascertain whether compliance with Article 22(1) and other mandatory safeguards has been made while remanding the accused.""When a violation of Article 22(1) is established, it is the duty of the court to forthwith order the release of the accused. That will be a ground to grant bail even if statutory restrictions on the grant of bail exist. The statutory restrictions do not affect the power of the court to grant bail when the violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution is established,"" it said.","Supreme Court quashed an arrest made by Gurgaon police, saying the accused had not been not informed of the grounds of his arrest.

Centre can't impose service tax on sale of lotteries: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-cant-impose-service-tax-on-sale-of-lotteries-sc/articleshow/118158597.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the Centre cannot impose service tax on sale of lotteries as the lottery business comes under the State List.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N K Singh said service tax was not leviable on transactions between the purchaser of lottery tickets and the state govt and upheld Sikkim High Court's order which said all activities - from publishing of lottery tickets to participating in the game of chance, declaration of draw and even distribution of prize to the winner - fell within the purview of the expression 'betting and gambling', coming within the exclusive domain of Entry 62 - List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.The court passed the order on an appeal filed by the Centre claiming the right to levy service tax on lottery transactions. Examining various amendments made in the Finance Act, the bench said, ""We find that at each stage, the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, in order to impose service tax on the sole distributor/purchaser of the lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) have been unsuccessful. We have reasoned that the amendment to the said definition would in no way detract from the substance of the relationship between the state government and the sole distributor or purchaser of lottery tickets which is one of principal-to-principal and not of principal-agent. There being no agency and no service rendered by the respondents-assessees herein as an agent to the government of Sikkim, service tax is not leviable on the transactions between the purchaser of lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) and the government of Sikkim.""The bench said detailed analysis of the relevant provisions of the Finance Act, 1994, and amendments made thereto in light of the clauses of the agreements highlighted during the course of submissions, as well as the judgments of this court ""would not persuade us to take a different view from what Sikkim High Court has taken"". ""In view of the aforesaid discussion, we find no merit in the appeals filed by the Union of India and others,"" it said.The court noted that there was no Entry in any of the Lists of the Seventh Schedule specifically provided for levying taxes on lotteries and the power to enact laws for taxing lotteries must be understood as inherent within the expressions 'betting and gambling', as lottery activities fell within this category which is a state subject.The HC had held that the lottery was organised by the state govt through its various stockists etc but could not be construed to be a service rendered to the state govt and the question of service tax did not arise.",Supreme Court says Centre cannot impose service tax on sale of lotteries.

Donald Trump pauses US foreign bribery law; relief for Adani Group?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donald-trump-pauses-us-foreign-bribery-law-relief-for-adani-group/articleshow/118158253.cms,"Adani stocks took $55 billion hit after indictment

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing enforcement of a 48-year-old law, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), that prohibits US companies from bribing foreign government officials to get or retain business contracts.The move could potentially bring relief to Adani Group, which was indicted by the department of justice (DoJ) and US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) last year. The order signed by Trump directs attorney general Pam Bondi to pause FCPA actions until revised FCPA enforcement guidance is issued, which ""promotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources"".The order said past and existing FCPA actions will be reviewed and future FCPA actions must be approved by the attorney general. TNNThe order addresses a long-held grievance of the American business that the anti-bribery law leaves them hamstrung vis-a-vis their competitors who don't have to contend with similar restraint.The action taken by the US DoJ against billionaire Gautam Adani and his nephew, former executives of Canadian pension fund CDPQ and Azure Power for their alleged role in a $265 million bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India, was termed by some quarters as arising out of the FCPA.The case stoked a massive controversy and led to a significant slide in the group company shares, which have since recovered sharply. The Adani Group had said since the indictment, it had suffered a loss of nearly $55 billion in its market capitalisation across its 11 listed companies. However, in late November, Adani Green Energy Ltd had informed the stock exchanges and clarified that Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain had not been charged with any violation of the FCPA on the counts mentioned in the criminal indictment of the US DoJ or the civil complaint of the US-SEC.In a significant coincidence, a group of six US Congressmen have written to newly appointed attorney general Bondi, calling for a review of what they said were ""some questionable decisions"" made by the DoJ under the Biden administration, and cited the case against Adani group.""One such decision involves the questionable pursuit of a case against the Adani group, an Indian company whose executives are situated in India. The case rests on the allegation that preparations were made by members of this company in India to bribe Indian officials, also exclusively located in India,"" said the letter signed by Lance Gooden, Mat Fallon, Mark Haridopolos, Brandon Gill, William R Timmons and Brian Babin.The letter endorses the grouse of the Adani Group that they were targeted for extraneous considerations and that the DOJ under the Biden administration overplayed its hand. ""Instead of deferring the case to appropriate Indian authorities, the Biden DoJ pushed forward and indicted the company's executives without any real injury to the US interests being present,"" said the February 10 letter to Bondi. The Congressmen said there was no compelling reason to pursue a case in a manner that could complicate relations with an ally like India unless some external factors were at play. They said some of these decisions involved pursuing and abandoning cases, often against America's interest at home and abroad, jeopardising relationships with close allies like India.On Tuesday, the stocks of Adani group companies had a mixed day despite the broader market witnessing strong selling pressure since the start of the session due to weak global cues. After an initial euphoria about news related to the pausing of the FCPA in the US, the rally across the 11 group stocks fizzled out and only two stocks, group flagship Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, closed higher.The FCPA of 1977 was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business, according to the DoJ definition. Initially, the US business, reeling under the embarrassment of the Lockheed bribery scam where the American aviation major was accused of bribing the Japanese government for a hefty order, had welcomed the law, saying it would help them with their business. Originally, it applied to only Americans and certain foreign issuers of securities before it was expanded during the Clinton presidency to apply to foreign firms which do business with the US.The admiration turned to the disappointment and complaint that it had tied their hands against competition and tilted the field in latter's favour. Trump had promised to change the law in his first term. His order completes what was an important unfinished business.""It was a Jimmy Carter concept, and it sounds so good, but it's so bad. It hurts the country and many, many deals are unable to be made because nobody wants to do business,"" Trump said, dumping on a recently passed former president whom he disdained, having also blamed him for ceding the Panama Canal to Panama.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing enforcement of a 48-year-old law.

BENGALURU: Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has said his confidence in defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) continues to erode over its failure to fix delays in delivery and upgrades to the light combat aircraft Tejas.""You have to alleviate (our) worries and make us more confident. At the mom-ent, I am just not confident of HAL, which is a very wrong thing to happen,"" Singh said in a video shot on Monday, coinciding with the start of Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru. ""I can tell you (HAL) what our requirements and worries are,"" he can be heard saying, purportedly referring to the PSU. His remarks questioning the PSU's efficiency have stirred a row.Although this isn't the first time the IAF chief has slammed HAL over not adhering to timelines, his remarks questioning the defence PSU's efficiency have stirred controversy. HAL has attributed the delays to sanctions clamped on India after the 1998 nuclear tests. CMD D K Sunil said the PSU would catch up with the timelines set for the project, initiated in 1984, and the additional orders it is anticipating.HAL, which came in for criticism from previous IAF chiefs too, said Tuesday it was confident of ""delivering at least 11 Tejas-Mk1A aircraft to IAF by March-end"". This is part of an 83-aircraft contract. Multiple people associated with the project have hinted that HAL views the aircraft as being the Aeronautical Development Agency's baby. The argument is that the latter designed and developed the fighter while HAL began working only after a push for Make-in-India post-2014.On how the HAL leadership viewed repeated criticism from the air chief, Sunil said, ""I have to put it in context. You know that we (India) faced sanctions after our nuclear test in 1998, so we had to build things from the ground up. A lot of work has gone into it. The delays are not simply attributable to, you know, laziness."" He said technical issues had been resolved. ""The concern of the air chief is understandable as his squadron strength is reducing. We have promised that we will have all these structures ready. And we have conveyed this during multiple meetings at different levels,"" the CMD said.He said HAL was pushing American firm GE to consider an 80% transfer of technology (ToT) deal for the GE-414 engine that will power the upgraded variants of the Tejas, and probably India's fifth-generation aircraft AMCA, which is under development.Sunil said HAL had seen significant growth in its order book, which stands at more than Rs 1.3 lakh crore as of Dec 2024, thanks to several major contracts in the past year, including orders for 12 Su-30MKI aircraft for IAF, 240 AL31FP engines, and multiple helicopter orders for various defence forces.",Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has said his confidence in defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd continues to erode.

NEW DELHI: Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party.Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann.AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM.

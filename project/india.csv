Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday said that US vice president JD Vance understood there could be no mediation between India and Pakistan, as it would imply an equivalence between the two countries.Speaking in Washington, Tharoor, who leads Group 5 of the all-party delegation tasked with conveying India's message against terrorism abroad, said they made India’s position “very clear” to the US vice president.Tharoor said, “The meeting with VP Vance was very clear. Mediation implies an equivalence between two parties, and there can be no equivalence between terrorists and their victims. Vance fully understood our points, and so did other levels of the system.”Commenting on the Pakistani delegation also visiting the United States, Tharoor said the Americans who met the Pakistani delegation had not publicly expressed any support for the country. “We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings. But we haven’t seen those they met say anything publicly supportive or appreciative of Pakistan,” he said.Speaking about the Pakistani delegation in the United States, Tharoor noted that the people the Pakistani delegation met in the US didn't say anything supportive of Pakistan.""We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings.

I'm not anticipating anything because I've not been told anything directly. All I see is in the media, some of which is speculative. But on the whole, my view is that we are facing a situation where the country is united. And that unity was very apparent in the delegation. ""Reflecting on the five-day effort, Tharoor called the visit a success. “We had good conversations, high-level contacts, and clear outcomes. We got our message across about Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor and reaffirmed India’s relations globally.”","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said US vice president JD Vance understood there could be no mediation between India and Pakistan.

FULL: ‘Trump Won’t Tolerate...’: US State Dept Warns After Decision To Revoke Chinese Student Visas





US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students, as announced by the White House on Wednesday. This action represents a significant intensification of efforts to prevent foreign students from attending this prestigious institution.The directive halts entry for new Harvard students under F, M, or J visa categories and instructs the Secretary of State to evaluate revoking existing visas for current students meeting specific criteria, according to the White House statement on Wednesday.Citing national security concerns, the White House expressed apprehension about Harvard's foreign connections. The administration criticised the university's alleged inadequate reporting of foreign student information, noting deficiencies in data submission for three students.The White House statement claimed Harvard either inadequately reports foreign student disciplinary records or insufficiently monitors these students. Additional criticisms included the university's handling of antisemitism and its continued emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).Also read: 'Retaliatory step': Trump blocks visas for new foreign students at Harvard; here's how the University responded The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development, and spread false information, as per the White House.""Harvard has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries, receiving more than $150 million from China alone. In exchange, Harvard has, among other things, hosted Chinese Communist Party paramilitary members and partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization,"" the White House said in a statement.""Harvard has failed to adequately address violent anti-Semitic incidents on campus, with many of these agitators found to be foreign students."" it added.The President said that there are people who wants to go to Harvard but they can't get in because of foreign students. He also said that they are waiting for the foreign student lists from Harvard so that the administration can determine how many ""radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all"" should not be let back into the US.“The students? Well, we want to have great students here. We just don’t want students that are causing trouble. We want to have students. I want to have foreign students. We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there. But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that can love our country,"" he said.“We are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country. Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents, and probably for good reason!” Trump added.This development came after US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs's recent ruling, which indefinitely prevented the Trump administration from modifying Harvard's international student visa programme. This ruling came shortly after the judge temporarily stopped the administration's attempt to revoke the university's authority to enrol international students.The ongoing showdown stems from Harvard's refusal to submit to a series of federal government demands. The situation escalated recently after the department of homeland security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.Trump had already froze more than $2.2 billion in funding and now had terminated $450 million in grants to the country's oldest university.Members of the Republican Party have introduced new bills aimed at substantially raising tax rates on endowments held by elite universities, with Harvard being a primary target. The former president had previously indicated his intention to revoke the university's tax exemption privileges.Following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the US President has repeatedly criticised the university for its perceived inadequate protection of Jewish students. In response, Harvard has broadened its legal challenge against the Trump administration, contesting both the suspension of federal funding and what the institution considers to be demands that compromise its autonomy and violate constitutional principles.",US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students.

Those opposing the law are doing so due to political reasons or because they are unaware of its purpose.

Accountability, efficiency and transparency are the core principles defining the process,” he added.Significantly, only waqf properties, including those in the ‘waqf by user’ category, existing prior to Waqf Amendment Act 2025’s coming into force on April 8 that are registered with state waqf boards as per norms laid out in the 1995 Act will be able to upload their information on the Central Portal. The officials at the ministry of minority affairs said asserting that this will help weed out the possibility of bogus entries into the database.For existing waqf properties, the status has to be uploaded within six months of the portal’s launch. For new properties seeking waqf status, the process laid out under the new law will apply.For uploading details on the portal, the mutawalli (caretaker) will serve as the ‘maker’, entering property details, including registration document details. A Waqf Board official will function as the ‘checker’, reviewing and validating entries. Finally, a designated ‘govt authority’ will act as the ‘approver’, ensuring full verification before records are finalised.",Minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju has stressed that the portal in no way violates the law or the Constitution. The minister was reacting to questions regarding All India Muslim Personal Law Board's statement that it will challenge the legal validity of the portal.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121658907,imgsize-1511594,width-400,resizemode-4/121658907.jpg"

US correspondent from US: An Indian parliamentary team tasked with highlighting Pakistan's terrorist depredations has conveyed to US interlocutors that New Delhi will not talk to Islamabad ""with a gun pointed to our head"" even as a Pakistani delegation tailing the Indian team in Washington DC desperately sought President Trump's mediation between the two sides.Summing up India's stance, delegation leader Shashi Tharoor likened Pakistan to a neighbor who ""unleashes a rottweiler to bite your children and do worse and then says 'let's talk."" Talks are not possible unless Pakistan locks up the rottweilers (terrorists) or puts them to sleep, Tharoor said.Tharoor also rejected efforts to insinuate US into bilateral issues saying India has enormous respect for the American presidency and the American president, but ""we have never particularly wanted to ask anyone to mediate.""The Indian delegation met US vice-president JD Vance at the White House on Thursday morning to convey India's stance. Vance, who initially said the India-Pakistan scrap was ""not our business"" as New Delhi launched punitive strikes against Pakistan for the Pahalgam terrorist attacks, virtually greenlighting the retribution, later jumped into the fray to bring about a truce.India has since made it clear that he was merely conveying Pakistan's desire to stand down, and New Delhi will not brook any mediation.""Excellent meeting with Vice President @JDVance today in Washington D.C. with our delegation. We had comprehensive discussions covering a wide array of critical issues, from counter-terrorism efforts to enhancing technological cooperation. A truly constructive & productive exchange for strengthening India-US strategic partnership, with a great meeting of minds,"" Tharoor said after the meeting.At a press conference hours before the team met Vance, Tharoor said India can speak all the languages Pakistan speaks and is happy to talk to them in any of them if they roll up their terrorism policy and infrastructure, ""but as long as they use the language of terrorism, we will use the language of force.That doesn't require a third party,"" even as the team from Islamabad, in its meetings, rolled out the familiar trope of ""Pakistan is a victim of terrorism,"" which the Indian delegation ridiculed.In one vivid presentation, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya listed five Pakistanis and five Indians who are famous in the US to highlight the difference between the two countries. For Pakistan: Ramzi Yousuf, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Faisal Shahzad, Tashfeen Malik, and Muhammad Shahzeb Khan -- all of whom conducted terrorist attacks on the US. For India: Indra Nooyi, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Ajay Banga, Arvind Krishna -- all corporate titans who have generated billions in economic activity in the US.""India gives tech titans, Pak gives terrorists,"" Surya noted.The Indian delegation met US vice-president JD Vance on Thursday morning to convey India's stand after engaging dozens of US lawmakers from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the India Caucus, which has nearly 200 legislators, including 40 Senators, compared to the Pakistan Caucus, which has only around 50 members -- a differential the Indian side mentioned to highlight the breadth of support for India.The Pakistani team meanwhile labored to make an impression on the few meetings its cobbled together on the Hill, insisting that the Kashmir issue was an “unfinished agenda of the United Nations” despite being outed repeatedly on UN resolutions that seek Pakistan's withdrawal from the territory it has occupied.""Raised concerns over India’s recent provocations, the deepening humanitarian crisis in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir,"" Bhutto posted on X after one such meeting, even though there is no humanitarian crisis in J&K other than terrorist attacks initiated by Pakistan. The Indian delegation in fact told US interlocutors that J&K was seeing unprecedented economic activity and travel boom, ""with more tourists than in Aspen, Colorado"" before Pahalgam terrorist attack.","The Indian parliamentary team tasked with highlighting Pakistan's terrorist depredations has conveyed to US interlocutors that New Delhi will not talk to Islamabad ""with a gun pointed to our head"" A Pakistani delegation tailing the Indian team in Washington DC desperately sought President Trump's mediation between the two sides.

NEW DELHI: Russia appeared to be buying into US President Donald Trump's claim that he mediated the ""ceasefire"" in the India-Pakistan military conflict that followed India's Operation Sindoor strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan.A ccording to President Vladimir Putin's aide Yury Ushakov, the issue figured in the ""highly productive and positive"" talks that Putin had with Trump on Wednesday. In his account of the conversation, Ushakov said other than Ukraine, a number of other international issues were raised ""as well as the armed conflict between India and Pakistan, which has been halted with the personal involvement of President Trump"".Putin strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and also backed India's efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. However, Ushakov's remark about Trump's role is unlikely to go down well with Indian authorities who have repeatedly denied that the US or any other country brought the conflict to an end. India also rejected Trump's offer of mediation on the Kashmir issue, saying it will always engage bilaterally with Pakistan.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had said earlier that while American leaders were in touch with India and Pakistan, the pause in fighting was directly negotiated by the Indian and Pakistani armies, after Pakistan reached out to India for a dialogue. US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick had later said on oath in a US court that Trump had used trade to avert a full-scale war between the ""nuclear armed"" countries.Putin is likely to visit India later this year for the annual India-Russia summit. Before that, as reported by TOI on May 26, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will travel to India later this month to finalise agenda for the summit.","Russia appears to be buying into US President Donald Trump's claim that he mediated the ""ceasefire"" in the India-Pakistan military conflict.

‘Chinese Kill Chain Couldn’t…’: Tharoor Mocks Pakistan & Its Cabal As US Officials Stare In Shock

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a parliamentary delegation to the United States in a diplomatic outreach to highlight India's firm stance against terrorism, launched a scathing attack and called out the nation's long-standing policy of harbouring terrorism.Taking aim at Pakistan's parallel delegation led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto , Tharoor invoked Hillary Clinton's famous rebuke: ""How can you breed vipers in your backyard and expect them to bite only your neighbours?""The diplomatic face-off in Washington comes in the wake of Operation Sindoor , following the Pahalgam terror attack. While India has deployed seven delegations across 33 countries, Pakistan's smaller diplomatic initiative covers just five capitals - Washington, New York, Brussels, London, and Moscow.Tharoor's delegation has embarked on a comprehensive outreach program in Washington, including appearances at the National Press Club, meetings with diaspora media, and a reception hosted by the ambassador. ""The message must be spread as widely as possible — through media, diaspora, and direct government outreach,"" he said.“Indeed, I know that Bilawal Bhutto's mother was killed and one sympathise with the young man for the loss of his mother to terrorism,” he added.Addressing Pakistan's diplomatic efforts, Tharoor remarked, ""They can come with their narratives... But anybody who has followed this issue beyond official headlines will have absolutely no doubt as to what the Pakistani denials are worth — which is not very much.""Pakistan's mission seeks international mediation and the revival of the Indus Waters Treaty , which India suspended on April 23 in response to the Pahalgam attack which claimed lives of 26 people.Speaking about India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Tharoor had earlier stated in Colombia, ""The time for acting on the basis of goodwill unilaterally is frankly no longer with us.""Despite India's strong stance, Tharoor highlighted the country's balanced approach, noting, ""We sympathise with victims of terror wherever they may be. I remember Parliament once passed a resolution condemning a terrorist attack that killed 40 schoolchildren in Pakistan. But it's very difficult to sympathise with the Pakistani authorities who have unfortunately created this phenomenon.""",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is leading a parliamentary delegation to the United States in a diplomatic outreach to highlight India's firm stance against terrorism.

As India cracks down on a suspected Pakistan-backed spy ring spreading across the country, one unsettling question emerges: How did Indian influencers end up working against their own country?At the center of this mystery is Noshaba Shehzad, a Pakistani businesswoman with high-level connections and a seemingly ordinary travel agency, Jaiyana Travel and Tourism. But behind the tourist brochures, Shehzad allegedly helped orchestrate a sophisticated espionage network with the backing of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).According to sources cited by NDTV, Shehzad isn’t just a travel agent, she’s “Madam N”, an ISI codename for the woman who reportedly laid the groundwork for a sleeper cell network inside India, with a target of recruiting up to 500 operatives who could blend in with the population unnoticed.Her strategy? Start with influencers. Arrested Instagram personality Jyoti Malhotra was allegedly among the many Indian citizens Shehzad lured into Pakistan under the pretext of cultural trips and tourism.But what began as guided visits soon turned into groundwork for spying.Sources say Shehzad worked hand-in-hand with Pakistani officials and ISI handlers, even manipulating the visa process through the Pakistani Embassy in Delhi.With just a call to key officials like Suhail Qamar (First Secretary, Visa) and Umar Sheryar (Counsellor, Trade), Shehzad could reportedly get Pakistani visas approved almost instantly for people she handpicked.She was also in close contact with Danish aka Ehsan-ur-Rehman, a known ISI operative working at the embassy until he was expelled in May—shortly after Malhotra’s arrest. Notably, Madam N’s husband is said to be a retired officer of Pakistan’s civil services, adding another layer to her insider access.Though there is no official tourism corridor between India and Pakistan, Shehzad allegedly managed to send over 3,000 Indian citizens and 1,500 NRIs across the border in just six months. Many of these trips were organized under the banner of religious pilgrimage, Sikh and Hindu yatras permitted only through her agency, thanks to a tie-up with Pakistan’s Evacuee Trust Property Board.Investigators believe the agency was used not only to facilitate travel but also to funnel funds into anti-India propaganda efforts. Pilgrims were reportedly overcharged, with the excess diverted for covert operations.Shehzad’s network didn’t stop at Pakistan’s border. She’s said to have recruited travel agents in Delhi and other Indian cities, creating a domestic pipeline to push unsuspecting Indian citizens into her espionage web.",Noshaba Shehzad is a Pakistani businesswoman with high-level connections and a travel agency.

He was explaining his biting remarks that were apparently directed at Congress officebearers who ran down the govt campaign.Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing. Congress MP Manish Tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in Gulf and African countries, where it effectively ""busted false equivalence"" Pakistan has drawn between Palestine and Kashmir, and sensitised the hosts about Pakistan's terror agenda against India.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a delegation that is in the US at present, said, ""I think anybody who thinks that working in national interest is some sort of anti-party activity really needs to question themselves rather than us.""However, unfazed by the criticism of these party members, Congress continued its offensive against the programme, saying the foreign visits achieved little with the delegations failing to meet big leaders in host countries.When asked about Khurshid's praise of the outreach, All India Congress Committee spokesman Ajoy Kumar said the issue was not about any party or individual because it is govt that decides the script for any such delegation. ""And the problem is that govt did not give the script,"" he felt.Kumar added that the delegations did not even name China as the force behind Pakistan's devious agenda or call out US president Donald Trump for his claim that he was behind Indo-Pak ceasefire. ""The media was busy pitting Congress against Congress by talking about Tharoor, etc, but this was Modi's surrender,"" he claimed.Nevertheless, Khurshid stuck to his guns and said he had been in touch with the party high command throughout the tour.Citing an example of what the trip had achieved, he said Pakistan had to issue a ""frustrated press release"" after his delegation's three-day visit to Malaysia.""While some questions were raised by Malaysia, given its strong membership of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, we received a firm letter of support from the prime minister of Malaysia. We saw no indication of any hesitation in backing India,"" Khurshid pointed out.","Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing.

PUNE: IMD indicated on Thursday a potential revival of southwest monsoon between June 12 and 18, following a stall since May 29.An IMD official said a system may form over Bay of Bengal on June 12-13, though uncertainties persist due to conflicting model outputs. ""Some models suggest a system formation, others do not. We are not confident enough to include it in our forecast yet,"" the official said.The extended-range forecast, however, points to a monsoon revival during the specified period, irrespective of whether a system forms or not. Post-revival, the IMD anticipates robust rainfall across central India, parts of Maharashtra and south peninsular India (parts where monsoon has already advanced).The forecast brings hope to regions grappling with dry spells as monsoon's progress has been sluggish over the past week. The IMD official said: ""The monsoon's advance across other regions post-revival will hinge on rainfall distribution and establishment of monsoon winds.""An extended range forecast by IMD indicated that southwest monsoon was likely to advance over some more parts of central and east during the week June 12 to 18.For the same week, it said fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls were likely over many parts of south Peninsular and adjoining central India due to the strengthening of westerly winds and likely development of an off-shore trough off the west coast.Overall rainfall activity was likely to be above normal over south peninsular India; normal to above normal over many parts of central India and below normal over northwest, east and northeast India from June 12-18, the IMD extended range forecast stated.Private forecaster Skymet Weather Services, however, expressed greater confidence in the formation of a monsoon system over Bay of Bengal.""A precursor cyclonic circulation is expected to develop over the west-central Bay of Bengal by June 10. It will take another 48 hours for reorganisation and consolidation,"" Skymet president G P Sharma said. According to Sharma, the system is likely to trigger weather activity along the coastline from June 11. ""The weather system may track slightly south of its usual path, moving across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over misuse of Sec 498A of IPC that criminalises cruelty in matrimonial homes and dowry harassment, Supreme Court has quashed a case lodged 23 years ago by a Delhi Police woman sub-inspector against her husband, a colleague, and his entire family.Allowing the husband's appeal and quashing the case, a bench of justices B V Nagarathna and Satish C Sharma exercised SC's exclusive powers under Art 142 of the Con-stitution to quash the FIR lodged in 2002 at Malviya Nagar in Delhi and the charge sheet filed against the policeman, his parents and five sisters.""It is rather unfortunate that the complainant being an officer of the state has initiated criminal machinery in such a manner, where the aged parents-in-law, five sisters and one tailor have been arrayed as accused,"" it said.Writing the judgment, Justice Sharma said: ""Even if the allegations and the case of the prosecution is taken at face value, apart from the bald allegations without any specifics of time, date or place, there is no incriminating material found by the prosecution or rather produced by the complainant to substantiate the ingredients of 'cruelty' under Section 498A IPC.""

Census to pave way for nationwide delimitation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-pave-way-for-nationwide-delimitation/articleshow/121660013.cms,"Entire Census 2027 data may be released in 3 yrs

NEW DELHI: Population data returned by the upcoming 'Census 2027', due to begin on April 1, 2026, will pave the way for a countrywide delimitation of Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies, as the March 1, 2027 reference date makes it ""the first Census to be held after 2026"".However, the chances of delimitation being completed in time for the 2029 general election appear bleak, given that the final population data may take time to be published. The final population data for Census 2011 was published almost two years after release of the provisional data in March-end 2011. Even with a 'digital' Census - which is expected to facilitate early release of tables - there may be a considerable time lag between completion of the exercise in March 2027 and availability of the final population count to enable initiation of the delimitation process.The home ministry on Thursday took to X to explain the delay in conducting the Census, put on hold five years ago due to the Covid outbreak, stating that hiring lakhs of school teachers as enumerators would have immensely disrupted primary education already hit by the pandemic.The home ministry also cited issues in quality and coverage of Census conducted by other countries immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.The Census declared by govt on Wednesday fulfils the criterion laid down in the 84th constitutional amendment for a fresh countrywide delimitation.“The relevant cutoff here is the March 1, 2027 reference date for the upcoming Census. Population enumeration is to be done in Feb 2027, and the population count — the primary input for the next delimitation — will be recorded as on March 1, 2027. Thus, the criterion of the upcoming Census being the first Census after 2026 is fulfilled,” said former chief election commissioner (CEC) N Gopalaswami, who was also ex officio member of the last Delimitation Commission chaired by Justice Kuldip Singh. Jay Vinayak Ojha from Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy added, “Article 82 of the Constitution provides for readjustment of seats between and within states after each Census. The 42nd amendment, passed in 1976, had provided that readjustment of constituencies would take place based on the figures of the first Census to be taken after the year 2000.Delimitation takes time — a couple of years, at least, though the 2002 one had taken six years — as it involves consultations with MPs, MLAs, state chief electoral officers, as well as public meetings in all states/Union Territories to record suggestions and hear objections and claims. Sources indicated that the entire Census 2027 data may be released in around three years; the population figures, much earlier. Interestingly, Finalising delimitation prior to the 2034 general election will work well in terms of plans to switch to ‘one nation-one election’ system, and the implementation of one-third reservation for women in legislature.","Census 2027 will pave the way for a countrywide delimitation of Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies.

1st passenger train to Srinagar on Saturday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-passenger-train-to-srinagar-on-saturday/articleshow/121659886.cms,"LUCKNOW: Neetu Sapra has bittersweet memories of the 14 years she spent in J&K since 1997.""No quarters, peak insurgency, Kargil War - it was a roller coaster,"" she says of life in a CRPF camp in Srinagar with a two-year-old son and a railway officer husband handling a project as fraught with danger as it was technically daunting. ""On a shopping trip to Lal Chowk in 1998, we narrowly escaped a bomb blast. The USBRL shaped us as much as we shaped it.""Neetu's story is intertwined with the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) that PM Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate Friday, marking the physical bridging of what was once considered a geographical implausibility: seamless rail connectivity from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.""Wives of all railway personnel associated with USBRL would have similar stories to tell,"" says Neetu, whose husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.Sapra was posted in Udhampur when former PM H D Deve Gowda laid USBRL's foundation stone in Udhampur in early 1997. Many thought the task of carving a route through the undulating, terrorist-infested terrain was a fanciful idea.By April that year, India had a new PM in I K Gujral, and a second foundation ceremony was soon planned in Srinagar for the Qazigund-Baramulla section.Sapra recalls receiving an official note from his senior colleague Sandeep Gupta - the executive engineer assigned to lead the 13-strong technical team - to proceed to Srinagar for the July 12, 1997, event.With the odds as steep as the Pir Panjal, the team got cracking. ""Srinagar was synonymous with militancy. Nobody was prepared,"" Gupta, who retired as USBRL's chief administrative officer in Feb this year, writes in the 2009 TOI coffee table book, 'Linking Paradise: A Northern Railway Project'.""We had no choice but to dive in. This was bigger than us,"" he writes in the book, remembering how his team got by erratic phone and electricity connections and an inadequate number of vehicles.Sapra's trip to Srinagar from Udhampur to lay the ground for the foundation ceremony prepared him for what lay ahead.""Just 13km beyond Udhampur, we dodged the possibility of death by a few metres as a landslide occurred in front of our eyes. The national highway was blocked for 48 hours."" A week later, Gupta joined them, reaching Srinagar on a rickety van. A team from CRPF's 69th battalion was then occupying the railway-owned holiday home in Srinagar's Tulsi Bagh, leaving Gupta's team to cram into four dingy rooms within the complex.""We had only candles for light and hauled water in buckets from CRPF tankers,"" says Sapra, currently principal executive director in the Research Design and Standards Organisation in Lucknow.Living conditions and logistics remained a challenge throughout. The state power department refused to restore electricity to the railway facility, citing unpaid bills throughout a decade of unrest. It took several meetings with the then divisional commissioner of Kashmir, SL Bhat, for power supply to be restored. Mudassara, the PA to DoT's then general manager, intervened to provide landlines.On Nov 12, 1997, a railway survey team comprising two officers, three junior engineers and six helpers reached Nowgam (later named Srinagar railway station) on a cloudy, uneasy morning. Locals mistook them for a police raid party, causing an already tense situation to almost spiral out of control.""I had butterflies in my stomach due to sheer anxiety and fear,"" Gupta recalls in his essay.Every day, a road-opening party would set out ahead of the railway survey team to detect and defuse potential mines. After spending weeks studying topography sheets and working out other details, Gupta and Sapra drove the first two wooden pegs into the ground to mark the project's first alignment.""It felt like we had planted a dream,"" recalls Sapra.As winter took hold, the survey covered Pampore and Kakapora. The first snowfall of 1997 came on Nov 27. Work had to be halted by Dec 15. The team would return next April to resume work.""On our off days, we hunted for vegetarian food in Srinagar. However, the CRPF wasn't happy about our venturing out of the railways complex,"" reminisces Gupta.While surveying Anantnag, the team would run into surrendered militants still carrying AK-47s. ""They looked intimidating, but didn't do us harm; in fact, they seemed encouraging,"" says Gupta.By Oct 31, 1998, the Qazigund-Baramulla survey report was ready. The railway team didn't just beat the odds; they completed the task ahead of schedule.After the Baramulla-Qazigund section, Sapra and his colleagues were asked to survey the proposed Katra-Qazigund stretch. That was in 2001. The then rail minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation for this portion two years later.""During the survey, we closely observed how difficult life was for people of the Valley. Pregnant women, critically ill patients and elderly people would be brought down from hilly terrain on makeshift palanquins as there were no roads. Mules and horses were the only modes of transport to ferry goods,"" recalls Sapra.Just when things seemed to be going well, tragedy struck on June 25, 2004, when IRCON engineer R N Pundhir and his brother were kidnapped and killed by terrorists at Sugan in Shopian. ""It was a jolt. Work paused. But buoyed by local sympathy and police support, the railway men restarted with the same zeal,"" writes Bhanu Prakash, the then deputy chief engineer of USBRL, in his memoir.The first trial run in Oct 2008, from Budgam to Kakapora, was a milestone in more ways than one. A Hindu priest, a Muslim cleric and a Sikh granthi presided over prayers before the train rolled in at 30kmph. ""Locals lined the tracks and children skipped school to see the trial run. Even the cattle seemed puzzled!"" recounts Bhanu.By the time the Qazigund-Baramulla section was commissioned in 2009, tracks were ready for trains to run at speeds of up to 100kmph.Built at a cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, including a parallel highway, the 272km rail route has 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, including the world's highest, the Chenab Bridge.The rail route promises all-weather connectivity, slashing the 800km Delhi-Srinagar journey to under 13 hours.This isn't just a story of steel tracks, concrete arches and staggering statistics. USBRL is an odyssey of workers and officials fighting the elements, braving the threat of guns, and enduring separation from their families to finally ""connect"" Kashmir to the rest of India.",The Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) will be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on Friday.

accidental gunshot injury

, rules SC

NEW DELHI: The friendship between Vaibhav and Mangesh, who studied homeopathy, came to a tragic end in Sept 2010, when Mangesh, while playing with Vaibhav's father's service gun, accidentally shot himself fatally. A panic-stricken Vaibhav dumped the body and cleaned up the scene of the accident.The trial court and Bombay high court concurrently convicted him of murder in 2012. Over a decade later, Supreme Court acquitted Vaibhav of murder charges.The trial court had believed the prosecution's version of events - that Vaibhav killed Mangesh using his father's service gun when the latter came to drop him home after college. He then called two of his friends to help dispose of the body and clean the blood stains at the scene of the crime. HC had dismissed his appeal.In SC, the bullet's trajectory came to Vaibhav's rescue.The bullet had exited from the downward portion of Mangesh's skull and then hit the ventilator above the door. His counsel argued that such a trajectory was only possible in case of a suicidal death and not homicidal.On the conduct of the accused, the counsel said the young man panicked seeing his friend motionless in a pool of blood. Fearing his father's wrath, he dumped the body and cleaned the scene ofhis friend's accidental death.A bench of justices B V Nagarathna and Satish C Sharma said, ""No doubt, the deceased was shot by the pistol belonging to the father of the appellant and in the house of the appellant, but the pertinent question that craves for an answer is - who pulled the trigger? Despite two rounds of litigation, the question is yet to find answer.""Doing the work of a detective with a keen eye for details, the bench said while the trajectory of the bullet was admittedly upwards as it hit the ventilator, which was at a much higher level than the height of the deceased, the prosecution's story was that Vaibhav shot Mangesh in the eye without proving the trajectory of the bullet.Writing the judgment, Justice Sharma said, ""The prosecution version remains acceptable only till the point of entry of the bullet through the eye, but it starts becoming cloudy when the upward trajectory of the bullet is analysed further... Such a trajectory of the bullet could have been possible only if the deceased was sitting and looking downwards towards the barrel of the pistol from a close distance. It was only then that the bullet could have hit the ventilator despite exiting from the lower part of the skull.

Delhi and Karnataka reported two Covid deaths each.In Delhi, the govt said, a five-month-old child with a history of seizure disorder and an 87-year-old man with a history of heart and kidney disease died with Covid-19.All three Covid deaths reported from Maharashtra involved elderly persons with a history of comorbidities, while in Karnataka, the deaths involved a 65-year-old cancer patient and a 42-year-old man with a history of respiratory illness.The total number of Covid deaths in the country this year has now reached 51, with Maharashtra recording maximum 17 such deaths, followed by Kerala (9), Delhi (7), Karnataka (6), Tamil Nadu (4), Gujarat (2), UP (2) and one each from Bengal, Rajasthan, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh.

"50k CRPF troops, drones, bomb squads & canine teams to guard Amarnath yatris",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50k-crpf-troops-drones-bomb-squads-canine-teams-to-guard-amarnath-yatris/articleshow/121659639.cms,"NEW DELHI: Surveillance drones, bomb disposal squads and canine teams will be deployed along the two designated routes of the Amarnath Yatra as part of heightened security measures that also include the highest-ever deployment of CRPF personnel for the 38-day pilgrimage.Nearly 50,000 CRPF personnel, in addition to J&K Police, will fan across the route of the yatra, engaging in road opening duties to detect and defuse IEDs, besides having quick action teams stationed at vantage points. All approach roads to the NH will be blocked when the yatri convoys, escorted by CRPF troops equipped with satellite phones, will pass through. All convoys will have jammers.The Amarnath Yatra, which is much shorter than its 52-day edition last year, comes in the wake of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which killed 25 tourists and a local, and led to retaliatory strikes on terror bases in Pakistan as part of Operation Sindoor. When the Pakistani forces hit back by trying to target civilian settlements and military assets, Indian armed forces responded with full force, carrying out precision strikes on several military targets in Pakistan.Like the past year, there will be radio frequency IDs for both yatris and convoy vehicles to help forces track their journey. Drones will keep an eye on suspicious movement along the yatra routes and quick action teams will swoop in to neutralise such elements before they can strike.","Nearly 50,000 CRPF personnel, in addition to J&K Police, will fan across the route of the yatra.

Yunus has been an effective figurehead but needs to move faster to retain popular support: David Taylor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yunus-has-been-an-effective-figurehead-but-needs-to-move-faster-to-retain-popular-support-david-taylor/articleshow/121656787.cms,"Former Dean of Humanities and Interim Pro-Vice Chancellor of the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh's Chittagong talks to TOI about the forthcoming polls

and the challenges in Dhaka's political transition

Ten months down the line do you think that the Yunus government has been successful in carrying out key reforms as was demanded by the July-August protesters?

What is your opinion of how the interim govt has handled Islamic fundamentalism and the rise of the Jamiat's influence in the country?

How has the political climate impacted the welfare of minorities, especially Hindus? There have been reports of persecution of Hindu residents.

Major political parties like BNP have demanded early elections preferably by December. The demand has now been endorsed by the army chief. Do you see the Yunus govt committing to the deadline of Dec 25-Jun 2026?

How do you see the Bangladesh army's role in the current situation? It was initially criticized for having abandoned former PM Sheikh Hasina.

Students in the country have metamorphosed from a group of protestors to a political party. As a former Pro-VC do you think they have the capability and capacity to meet the aspirations of the people?

As someone who was teaching and mentoring women students till recently what is your opinion of women's freedoms in Bangladesh? Are they more free now than before?

You have studied civil society in south Asia closely. Chief advisor Yunus was very successful at groundbreaking volunteer work and creating the SHG system in Bangladesh that has been lauded by the world. Do you think his transition as a politician has been as successful?

Do you think elections can be inclusive and fair when one of the major political parties has been banned?

Progress in carrying out key reforms has been slower than the protesters had hoped. Yunus's strategy has been to try to create a consensus around a list of reforms, some of which will require major constitutional changes. This consensus has not been easy to achieve, given the political divisions between the major parties as well as the expectations of the protesters. The dilemma that he faces is that to produce a well thought out programme of reform will take time, while the political parties that had lost out during the period of Awami League rule want to seize the moment to come to power.The evidence here is somewhat anecdotal and I don’t feel I have enough data to make an informed comment. The interim government has created space for the Jamaat by lifting the ban on its activities but it is too early to say whether it has been able to enlarge its support base. Nor is it clear how far the Jamaat is prepared to operate within the constitutional framework that the interim government puts in place.As far as I can see, the reports of attacks on members of the Hindu minority are best seen as isolated, if worrisome, events rather than part of any concerted campaign. However, times of political uncertainty such as the present create conditions in which such attacks are more likely.This is the dilemma that Yunus and his colleagues face. The logic of democracy would call for early elections but the most likely beneficiary of early elections would be the BNP, which in many ways is part of the previous political system against which the students revolted. The BNP had been the target of state repression under the Awami League, it’s true, but its approach to political power would most likely be very similar in its use of patronage and its vulnerability to corruption.As in Pakistan, the army has the power to intervene in politics either directly or indirectly. While it is clear that its decision not to back Sheikh Hasina’s violent crackdown on protesters was crucial in her downfall and that it preferred to bring in an interim government, it also seems plausible that it really does want to see fresh elections and a fresh start. There are parallels here with its role in the 1990s upheavals in Bangladesh.Students in many countries have taken the lead in protesting against autocratic regimes but the next step of creating a permanent voice in politics is often very difficult. In Bangladesh the National Citizen Party represents the view of an important section of the student movement but it is likely to find it difficult to sustain a sufficiently high level of support to win power.I don’t see a major shift in the position of women in Bangladesh. Economic development over the last few decades has created new opportunities for women from all socio-economic classes but there have been only gradual changes to social expectations of women’s roles except among small sections of the middle and upper class.Muhammad Yunus has been an effective figurehead for a process of political transition but needs to move faster if he is to maintain popular support.There’s huge public feeling in favour of banning the Awami League, given the experience of the July/August 2024 movement and the use of state violence against it, but there’s also a significant residual support for the party as well. If it can’t participate, it may shore up trouble for the future.",The BNP has been banned from holding elections for a year and a half. The party is expected to make a comeback after the ban is lifted. The BNP is also expected to win back some of the votes it lost in the last election.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121656812,imgsize-52594,width-400,resizemode-4/121656812.jpg"
"‘Political class showed mutual understanding’: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat calls for lasting political unity post-Pahalgam attack, warns against forced conversions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-class-showed-mutual-understanding-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-calls-for-lasting-political-unity-post-pahalgam-attack-warns-against-forced-conversions/articleshow/121655766.cms,"RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat calls for lasting political unity post-Pahalgam attack, warns against forced conversions (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday urged that the political consensus and swift government response seen after the Pahalgam terror attack in April should become a lasting feature of India’s national security approach.Speaking at the concluding event of the Karyakarta Vikas Varg in Nagpur, he praised the collective political will and military resolve demonstrated in the aftermath of the attack.“Action was taken after the heinous terror attack in Pahalgam. The valour of our Army shone once again in it. The firmness of the administration was also seen. The political class showed mutual understanding. The society gave the message of unity. This should continue and become a permanent feature,” Bhagwat said, referring to retaliatory actions under Operation Sindoor , including strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK.He said the people were angry after the massacre of tourists in Pahalgam on April 22 and wanted justice, which led to the military response. Operation Sindoor marked a significant escalation, with Indian armed forces bombing terror-linked airbases in Pakistan and repelling drone attacks.Bhagwat warned that enemies were engaged in a proxy war against India. “Those who can't win a direct fight with India want to bleed our country by the policy of a thousand cuts,” he said, invoking Winston Churchill’s WWII speech to highlight societal resilience.“Churchill had said that society was the true lion, and he merely roared on its behalf.”He further called for national unity and restraint, cautioning against provocation and internal conflict. “No group or class should come into conflict with another. Acting impulsively or taking the law into one’s own hands is not in the country’s interest.”Bhagwat came down strongly against religious conversion through coercion or inducement, calling it a form of violence. “Conversion is violence. We are not against it when done by choice. But luring, forcing and pressurising is something we are against,” he said, adding that such acts insult people’s ancestors and heritage. “We are with you (in the fight against conversion),” he told tribal leader and former Union minister Arvind Netam, who was present as chief guest.Netam, hailing from Chhattisgarh, echoed these concerns and criticised successive governments for ignoring religious conversions in tribal areas. “I think RSS is the only institution which can help us in this area,” he said, urging the Sangh to push the central government for a post-Naxalism action plan to prevent recurrence.He also criticised the non-implementation of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), saying it was vital for tribal self-governance and community empowerment.Earlier, in an interview with Organiser, Bhagwat had said India must become militarily and economically self-reliant, asserting, “We have no option but to be powerful as we have been witnessing the wickedness of the evil forces on all our borders.” He emphasised that true strength must be matched with righteousness, or it risks becoming directionless and violent.The RSS chief concluded that unity, moral strength, and readiness are the pillars of a resilient and powerful India. “Our roots lie in unity, not in division,” he said.","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat calls for lasting political unity post-Pahalgam attack.

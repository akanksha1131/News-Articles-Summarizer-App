History will blame Nitish Kumar more than BJP: Prashant Kishor on Waqf bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/history-will-blame-nitish-kumar-more-than-bjp-prashant-kishor-on-waqf-bill/articleshow/119890705.cms,"Prashant Kishor (PTI file photo)





Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor on Wednesday called the Waqf Amendment Bill an attempt at political polarisation and also attacked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for supporting it.Speaking to ANI, Kishor said the Bill is being pushed through without taking the affected communities into confidence. He pointed out that many Muslims feel threatened by it and criticised the government for rushing the legislation.""It is unfortunate... If changes impact any section, they should be taken into confidence. Many Muslims feel threatened. The government is rushing this for polarisation politics,"" Kishor said.Kishor did not hold back in his attack on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. He argued that the BJP does not consider Muslims its vote bank, but leaders like Nitish Kumar claim to support the community while backing laws that harm them. He accused Kumar of hypocrisy, saying that despite invoking leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Jayaprakash Narayan, Kumar is helping the BJP pass a Bill that many Muslims oppose.""The government does not have a majority in the Lok Sabha. If leaders like Nitish Kumar refuse to support this Bill, it cannot become law. When history is written, the blame for this law will fall more on leaders like Nitish Kumar than on the BJP,"" Kishor said.Last week, Kishor also participated in a protest against the Waqf Amendment Bill organised by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) at Gardanibagh in Patna.His party, Jan Suraaj, has been trying to appeal to Muslim voters by presenting itself as an alternative to the RJD. He claims that Muslims vote for RJD out of fear of the BJP and accuses Nitish Kumar's JD(U) of betraying them.The Waqf Amendment Bill is set to be tabled in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. The bill has faced resistance from opposition parties and Muslim organisations like the AIMPLB. Despite opposition, the NDA has a majority in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, making its passage likely.",Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor attacked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.

Poll Do you think MS Dhoni can still perform at a high level in cricket? No, not anymore Yes, definitely

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

GUWAHATI: Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) are facing a tricky situation regarding MS Dhoni ’s batting position. Having drawn a lot of criticism for coming in to bat at No. 9 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last week, Dhoni came in to bat at No.7 on Sunday against Rajasthan Royals.His team needed 54 off 25 balls at that point, but Dhoni couldn’t take this team over the line. When he departed after scoring 16 off 11 balls (1x4, 1x6) — Shimron Hetmyer taking a superb catch at deep mid-wicket — CSK still needed 19 off the last five legal deliveries from Sandeep Sharma. They failed to go the distance and lost by six runs.Asked to explain Dhoni’s flickering appearances with the bat and his changing batting positions, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming said, “It’s a time thing. It’s MS who judges it. His body, his knees aren’t what they used to be. He’s moving okay but there’s still an attrition aspect to it. He can’t bat 10 overs running full stick. So, he will gauge on the day what he can give us.“If the game is in the balance, he’ll go a little bit earlier and he backs other players when opportunities are up. So he’s balancing that. I said it last year, he is too valuable to us for leadership and wicketkeeping. To throw him in at 9, 10 overs... he’s actually never done that. So, from around 13, 14 overs he’s looking to go depending on the situation,” the former New Zealand captain said.Analysing their second straight loss this season after the opening win against Mumbai Indians, Fleming said, “It’s probably the two Powerplays. Our Powerplay with the ball went for best part of 80 runs and we were only able to manage mid-40s or early-40s. That’s the big difference.""We were also sloppy in the field compared to Rajasthan, who were outstanding. The start of a new three-year cycle (following a mega IPL auction) is always a little bit difficult, especially if you’re just short of a little bit of form.”","MS Dhoni came in to bat at No.7 against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Defying resistance from opposition parties and Muslim bodies like All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), the govt has decided to seek passage of Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, clearing the way for a showdown in the House.With the numbers arrayed on its side thanks to support from 'secular' allies TDP, JD(U) and LJP, the govt has also decided to push for the bill to be passed by Rajya Sabha on Thursday.The INDIA bloc met on Tuesday evening and decided to participate in the debate and oppose it with gusto, with the leadership agreeing against any disruption or boycott when the legislation is taken up.Sources said there was complete unanimity that opposition should put forth its viewpoint on Waqf (Amendment) Bill forcefully. They will seek voting on the bill.Govt's urgency and determination, significant in view of the 'black armband' protest by Muslim organisations in different parts during Eid prayers, was evident at the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting Tuesday with govt not agreeing to opposition's demand for a 12-hour discussion in LS, something which would have raised doubts about passage of the bill in Parliament by Friday when the Budget session concludes. Lok Sabha will now have an eight-hour debate which, by all accounts, is going to be a stormy affair.A teaser of what could unfold was on display at BAC meeting when opposition, unhappy with Speaker Om Birla's assurance that he was open to extending the debate depending on the views of the House, walked out.Majority of the parties, including BJP, Congress and their respective allies, have issued whips to their MPs to attend the House for the next couple of days, beginning with Wednesday noon when minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju is scheduled to introduce the bill, redrafted in accordance with the suggestions made by a joint parliamentary committee.However, the political heat and length of the debate are unlikely to have any bearing on the final outcome as the numbers heavily favour NDA. The strength of the alliance in LS is 293, comfortably ahead of the majority mark in the 542-member House.Even in Rajya Sabha, NDA has surpassed the majority mark with 126 members on its side in the House of 236 members, including two independents and six nominated members, who invariably vote in support of the govt. A few abstentions are not ruled out, sources said.Meanwhile, opposition bloc dubbed the bill ""unconstitutional, anti-minority and anti-Muslim"". It said the bill was brought with the idea of harassing one religious community. Led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, it was decided that opposition should rebuff the possibility of disruption, and should not boycott or walk out. ""The House should run smoothly and all should speak on the bill,"" sources quoted Kharge as saying at INDIA bloc meeting.Arvind Sawant of Sena UBT said, ""Opposition is united. This bill is divisionary. We will take part in the discussion and see if govt has incorporated our suggestions and amendments in the bill.""BJP allies TDP, JDU and LJP, which had initially expressed reservations over some aspects of the bill, came around claiming that their suggestions, based on feedback from their Muslim constituents, were incorporated in the new bill.","Govt decides to seek passage of Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Funding by US Agency for International Development (USAID), which has been under attack from the Trump administration for promoting a ""left, liberal and woke"" agenda abroad, has come under ED's scanner in connection with an ongoing probe against hedge fund operator George Soros.ED, which was probing three Bengaluru-based companies for alleged breach of Foreign Exchange Management Act in receiving Rs 25 crore from Soros Economic Development Fund , has found that one of those, ASAR Social Impact Advisors, also received Rs 8 crore from USAID as foreign inward remittance in 2022-23.The three companies received Soros's funds between 2021 and 2024. Sources said ASAR explained that the USAID funding was reimbursement for the services it provided to a Delhi-based public policy think tank, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), which, according to its website, is focused on ""understanding global challenges and implications for India's development"".CEEW has former deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Suresh Prabhu, who served as a minister in the first Modi govt, as its trustees.ASAR officials were unable to explain the nature of services provided to CEEW and how USAID came into the picture. ASAR and CEEW did not respond to TOI's queries on the ED probe.Sources identified Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd and Rootbridge Academy Ltd as the other two Bengaluru-based companies that had received funding from SEDF, which is the impact investment arm of Open Society Foundations, one of the several entities founded by Soros.ED is looking for the motive and purpose of these payments made by USAID. Sources said Open Society Foundations was placed under 'prior reference category' by the home ministry in 2016 on account of ""undesirable activities"" - a categorisation which required it to seek prior sanction from the ministry in order to contribute funds to any Indian non-profit organisation.With regard to ASAR and the two other Bengaluru-based entities, ED probe will also look into whether OSF complied with the mandatory requirement. The agency is also probing Soros's funding of Indian civil rights organisations, think tanks and other entities in the garb of foreign direct investments.","US Agency for International Development (USAID) has been under attack from the Trump administration for promoting a ""left, liberal and woke"" agenda abroad.

Why BJP pitch for Waqf reforms may find support among a section of Muslims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-bjp-pitch-for-waqf-reforms-may-find-support-among-a-section-of-muslims/articleshow/119875363.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Waqf Amendment Bill is all set for Parliament nod with the BJP managing to convince its allies about the benefits of backing the legislation. This even as the INDIA bloc of opposition parties have been very vocal and united in their opposition to the Bill claiming that it harms the interests of the Muslims.If the government succeeds in getting the Bill passed - in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, it will be the second big change that the BJP would have pushed to implement in the minority community after making the practice of triple talaq illegal in 2019.However, there is one major difference between then and now. In 2019, the BJP had absolute majority in Lok Sabha while it is now dependent on support of key allies for the survival of its government.So, how did the BJP managed to convince its key allies, especially Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar , who have enjoyed considerable support of the minorities over the years?Both Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) have announced to support the Bill and have issued a whip to their MPs to vote for the legislation. Earlier in the day, the JD(U) had announced that it was against retrospective implementation of the law and had hoped that the government would consider its demand.Interestingly, there are a lot of similarities in the way the BJP has pitched for these legislations then and now.The Triple Talaq Bill found support of many parties as it favoured the women of the community by protecting them from arbitrary divorce by men - which was a common practice over the years.Similarly, the BJP now pitched the Waqf Amendment Bill as a reform measure that would help the poor among the Muslims, who, the party claimed, had no say in the affairs of the community.Jagdambika Pal, chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Waqf Amendment Bill, summed up how the legislation would benefit the poor members of the community. ""We’ve now prepared a 400-page amendment, which addresses the needs of the country’s minorities. This law aims to support vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, orphans, widows, and economically backward Muslims,"" he said.Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju asserted that those opposing the Bill are ""powerful people"" who have encroached upon the Waqf properties.The Union minister asserted that the amendment bill was in interest of poor Muslims, children and women and would ensure accountability and transparency when it comes to managing properties under the Waqf board.BJP MP Dinesh Sharma claimed that the Waqf Bill was like a ""dream come true"" for the underprivileged Muslims.""Waqf is like a dream come true for poor Muslims. This is going to fix their plight. This bill is going to end the corruption prevailing in Waqf and the nexus of real estate and builders. This bill will be the roadmap for the underprivileged education, employment, house, and basic needs,"" Sharma said.""Government of India has made it very clear and even the committee chairman that they are not renewing the Waqf Board itself but they are only amending certain clauses and issues, which will enable the poor Muslims to have representation in the Waqf Board and women and other genders in Muslim community ,"" he added.Already, some BJP leaders have claimed that the opposition parties and some leading Muslim organisations are opposing the Waqf Bill as they fear a section of the Muslims would start voting for the saffron party.Perhaps, the BJP hopes to once again create a divide between the rich and the poor within the community by pushing through the ""reform"" legislation and eventually make some electoral gains.",Both Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) have announced to support the Bill and have issued a whip to their MPs to vote for the legislation. Opposition parties have been very vocal and united in their opposition to the Bill claiming that it harms the interests of Muslims.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119876482,imgsize-1933241,width-400,resizemode-4/119876482.jpg"

Giving the background of RSS's support for the movement started by ""sadhus and sants"" for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and saying the Sangh would not stop its members from supporting the efforts of VHP and others for taking possession of sites of Kashi Vishwanath Mandir in Varanasi and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, Hosabale suggested that the push for mass re-conversion of mosques allegedly built on temple sites fell into a different category.""But if we talk about all the other mosques and structures, should we start digging up 30,000 mosques and attempt to reverse history? Would that not create more hostility and resentment in society? Should we move forward as a society or stay stuck in the past? How far do we go in history?"" Hosabale said in an interview with Kannada weekly, Vikrama.Delineating the stand which was first articulated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, the Sangh general secretary said the demand for control of allegedly disputed mosque sites could only be pursued at a huge cost to society's other priorities like eradication and untouchability. ""If we keep doing this, when will we focus on other vital societal transformations? What about eliminating untouchability? How do we instil values in youth?"" he said.Hosabale, who is next only to Bhagwat in hierarchy, also seemed to caution that single-minded pursuit of the reclamation agenda could be at the expense of other issues which have been of equal concern for those pushing for it - preservation of culture and languages, conversions, cow slaughter, love jihad. ""The Sangh has never said anybody should ignore or not work on these issues,"" he said.Hosabale further said the movement for re-conversion of disputed sites was not in keeping with the conception of a temple. ""Consider the concept of a temple. Is a former temple that has been turned into a mosque still a divine space? Should we focus on finding Hindutva in remains of a stone structure, or should we awaken Hindutva within those who have distanced themselves from it? Instead of searching for traces of Hindu heritage in stone buildings, if we revive the Hindu roots within them and their communities, the mosque issue will resolve on its own,"" he told Vikrama.",RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale has made it clear that Sangh was against the idea.

'These cases shock our conscience': SC on illegal Prayagraj demolitions

NEW DELHI: Noting that a message has to be sent to ""make govt authorities remember"" that right to shelter is a fundamental right and rule of law is part of the basic structure of the Constitution, Supreme Court Tuesday directed Prayagraj Development Authority to pay compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to five people whose houses were illegally razed in 2021, setting a benchmark for the fine to be paid for resorting to what has come to be known as "" bulldozer justice "".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan rejected the state govt's plea to refrain from awarding compensation as the aggrieved people were not poor and owned multiple houses. Attorney General R Venkataramani, appearing for the state, said the constructions were illegal and illegality should not be compensated.The court said there was a procedure prescribed before demolition and the facts of the case were shocking as houses were razed within 24 hours of proper notices being served. The demolition was done on March 7, 2021, in which the houses of a lawyer, a professor and others were razed. Notice was served to them on March 6.Authorities, especially the development authority, must remember that the right to shelter is a fundamental right and an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution. They should also know that there is something called rule of law which is a basic feature of the Constitution, the SC bench said.As stated earlier, no effort was made to serve them notices in person or by registered post. Only communication dated March 1 was sent by registry which was received on March 6 and demolition was carried out on March 7. The applicant was deprived to avail the appeal against the decision. Therefore, demolition is illegal, the bench added.""Considering the inhuman and illegal manner in which demolition was carried out, we quantify the compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the appellants and direct the Prayagraj Development Authority to pay compensation to the appellants,"" court said.It added that the practice of affixing notice on the house had to stop which could be done as a last resort after notice could not be served in person.The bench said ""these cases shock our conscience and this should never happen"". Justifying its harsh order against Prayagraj Development Authority, the bench said this would discourage the authority from carrying out such exercises without following due procedure.The petitioners in the case are advocate Zulfiqar Haider, professor Ali Ahmed and three other individuals. They moved the apex court after Allahabad HC dismissed their plea against the demolition. Granting them relief, the court said Section 27 of UP Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973, states that if a building is constructed in violation of the master plan or without proper approvals, the development authority may order its demolition after providing the owner with a reasonable opportunity to show cause.In the previous hearing, the court had said that the state must act ""very fairly and must give reasonable time to enable the aggrieved person to file an appeal before the structures are demolished"".","The Supreme Court of India mandated the Prayagraj Development Authority to compensate five homeowners, whose houses were unlawfully demolished in 2021, with Rs 10 lakh each.

JAMMU: A brief gunfight was reported as security forces pursued Pakistani terrorists in new areas of J&K’s Kathua district, following last Thursday’s gunfight in Sufain forests that left four policemen dead. Two terrorists were also killed, but at least three of them managed to escape.In Poonch district, a series of landmine blasts occurred in Krishna Ghati sector Tuesday. “No loss of life or injury reported so far,” an official said. The area has an anti-infiltration obstacle system, with landmines that sometimes get washed away by rain and triggered by cattle or human movement.The forces intensified search operations and laid a cordon in the forested Panjtirthi area of Ramkote in Kathua after gunfire erupted Monday night, officials said Tuesday. Police received intelligence about the presence of three armed men in the area.“The firing has stopped. A cordon was put up to stop the terrorists from escaping,” an official said.They are believed to be the same men spotted in combat clothing in Ghati-Juthana forest Monday, just a few km from the site in Sufain. According to officials, the fugitives are constantly on the move, taking advantage of the mountainous terrain’s natural hiding spots, including caves and dense forests.The forces have deployed drones for aerial surveillance, while sniffer dogs are assisting joint teams from Army, police, NSG, CRPF, and BSF in the search.Police have detained six members of a jailed “overground” worker of terrorists on suspicion of aiding the armed Pakistani infiltrators in hiding and navigating the area undetected.According to sources, many people from remote villages may be coerced or financially incentivised to assist the terrorists — such as knowledge of the terrain and resources, enabling the intruders to evade security forces and carry out attacks in the challenging landscape.","Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district engaged in a gunfight while pursuing Pakistani terrorists.

Ready to walk the tough road to rebuild India-China ties: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ready-to-walk-tough-road-to-rebuild-china-ties-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/119887176.cms,"NEW DELHI: The nascent warmth in Sino-Indian ties was on full display again Tuesday as President Droupadi Murmu and PM Narendra Modi exchanged messages with their counterparts, Xi Jinping and Li Qiang respectively, on the 75th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between the 2 countries and foreign secretary Vikram Misri joined an event hosted by Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong to mark the event. Speaking on the occasion, Misri said such celebrations would become even more meaningful if “promising beginnings” in the relationship are translated into tangible benefits for the people of India and China.The foreign secretary said that the road ahead – of rebuilding ties based on mutual respect, mutual sensitivity, and mutual interests – was not going to be an easy one but India was prepared to walk on it. “We are looking at the next steps to resume practical cooperation between our two countries, and amongst the first of these steps is the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar yatra this year,’’ he said.According to a Chinese readout, Modi told Li in his message that progress in bilateral relations will contribute not only to global stability and prosperity but also to the emergence of a multipolar world.In his message to Murmu, Xi said both India and China are important members of the Global South and at a critical stage in their efforts to modernise, reiterating China’s position that an elephant-dragon tango will completely serve the fundamental interests of both countries. According to a Chinese readout, the 75th anniversary of ties was an opportunity to promote “strategic mutual trust…jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in China-India border regions, advance China-India relations on the track of sound and stable development”.Ties between the 2 countries have improved considerably since the agreement in October 2024 to complete the troop disengagement process in eastern Ladakh and the first Modi-Xi bilateral in 5 years in Russia’s Kazan that took place on October 23. Russian ambassador Denis Alipov was present at the event hosted by the Chinese embassy.Modi said recently in a podcast that normalcy had returned in the border areas since his meeting with Xi and he expected trust to return too in the relationship slowly but surely.Misri said that India and China had resolved several issues along the border areas, adding peace and tranquillity in the border areas is critical for the smooth development of overall bilateral relations.“And it is on the basis of this fundamental understanding, which was shared in the meeting between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan, that both of us are now working together to chart a road map for our bilateral relations to return to a stable, predictable, and amicable path,’’ said Misri. In an interview with Global Times on Tuesday, the Chinese ambassador said that China was ready to import more goods from India to strengthen trade but also expected India to create a fair and transparent business climate for Chinese companies.","The nascent warmth in Sino-Indian ties was on full display again Tuesday.

BJP allies shift stance, back Bill



Christian organisations support Bill



Govt defends Bill as reform measure



Oppn, Muslim groups strongly oppose Bill



NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha is set to deliberate on the long-debated Waqf Amendment Bill on Wednesday, with the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) pushing for its passage and the opposition strongly condemning it as ""unconstitutional.""""This Bill is unconstitutional. This Bill is a grave violation of Article 14, Articles 25, 26 and 29. This is not Waqf Bill rather it's a Waqf Barbaad Bill,"" said AIMIM 's Asaduddin Owaisi However, the ruling coalition holds the advantage in both Houses of Parliament, making the Bill's eventual passage likely possible despite the opposition's strong resistance.Minorities and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said that the Lok Sabha’s Business Advisory Committee (BAC), chaired by Speaker Om Birla has agreed to an eight-hour debate.The session could be extended based on the House’s consensus.Tensions flared as Congress and several opposition INDIA bloc members staged a walkout from the BAC meeting, accusing the government of suppressing their voices. Congress deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi criticised the limited debate time and demanded discussions on additional issues, including the situation in Manipur and concerns over electors’ photo identity cards.Despite opposition resistance, the NDA is well-positioned to pass the Bill, holding 293 MPs in the 542-member House. Key allies include the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) with 16 MPs, Janata Dal (United) with 12, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) with 5, and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena with 7 MPs.In the Rajya Sabha, the NDA holds a total of 125 MPs representation, including BJP’s 98, JD(U)’s 4, Ajit Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)’s 3, and TDP’s 2. The Bill will be taken up by the Upper House following its passage in the Lok Sabha.The Congress has criticised JD(U) and TDP for supporting the Bill, calling it an ""attack on the Constitution."" The grand old party's Jairam Ramesh said, ""Every opposition party opposes it, but what is the stand of so-called secular parties JD(U) and TDP?""Initially, some NDA allies, including JD(U), TDP, and LJP (Ram Vilas), had reservations about the Bill.However, they later extended their support after a parliamentary joint committee incorporated their recommendations. JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha reiterated that his party opposed any retrospective implementation of the Bill but expressed hope that the government would address this concern.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it... As long as Nitish Kumar is in politics, the interests of the people will be protected,"" JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha said.Ending days of speculation, Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP has officially backed the Bill, despite opposition criticism and protests from various Muslim organisations.""The whole Muslim community is waiting for the Waqf Amendment Bill to be tabled. Our party will support it. Chandrababu Naidu has already mentioned that we will work in the interests of the Muslim community. Tomorrow, the Bill will be tabled, only then we will make any comments on it. I assure you that Chandrababu Naidu is in favour of Muslims,"" TDP national spokesperson Prem Kumar Jain said.Meanwhile, TDP & JD(U) have issued a whip to all its MPs, directing them for their presence in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.The Church of Bharat and the Catholic Bishops Conference of India have extended support to the Bill, strengthening the government’s defense against allegations of an anti-minority agenda.The government maintains that the Bill seeks to improve transparency and efficiency in managing Waqf properties. Initially referred to a joint parliamentary committee, the Bill underwent revisions before receiving cabinet approval.Opposition parties and prominent Muslim organizations continue to oppose the Bill, calling it unconstitutional and harmful to the Muslim community. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has labeled it an attack on religious freedoms and warned that BJP allies like TDP and JD(U) will face repercussions for their support.","The Lok Sabha is set to deliberate on the long-debated Waqf Amendment Bill on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comic Kunal Kamra on Tuesday once again hit back at critics amid the row over his ""gaddar"" (traitor) remark targeting Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde . Kamra shared a satirical post on X titled ""How to kill an artist 'democratically'"", in which he condemned what he described as a systematic effort to silence artists.The post, structured as a step-by-step guide, outlined how outrage can be used to restrict artistic expression :""Now the artist is left with only two choices: Sell their soul and become a dollar puppet - or wither in silence. This isn't just a playbook, it's a political weapon. A silencing machine.""The controversy began after Kamra's performance at the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar, where he referred to Shinde as a ""traitor"" without directly naming him and performed a parody song aimed at him. The remarks triggered a strong backlash, leading to calls for action against the comedian.On Monday, Mumbai Police reportedly visited Kamra's ""residence"" in connection with the matter. In response, Kamra dismissed the visit as futile, posting on X: ""Going to an address where I haven’t lived for the last 10 years is a waste of your time & public resources…""Meanwhile, Shiv Sena's Yuva Sena general secretary Rahool Kanal issued a strong statement towards stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra.

Speaking at the DP Kohli Memorial Lecture, marking CBI's 62nd Foundation Day on Tuesday, he urged the agency to explore partnerships with academia and industry, citing the transformative impact of AI on economic, social and technological landscapes.At the event hosted under the theme ' Viksit Bharat @2047 - A Roadmap for CBI', Vaishnaw emphasised that the advent of Artificial Intelligence has brought about a paradigm shift, and the investigative agency must now think beyond traditional investigative methods to stay effective.He advocated for collaborative efforts with institutions like the IITs, the ministry of electronics and information technology, and the Department of Telecommunications to enhance the efficiency of investigating agencies. ""CBI and its exceptional team should actively seek more collaborations,"" he suggested in his address, which was attended by the chiefs and officials of all central intelligence and investigating agencies.""We can co-create innovative technological solutions.

Poll Do you believe the missile strike on Kusum Healthcare's warehouse was a deliberate attack? No, it was accidental Yes, it was deliberate

What's the response of Indian and Russian government?



Kusum Healthcare’s presence in Ukraine



Conflict continues despite ceasefire talks

Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, a warehouse belonging to an Indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a Russian missile in Ukraine on Saturday in what the Ukrainian embassy in India described as a ""deliberate attack.""The Ukrainian embassy in India said on Saturday that a Russian missile had hit the warehouse of Kusum Healthcare , an Indian pharmaceutical company operating in Ukraine.""Today, a Russian missile struck the warehouse of Indian pharmaceutical company Kusum in Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian embassy said in a post on X.In the same post, the embassy added: ""While claiming 'special friendship' with India, Moscow deliberately targets Indian businesses -- destroying medicines meant for children and the elderly.""So far, no additional details have been shared about the damage or casualties from the strike.The Indian and Russian governments are yet to comment on the matter.Martin Harris, the UK's ambassador to Ukraine, also claimed that Russian strikes destroyed a ""major pharma's warehouse in Kyiv"". However, his post did not mention whether the warehouse belongs to Kusum and also said the attack was carried out by Russian drones and not a missile.The governments of India and Russia have not yet issued any statements regarding the incident.Meanwhile, Martin Harris, the British ambassador to Ukraine, also said that Russian strikes had destroyed a ""major pharma’s warehouse in Kyiv."" However, he did not specify whether the warehouse belonged to Kusum Healthcare. He also mentioned that the attack was carried out using Russian drones, not a missile.""This morning Russian drones completely destroyed a major pharmaceuticals warehouse in Kyiv, incinerating stocks of medicines needed by the elderly and children. Russia's campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians continues,"" Mr Martin said in a post on X.According to its official website, headquartered in Delhi, Kusum Healthcare operates in 29 countries, including Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, Mali, and Tanzania.The company is among several Indian firms with a business presence in Ukraine, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both countries have continued to exchange strikes. Although they agreed last month to stop targeting each other’s energy facilities, each side has accused the other of violating the agreement.India has maintained that dialogue is the only path to peace and has not taken sides in the conflict, even while keeping good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow.In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would urge the presidents of both countries to seek a peaceful resolution, saying, ""I can sit with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin and say it's not the time for war. I can tell (Ukraine) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy in a friendly way that brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield.""Despite the ongoing conflict, India has continued to buy large quantities of oil from Russia, which has been available at discounted rates due to Western sanctions and reduced demand from Europe. Russia has remained India’s top oil supplier, with India importing 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia in February, down from 1.67 million bpd in January.","A warehouse belonging to an Indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a Russian missile in Ukraine on Saturday.

JEE Mains 2025: What is the difference between mark and percentile?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/jee-mains-2025-what-is-the-difference-between-mark-and-percentile/articleshow/120247839.cms,"Understanding the difference: JEE Main Marks vs Percentile

Marks: This refers to the total score obtained by a candidate out of 300. Each correct answer adds to the score, while incorrect responses can attract negative marking.



Percentile: This is a comparative metric. It reflects the percentage of candidates who scored lower than a particular student. Unlike marks, percentiles do not denote absolute performance but rather relative performance.

How the JEE Main rank is calculated in 2025

Percentile Score

Key factors affecting JEE Main 2025 marks vs percentile vs rank

Total number of candidates: A greater number of test-takers increases the competition. With more candidates, minor differences in marks can significantly affect percentile and rank.



Difficulty level of the exam: If a particular session is tougher than others, scoring lower marks may still translate to a high percentile. The normalisation process adjusts percentile scores accordingly.



Normalisation across sessions: To maintain equity, NTA compares performance across different exam shifts. This adjustment ensures that no candidate is disadvantaged due to the relative toughness of their session.



Individual performance: Ultimately, your personal performance is pivotal. The higher your score, the higher your percentile is likely to be—assuming all other variables remain constant.



Maximum marks: JEE Main continues to be out of 300 marks. Understanding how these marks scale to percentiles and rank gives candidates clarity on their performance spectrum.



Aspiring engineering students across India take the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main to secure seats in top-tier institutions like the NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs. However, many remain puzzled by the terms marks, percentile, and rank, which are crucial to understanding their standing in the examination. This article delves deep into the difference between JEE Main marks and percentile, explains how ranks are calculated, and outlines the factors that influence these metrics in 2025.At the heart of the confusion lies the distinction between raw marks and percentile scores. Here's a breakdown:For instance, if a student scores a 98 percentile, it means they have performed better than 98% of the candidates who appeared for the same session.The rank in JEE Main 2025 is derived from the percentile score, not directly from the marks. Since the exam is conducted in multiple sessions, the normalisation process is employed to ensure fairness. This process adjusts for variations in difficulty across sessions, making percentile scores the most equitable metric for comparison.The formula used for calculating percentile is:= (Number of candidates who scored less than you / Total number of candidates) × 100A higher percentile ensures a better All India Rank (AIR), which in turn influences college admissions.Several variables come into play when mapping your raw score to your percentile and final rank:","JEE Main marks are the total score obtained by a candidate out of 300 marks.

The university said it was prank gone too far and was taking action against the students.Although the video - which surfaced Saturday - does not show any boy in it, sources at the university said one had indeed sneaked into the girls' hostel.It was not immediately clear if this was linked to the suitcase incident.According to Anjoo Mohun, director of communications at the university, the video shows a group of girl students moving their friend around the hostel in a large suitcase as part of a ""light-hearted"" joke.""This was a prank, entirely confined to the premises of the girls' hostel.

No, it undermines the governor's authority. Yes, it's necessary for democratic processes.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court drew inspiration from provisions in the constitutions of Pakistan and the US in specifying timelines for governors in giving assent, returning or referring to President the bills passed by state assemblies, and said time-limit breach is amenable to judicial scrutiny.The 415-page magnum opus of a judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, pronounced on April 8 but uploaded on SC's website Friday, justified its decision to give purposive meaning to the words 'as soon as possible' in the Constitution for governors or the President in taking decision on bills passed by assemblies or Parliament.Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala gave omnibus scrutiny powers to SC, and said, ""No exercise of power under the Constitution is beyond the ambit of its judicial review. Thus, we find no reason to exclude discharge of functions by governor or President under Articles 200 & 201 of the Constitution, respectively.""The first question that arose before SC was whether the court had jurisdiction to step beyond the written words of the Constitution to prescribe a time-limit for the governor. It did so by drawing inspiration, first from its own judgment in 2021 prescribing a three-month outer-limit for Speakers to adjudicate pleas seeking disqualification of MLAs under anti-defection law.The other inspiration came from constitutions of Pakistan and the US. Justice Pardiwala said, ""For instance, Article 75 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan or Article I, Section 7 of the US Constitution , where if no decision is taken within the stipulated time limit by President, then bills are deemed to have been assented to.""Article 75 of Pakistan's constitution provides a 10-day period for the President to either assent or return a bill to Majlis-e-Shoora (parliament). If the returned bill is re-passed with or without amendment, then the president is bound to give assent to it within 10 days, beyond which the bill is deemed to have received his assent. But the court was aware that ""unlike many countries across the globe wherein a provision for deemed assent upon the expiry of the specified time period has been made, there is no such provision in our Constitution"". At the same time, it mentioned that during Constituent Assembly debates, Dr B R Ambedkar had proposed a six-week time limit for governors on this issue and that both the Sarkaria and Punchhi commissions had favoured a time limit.Thus, in the case of TN, SC had to resort to its potent Article 142 powers to rule that the long-delayed 10 bills passed by the assembly, on which the governor had dilly-dallied for months, would be deemed to have got his assent, and declared that his decision to refer them to the President after their re-passing by the assembly is illegal. It said any decision on such referred bills by the President would also be void. Sans a time limit, governors could play spoilsport for democracy where an elected govt gets five years to implement policies and election promises, SC said. ""Not taking any action on bills for an unreasonable and prolonged period of time virtually vests the governor with the power of pocket veto and it can't be held to be permissible within our constitutional scheme,"" SC said.",The 415-page magnum opus of a judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan was pronounced on April 8 but uploaded on SC's website Friday. It justified its decision to give purposive meaning to the words 'as soon as possible' in the Constitution for governors or the President in taking decision.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120241800,imgsize-50612,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Tahawwur Rana In India: Trump's Biggest Strike On Pak Terror, 26/11 Plotter To Face Justice Finally

Also read:

NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his remand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.","Tahawwur Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security.

NEW DELHI: At least three people were killed in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district as protests against the Centre’s Waqf (Amendment) Act spiraled into violence over the weekend, prompting chief minister Mamata Banerjee to declare that the law will not be implemented in the state.The recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, has triggered a wave of protests and legal confrontations across India, with political parties, religious organizations, and civil society groups voicing concern over its implications for minority rights and religious freedoms.ALSO READ: What is Waqf (Amendment) Bill? All you need to know While the Centre has defended the legislation as a historic reform, critics claim it enables state overreach into Muslim endowments and threatens the secular fabric of the Constitution.From courtroom battles in Delhi and Calcutta to violent street protests in Bengal and Rajasthan, here’s a detailed look at the top developments:Shortly after the Calcutta High Court approved the deployment of central forces in riot-hit Murshidabad, Union home secretary Govind Mohan stated that apart from nearly 300 Border Security Force personnel locally available in Murshidabad, additional five Companies have been deployed at the request of the state sovernment.Mohan, who held a video conference with Chief Secretary and DGP of West Bengal, advised the state administration to keep a close watch on other sensitive districts also, and to put in place adequate steps to ensure normalcy at the earliest.He also stated that the Centre is closely monitoring the situation and assured the state all possible assistance including deployment of additional manpower, if necessary, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement.The West Bengal DGP briefed that the situation was tense but under control and was being monitored closely. The DGP further stated that he is taking the assistance of BSF posted locally, and that more than 150 persons have been arrested, the MHA said.A father and son, were killed in West Bengal's Murshidabad district after violent clashes, reportedly linked to ongoing protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.The victims were found with multiple stab wounds inside their home in Jafrabad, a locality in the violence-stricken Samserganj area. The family claims that miscreants looted their house before fatally stabbing the two.In a separate incident, another individual suffered a bullet injury earlier in Dhulian, Samserganj. The district has seen widespread unrest, with large-scale violence erupting on Friday in Samserganj and Suti areas during protests against the contentious law.ALSO READ: Calcutta HC intervenes, ‘We cannot stay silent’; deploys central forces amid Waqf Act protests The state has so far arrested 118 individuals linked to the unrest. While officials initially said one person had sustained a bullet injury, Additional Director General (Law and Order) Jawed Shamim later confirmed two deaths, without clarifying whether police firing was involved. He suggested the possibility of shots being fired from the BSF side but said the source was still under investigation.""These are early reports that we need to cross-check,” Shamim said, adding that the injured were receiving treatment and that the situation remained tense.The Calcutta high court on Saturday ordered the deployment of central paramilitary forces in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district following large-scale violence during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. The decision came after a special hearing was held on a court holiday in response to a petition filed by Leader of the Opposition and BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari.“In view of the large-scale communal riots spreading like wildfire across West Bengal, I had sought immediate intervention from the state government for the requisition of central paramilitary forces. The state government did not accept it. With no other option, I approached the High Court for an urgent hearing,” Adhikari said after the order.A division bench comprising Justice Soumen Sen and Justice Raja Basu Chaudhary heard the matter and accepted his plea, ordering immediate deployment of central forces in the violence-hit areas.Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that her government will not implement the Waqf (Amendment) Act in the state, amid spiraling violence in Muslim-majority districts like Murshidabad. “We did not make this law. It was brought by the Centre. So what is the riot about?” Mamata asked in a post on X.“We do not condone any violent activity. My appeal to all religions: remain calm and restrained. Do not fall prey to provocation,” Mamata said, accusing “some political parties” of misusing religion for political gain.Four rounds were reportedly fired by police on Friday, injuring two. Vehicles were torched, roads blocked, and stones hurled at police in districts like Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Hooghly. DGP Rajeev Kumar said strong action would follow and urged people not to fall for ""rumour mongering.""Meanwhile, political leaders have sharply reacted to the ongoing violence.BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi commented on the passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, calling the protests in West Bengal a political ploy. ""After completing all the constitutional procedures in a systematic manner, the Waqf Bill came to Parliament, was discussed by the JPC, and passed by both Houses. It then received the President's approval and became law. Yet, some are using it for political gain. It is sad that this is happening only in West Bengal. This raises the question if Mamata Banerjee’s politics is becoming a challenge for the entire country,"" he said.In response to the growing violence, West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari moved the Calcutta High Court, seeking deployment of central forces in the state. “With communal riots spreading rapidly across West Bengal, I sought immediate intervention from the state government for central paramilitary forces. When the state government didn’t act, I approached the High Court for urgent intervention. My plea has been accepted, and the division bench will hear the PIL,” he said.Adhikari also wrote to the railway minister demanding an NIA probe into vandalism in Murshidabad, alleging a “premeditated assault by jihadist forces.”“This wasn’t protest—it was an attack on democracy and governance,” Adhikari posted on X.ALSO READ | President Droupadi Murmu gives assent to Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 State BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar said the TMC government was enabling the unrest through appeasement. “When BJP comes to power, we will crush such vandalism in five minutes,” he warned.After Friday prayers, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) staged a peaceful protest in Jaipur's Bhatta Basti area to oppose the Waqf (Amendment) Act. Rajasthan AIMIM chief Jameel Khan alleged that the legislation is an attempt by the Centre to take control of Waqf assets and marginalize Muslims.“This legislation is not about reform, but about reinforcing a broader agenda of exclusion and injustice against Muslims,” said Khan. “We will continue to assert our democratic right to peaceful protest and also launch a public awareness campaign.”Khan said that their demonstration aimed to urge citizens and lawmakers alike to reassess the broader impact of the amendment on minority rights and social harmony.The Congress party has pledged to challenge the Act, calling it a violation of the Constitution’s basic structure.“The law is part of a broader agenda to polarize the country on religious lines,” said Congress leader Swadesh Sharma.“Just as public sector units were sold off to industrialist friends, this law seeks to gift donated lands to a few.”Several Muslim organizations, including the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and Indian Union Muslim League, have announced plans to take legal recourse, while protests continue across states.Congress MP Imran Masood, commenting on the unrest, condemned the violence while emphasizing the fight for the Constitution. “We are staunchly against violence. This is not just a fight for Muslims but for the Constitution. The BJP trampled on the Constitution with the Waqf Act. This is about protecting the Constitution, not a political agenda,” he saidThe National Conference (NC), currently in power in Jammu & Kashmir, has petitioned the Supreme Court, calling the Act a ""constitutionally alarming interference"" in Muslim religious affairs. NC MLAs Arjun Singh Raju, Hilal Akbar Lone, and others filed a writ on April 11.“On the directions of Party President Dr Farooq Abdullah... our MLAs have filed a writ petition seeking justice,” the NC posted on X.Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna's bench is set to hear a clutch of similar petitions on April 16. Other challengers include AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, SDPI, AAP's Amanatullah Khan, and civil rights organizations.In contrast, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta filed an intervention application in support of the Act, arguing that the original Waqf Act enabled wrongful claims on non-Muslim property.“The unamended provision of the Waqf Act, 1995, caused serious prejudice to the rights and interests of non-Muslims,” read the plea.The plea contends that the 2025 amendment restores justice to non-Muslims whose properties were allegedly misclassified as Waqf assets.In Bhopal, MP Waqf Board chairman Sanwar Patel said the board is preparing to serve notices to nearly 2,000 people for illegal occupation of Waqf properties.“Out of 15,008 Waqf properties in the state, most are occupied. We’ll ask them to vacate or become legal tenants, failing which action will follow under the new law,” Patel told ANI.He accused several Congress leaders, including a national president and AIMIM chief Owaisi, of occupying such properties. Patel also cited an RRC (Revenue Recovery Certificate) of Rs 7.11 crore against Congress leader Riyaz Khan.","The recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, has triggered a wave of protests and legal confrontations across India.

While some sources claim the AIADMK demanded his removal, both parties have denied this.Nagenthran, who joined the BJP in 2017, gained prominence under mentor V Karuppasamy Pandian and made headlines in 2018 for threatening lyricist Vairamuthu over remarks about Goddess Andal.Amit Shah on Friday confirmed that the BJP had received Nagenthiran's nomination for the top post.""The nomination for the post of Tamil Nadu BJP State President has been received only from Mr @NainarBJP. As the Tamil Nadu BJP President , Mr @annamalai_k has made commendable achievements. Whether it is taking the policies of Prime Minister Mr @narendramodi to the people, or taking the party's projects village by village, Mr Annamalai's contribution is immense. The BJP will utilize Mr Annamalai's organizational skills in the party's national structure,"" he said.Having served as a cabinet minister in the AIADMK government from 2001 to 2006, Nagendran is seen as a natural link between the two parties in the renewed alliance.He is the BJP MLA from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu and had earlier hinted at a possible alliance with the AIADMK, stating that there was no need to pressure the party into an agreement and that a simple dialogue with EPS would suffice to forge a partnership.At the time, then BJP president Annamalai distanced himself from the remark, claiming it was misinterpreted. He later reaffirmed his commitment to the party, saying he was willing to work as a grassroots BJP cadre and had joined politics to serve Tamil Nadu, not to seek power.",Nagenthiran succeeds K Annamalai as the 13th president of the Tamil Nadu BJP. This comes a day after the saffron party announced its alliance with AIADMK ahead of the 2026 assembly elections in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120232423,imgsize-379268,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

After the post-mortem found signs that she had been killed by strangulation, police interrogated the woman's husband, who confessed to the crime, stating that he was drunk after attending a party and had an altercation with his wife, which led to the murder.Police received a control room alert on March 6 about an alleged hanging death. On reaching the spot at K Block in Mahipalpur, the police team found that a woman named Kalpana, aged 28, had hanged herself. Her body had already been taken down by her family members and taken to a Vasant Kunj hospital, where she was declared brought dead. The deceased had married Amit Kumar Sehrawat about six years ago, and she had a five-year-old child from the marriage. He is employed by a private company in Gurgaon.Proceedings under Section 176 (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita were carried out. The statements of Kalpana's parents were recorded before the tehsildar of Vasant Kunj, in which they and other relatives stated that there was a quarrel between Kalpana and her husband but they didn't level any allegations about dowry torture. Police sources said that on March 8, the post-mortem of the deceased was conducted at Safdarjung Hospital. The medical team that carried out the autopsy opined that ""death is due to asphyxia consequent upon ante-mortem ligature strangulation. However, viscera is preserved to rule out any concomitant poisoning. All the injuries are ante-mortem in nature. Injury Nos. 2 to 11 are a result of blunt force impact"".The parents of the woman were informed about the findings and a case was registered. An investigation was initiated. Police sources said Sehrawat was also interrogated, and he eventually admitted that on March 5, he, along with his family, had gone to a marriage function at Masoodpur in Vasant Kunj, where he consumed liquor. He had an altercation with his wife after he became heavily intoxicated and was dropped at his house by his cousin. After a while, Kalpana too returned home, upon which Sehrawat began quarrelling with her about some domestic issues. He beat his wife, and during the scuffle, he strangled her. Finding that she had died, hanged his wife's body with a rope made of multicoloured cloth, the cops said. He then acted as if his wife Kalpana had hanged herself. However, the post-mortem findings nailed Sehrawat's lies and when the police questioning prompted him to confess his crime, he was arrested. Further investigation is underway.","Police received a control room alert on March 6 about an alleged hanging death.

Paywall: UPI outage hits users across the country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paywall-upi-outage-hits-users-across-the-country/articleshow/120241983.cms,"(With inputs from our state bureau)

MUMBAI: India experienced the flip side of going cashless when Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the platform that accounts for more than four-fifths of all digital transactions in the country, suffered a major outage Saturday, leaving users struggling to make payments across malls, parking lots and shops.Users across India reported failed payments. Some got debit alerts despite failed transactions. National Payments Corporation of India, which operates UPI, reported ""intermittent technical issues leading to partial transaction declines"" which ""stabilised by late afternoon"". TNNNPCI said they regretted the outage and were ""working to resolve the issue"". The impact was pan-India, with complaints from people in Bengal, Delhi, Maharashtra, UP, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Assam and the southern states. A woman in the national capital said the outage inconvenienced people at a specialty hospital as it led to a long queue at the payments desk. In Lucknow, Ahad Arshad, operator of the popular food chain Red Dragon, said around 50 customers were unable to pay their bills. ""We had to note down their contact numbers for payment later. It was chaotic for about 25 minutes but eventually all dues were cleared,"" he said.Payment providers said they started facing increased failures just before 10am. There was no shutdown of services but a sharp rise in failed transactions. Success rates improved later in the afternoon. NPCI did not give any details of the cause of the failures nor about the increase in failure rate.Sources said that it was not a capacity issue as NPCI was used to higher volumes. The corporation was doing a ""root cause analysis"" and did not disclose the reasons behind the disruption.An Ahmedabad-based petrol pump owner, requesting anonymity, said they switched to precautionary payment methods during the disruption. ""We took UPI payments before filling fuel or requested customers to use other options."" In UP, from restaurants to retailers, users across the state reported that popular third-party payment platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm were unresponsive between 11.20am and 11.45am.The disruption was the fourth in 30 days - an unusual frequency for a platform that has a highly reliable track record. Since its launch in 2016, UPI has scaled rapidly without major hiccups. Its ease of use - allowing peer-to-peer transfers at no cost - has made it ubiquitous, from roadside vendors to high-value transactions of up to Rs 1 lakh. Many consumers, now accustomed to its dependability, no longer carry cash.For small merchants, the outage meant missed sales. Larger retailerssaw customers switch to more expensive card-based payments, raising transaction costs.The impact ranged from a few rupees in rickshaw fares to larger purchases at petrol stations and shops. Earlier, disruptions on March 26 were also attributed to a technical issue. Banks said the outages on March 31 and April 2 were largely due to heavy traffic at the close of the financial year.The last time UPI faced a systemic vulnerability was in 2020 when Yes Bank, then a key service provider for apps such as PhonePe, was placed under a moratorium by RBI. The fallout led NPCI to propose market-share caps to mitigate single-point-of-failure risks. Despite these efforts, Google Pay and PhonePe continue to dominate the UPI ecosystem. Though transactions feel instantaneous to users, the process involves nearly 10 rapid-fire digital handshakes among third-party apps, their banks, customers and recipient banks, and recipient payment processors and their banks.","Users across India reported failed payments.

"India, 62 countries agree to world's 1st global carbon tax in shipping industry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-61-countries-agree-to-worlds-1st-global-carbon-tax-in-shipping-industry/articleshow/120241845.cms,"Poll Do you support the implementation of a global carbon tax on commercial shipping? No, it could harm the shipping industry. Yes, it's essential for environmental protection.

NEW DELHI: India joined 62 other countries in agreeing to the world’s first-ever global carbon tax by bringing commercial shipping under this mechanism to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions in the sector. Under the agreement, ship owners will need to use cleaner fuels or face fines beginning 2028.Shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions. Since the sector is not covered under the Paris Agreement, the legally binding deal on imposing a global carbon tax on shipping to tackle emissions marks a significant development towards the overall 'net-zero' goal.The countries agreed on the global framework after voting at the UN’s International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London late Friday. The agreement, reached after nearly 10 years of negotiations, aims to put a carbon price on shipping emissions. It is expected to help the sector decarbonise and encourage the use of cleaner technologies.The carbon pricing measures, set to be formally adopted in October, will become mandatory for large ocean-going ships of over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emits 85% of the total carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping.Under the agreed framework, if a ship continues to use conventional fuel in 2028 it would have to pay $100 to $380 per tonne of emission, depending on crossing the threshold of 'base' and 'direct compliance' targets. It is estimated that the carbon tax could generate up to $40 billion by 2030. The funds will be used exclusively to decarbonise the shipping industry.A total of 63 countries, including India, China, the EU, Norway, Singapore, South Africa and Japan, voted in favour of the agreement, while 16, including major oil-producing Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Russia and Venezuela, voted against it, and 25 countries, mostly the small island nations and Argentina, abstained. The US delegation was not present at the time of the voting, sticking to its principle of not engaging in negotiations.“Now, it is important to continue working together, engaging in dialogue and listening to one another, if we are to create the conditions for successful adoption,” said IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez while commending the spirit of cooperation and commitment demonstrated by the shipping nations.Many expert groups pointed out that the agreement is projected to deliver at best 10% absolute emissions reduction in the shipping sector by 2030, which is far short of the IMO’s own targets set in their 2023 revised strategy, calling for at least a 20% cut by 2030, with a stretch goal of 30%.","India joins 62 other countries in agreeing to the world’s first-ever global carbon tax.

"Presidents, governors don't have unbridled powers: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/presidents-governors-dont-have-unbridled-powers-sc/articleshow/120241790.cms,"Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision to invoke Article 142 in this case? No, it undermines the governor's role. Yes, it's a necessary measure.

NEW DELHI: Justifying its decision to invoke the extraordinary powers granted under Constitution's Article 142 by deeming 10 bills passed by the Tamil Nadu assembly to have received the governor's assent, rather than sending the matter back to him, Supreme Court said governor R N Ravi was ""lacking in bona fides"" and that ""it was difficult for us to repose our trust and remand the matter to him"".Questioning the conduct of the governor who has been at loggerheads with the state govt on a number of issues, SC said the constitutional head of the state of TN ""failed in showing due deference and respect to its judgments and directions"".""There have been clear instances where the governor has failed in showing due deference and respect to the judgments and directions of this court,"" court said.Appealing to all constitutional functionaries, SC said, ""When called upon to take decisions, such authorities must not give in to ephemeral political considerations but rather be guided by the spirit that underlies the Constitution.""Observing that bills if kept pending after their passage by state legislature militate against the very sustenance of a representative democracy based on direct elections, Supreme Court has ruled that neither the President nor governors have ""unbridled powers"" and neither of them has the power to exercise 'absolute veto' on any bill passed by the assembly. It said the constitutional functionaries have to take decisions in a time-bound manner and fixed it at three months for the President.Clearing the constitutional ambiguity over the role of the constitutional head of the country and those of states when bills are sent for their assent, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said the authorities have to pass a reasoned order and cannot sit indefinitely on bills. It said delay on their part as well as decisions taken by them are judicially reviewable and can be challenged in court.Settling a timeline for governors, it said a decision has to be taken within a month if assent is granted or within three months if a bill is referred to the President or to assembly for reconsideration. SC also accepted Centre's 2016 office memorandum fixing a timeline of three months for the President to take a decision, and made it a part of its order.""... the scheme under which the constitutional heads of both the country and a state respectively are required to operate, does not contemplate the idea of an 'absolute veto', thereby meaning that there can be no withholding of assent without furnishing reasons. This is owing to the fact that the simpliciter withholding of assent both by President and governor would be impermissible within the fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy,"" SC said.Elaborating on Article 200 (pertaining to governors) and Article 201 (regarding President) of the Constitution, it said both the functionaries are bound to give reasons in writing for withholding assent and the state govt must not be prevented from incorporating the changes or amendments to the bill. Though a governor is bound to give assent in case the assembly sends the bill again after reconsideration, the bench said it was not applicable to the President.It said the President giving reasons in support of decision is of paramount importance, and the court can make a presumption that the President and by extension, the central govt, may not have acted in a bona fide manner if the decision is not a reasoned one.The bench said, ""...governor does not hold the power to exercise 'absolute veto' on any bill, we see no reason why the same standard would also not apply to the President under Article 201 as well. The President is not an exception to this default rule which permeates throughout our Constitution. Such unbridled powers cannot be said to remain in either of these constitutional posts.""SC suggested the President invoke Article 143 of the Constitution to seek SC's opinion in case a state bill's constitutionality is questioned. ""... although the option to refer a bill to this court under Article 143 may not be mandatory, yet the President, as a measure of prudence, ought to seek an opinion under the said provision in respect of bills that have been reserved for the consideration of the President on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality. This is all the more necessary as there is no mechanism at the state level for the governor to refer bills to the constitutional courts for their advice or opinion thereupon,"" SC said.","Supreme Court said governor R N Ravi was ""lacking in bona fides"" and that ""it was difficult for us to repose our trust and remand the matter to him"" Neither the President nor governors have ""unbridled powers"" and neither has the power to exercise 'absolute veto' on any bill passed by the assembly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120241808,imgsize-777600,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Hisar: Outpatient services were disrupted for two hours across Haryana on Saturday as doctors staged a symbolic protest against the suspension of Hisar’s deputy civil surgeon and PNDT nodal officer, Dr. Prabhu Dayal . Members of the Haryana Civil Medical Service (HCMS) wore black badges and shut down OPDs from 10 am to 12 noon in solidarity.Dr. Dayal was suspended following a sting operation conducted by a private news channel, which featured claims made by brokers allegedly involved in illegal fetal sex determination. The association strongly objected to what they termed a hasty and unjustified suspension without preliminary inquiry.The decision to protest was finalized at a state-level meeting of the HCMS Association held on Friday. Following the meeting, the association submitted a memorandum to chief minister Nayab Singh Saini, urging him to intervene and revoke the suspension.HCMS General Secretary Dr. Anil Yadav said that members were unanimous in their disapproval of the action against Dr. Dayal. “Dr. Prabhu Dayal has consistently performed his duties with integrity and dedication. He has been recognized multiple times by the government for his exemplary service. Despite this, he was suspended abruptly on the night of April 9 without any explanation or prior inquiry,” he stated.The association expressed deep concern over the incident and announced that a delegation would soon meet senior officials to discuss the issue. Letters have also been sent to the additional chief secretary (health), home minister, and the chief minister demanding immediate withdrawal of the suspension order.","Outpatient services were disrupted for two hours across Haryana on Saturday.

He alleged Stalin’s government was “incompetent” and relied on painting the BJP as a villain to distract from its own failures. “He’s screaming because Amit Shah spoke the truth about the DMK’s scams,” EPS added.With war drums beating louder on both sides, Tamil Nadu is clearly headed for a heated political showdown in 2026.",AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) on Saturday hit back at chief minister M K Stalin.

Sarma: Fugitives won’t be safe abroad anymore

‘Judiciary will give him what he deserves’

Sarma recalls narrow escape during 26/11

What’s next for Rana?

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday hailed the extradition of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, one of the key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks , calling it a major diplomatic triumph for the Narendra Modi-led government. He asserted that the move should serve as a strong warning to fugitives enjoying luxury abroad that they will inevitably have to face Indian justice.Addressing a press conference in Guwahati, Sarma said, “Rana’s extradition is a big diplomatic victory because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji. American courts had earlier acquitted him in the Mumbai terror case only because there was no proper follow-up by the then UPA government. He was in jail in the US in connection with another case.”Tahawwur Rana, a 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, was brought back to India by a team of NIA officials on Thursday evening on a chartered aircraft. His extradition from the United States marks a significant breakthrough in India’s attempt to prosecute one of the key figures accused of aiding the planning and logistics of the 26/11 attacks that killed 166 people and injured over 230 in Mumbai.Rana is accused of facilitating reconnaissance activities in Mumbai for his childhood friend David Coleman Headley, another 26/11 accused who is currently serving a prison sentence in the US. Rana allegedly used his immigration business as a front to help Headley get access to India.The extradition comes after a prolonged legal process in the United States, where an American court had earlier rejected India’s request citing double jeopardy, but eventually cleared the way following detailed submissions from Indian authorities and diplomatic negotiations.CM Sarma said the message from Rana’s extradition is clear: fugitives can no longer hide behind foreign borders.“This is a warning to all absconders. They may be living luxurious lives abroad now, but with Modi ji at the helm, they will have to come back. Their relief is only temporary,” he said.The BJP leader took a sharp dig at the Congress-led UPA government, blaming it for Rana’s earlier acquittal in the US and accusing it of “failing to pursue the case with seriousness.”Sarma expressed full confidence in the Indian judicial system, saying, “We have full faith in our judiciary, and it will deliver justice. Rana will get what he deserves.”In a personal anecdote, Sarma shared that he narrowly escaped the 26/11 attacks. At the time a minister in the Congress-led Assam government, he said he had initially booked a room at Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Palace Hotel — one of the main sites of the attack — but changed his plans at the last minute.“I had booked a room at the Taj Hotel, but for some reason, I checked into another hotel. That decision probably saved my life,” Sarma recalled.The chief minister said the horror of 26/11 still lingers in the minds of the nation, and bringing perpetrators like Rana to justice is not just about closure, but a reaffirmation of India’s resolve to fight terrorism.Following his arrival in Delhi, Rana is expected to face trial under Indian law and will be produced before a special NIA court. The agency is expected to press charges based on evidence already collected from international intelligence agencies and Headley’s previous confessions.With Rana now in Indian custody, officials say the case could serve as a precedent for extradition of other key fugitives wanted in terror cases, financial fraud, and organised crime.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hailed the extradition of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, one of the key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.

CM mourns ‘irreplaceable void’ in Bengal politics

From Left stalwart to Trinamool minister

NEW DELHI: Former West Bengal minister and veteran leader Abdur Razzak Mollah passed away at his ancestral home in South 24 Parganas on Friday morning.The 80-year-old Trinamool Congress leader, who had been ailing due to age-related complications, breathed his last at his residence in Bankri village in the Bhangar area, party sources confirmed.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed deep grief over Mollah’s demise, recalling his contributions to Bengal’s rural and agrarian landscape.“I am saddened and shocked by the passing of my colleague, Abdur Razzak Mollah. He was my colleague in the state cabinet. I respected and honoured him,” Banerjee said on X.“His knowledge and experience in Bengal's rural life, agricultural economy and land reform were well-known. That's why, even though he once practised politics of a different ideology, it was easy and natural for him to join the 'Ma-Mati-Manush' government,” she said, calling his death an “irreplaceable void in the political life of Bengal.”Mollah served as the Minister for Land and Land Reforms during the Left Front regime and represented the Canning Purba seat from 1977 to 2011. In 2014, he was expelled from CPI(M) over “anti-party activities” and soon floated the Bharatiya Nayabichar Party (BNP).He was later expelled from the BNP as well for aligning with the ruling Trinamool Congress. Ahead of the 2016 assembly elections, Mollah officially joined TMC and won the Bhangar seat, following which he was inducted as the Minister for Food Processing.Mollah's decades-long political journey spanned ideological shifts, but his deep connect with rural Bengal and his role in land reforms remained a constant thread in his public life.He is survived by his family, and condolences have poured in from across the political spectrum.",Former West Bengal minister and veteran leader Abdur Razzak Mollah passed away at his ancestral home in South 24 Parganas on Friday morning.

"Tahawwur Rana arrested on arrival in India, appears before NIA court, sent to 18-day custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-arrested-on-arrival-in-india-appears-before-nia-court-sent-to-18-day-custody/articleshow/120177280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , who played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives, was arrested by NIA here on Thursday after his arrival from US on a special flight.The Pakistani-Canadian terrorist was produced before special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh, who held an in-camera hearing on NIA counsel and special public prosecutor Narender Mann's plea for a 20-day remand. Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives.

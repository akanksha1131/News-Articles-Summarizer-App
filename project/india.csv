NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday made a strong pitch for generational transition in leadership, suggesting that the older generation should step aside once systems begin to function smoothly and allow younger people to take charge.Addressing a press conference in Nagpur ahead of the Advantage Vidarbha–Khasdar Audhyogik Mahotsav, Gadkari said he firmly believes in gradually handing over responsibility to the next generation.The industrial expo has been conceptualised by Gadkari and is organised by Ashish Kale, president of the Association for Industrial Development (AID).Highlighting Kale’s role, Gadkari said the initiative has actively involved young people. “I believe that gradually, the generation should also change,” he said.Referring to his long association with Kale’s family, Gadkari added, “Ashish's father is my friend. Now we should be gradually made to retire and the responsibility be given to the new generation, and when the vehicle starts running smoothly, then we should withdraw and do some other work.”Gadkari, who serves as AID’s chief mentor, said this year marks the third edition of the Advantage Vidarbha expo, which will be held in Nagpur from February 6 to 8.He noted that Vidarbha has strong entrepreneurial talent across multiple sectors and said the aim of the event is to position the region as a growing industrial hub.“The objective of the three-day event is to establish Vidarbha as a strong and emerging growth hub on India's industrial map,” he said.Emphasising the pillars of regional development, Gadkari underlined the importance of the industrial sector, agriculture and allied activities, and the services sector. He said balanced growth across these areas is essential for long-term economic progress.The Advantage Vidarbha expo will see participation from industries across a wide range of sectors, including textiles, plastics, minerals, coal, aviation, logistics, IT, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, defence, real estate, renewable energy, and startups.",Union minister Nitin Gadkari makes a strong pitch for generational transition in leadership.

Operation Trashi-I: Gunfight Erupts In J&K’s Kishtwar; Eight Army Personnel Injured

NEW DELHI: Eight Army personnel were injured on Sunday in a prolonged gunfight with terrorists in a remote forested area of the upper reaches of Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district.The encounter, which lasted for several hours, erupted when security forces came in contact with terrorists during a search operation in the general area of Sonnar, northeast of Chatroo. The operation, launched around noon, has been named Operation Trashi-I by the Army’s Jammu-based White Knight Corps.In a post on X, the White Knight Corps said the search was part of ongoing joint counter-terror operations being conducted with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. “Operations remain underway with additional forces inducted to reinforce the cordon, supported by close coordination with civil administration and security agencies,” the Army said, praising the troops for their professionalism while responding to hostile fire in difficult terrain and conditions.Officials said one of the search teams encountered a group of two to three foreign terrorists, believed to be affiliated with Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).The terrorists allegedly opened indiscriminate fire and hurled grenades in an attempt to break the cordon. The troops retaliated, following which reinforcements from the Army, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and police were rushed to the area to tighten the cordon.Intermittent firing continued until around 5.40 pm. Eight soldiers sustained injuries, mostly splinter wounds from grenade blasts, and were evacuated to hospital. A massive search operation is continuing to track down and neutralise the terrorists.Advanced surveillance equipment, including drones, along with sniffer dogs, has been deployed to speed up the operation.This is the third encounter between security forces and terrorists in the Jammu region this year. Earlier gunfights were reported in the Kahog and Najote forests of the Billawar area in Kathua district on January 7 and 13.On December 15 last year, a police officer was killed in an encounter with terrorists in Soan village of the Majalta area in Udhampur district. The terrorists managed to escape by taking advantage of thick foliage and darkness.These encounters come in the wake of a major counter-terror operation launched across forest belts of the Jammu region in December last year to flush out nearly three dozen terrorists believed to be hiding in the area.Security operations have been further intensified ahead of Republic Day amid intelligence inputs of renewed attempts by Pakistan-based handlers to push in more terrorists, officials said.","Eight soldiers sustained injuries, mostly splinter wounds from grenade blasts, and were evacuated to hospital.

"In 2023 too, -40 was good enough for NEET PG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-2023-too-40-was-good-enough-for-neet-pg/articleshow/126663852.cms,"There is much outrage in the medical community that the cut off for NEET PG 2025 has been reduced to zero percentile for the reserved category, which is equivalent to a score of minus 40. However, this is not the first time a score of minus 40 was good enough to qualify. The cut off was similarly reduced to zero percentile in 2023 for all categories and then too the equivalent score was minus 40.In 2023, when the medical counselling committee announced the reduction to zero percentile, it did not reveal that this was equivalent to a score of minus 40. TOI had analysed the NEET scores and pointed out that zero percentile meant 14 candidates who scored zero marks, 13 with negative marks and the one getting the lowest mark of -40 out of 800 would also qualify. In 2025, there are 126 candidates who have scored zero or less. Zero percentile means the lowest score or that none of the candidates got less. In 2023 and in 2025, one candidate got the lowest score of -40.Interestingly, in July 2022, in response to a petition filed by three students seeking lower cut off, the government had stated in court that ""minimum qualifying percentile for admission is required to be maintained to ensure minimum standard of education and general standards for admission to professional courses"".Taking the government's argument into consideration, the court dismissed the petition and ruled against lowering the standards of medical education as it ""involves in its ambit the matter of life and death"".In 2023, govt officials were quoted in news reports justifying lowering the cut off to zero as a one-time measure to fill vacant PG seats. However, this has become a regular feature with cut offs being lowered to abysmal levels every year. About 2 lakh to 2.3 lakh students appear for NEET PG for over 70,000 seats (about 57,000 MD/MS seats and the rest are DNB and PG diploma seats). However, the seats in private medical colleges remain vacant as the fees for clinical subjects in many of them runs into crores which most candidates cannot afford. Lowering the cut off increases the pool of 'qualified' candidates and improves the chance of finding candidates with deep pockets who can afford the fees even if they have rock bottom scores.""To lower NEET PG qualifying marks to abysmal level is driven solely by commercial considerations. This decision 'reserves' post-graduate medical seats to the rich and mighty in commercial fiefdoms called private medical colleges. This is shameful and must be condemned as unadulterated corruption,"" tweeted former principal health secretary of Andhra Pradesh Dr PV Ramesh.","The cut off for NEET PG 2025 has been reduced to zero percentile for the reserved category, which is equivalent to a score of minus 40.

How India got its first woman PM this day in 1966,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-india-got-its-first-woman-pm-this-day-in-1966/articleshow/126663187.cms,"On Jan 19, 1966, the high-domed Central Hall of Parliament — where India’s Constitution had been adopted — witnessed a spectacle unlike any before. For the first time since Independence, the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) elected its leader through a full-fledged contest. Out of that tense, four-hour drama emerged Indira Gandhi , 48, as India’s first woman Prime Minister.“She was cheered as she entered the hall, clad in a white sari with a light brown shawl wrapping her shoulders,” TOI reported. When the returning officer announced, “I declare Mrs Gandhi elected,” the hall broke into “thunderous cheers”. It was not merely a personal triumph. The vote marked a turning point for the Congress party — and for the way succession battles would be fought within it.After Lal Bahadur Shastri’s sudden death in Tashkent, in Jan 1966, India was without a Prime Minister once again. Acting PM Gulzarilal Nanda took charge.Indira Gandhi did not enter a smooth succession. The only daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, she had long lived in his shadow — first as his companion, later as a political figure in her own right. She had served as information minister under Shastri and as Congress president in 1960.Powerful regional leaders — chief ministers of 11 of India’s then 16 states — rallied behind her, signalling support just four days before the vote. Another contender, Nanda, withdrew. But Morarji Desai, the formidable former finance minister, refused to step aside.“Why should I form a separate party? I am a true Congressman and I will remain in the Congress,” Desai declared. What many expected to be a smooth transition became one of the most bitterly fought leadership contests in India’s parliamentary history.At the centre of the storm was Congress president K Kamaraj, who tried to avoid a contest. However, Desai insisted on a ballot, alleging “pressure” on MPs to back a particular candidate. Chief ministers, he said, had “no business” imposing their preferences on the CPP. Kamaraj countered that in a federal democracy, the views of the states mattered.On the eve of the vote, Desai told reporters that MPs were “not dumb cattle” and framed the battle as one between the party establishment and ordinary parliamentarians. He said he had proof of pressure — but declined to elaborate, arguing that naming supporters could expose them to victimisation if he lost.As the vote neared, Delhi became a political beehive. Chief ministers met MPs from their states, and journalists camped outside the homes of Kamaraj, Desai and Indira Gandhi.On Jan 19, the Central Hall filled with 526 Congress MPs — a record turnout. Desai arrived first, greeting members with folded hands. Minutes later, Indira Gandhi walked in, went up to Desai, said “namaste,” and posed with him as photographers urged them to clasp hands.In the nominations, the lines were clear. Desai was proposed by K Hanumanthaiya. Indira Gandhi’s name was proposed by acting Prime Minister Nanda and seconded by Sanjiva Reddy.Counting dragged on through the afternoon, fuelling tension and rumours of an imminent result. Four times there were false alarms. Then, around 3pm, the returning officer emerged.“I declare Mrs Gandhi elected.”The figures were emphatic: 355 votes for Indira Gandhi, 169 for Morarji Desai — nearly 68% of the valid votes, a two-thirds majority that even her supporters had scarcely dared hope for. What followed was as theatrical as the contest itself. Amid cheers, the two candidates shook hands and posed for press photographers and TV crews. Outside Parliament House, crowds had gathered all day; when the result became known, they cheered as Gandhi went to Rashtrapati Bhavan to meet the President S Radhakrishnan to form a new govt.Desai pledged cooperation, though with a sting: he hoped that “at least in future, an atmosphere of fearlessness” would be created in party and country. Indira Gandhi, at her first press conference, rejected any insinuation of foul play. “The insinuation that unfair play had a part in this election was unjustified,” she said, while agreeing that fearlessness in public life mattered.Reactions poured in across India. C Rajagopalachari said Gandhi might be more broad-minded, and closer to Nehru’s outlook, than Desai. Women’s groups celebrated.Abroad, the response was swift. The Soviet news agency Tass flashed the news within minutes. Lord Mountbatten called her election one that was bound to have a stabilising effect in India.As Kamaraj told MPs that day, “We have elected Mrs Gandhi to take over the burden of the Prime Ministership of the country.”Research: Rajesh Sharma","After Lal Bahadur Shastri’s sudden death in Tashkent, in Jan 1966, India was without a Prime Minister once again.

NEW DELHI: As IndiGo's exemption from the new safety-enhancing flight duty rules for A320 fleet pilots expires Feb 10, the airline must tell DGCA this week, likely Monday, whether it can still run more than 2,000 flights a day under the new rules that increase pilot requirement, reports Saurabh Sinha.If it cannot, authorities are expected to step in and cut flights in time to avert a repeat of last December's chaos, for which the DGCA fined the airline Rs 22.2cr, an amount pilots' body has dismissed as ""peanuts"", saying the regulator counted only three days of disruption when the turmoil lasted far longer.Regular meetings are being held with IndiGo to get a status on their preparedness for once the flight duty time limitation (FDTL) exemption ends on Feb 10. They have informed us about their pilot hiring plans. The airline has been doing dry runs with its scheduling software by matching available pilot strength with number of flights to be operated. On Monday they are expected to share their post Feb 10 preparedness,” said people in the know.It is learnt that from Feb 1 IndiGo will plan its crew rosters as per new FDTL rules and without factoring in the current exemption that will end later that month.IndiGo flights have been reduced till the end of winter schedule (which ends on last Saturday in March) and the airline plans to serve its entire network with these cuts under the new FDTL rules. It is learnt IndiGo may not seek any further exemptions.The aviation ministry and the DGCA are keeping a very close watch on the situation. “We can’t and won’t allow a repeat of what happened last Dec,” said sources.The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has termed the DGCA’s Rs 22.2cr fine on IndiGo as “peanuts” and questioned some aspects of its report. FIP president Captain CS Randhawa said: “The DGCA probe takes cognisance of IndiGo flight disruptions only on three days — Dec 3, 4 & 5. In reality, the disruptions lasted much longer till about mid Dec and the scale was much higher.”Captain Randhawa questioned the lack of action. “Issuing a warning letter after a massive disruption of this scale is a joke, like the fine amount. Also with IndiGo flights cut, why hasn’t the FDTL exemption been revoked? The DGCA is levying a fine of Rs 30 lakh for each day of non-compliance of the new flight duty rules. Does it mean that non-compliance of the law can be traded with a penalty?” Captain Randhawa said.IndiGo said on Saturday that it is “committed to taking full cognisance of the orders and will, in a thoughtful and timely manner, take appropriate measures… an in-depth review of the robustness and resilience of the internal processes at IndiGo (is) underway to ensure that the airline emerges stronger out of these events in its otherwise pristine record of 19 plus years of operations..”","IndiGo's exemption from the new safety-enhancing flight duty rules for A320 fleet pilots expires Feb 10.

FIR In July 2023, Suspects Not Even Identified Yet







IMPHAL: A 20-year-old from the Kuki-Zo community, who became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur, has died waiting for justice.Eighteen when she was abducted and allegedly ""handed over"" to members of an armed group, the woman carried physical and psychological injuries that never healed, culminating in her death on Jan 10, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum said.The FIR, filed two-and-a-half years ago, is still pending at Porompat police station in Imphal East. None among her alleged attackers has been even identified.Kuki-Zo organisations, including Committee on Tribal Unity, held a candlelight vigil Saturday, demanding accountability for the woman's trauma through the 30-odd months she lived since the assault. She first reported the alleged crime to Kangpokpi police on July 21, 2023, two months after it occurred.This was after she fled the Imphal Valley amid spiralling unrest there. The FIR states that she was abducted on May 15 that year from near an ATM booth in Imphal's New Checkon. Some women from a group involved in the ethnic clashes allowed four armed men belonging to a valley-based outfit to take her to a hilltop, where three of them allegedly took turns sexually brutalising her before dumping her in a creek.The woman survived when an autorickshaw driver ferrying vegetables found her. The next day, she fled Imphal and sought treatment at a Kangpokpi hospital. She was referred to a hospital at Kohima in Nagaland and later to Guwahati in Assam.Despite months of medical care, the woman continued to suffer from uterine complications and deep psychological trauma, ITLF said. The organisation termed her death ""emblematic"" of the atrocities faced by the community during the ethnic violence.The Committee on Tribal Unity urged the Union govt to ensure justice was done to the young woman, saying punishing the perpetrators would ""uphold the spirit of the PM's Beti Bachao vision"".","20-year-old from Kuki-Zo community became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur.

"When winter burns: Uttarakhand to Kashmir, Himalayan forests are catching fire out of season",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-winter-burns-uttarakhand-to-kashmir-himalayan-forests-are-catching-fire-out-of-season/articleshow/126661834.cms,"‘Mountains where we’ve lived our lives don’t feel as pleasant anymore’

The pattern extends further north

But does dryness alone explain the scale or spread?

DEHRADUN/KULLU/SRINAGAR: For decades, forest fires in the Himalayas followed a predictable calendar. They started simmering in late spring and early summer, when rising temperatures, dry winds and accumulated leaf litter turned forests combustible. Winter, by contrast, was the season of snow, moisture and relative calm. That rhythm has been breaking for the past few years.This winter, forests across Uttarakhand - and increasingly Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir - have been burning with an intensity and frequency that forest officials and scientists say is no longer an anomaly, but indicative of a shifting ecological pattern. ""Forest fires are part of a natural cycle, but climate variability is compressing and intensifying that cycle,"" said Amit Kumar Verma, senior scientist at Dehradun's Forest Research Institute, who is involved in a five-year study to understand shifting forest fire regimes across the country.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country - 1,756 - surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country — 1,756 — surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.Dec, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years. Forest officials attribute much of the spike to extreme dryness. “We have had a completely rainless December. Moisture levels in forest floors are very low,” a senior official said. Like Uttarakhand, Himachal, too, has not received any rainfall since the first week of October last year, and snowfall has been largely absent from major apple-growing belts such as Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba. This has led to fires sparking across the state’s forests -- maximum at Shimla forest circle (62), followed by Rampur (16), Mandi (8), the Great Himalayan National Park-Kullu (6), Chamba and Kullu (4 each), and Bilaspur and Wildlife (South) circle (2 each) as per data from the state forest department.Kashmir’s forests have been enduring a harsh, snow-deficient winter too. Fires have been reported across the Valley and the Pir Panjal range, including Uri, Bandipora, Nishat and Poonch. In Dec, a forest guard died while fighting a blaze in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, and on Jan 12, a forest fire in Poonch triggered a series of landmine explosions along the Line of Control after flames spread into mined areas in Balakote and Mendhar sectors. “There is nearly a 40% snowfall deficit after three consecutive dry winters,” said Mudasir Mehmood, DFO Awantipora. “With no soil moisture, it’s no surprise that grass becomes highly flammable.”Officials point to stubble burning in farms close to forest fringes, biomass and solid waste burning, and in some cases, villagers setting fire to forest floors to encourage fresh grass growth for cattle. Anti-forest activities — including poaching and attempts to flush wildlife from cover — are also cited by forest and wildlife experts as possible reasons.According to former Uttarakhand head of forest force Jairaj, forest fires are rarely driven by a single cause. “In high-altitude areas with valuable wildlife like musk deer, poachers sometimes light fires to corner animals during winter when they are already vulnerable. Climate change adds another layer — everything is dry, and even a small spark can escalate into a big blaze,” he said.What is compounding the situation is that traditional forest management practices have eroded. The gradual decline of grazing and community-led clearing has allowed dry grass and leaf litter to accumulate on the forest floor, creating a potent mix that can erupt into a blaze if a carelessly-thrown beedi or half-lit match comes its way. “Earlier, villagers regularly cleared jungle grass. With migration and alternative livelihoods, that practice is fading,” an official said.On the ground, residents are already feeling the impact. In Jyotirmath (formerly Joshimath), 61-year-old Sarvani Devi has been watching, with a wary eye, smoke spiralling from the forest near her house for the past few days. “If these fires spread, everything will turn to ash. That is our biggest fear. Somehow, these mountains, where we have lived all our lives, don’t feel as pleasant anymore.”","December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS.

Vande Bharat Sleeper ticket cancellation to be costly affair,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharat-sleeper-ticket-cancellation-to-be-costly-affair/articleshow/126661131.cms,"India Reveals First Vande Bharat Sleeper Offering Faster Overnight Travel On Kolkata-Guwahati Line

NEW DELHI: Cancelling confirmed tickets of newly launched Vande Bharat Sleeper trains will be costlier for passengers, according to new norms notified by the Railways.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership. The draft gives Trump authority over membership, renewals, and final approval of decisions.","US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” The Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition.

It has also requested finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to issue sector-specific clarification or guidance regarding her ministry’s 2024 order to end arbitration for all such projects.In its circular with regard to revised dispute resolution issued on Jan 12, the road transport ministry, while referring to the finance ministry order, said that any dispute between parties involving value of Rs 10 crore or more will not be referred to arbitration, and these will be resolved by conciliation.In its letter to road transport secretary V Umashankar, the National Highway Builders Federation (NHBF) has said invoking this provision in ongoing projects is “against settled principle of fair contracting” and would have a cascading impact on lenders and highway builders. It has urged the ministry to withdraw the revised provisions to ongoing projects, claiming that such a move will “impair project cash flow and debt servicing ability”, “trigger lenders concerns” as well as shift financial stress to the banking system.In a separate letter to Sitharaman dated Jan 17, the federation has submitted that the revised dispute framework, in its present form, discourages investment, increases project cost, delays execution and transfers the financial risk to the banking system.“Given the long concession periods, high leverage, dependence on stable cash flows and sensitivity of financing structures, dispute resolution mechanisms for highway projects require sector-specific calibration,” the NHBF said.Separately, NHBF has flagged the issue with bankers and financial lenders, suggesting they assess the impact of ending arbitration on highway loan portfolio with respect to ongoing projects as well as bankability of future projects under the amended model concession agreements of BOT, HAM and EPC.",National Highway Builders Federation (NHBF) has opposed the road transport ministry’s move to end arbitration in disputes with claims of over Rs 10 crore.

"Driven by state-run utilities, distribution companies post Rs 2,700cr profit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/driven-by-state-run-utilities-distribution-companies-post-rs-2700cr-profit/articleshow/126661081.cms,"From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: Power distribution companies in the private and public sectors have staged a smart turnaround, reporting a combined profit of over Rs 2,700 crore in 2024-25, as against losses of Rs 25,553 crore in the previous year, govt said on Sunday.Power ministry officials attributed this to improved performance by state-run power utilities.""If we look at the last three financial years, private distribution companies have been posting profits, which went up further in the last financial year. The positive profit after tax in 2024-25 is the result of a sharp decline in losses of state-run power discoms,"" said a senior power ministry official.The Centre said infrastructure modernisation and accelerated smart metering, prudent tariff structures and the transparent accounting of subsidies to ensure full recovery had aided the performance of discoms. Providing for subsidies is seen to be critical as state after state is announcing free power for consumers up to a certain level, and in the absence of money being set aside in the budget, discoms have to bear the burden.Additional measures - such as introducing uniform accounting and greater transparency across distribution utilities to improve financial governance, enforcing legal contracts through timely payments to support investment in new renewable energy projects and incentivising states to implement critical power sector reforms by linking borrowing limits to performance metrics under the additional borrowing scheme - also contributed to the improved financial performance, govt said.The impact of these reforms is evident not only in the bottom lines but also in other performance indicators, including a reduction in aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses and a narrowing gap between the average cost of supply and the average revenue realised, the ministry said.AT&C losses, a key parameter of efficiency, have reduced from 22.6% in 2013-14 to 15% in 2024-25, an official statement said. Reforms such as late payment surcharge rules led to a 96% reduction in outstanding dues to generating companies, from Rs 1.4 lakh crore in 2022 to Rs 4,927 crore by Jan 2026, while reducing payment cycles from 178 days in 2020-21 to 113 days in 2024-25, it added.Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner at consulting firm PwC India, said the return of some state discoms to profitability should be seen as a structural inflection point rather than an accounting exercise, driven by improved billing efficiency, lower AT&C losses, better subsidy discipline and selective tariff rationalisation.Yet, there is a long way to go for the discoms, which had accumulated losses of Rs 6.8 lakh crore in 2022-23.Besides, regulatory assets, due to insufficient pass-through of costs, were estimated at over Rs 3 lakh crore, mainly in states such as Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and West Bengal.Anujwsh Dwivedi, partner at Deloitte India, said from a financial sustainability perspective, resolving the outstanding debt pile of over Rs 7 lakh crore in state-owned discoms is the most significant challenge facing the sector.","Power distribution companies in the private and public sectors have staged a smart turnaround.

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

Composer A R Rahman's claims that he possibly faced instances of ""communal"" discrimination in the last eight years in Bollywood caused an outcry on Saturday. During an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman was asked, "". ..today there's a lot of discrimination against the Tamil community within Bollywood. What was it like in the 1990s. Did you ever face...""Before the question was completed, Rahman answered, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff. Maybe God concealed all this stuff (laughed). I never felt all those..."" before he went on to say, ""Past eight years, maybe, because the power shift has happened... people who are not creative have the power now to decide things. And this might have been a communal thing also, but not in my face. But I would hear like Chinese whispers that this happened. And they booked you and the music company went and funded the movie and got five composers. And I said, 'Oh, that's great. Rest for me'.""The answer put out verbatim suggested there was a possible communal angle to some producers preferring other musicians. The interview said “you’re very proud of the soundtrack of ‘Chhaava’ and it is a really good soundtrack, but it is a divisive film.”The composer said, “It is… I think it cashed on divisiveness. But I think the core of it is to show bravery.”Interestingly, A R Rahman said that the director insisted on him working for the project. In his words, “The director, I told him like, ‘why do you need me for this?’ He said, ‘We need only you for this’.” ‘Chhaava’, directed by Laxman Utekar, was among biggest hits of 2025.The maestro has won a clutch of National Awards for best music; more recently for ‘Kaatru Veliyidai’ (Tamil, 2017) and ‘Mom’ (Hindi, 2017) and ‘Ponniyin Selvan 1’ (Tamil, 2022).Writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar sought to play down the controversy. Speaking to IANS, Akhtar said, “People in Mumbai have great respect for him. Maybe they think he has got busy with the West (producers). Or they think he is busier with his big shows. Small producers are also scared to approach him. I don’t think there is any communal element.”Bollywood singer Shaan also said there’s unlikely to be any communal angle to the situation. He told IANS, “I have sung so much over the years, yet even I don’t get work at times. But I don’t take it personally, because it is a personal matter; everyone has their own thinking and their own preferences… Rahman saab has a signature style and he is a great composer. His number of fans hasn’t gone down, but are increasing. I don’t think there is any communal or minority angle in music. Music doesn’t work that way.”","A R Rahman was asked about discrimination against the Tamil community in Bollywood. He said, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff. Maybe God concealed all these stuff (laughed) I never felt all those..."" The answer put out verbatim suggested there was a possible communal angle to some producers preferring other musicians.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126629415,imgsize-1057482,width-400,resizemode-4/article-28.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, while addressing a rally in Singur, West Bengal, said that the people of the state are determined to oust the ruling Trinamool Congress and bring an end to the 15-year “maha-jungleraj” of the Mamata Banerjee-led government.PM Modi was in West Bengal to launch development projects worth over Rs 830 crore and to flag off three Amrit Bharat trains connecting Kolkata with other parts of the country.Hitting out at TMC “maha-jungleraj”, PM Modi said, “A very large number of mothers, sisters, and farmers have come. Everyone has come with the same hope that we want real change. Everyone wants to change the 15-year mega-jungleraj. The BJP has once again stopped the jungleraj in Bihar, and now West Bengal is also ready to bid farewell to TMC's maha-jungleraj.”He further criticised the state government on security and border issues, saying, ""The TMC government is playing with the security of West Bengal and the country as well, so the youth here, in particular, need to be extremely cautious. TMC provides all kinds of facilities to infiltrators here. It holds protests to protect infiltrators.”“For the past 11 years, the Central Government has been repeatedly writing letters to the TMC government that fencing needs to be installed on the Bengal border, for which land is required, but TMC doesn't care.TMC provides patronage to such gangs that give protection to infiltrators and create fake documents for them. The time has come when infiltration must be completely stopped,” he added.""West Bengal has immense potential, it has very large rivers, very extensive coastlines, fertile land, every district of West Bengal has something special... The BJP will further enhance this strength of every district..."" he added. PM Modi’s remarks come as BJP prepares for the high-stakes assembly elections due in the next three months.""Industries will be established in Bengal, investments will come only when law and order improves here, but in Bengal, rioters, looters, and mafias have been given free rein. Here, syndicate tax is imposed on everything. Only the BJP government will end this syndicate tax, this mafia rule, and this is also Modi's guarantee,” said the PM.PM Modi alleged that the state government obstructs central schemes from reaching the people. “I want to serve people of Bengal, but TMC govt prevents benefits of central schemes from reaching them.”“Centre created digital platform to register fishermen across country, but TMC has put brakes on it,” he said, adding, “Central government working to meet goal of developed eastern India.”Concluding his address, PM Modi paid tribute to the 150th anniversary of, highlighting the cultural significance of Hooghly.“I have come to Singur today at a time when the country has celebrated the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram. In Parliament too, a special discussion was held to sing the glory of Vande Mataram, and the entire country, the entire Parliament, has paid homage with reverence to Rishi Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.”“The connection between Hooghly and Vande Mataram is even more special; it is said that it was right here that Rishi Bankim Ji gave Vande Mataram its full form. Just as Vande Mataram became the proclamation of independence, we must also make Vande Mataram the mantra for developing West Bengal and India,” he added.During his visit, he inaugurated the Jayrambati-Barogopinathpur-Maynapur rail line and flagged off a train between Maynapur and Jayrambati. Three Amrit Bharat Express trains connecting Kolkata with New Delhi, Varanasi, and Chennai were also flagged off.The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for the Extended Port Gate System in Hooghly district, which includes an Inland Water Transport terminal and a road over bridge at Balagarh. Spread over approximately 900 acres, the project is aimed at improving cargo handling efficiency and reducing congestion in urban areas.Highlighting infrastructure development, PM Modi said, “In the last 11 years, the Central Government has made a very large investment in the capacity expansion of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port. Under the Sagarmala scheme, roads have also been constructed to improve the connectivity of this port. We can all see the result of this today...”","PM Modi was in West Bengal to launch development projects worth over Rs 830 crore.

NEW DELHI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape. Held after a delay of nearly four years due to legal challenges and prolonged administrator rule, the elections across 27 municipal corporations and 2,869 seats were widely seen as a test of governance credibility and of existence for some.The verdict was emphatic. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged as the dominant force in urban Maharashtra, winning 25 of the 29 municipal corporations across the state. In Mumbai, the Mahayuti crossed the majority threshold in the 227-member BMC, with the BJP seizing over 89 wards alone in its favour.With this, there ended the Shiv Sena 's uninterrupted control of the civic body since 1997 and marked the BJP’s first real capture of India’s richest municipal corporation.The biggest and the obvious winner of the civic polls verdict is Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The BJP has won over 89 wards of the BMC on its own, compared to 82 in 2017. In key wards such as Mulund West (Ward 103), the BJP defeated the MNS by a margin exceeding 12,000 votes.The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Navi Mumbai with 65 seats, Kalyan-Dombivli (50), Mira-Bhayandar (78), Nashik (72), Panvel (55), Pune (119), Pimpri-Chinchwad (84), Solapur (87), Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (57), Nanded (45) and Nagpur (102).The saffron party stunned the Pawars in the Pune polls, clinching 119 seats, with Ajit Pawar-led NCP coming in distant second with 27 and its ally NCP (SP) getting three seats, while the Congress managed 15 seats.In the 151-member Nagpur civic body, the BJP held sway, getting 102, while the Congress bagged a mere 34.Nashik saw the BJP bagging 72 seats, Shiv Sena 26, Shiv Sena (UBT) 15, Congress 3 and NCP 4.The BJP's victory streak continued in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where it won 57 seats, followed by Shiv Sena with 15, Congress with one, while other parties registered with the SEC, especially the AIMIM, bagged 33 seats.With the BMC’s annual budget exceeding Rs 60,000 crore, control over Mumbai’s civic machinery also enhances the BJP’s long-term institutional leverage ahead of the 2029 assembly elections.For the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the civic results offered political validation.Since the 2022 split, the Shinde faction’s central challenge has been legitimacy. The civic verdict, particularly in Mumbai and Thane, strengthened its claim. The party won 399 wards and emerged as the second largest party in Maharashtra civic polls.In Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar, the Shinde faction recorded near-sweeps, reflecting voter preference for continuity in infrastructure delivery over symbolic politics.The BJP–Shiv Sena–NCP Mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in Maharashtra.Despite contesting separately in some cities, the alliance demonstrated effective vote transferability in Mumbai, Nashik, and Nagpur.The alliance won 1,991 of 2,869 wards across Maharashtra.With a major victory, Mahayuti showed how to converted state-level power into grassroots and civic dominance.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) made modest but consequential gains in Maharashtra civic elections.It won 33 seats in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation and bagged a total of 126 seats across Maharashtra.The improved tally in Sambhajinagar marked a clear jump from the 2015 municipal corporation elections, when the party had secured 24 seats.AIMIM also registered gains in several urban pockets across the state.The party has won 21 seats in Malegaon, 14 in Nanded Waghala, 12 in Amravati, 10 in Dhule, 8 in Solapur, and eight in Mumbai. It also secured six seats in Nagpur, three in Akola, two each in Ahilyanagar and Jalna, and five seats in Thane.While these numbers remain small, AIMIM’s presence seems to have fragmented the opposition vote, particularly hurting Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT).When the results of the Maharashtra civic elections were being tallied, one of the most unexpected stories to emerge was not about seats won or wards lost. It was about narrative currency — how a Tamil Nadu BJP leader emerged as a winner without contesting.And it all started with the 'rasmalai' controversy which begun when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.However, Mahayuti won and BJP MPs and supporters were soon having a field on social media, posting photos of 'rasmalai' and mocking Raj Thackeray.The biggest electoral setback was suffered by Uddhav Thackeray. From over 130 BMC seats in 2017, Sena (UBT) fell to 65 seats. Even traditional strongholds such as Gorai and parts of Mahim witnessed defeats.The loss of control of the BMC is a big blow to Uddhav the Sena has always maintained its control over the civic body.His long-anticipated reunion with estranged cousin Raj Thackeray also failed to make any impact on the ground.Overall, the party managed to bag only 155 across the state.The Indian National Congress emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections because the results exposed its near-total erosion in urban politics.In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Congress, which fought in alliance with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), bagged 24 seats, a sharp fall from its already diminished presence in 2017, when it had crossed 30. Across Maharashtra’s 27 municipal corporations, the party managed roughly 324 wards out of 2,869.The Congress, which ran a muted campaign in the run-up to the polls, managed significant victories in Bhiwandi, where it won 30 seats, Chandrapur 27, and Latur 43.In Pune, once a Congress-influenced city, the party was restricted to fewer than five seats out of 162, while in Mumbai it failed to emerge as a serious contender in most wards.In Pune, it was reduced to fewer than five seats. The party which decided to go solo after that Thackeray cousins jouned hands, failed to make any impact in BMC polls where Uddhav's Sena won 72 seats.It seems that lack of a city-specific agenda, factional infighting and minimal national leadership presence during the campaign compounded the decline.For Raj Thackeray, the civic polls reinforced a long-term downward trajectory.The leader joined hands with his cousin Uddhav to keep the BJP at bay. But the results show how he failed miserably.During the election campaign, he tried to appeal around the idea of the 'Marathi Manoos' while invoking Balasaheb Thackeray. This politics of sentiment obviously has deep roots in Maharashtra’s history.He relied on fiery speeches, symbolic gestures and cultural flashpoints to command attention, often targeting migrants, linguistic outsiders, or perceived cultural dilution in Mumbai. Unlike mass welfare or governance-driven politics, his appeal was rooted in 'Marathi asmita'.This, however, failed to resonate with the voters. The MNS failed to secure major wins, while getting only 6 of 227 wards in Mumbai.At the state level, the party managed to get only 13 of 2869 wards.Sharad Pawar emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections as the results exposed the steady erosion of his once-formidable grip over urban and organisational politics.For decades, Pawar was seen as the master strategist of Maharashtra, capable of shaping outcomes even when not in direct power. The civic verdict punctured that perception. The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) failed to make any meaningful impact in the BMC, getting just 1 win in Mumbai wards and remaining marginal in Pune, a city long considered central to Pawar’s political influence.His strategy to join hands with nephew Ajit Pawar for the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections also failed as the BJP secured victory in these bodies.Statewide, the faction’s ward tally was 36 of 2869 wards, far below expectations for a party led by a veteran of his stature.Crucially, Pawar’s traditional role as an alliance-builder also lost relevance. Fragmentation within the opposition and the rise of a dominant Mahayuti alliance reduced his ability to act as a power broker. This time, though reports suggested he wanted the Maha Vikas Agadi to fight as a unit, he failed to keep the parties together, especially after the Thackeray cousins joined hands, pushing Congress to go solo.Despite being part of Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar has emerged as one of the losers this election. During the civic poll campaigns, Ajit Pawar repeatedly hit out at his own Mahayuti allies, Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, exposing visible faultlines within the ruling alliance.As election date approached, he finally decided to unite with his uncle Sharad Pawar to contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections as a united front.His attacks were also unusually sharp for an alliance partner, with Pawar questioning why local bodies under BJP–Shinde control still struggled with water supply, roads and urban planning. In several rallies, he projected his faction as a corrective force within the government rather than a stakeholder in its record. .The civic results however suggest the tactic backfired. Ajit Pawar’s faction underperformed in Pune and Nashik, reinforcing the perception that public sparring with allies during elections diluted his credibility and bargaining power within the Mahayuti rather than strengthening it.Eventually, the Pawar lost their strongholds, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, to BJP with huge margin.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape.

‘Jungle raj’ must end for growth: PM Modi in West Bengal; attacks TMC govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jungle-raj-must-end-for-growth-pm-modi-in-west-bengal-attacks-tmc-govt/articleshow/126662158.cms,"PM Modi Says Bengal Ready To End TMC’s ‘15-Year Mega-Jungleraj’

Your vote for BJP will ensure no Sandeshkhali, says Modi

SINGUR: “Maha jungle raj” must end if Bengal is to regain law and order, attract industry and restore investor confidence, PM Narendra Modi said Sunday, launching a blistering attack on Trinamool Congress govt as the state heads towards assembly elections due in about three months.Addressing a rally at Singur — about 40km northwest of Kolkata in Hooghly district — Modi framed the contest as a straight fight between “Trinamool’s maha jungle raj and BJP’s sushasan (good governance)”, accusing Bengal’s governing party of playing with national security by protecting infiltrators for vote-bank politics.“Infiltrators who have settled using forged documents must be identified and sent back,” Modi said, urging voters to replicate Bihar’s verdict against “jungle raj” and end what he called Trinamool’s 15-year misrule.He charged TMC with facilitating infiltration by denying land for fencing along Bangladesh border. “For the past 11 years, Centre has repeatedly written to state govt that a barbed-wire fencing must be erected along Bengal’s border and land is required for it. But TMC has shown no concern,” he said.This story continues on page 9 in the newspaper. For your reading convenience we have added it below.“Your vote for BJP will ensure there is no more Sandeshkhali or theft of jobs,” Modi said.Modi accused Trinamool of blocking central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, PM Matsya Sampada Yojana and PM Shree Schools, alleging Bengal followed the path of erstwhile Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi govt in stopping benefits.Despite BJP’s pre-rally pitch built around “Tata”, “Nano” and land-for-industry, Modi made no reference to Singur’s past as flashpoint of land acquisition protests that helped Mamata Banerjee end Left Front’s 35-year govt in 2011 and drove Tata’s Nano project to Gujarat. Instead, he linked industry’s return to law and order. “Industry and investment will come to Bengal only when there is proper law and order. If voted to office, BJP will end syndicate tax and rioters,” he said.Earlier, Modi inaugurated and laid foundation stones for port-led development projects worth 830 crore, including an “extended port gate system” at Balagarh, about 60km north of Kolkata along Hooghly river.He said project would ease pressure on Kolkata Port, turn Hooghly into a warehousing and trading hub, draw hundreds of crores in investment and create jobs. “New markets will open for farmers here,” he said, flagging export potential for local produce.Outlining BJP’s economic script, Modi promised district-wise capacity building, a one-district-one-product push, a special plastic policy and immediate encouragement to jute packaging. Hooghly anchors Bengal’s jute belt and hosts nearly 60 mills. Turning to women and youth, Modi invoked social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, urging them to become agents of change.“Children will not get good education or jobs so long as TMC is in govt,” he said, alleging education sector was under grip of a mafia and Hooghly had been shamed by an education scam. “If voted to office, we will ensure they are behind bars.”Modi credited his govt for Durga Puja in Kolkata securing Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage tag, Santiniketan — about 160km northwest of Kolkata in Birbhum district — gaining world heritage status, classical language recognition for Bengali and installation of Subhas Chandra Bose’s statue at India Gate. “TMC was part of Sonia Gandhi’s govt but made no effort. It happened only after BJP formed govt in Delhi,” he said.","Modi accuses TMC of playing with national security by protecting infiltrators for vote-bank politics. “Your vote for BJP will ensure there is no more Sandeshkhali or theft of jobs,” he says.

Final green light for India’s 1st PPP Earth imaging Sat project likely this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-green-light-for-indias-1st-ppp-earth-imaging-sat-project-likely-this-week/articleshow/126660465.cms,"BENGALURU: More than four months after India’s space regulator-cum-promoter Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) announced the winners of India’s first EO Satellite System (EOSS) under PPP, a concession agreement is expected to be signed as early as this week, allowing the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground.“It has taken longer than expected, but the [concession] agreement is now expected to be signed shortly, after which work on the project can finally move from paper to the ground,” a source familiar with the matter confirmed to TOI.TOI had reported in Aug 2025 that the consortium had won the project through a “zero-bid”. While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, delay in processes will see the agreement be signed this week. Another source said that if all goes as planned it could happen in the “first-half” of this week at Isro headquarters in Bengaluru.The project, which will create a constellation of 12 satellites, assumes importance not only because it has the private sector at its heart, but also in the backdrop of the persistent gap in strategic space assets and demand.The data from the satellites will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space is expected to implement the project through Allied Orbits. IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka had told TOI after announcing the winning consortium that the project would be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV).Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create a constellation of 12 satellites in low-Earth orbit. The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.IN-SPACe described the programme as a paradigm shift in India’s space policy – one that places private enterprise at the heart of building national capability. As per IN-SPACe: “Satellites will carry a mix of panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral, and microwave sensors, capable of delivering high-resolution, analysis-ready geospatial data…”In addition to meeting India’s own needs, the consortium is expected to be allowed to sell analysis-ready data and value-added services commercially.","A concession agreement is expected to be signed as early as this week, allowing the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground.

Advanced version of Nagastra drone used in Op Sindoor developed: Rajnath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/advanced-version-of-nagastra-drone-used-in-op-sindoor-developed-rajnath/articleshow/126658304.cms,"New Army Video Highlights Operation Sindoor Strikes On Terror Camps And Airbases

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Sunday that an advanced version of the Nagastra drone, which was extensively used during Operation Sindoor to “accurately strike terrorist targets”, has been developed. He said that the Nagpur-based Solar Defence and Aerospace Plant, which developed Nagastra, has also developed ‘Bhargavastra’, a micro-missile-based system, having conducted a successful test-launch.Rajnath stressed that the govt is focusing on ensuring that the private sector’s contribution in defence manufacturing reaches 50% or more in coming times.Inaugurating a medium-calibre ammunition manufacturing facility at the company’s plant in Nagpur, Rajnath said, “We witnessed the brilliance of your (company’s) ingenuity in Operation Sindoor. The Nagastra drone developed by this group was successfully deployed. This drone struck precisely those who harboured ill intentions towards our country.” Lauding the development of a more advanced version of Nagastra, the minister said, “One never knows when it might be needed, given that our neighbour is so unpredictable. ”Nagastra-1 is a ‘kamikaze’ (suicide) drone that can search and destroy any target by crashing into it.Bhargavastra, on the other hand, is India's first indigenous, low-cost counter-drone system, developed to neutralise hostile drone swarms using micro-rockets and guided micro-missiles, featuring radar detection of up to 6 km and engagement of up to 2.5 km.The newly inaugurated facility is a fully automated plant manufacturing 30mm ammunition, which is extensively used by the Indian Army and Navy. Rajnath also visited the Pinaka rocket manufacturing facility and flagged off the first tranche of guided Pinaka rockets bound for Armenia.He said that Op Sindoor had lasted for approximately 88 hours, but the sheer scale and intensity of those 88 hours couldn’t be described in words. “In such operations, every minute, every decision and every resource is crucial. If we look around today, we see various kinds of wars. One thing becomes clear: warfare is becoming increasingly complex, and its intensity is constantly increasing. In such a situation, preparation for wars should be done on a war footing. ”Rajnath recalled the time when ammunition shortages hampered the country’s defence preparedness, making the govt realise the need to become self-reliant in the field.

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

Under the leadership of Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, the Delhi Government has taken a major decision to further expand the capital's Metro network. The Government has released its share of funds for the remaining three corridors of Phase IV of the Delhi Metro Rail Transit System (MRTS).According to an official release, the Chief Minister stated that these projects will provide improved Metro connectivity to various parts of Delhi and further strengthen the public transport system. The corridors are expected to be completed within four years. Efficient metro operations will also play a significant role in controlling pollution.The three Phase-IV Metro corridors will have a combined length of 47.225 kilometres. The projects are estimated to cost approximately Rs 14,630.80 crore, of which Rs 3,386.18 crore will be met by the Delhi Government.The first corridor is proposed from Lajpat Nagar to Saket G-Block, with a length of 8.385 kilometres and eight elevated Metro stations. The second corridor is proposed from Inderlok to Indraprastha, with a length of 12.377 kilometres. This line will have a total of ten Metro stations, one elevated and nine underground.This corridor has been included under a combined financial framework with the Lajpat Nagar- Saket G-Block corridor. The combined project cost of these two corridors is Rs 8,399.81 crore, of which the Delhi Government's share will be Rs 1,987.86 crore.The third and longest corridor is proposed from Rithala to Kundli, extending connectivity to the neighbouring state of Haryana. This corridor will be 26.463 kilometres long and will include 21 stations. The total cost of this project has been estimated at Rs 6,230.99 crore, with the Delhi Government's share amounting to Rs 1,398.32 crore. Of the total cost, Rs 5,685.22 crore will be spent for Delhi and Rs 545.77 crore for Haryana, the release noted.These three corridors will provide better travel facilities to residents across several parts of Delhi. The Lajpat Nagar-Saket G-Block corridor will pass through Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj, GK-1, Chirag Delhi, Pushp Bhawan, Saket District Centre and Pushp Vihar.The Inderlok-Indraprastha corridor will connect areas such as Inderlok, Dayabasti, Sarai Rohilla, Ajmal Khan Park, Jhandewalan, Nabi Karim, New Delhi Railway Station, Delhi Gate, and Delhi Secretariat-IG Stadium.The extensive Rithala-Kundli corridor will pass through Rithala, Rohini Sectors 25, 26, 31, 32, 36, Barwala, Rohini Sectors 35 and 34, Bawana Industrial Area-I (Sectors 3-4 and 1-2), Bawana JJ Colony, Sanoth, New Sanoth, Bhorgarh village, Narela Anaj Mandi, Narela DDA Sports Complex, Narela, Narela Sector-5, Kundli and Nathupur.The tendering process for these corridors is underway, and basic work has already begun on some of them. All three corridors are expected to be completed within four years. The construction of these metro corridors will enhance connectivity across northern, central and southern parts of Delhi, as well as the Delhi-NCR region. This will reduce traffic pressure on roads, save commuters' time and promote the use of public transport.According to a release, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that the three Phase-IV corridors will provide Delhi with a modern and robust public transport system aligned with future requirements. She said the project will ensure safe, convenient and time-efficient travel for commuters, reduce dependence on private vehicles and contribute to pollution control. The Chief Minister added that the Delhi Government is continuously taking concrete steps towards making the capital a world-class city, and the expansion of the Metro network is a key part of this commitment.","The Government has released its share of funds for the remaining three corridors of Phase IV of the Delhi Metro Rail Transit System.

Ranchi ED Raid: Jharkhand HC Calls Police Action ‘Pre-Planned’, Orders Security Boost

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Sunday said it has filed a chargesheet against Magicwin, a betting website owned by two Pakistani nationals based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).According to the ED, the prosecution complaint—equivalent to a chargesheet—was filed on January 15 before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.The agency has named 14 individuals and entities as accused in the money laundering case linked to Magicwin. The case originates from an FIR registered by the Ahmedabad cyber crime police, which accused the portal of unauthorised hosting, streaming, and broadcasting of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. The tournament’s broadcasting rights had been granted by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to Star India Private Limited.During the investigation, the ED found that the Magicwin brand portal is owned by Magicwin Sports Limited, a UK-registered company with Pakistani nationals Gulab Harji Mal and Omesh Kumar Gurnani listed as directors. Both individuals are based in the UAE.The agency alleged that the portal and its mobile application functioned as a betting exchange offering sports betting and leisure gambling, with transactions routed through mule accounts.The website allegedly facilitated betting on cricket, tennis, football, and horse racing, while also providing live match streaming and real-time scorecards to users placing bets.The ED further claimed that several celebrities and social media influencers had promoted Magicwin and that proceeds from the betting operations were routed through hawala channels and cryptocurrencies.In October 2025, the Centre banned real-money online gaming and betting, describing it as a “financial and social menace” that “drains the hard-earned money of users, especially the youth.”","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Sunday said it has filed a chargesheet against Magicwin, a betting website.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of blocking central funds meant for West Bengal. His remarks came on a day when the prime minister addressed a rally in the poll-bound state, urging voters to end the TMC’s 15-year “maha jungle-raj. ”“You blocked funds meant for the people of Bengal and harassed them. You inflicted miseries on the people of Bengal over the last five years, and so your party will be reduced to below 50 seats in the assembly polls,” Banerjee said while addressing a rally in West Bengal’s Nadia district.His aunt, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee—who also heads the TMC—has repeatedly accused the BJP-led Union government of withholding central funds for the state and has made the issue a key poll plank.The Diamond Harbour MP further asserted that the fall of the BJP-led government at the Centre would begin in West Bengal.“In the coming days, the people of Bengal will throw you out of power in Delhi after electing the TMC for the fourth time. ‘Poriborton habe’ (there will be change at the Centre),” he remarked.On the recent Enforcement Directorate raids at the Kolkata office of I-PAC—a leading political consultancy that has been working with the TMC since 2021—Banerjee accused the Centre of “misusing” central agencies against opposition-run states.“They tried to steal our data before the elections, but we have people’s support. They (the BJP ) have everything—from the ED and CBI to a section of the media. They put central agencies behind me before the 2021 elections but failed. Now they are resorting to falsehood,” he stated.Referring to the ongoing revision of electoral rolls, Banerjee claimed that despite allegations of large numbers of illegal immigrants, the exercise had identified 54 lakh “unmapped voters"" in the state.“Now, unhappy with the findings, they are planning to delete over one crore names from the electoral rolls. We will not allow this to happen,” he alleged.Buoyed by its success in the recent assembly elections in neighbouring Bihar, the BJP is eyeing its first stint in power in West Bengal, where the TMC, under Mamata Banerjee, has been in office since 2011.","Abhishek Banerjee accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of blocking central funds meant for West Bengal.

How does '

crypto hawala

' network work

How 'mule accounts' hold key

NEW DELHI: Security agencies have flagged a sophisticated “crypto hawala” network allegedly being used to bypass the country’s financial safeguards to funnel untraceable foreign funds into Jammu and Kashmir, raising concerns that the money is being used to finance terror activities in the Union territory, officials said on Sunday.The development has put the security establishment on high alert. Officials warned that these shadow funds are aimed at reviving separatist elements and reigniting ""anti-national propaganda"" in the region—activities that had been largely curtailed following sustained crackdowns by police and central agencies.According to officials, this digital version mirrors the traditional ""hawala"" system, in which money is sent through non-banking channels. The ""crypto hawala"" network operates entirely off the grid, using the anonymity of unregulated cryptocurrency to erase the financial trail and inject cash into the domestic economy.An investigation by the Jammu and Kashmir Police, in coordination with central security agencies, has found that handlers based in countries including China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia were directing individuals in the Union Territory to create private cryptocurrency wallets.These wallets were often set up using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to evade detection and typically did not require Know Your Customer (KYC) or identity verification.Jammu and Kashmir Police has suspended the use of VPN services in the Valley, amid growing indications that such tools were being used to facilitate crypto wallet registrations. VPN is seen as a handy tool for terrorists as well as separatists to avoid detection.Officials further said that the foreign handlers transfer cryptocurrency directly into these private wallets, placing the funds under local control without routing them through any regulated financial institution. The wallet holders then travel to major cities such as Delhi or Mumbai, where they meet unregulated peer-to-peer (P2P) traders and convert the cryptocurrency into cash at negotiated rates.This process effectively “breaks the financial trail,” allowing foreign funds to enter the local economy as untraceable cash, they added.The network hinges on the use of “mule” or “parking” accounts that layer transactions to obscure the money trail. To keep the system running, syndicates have instituted a structured commission mechanism under which such account holders earn between 0.8 and 1.8 per cent per transaction.These accounts typically belong to ordinary individuals drawn in by the promise of commissions and reassured that their role is low-risk, limited to temporarily parking funds. In reality, full control of the accounts—including net banking usernames and passwords—is handed over to the operators.A single operator is usually given access to multiple mule accounts at a time, often ranging from 10 to 30 accounts.The emergence of “crypto hawala” is being viewed as a new challenge linked to off-exchange trading. By operating in the “grey market,” such networks are able to bypass anti-money laundering regulations that apply to registered financial entities.(With PTI inputs)","Security agencies have flagged a sophisticated “crypto hawala’ network allegedly being used to funnel untraceable foreign funds into Jammu and Kashmir.

Infrastructure as a catalyst for industrial growth

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Translating policy intent into global manufacturing competitiveness

(Arnab Basu is Partner and Chief Industries Officer, PwC India)

As India advances towards achieving the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat, Budget 2026 arrives at a poignant moment in the country’s economic journey. Over the past decade, public policy has laid strong structural foundations through reforms, infrastructure expansion and a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing which has collectively reshaped India’s growth trajectory. The task before the upcoming Budget is not to reset direction, but to consolidate gains, deepen execution and ensure that public investment continues to crowd in private capital at scale.At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure. Sustained public CapEx has been one of the most defining features of recent budgets, supporting growth even amid global uncertainty. Investments in roads, railways, ports, airports and digital infrastructure have improved connectivity, reduced logistics costs and strengthened India’s competitiveness across sectors.The Union Budget FY26 has the opportunity to build further on this momentum by continuing a high level of CapEx allocation, while sharpening focus on project execution, asset monetisation and state-level capacity building. The next phase of infrastructure growth must prioritise outcomes related to productivity gains, faster completion cycles, and stronger linkages between physical and digital networks.Equally important is the role of infrastructure in enabling India’s manufacturing ambitions. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, announced over successive Budgets, have begun to yield tangible results across electronics, pharmaceuticals, automotive components and renewable energy equipment. As India seeks to position itself as a trusted manufacturing partner in global value chains, this year’s Budget can focus on refining these schemes—shifting from capacity creation to deeper supply-chain integration, technology adoption and MSME participation. Simplifying compliance, improving access to long-term finance, and strengthening industrial clusters will be critical to sustaining manufacturing competitiveness beyond initial incentives.The manufacturing opportunity in India is both cyclical and structural. While geopolitical realignments and supply-chain diversification are creating near-term openings, domestic demand, urbanisation, and rising incomes provide a long-term anchor. Policy continuity will therefore be key. Measures such as stable customs regimes, faster approvals, and coordinated centre-state frameworks can reinforce investor confidence. Targeted investments in logistics parks, warehousing and multimodal transport can further reduce the cost of manufacturing and exports which has been a long-standing constraint for India’s manufacturing industry.While infrastructure and manufacturing form the core of Budget expectations, the role of technology (especially AI) cannot be overlooked. AI is increasingly becoming a horizontal enabler, enhancing productivity in design, operations, maintenance and supply chain planning across infrastructure and industrial sectors. Budget 2026 can support this transition through targeted incentives for digital adoption, investments in data infrastructure, and skilling programmes that prepare the workforce for technology-enabled manufacturing. The focus should be on practical application rather than experimentation alone, ensuring that AI investments translate into measurable productivity gains.Skilling and human capital development remain another critical lever. Large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing expansion will require a workforce equipped with both technical and digital skills. Building on initiatives such as Skill India and recent efforts to align skilling with industry needs, the Budget can further strengthen public-private partnerships in vocational training, apprenticeships, and continuous upskilling. Ensuring that India’s demographic dividend is absorbed into these sectors will be central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development.From an investor's perspective, policy predictability and fiscal discipline will be crucial. In the past, India has demonstrated that growth-oriented spending can coexist with a credible fiscal consolidation path and the Union Budget FY26 will have to continue this balancing act by maintaining CapEx while managing deficits and debt prudently. According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey: India Perspective, a majority of Indian CEOs remain confident about the country’s economic growth, underpinned by reform stability and sustained public investment. Preserving this confidence will depend on the Budget’s ability to reinforce continuity while addressing emerging execution challenges.Beyond numbers and allocations, this year’s budget will be read as a signal of intent. For global investors, it will indicate how firmly India is committed to strengthening its role in global manufacturing and infrastructure-led growth. For the domestic industry, it will shape decisions on capacity expansion, technology adoption, and long-term investment, while for the states, it will define the contours of cooperative federalism in delivering large-scale projects.The Union Budget FY26 represents an opportunity to reinforce the foundations of Viksit Bharat through steady, purposeful policy action. By sustaining infrastructure investment, deepening manufacturing capabilities and enabling technology-led productivity, the Budget can help ensure that India’s growth story remains resilient and inclusive. As the economy navigates an evolving global landscape, it is this consistency of direction and execution that will preserve momentum and translate ambition into enduring economic outcomes.","At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure.

MCX Gold has regained its bullish momentum after a short consolidation phase and is now trading around the all-time high of 143,500. With upward strength reasserting itself and minimal signs of a reversal, the rally is likely to extend to higher levels. The recent breakout reinforces the strength of the move, and the overall outlook remains positive as long as prices stay above the breakout zone.From a weekly perspective, the 139,000 level remains a key support area, marking the lower boundary of the consolidation range. Any dip toward this zone is expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this support strengthens the bullish structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well placed to advance toward the 151,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective rise is in line with the broader bullish trend and underscores the strength of prevailing market momentum. Additionally, a decisive and sustained breakout above the consolidation range resistance has attracted fresh buying interest, reinforcing positive sentiment and setting the stage for a continued upward move.Overall, Gold remains well positioned to maintain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly favouring trend continuation.

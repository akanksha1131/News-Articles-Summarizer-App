What someone else says is not relevant. Everything is for the good of Maharashtra but those who are anti-Maharashtra should not be entertained. We have not given pre- conditions.

This is not a pre-condition but the sentiment among people,” Raut added.Naresh Mhaske from Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, meanwhile, dismissed the possibility of a patch-up and said, “When Raj was in the party, Uddhav did not want to give him responsibility and did not want him to visit shakhas. How is he going to include him now?”Industries minister Uday Samant from Shiv Sena also dismissed the possibility of a reconciliation. “Raj is an independent thinker and he is unlikely to respond to riders and pre-conditions,” he said.","MNS’ functionary Sandeep Deshpande asked whether Uddhav would apologise for the 17,000 cases lodged against MNS workers when he was CM. “The parties should not come together just for elections but there are larger issues affecting Marathi people,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120467963,imgsize-1145334,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Shortly after arriving, Vance and his family are expected to visit the Swaminarayan Akshardham temple and a market selling traditional Indian crafts.

NEW DELHI: In an incident reminiscent of the Atul Subhash case , a 33-year-old techie from Uttar Pradesh, Mohit Yadav , has died by suicide, allegedly due to mental harassment by his wife. In a video message recorded before his death, Yadav cited the lack of legal protection for men as a key reason behind his decision.""By the time you get this video, I will be gone from this world. If there was a law for men, maybe I wouldn’t have taken this step. I couldn’t bear the mental torture by my wife and her family. Mom, Dad, please forgive me,"" Yadav said in the video. ""If I don’t get justice even after my death, then let my ashes be immersed in a drain,"" he added.He claimed that his wife Priya Yadav threatened him to register his house and property in her name and accused his mother-in-law of making his wife abort their child. The TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.""My wife threatened me that if I didn't register my house and property in her name, she would implicate my family in a dowry case. Her father, Manoj Yadav, filed a false complaint, and her brother threatened to kill me,"" he said.This comes only two days after a 30-year-old woman in UP was booked for allegedly driving her husband, Mohit Tyagi, a 34-year-old media professional, to suicide through constant harassment and financial demands. According to the FIR filed by Mohit's brother, the trouble began soon after Mohit married Priyanka from Sambhal in December 2020. She allegedly took off with gifted jewellery and lodged false complaints against him and his family.Last year in December, Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old Bengaluru techie, died by suicide in his apartment. Before his death, he left behind a 24-page note and a video message, in which he accused his wife and in-laws of relentless harassment. He alleged they had filed eight false police complaints against him and demanded Rs 3 crore to settle a divorce, along with an additional Rs 30 lakh for access to his son. Following a complaint lodged by Atul’s younger brother, Bikas Modi, the three accused were arrested.Also read: Meerut murder Déjà Vu: Woman, lover kill hubby in UP","Mohit Yadav, a 33-year-old techie from Uttar Pradesh, has died by suicide.

'Good thing'

'BJP is causing harm to Maharashtra'

'Two zeros always make a zero'

'If Balasaheb Thackeray were alive ...'

NEW DELHI: The political landscape of Maharashtra witnessed an interesting development as estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray indicated a possible reconciliation after two decades.""I am ready to come together (with Raj Thackeray). I am ready to come forward in the interest of Maharashtra, keeping aside minor incidents. I have put an end to all fights.

If people settle their differences, it’s a good thing. What else can I say about it? I also appeal to all Marathi people to come together for the benefit of Maharashtra and Marathi,” Fadnavis said.Echoing a similar sentiment, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said it was entirely up to Raj Thackeray whether or not to align with Uddhav Thackeray.“It is Raj Thackeray's prerogative whether to join hands with Uddhav Thackeray or not. He can decide his party's future. The BJP has no objection to it,” Bawankule said.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, on the other hand, appeared irked when asked about the possible alliance between the Thackeray brothers.Shinde seemed visibly irritated and brushed off the reporter’s mic. He asked the reporter to focus on the government's work instead.“Talk about work,” Shinde said.State Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal said if the two Thackeray families came together, there was no reason to object.""When Raj Thackeray says his issues with Uddhav Thackeray are not bigger than Maharashtra, he must be hinting that BJP is causing harm to Maharashtra.. that investment is going out of Maharashtra,"" he said in Pune. Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) are allies at present.""The BJP is trying to undermine the language and culture of Maharashtra, and Raj Thackeray's stand seems to endorse this view,"" he added.However, Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske expressed skepticism over the possibility of reconciliation, pointing to past tensions between the two.“Uddhav Thackeray had threatened to leave the house if Raj Thackeray was given any responsibility. He even opposed Raj’s visits to party branches in Mumbai and differentiated between his supporters. Uddhav should answer why he opposed Raj Thackeray,” Mhaske said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam took a jibe at the potential alliance, dismissing it as electorally irrelevant. “Two zeros always make a zero,” he said.“Uddhav aligned with Congress and relied on Muslim votes. Now, realising that this strategy hasn’t worked, he is leaning toward Raj Thackeray. This is not about Maharashtra’s interest—it’s about personal survival. Even together, they cannot pose a challenge to Mahayuti,” Nirupam added.Meanwhile, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MP Supriya Sule said the move should be welcomed if it is in the interest of the state.“Raj Thackeray said that the state’s issues are bigger than their personal dispute. That is happy news to me. If Balasaheb Thackeray were alive, he would have been very happy today,” Sule said.“If the two brothers are coming together for Maharashtra, we should welcome it wholeheartedly,” she added.","Uddhav and Raj Thackeray indicated a possible reconciliation after two decades.

Here are the key points:



Rescue operations were still under way when last reports came in, with police and emergency teams battling rough weather to reach affected villagers.

Over 100 people were safely rescued from flood-hit Dharam Kund village, where nearly 40 houses were damaged -- 10 of them completely washed away.

The downpour led to multiple landslides and mudslides between Nashri and Banihal on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway (NH-44), forcing its closure.

Hundreds of vehicles were stranded as stretches of the highway were rendered impassable, including a portion near Panthiyal that was swept away. Officials advised commuters to avoid travel until the road is cleared and weather improves.

The latest casualties bring the rain-related death toll in the Jammu region to five in the last 48 hours. On Saturday, two people, including a woman, were killed and another injured by lightning strikes in Reasi’s Arnas area.

A senior government official confirmed ""massive damage"" in the district due to landslides, hailstorms, and strong winds, saying the immediate priority was to protect lives. An official meeting was scheduled for later in the day to assess the situation and plan aid.

Union minister and Udhampur MP Jitendra Singh, who has been closely monitoring the developments, praised the swift response of the Ramban district administration led by Deputy Commissioner Baseer-ul-Haq Chaudhary.

Singh, in a post on X, highlighted the challenging weather conditions and said relief efforts, including financial support, were being extended. He added that his personal resources were also available for those in need and urged the public to remain calm.

“The district administration deserves appreciation for timely and prompt action, which helped save several precious lives,” he said.

Authorities continue to assess damage and provide relief, while NH-44 remains shut, cutting off the Kashmir Valley’s only all-weather road link with the rest of the country.

NEW DELHI: Flash floods and landslides triggered by incessant rain wreaked havoc across Jammu and Kashmir's Ramban district on Sunday, killing at least three people and damaging dozens of homes.The chaos was compounded by a cloudburst in Seri Bagna village, which claimed the lives of three residents -- including two brothers, Aqib Ahmad and Mohd Saqib.","Rescue operations were still under way when last reports came in, with police and emergency teams battling rough weather to reach affected villagers.

During a visit to the relief camps, Rahatkar described the distressing conditions faced by the displaced individuals, stating, ""The torture and suffering they faced was beyond imagination, having left a deep scar in their minds which need to be healed and addressed on an urgent basis with a humanitarian approach.""Rahatkar further criticised the state government for its lack of response, saying it was their ""moral duty"" to provide security and compensation for the victims.

States push labour reforms amid delay in notifying codes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/states-push-labour-reforms-amid-delay-in-notifying-codes/articleshow/120464894.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the long-awaited labour codes remain pending for official notification, several states have proactively amended their labour regulations to align with key industry demands - part of a broader strategy to position themselves as investment-friendly destinations .At least 19 states and UTs have increased the retrenchment threshold from 100 to 300 without govt approval - a demand that industry has been making for two decades. An equal number of states and UTs have also doubled the threshold for workers for applicability of Factories Act to 20 (for units with power) and 40 (for those without power). Ditto for the Contract Labour Act, where the threshold for number of workers for applicability of the law has been raised from 20 to 50.While several of the amendments may be limited to NDA-governed states, when it comes to allowing women to work night shifts, 31 have gone ahead with the change, while all states and UTs have notified reforms related to compliance notice before prosecution . This indicates that irrespective of party line, there are some issues on which economics trumps politics as state leadership scouts for investments, especially in the manufacturing sector to create jobs.Similarly, fixed-term employment has been permitted in 25 states, enabling easier hiring to deal with seasonal requirements. In fact, after amending the regulations, states such as Madhya Pradesh have introduced safeguards to prevent misuse of the provisions, following some complaints. Twenty-five states have also moved ahead and allowed for compounding of offences.Besides, sources told TOI that close to two dozen states and UTs were considering mandating issue of notice for strikes and lockouts across industrial establishments, a provision that applied to public sector companies.Several of the issues on which the states and UTs have moved forward are also included in the four labour codes that were enacted with much fanfare five years ago, but are yet to be notified. Consultations with the states are currently underway, with Bengal holding it up, said sources.But Centre's nudge to the states, including during a national workshop conducted by the labour ministry, has got states moving within the current legal framework.A task force led by cabinet secretary T V Somanathan is putting together a set of best practices that states can follow, and the revised labour regulations are a crucial element.","At least 19 states and UTs have increased the retrenchment threshold from 100 to 300 without govt approval.

Maharashtra language panel opposes Hindi from class 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-language-panel-opposes-hindi-from-class-1/articleshow/120464569.cms,"MUMBAI: The Language Advisory Committee in Maharashtra on Sunday publicly opposed the introduction of Hindi as a third language alongside Marathi and English for students in Class I to V in state schools, putting the state government on the defensive.Maharashtra is the second major state after Tamil Nadu where introducing a compulsory third language in primary school is leading to a blowback. The committee, in a letter to the chief minister, said the move was neither academically justified nor ""in tune with students' psychology"".On April 16, a directive from the state announced implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) in Maharashtra - and with it, the clause that Hindi would be taught as third language from Grade 1. It resulted in a clamour on social media with criticism led by opposition parties.On Sunday, CM Devendra Fadnavis said he had not read the panel's letter but clarified that Hindi was not replacing Marathi. ""Marathi is mandatory. But under NEP, it is mandatory to learn three languages, of which two need to be Indian languages. So when the language panel headed by the minister submitted their report, they opted for Hindi as we have the required strength of faculty to teach Hindi.""But, he clarified, if some schools want to teach another Indian language in place of Hindi and if there are at least 20 students opting for the same, a teacher can be provided; if not, teaching can probably take place online. And this could be especially considered for schools in areas bordering other states, he added.However, the language committee has warned that the 3-language policy is ""unscientific"" and could place unnecessary pressure on young students. They suggested instead that a requirement for only two languages, including Marathi, be enforced until Class XII. The committee's letter said, ""Ideally, SCERT (State Council of Educational Research and Training) Pune should have consulted the committee before making such decisions. Our membership includes both professors and recognised experts in linguistics and language sciences.""","Maharashtra is the second major state after Tamil Nadu where introducing a compulsory third language in primary school is leading to a blowback.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is investigating if alterations being carried out at a meat shop on the ground floor may have triggered the collapse of a four-storey building in Mustafabad area , which resulted in 11 deaths on Saturday.According to the FIR, just hours before the incident, construction work was underway at the shop. ""The owner (Tehsin) and others removed the wall between two shops on the ground floor, bypassing the building norms and committing negligence,"" it said. A police source said, ""We are also probing if seepage led to the weakening of the foundation.""The source said the building was constructed in a phased manner - the initial structure consisted of ground and first levels, and two more floors were added later. Police will question the builder and obtain the building's original layout. They will also seek documents from MCD related to the building's approval and compliance.Police said MCD will conduct a thorough inspection of the building on Monday to assess the structural integrity and identify potential causes of the collapse. Police will focus their inquiry on the ground-floor shops, and question their owners or anyone who had taken them on rent.

Family members of the deceased were overcome with grief as the bodies were brought out in ambulances.At the spot, several relatives searched for the belongings of their loved ones that might be buried under the rubble.

LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on late Sunday registered an FIR and launched a probe into an alleged inter-state module that was using encrypted messaging platforms to circulate anti-national content and radicalise youth to carry out fidayeen (suicide) attacks.According to ATS officials, a group was active on secure platforms such as Signal (under the name Al-Maut-ul-Hind), Instagram (Green Birds), Discord (Strangers), and WhatsApp, where they shared content promoting jihad, encouraged attacks on Indian security forces, and discussed targeting Hindu leaders and Israeli establishments in India.The FIR was filed on Thursday by ATS Sub-Inspector Rahul Satyal against three youths, two of whom belong to Sambhal and one from Patna. Their identities have not been revealed, and an interrogation with the ATS team is being conducted.Sources in the ATS said the group was allegedly conspiring to destabilise the country by pushing violent narratives online and planning targeted strikes. “The suspects were reportedly engaged in testing explosives and practising with air and pellet guns. They also shared training videos and posts to recruit new members for “suicide missions,” the ATS stated in the FIR.“Initial inputs suggest that the accused were part of a larger network preparing for proxy warfare against the Indian govt,” said a senior ATS official. “They aimed to foment communal tension and incite attacks on sensitive installations.”The FIR has been lodged at ATS's Gomtinagar police station under sections of UAPA, the Foreigners Act, and Explosives Act, and further investigation is underway to identify other members of the module and trace their funding sources.The ATS has roped in technical experts to track digital trails across multiple platforms and is coordinating with central agencies for deeper intelligence.","The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) registered an FIR and launched a probe into an alleged inter-state module.

SRINAGAR: National Conference president Farooq Abdullah blamed Sunday communal hatred for the recent violence in Bengal’s Murshidabad district, sparked by protests against the Waqf Act. The real threat to India comes not from China or Pakistan but from those spreading religious hatred, he said without naming anyone.“Didn’t you see how the bulldozers were run? How they demolished mosques, schools, houses of the community. What was their fault?” Abdullah said in Jammu after addressing a rally. “The Supreme Court had banned using bulldozers. How can they use it? Does it mean the law is different for them and me?”Abdullah refused comments on former RAW chief AS Dulat’s forthcoming book “The Chief Minister and the Spy”, which claims the NC president secretly supported the revocation of Article 370 in 2019, although he publicly denounced it as a betrayal. “I don’t want to talk about Dulat or his book,” he said.Rejecting speculation about a split in NC, Abdullah said reports that eight to 10 party MLAs were planning to defect were false. “No one is leaving the party. Instead, it is BJP that will go,” he said. “BJP lied about having their own CM in J&K. Where is their CM?”Reflecting on the abrogation of Article 370, Abdullah said some people in Jammu had celebrated without realising that the Dogra Maharaja had enacted special status laws in 1927 to protect local jobs and land. “After the abrogation, all jobs are going to outsiders who don’t know anything about J&K villages or topography,” he said.He also accused Centre of keeping J&K without an elected govt since PDP-BJP coalition ended in June 2018. “But by the grace of god an elected govt has now been formed in J&K (after assembly elections in Sept-Oct 2024),” he said. “You see a huge rush in the civil secretariat after the elected govt has taken over. It shows you people are real rulers.”Abdullah said nothing was done in J&K during the presidential rule (2018-2024), yet BJP is demanding accountability for just six months of CM Omar Abdullah’s govt.","National Conference president Farooq Abdullah blamed communal hatred for the recent violence in Bengal’s Murshidabad district. “Didn’t you see how the bulldozers were run?

The report was later shared with the Ministry of Electronics and IT. The project promises to develop angstrom-scale chips , far smaller than the smallest chips in production today,"" a source in the government familiar with the proposal told PTI.The DPR proposes the development of 2D semiconductors using ultra-thin materials like graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials can enable chip fabrication at the angstrom scale, significantly smaller than current nanometer-scale technologies.The smallest chip currently in production is the 3-nanometer node, manufactured by companies like Samsung and MediaTek.A brief summary of the 2D materials project -- which aims to replace silicon, is available on the website of the PSA's office.Sources in the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) confirmed that the proposal has been under discussion.""MeitY is positive about the project. The Principal Scientific Adviser and Secretary, MeitY, have held meetings on it. MeitY is exploring the electronics applications where such technology can be deployed. This is a collaborative effort that requires due diligence at every step,"" an official aware of the matter said.India currently relies heavily on foreign players for semiconductor manufacturing -- a technology that is strategic from both an economic and national security standpoint.The country's largest semiconductor project, being set up by Tata Electronics in partnership with Taiwan's PSMC, involves an investment of Rs 91,000 crore. This project has been approved under the India Semiconductor Mission and is eligible for 50 per cent capital support from the government.In comparison, the IISc-led proposal requests a relatively modest Rs 500 crore over five years to build indigenous technology for next- generation semiconductors. The project also includes a roadmap for self-sustainability after the initial funding phase.Globally, 2D materials have drawn significant interest. Europe has invested over USD 1 billion (around Rs 8,300 crore), South Korea over USD 300 million, and countries like China and Japan have made serious but undisclosed investments in 2D material-based semiconductor research.""2D materials will be key enablers for future heterogeneous systems. While global momentum is building, India's efforts remain limited and need urgent scaling. This is a domain where India can take leadership, but time is running out,"" said an officer familiar with the efforts and global developments, speaking on condition of anonymity.According to the PSA office website, communications regarding the project have been ongoing since 2021, with outreach to key ministries including MeitY, DRDO, and the Department of Space. NITI Aayog also recommended the project in September 2022 based on the IISc report.The officer privy to the research ecosystem noted that several countries are already preparing for a post-silicon world as traditional chip scaling nears its limits.""Global technology players have turned their attention to 2D semiconductors. India now needs to move from deliberation to execution. The proposal seeks Rs 500 crore over five years, but there is still no formal assurance. This window may not stay open for long,"" the person added.","A team of 30 scientists from India's premier institute, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has submitted a proposal to the government to develop 'angstrom- scale' chips.

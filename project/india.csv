NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his wishes to citizens for Kharna Puja, a key ritual of the four-day Chhath festival, which honours Surya Dev and Chhathi Maiya. PM Modi in a post on X said: ""Heartfelt greetings to all on the auspicious occasion of Kharna Puja during the grand festival of Chhath. My respectful salutations to all those observing the fast! On this sacred occasion, symbolising devotion and discipline, there is a tradition of partaking in sattvic prasad along with kheer prepared with jaggery. My wish is that on this ritual, Chhathi Maiya bestows her blessings upon everyone.""Along with his message, PM Modi shared a song titled ""सुख लेके उगिह दुख लेके डूबिह"" by Dinesh Lal Yadav , popularly known as Nirahua . Yadav is a prominent Bhojpuri actor, singer, producer, and politician, affiliated with the Bharatiya Janata Party . He unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Azamgarh against Akhilesh Yadav but later won the 2022 bypolls from the same constituency.Chhath Puja , beginning Saturday, sees widespread celebrations across Bihar, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Nepal.Devotees perform Vedic rituals and offer prayers to the Sun God and Chhathi Maiya. Central to the festival are traditional folk songs known as Chhath Geet, which carry blessings for family and loved ones. Legendary folk singer Sharda Sinha is remembered for popularising these melodies across generations.Ahead of the festival, PM Modi encouraged citizens to share Chhath songs on social media, saying: ""The grand festival of Chhath, dedicated to nature and culture, is approaching. Devotees across Bihar and the entire country are immersed in preparations with full devotion. The songs of Chhathi Maiya enhance the grandeur and divinity of this sacred occasion. I request you to share Chhath Puja songs with me. I will share them with all fellow countrymen over the next few days. ""Remembering Sharda Sinha, the Prime Minister added: ""When it comes to worshipping Chhathi Maiya, it's natural to remember Sharda Sinha. She was the daughter-in-law of Begusarai. We honoured her first with the Padma Bhushan and then this year with the Padma Vibhushan. She is no longer with us, but her songs will always be remembered.""While rooted in Bihar, Chhath Puja is also observed in Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Nepali communities, highlighting the festival’s shared cultural heritage across the eastern subcontinent. Cities and towns are preparing riverbanks and public spaces for rituals, reflecting the festival’s enduring social and spiritual significance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his wishes to citizens for Kharna Puja, a key ritual of the four-day Chhath festival.

'Millions of dollars' to Pak intel

'Qaida Plant' & Osama Escape

The US intelligence community believed that India and Pakistan were on the brink of war in 2002, following the Parliament attack (Dec 2001) and the tense military standoff that followed under Operation Parakram, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said. Such was the threat perception that families were evaucated from Islamabad, he added. The State Department at the time was urging restraint on both sides, essentially advising that if a fight were unavoidable it should be kept short and strictly conventional, because the introduction of nuclear weapons would transform the situation for everyone.Even as the CIA in 2002 chanced upon evidence connecting al-Qaida and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the US decided that its relationship with Pakistan ""is bigger than India, Pakistan...we needed the Pakistanis actually more than they needed us at this point"".""...In March of 2002, we raided a Lashkar-e-Taiba safe house in Lahore. And in that house, we captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters who had with them a copy of the al-Qaida training manual. And it was the first time, analytically, that we were able to connect Lashkar-e-Taiba with al-Qaida. I remember receiving a cable from the deputy director of the CIA for intelligence congratulating us on finding this training manual, saying it was the very first time that we could attach the Pakistani govt to al-Qaida,"" he said.Asked about the issue not being highlighted, he said the decision was made at the White House. ""And the decision was that that the relationship is bigger than India, Pakistan. At least temporarily. The relationship, we needed the Pakistanis actually more than they needed us at that point. We were happy to throw money at them. That's what they responded to. But we really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,"" he said.Kiriakou pointed to India's stated posture on nuclear coercion, saying New Delhi has warned it will not tolerate nuclear blackmail and will respond decisively to any terror attack. He highlighted a string of Indian responses to terrorism over recent years, including surgical strikes across Line of Control in 2016, Balakot airstrikes in 2019, and Operation Sindoor in May of this year.American defence contractor funds and cash rewards handed out in Pakistan over decades of counterterrorism cooperation with US enriched some ISI officers, former CIA officer he said. ""I feel that Pakistani groups with an eye towards India benefited because of those American defence contractor monies. Their defence parts were all turned towards India. We paid tens of millions of dollars in cash as rewards to the Pakistani intelligence service. And God knows what they did with that money,"" he said.The former CIA officer also referred Osama bin Laden escaping after CIA had tracked him down soon after 9/11. ""We believed in Oct of 2001 that we had Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida leadership cornered at Tora Bora. We did not know that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an al-Qaida operative who had infiltrated the US military. We told him to come down the mountain. And he said through the translator, can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we'll give up. .. What ended up happening was bin Laden, dressed as a woman, escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,"" he said.","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou says India and Pakistan were on the brink of war in 2002.

NAGPUR: Red fury has turned inward. The central committee of the banned CPI (Maoist) has lashed out at its own politburo senior Mallojula Venugopal Rao, alias Bhupathi or Sonu, branding him a ""revolutionary traitor"" and ""counter-revolutionary"" for allegedly engineering a ""historic betrayal"" - the mass surrender of 61 Maoist cadres in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli on Oct 15.That surrender, hailed by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis as the ""beginning of the end"" of Naxalism, saw 50 weapons handed to security forces. In a press release dated Oct 16, the Maoists condemned it as a ""party-breaking act"" that returned ""lethal tools to the enemy"".Bhupathi's public defection has triggered a storm inside the outlawed outfit's top brass. The Maoist central committee, led by its elusive leadership under the pseudonym Abhay, expelled Bhupathi, Vivek (a Dandakaranya special zone committee member), Deepa, and 10 divisional committee members, calling on ""revolutionary masses"" to deliver ""appropriate punishment"".Yet, in a contradictory tone, the committee extended an olive branch to the surrendered cadres: ""We assure them that such people will pose no threat and can return to the party."" It warned Bhupathi and Satish - Dandakaranya commander Rupesh alias Takkalapalli Vasudev Rao, who led another mass surrender of 210 PLGA fighters in Chhattisgarh - to stop ""counter-revolutionary activities"" allegedly carried out under govt intelligence patronage.

The New Rules of Study Abroad 2025 | Managing finances and mistakes

NEW DELHI: The Centre is preparing a five-year plan for higher education with five main goals: raise enrolment (GER), improve employment and apprenticeships, build international links, upgrade quality and strengthen digital systems. The plan relies on ""big-ticket"" projects, state-wise targets and performance-linked funding.The quality measures include clearer accreditation bands, so that students can compare programmes easily and programmes that remain weak face closure; a national apprenticeship and placement exchange that will be integrated with campuses; and Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) targets being set for each state. Financing will separate capital spending (buildings, labs, servers) from operational spending (faculty, maintenance, software), with officials indicating a tilt towards results-based grants, wherein funds are released after verification of milestones.As per the internal report accessed by TOI, stronger institutions will support nearby campuses through mentor-mentee clusters, sharing teachers, labs and lesson plans to help lift outcomes quickly. Funding will be tied to performance on learning and placements and not just inputs such as infrastructure. ""Clear goals, clear owners, clear data - that's the approach,"" a senior official with education ministrysaid.To connect education with employment, the National Apprenticeship and Placement Exchange will be integrated with campus ERPs, so employers can post openings and students can apply, track interviews and receive offers on one platform. ""Degrees must connect to jobs. A single exchange stitched into campus ERPs will cut friction for students and recruiters,"" the official added. For international students, a single window will handle visa, FRRO registration and housing to reduce paperwork and make Indian campuses easier to join.","The Centre is preparing a five-year plan for higher education with five main goals.

"Gujarat, Maharashtra fishermen lead in installing space-tech transponders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-maharshtra-fishermen-lead-in-installing-space-tech-transponders/articleshow/124820867.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: Gujarat and Maharashtra have taken the lead among 13 coastal states and Union Territories in installing indigenous transponders, a tracking device guided by space technology, in marine fishing vessels. The devices are being used for transmitting real-time weather alerts and disaster warnings such as cyclones, monitoring, control and surveillance.The effectiveness of the high-tech transponders in saving lives and properties of thousands of fishermen was proved successfully when it guided 686 marine fishing vessels of Tamil Nadu back to safe harbour during two well-marked low-pressure systems early this week.Disaster management authorities are now confident of saving lives of fishermen during any future cyclonic events, including the upcoming one - cyclone named 'Montha' - that is predicted to hit Andhra Pradesh coast on Oct 28. Its first successful test-case in a limited way was, however, in Odisha where the alerts sent through the transponders had saved the lives of many fishermen who were out in the high seas during Cyclone Dana in Oct last year.More than 41,700 transponders have been installed in marine vessels across all coastal states/UTs ever since the installation began in Aug last year with Gujarat installing the highest number at 15,486 followed by Maharashtra (8,773), Tamil Nadu (3,884), Karnataka (3,773), Andhra Pradesh (3,490), Odisha (1,707) and Kerala (1,551) as on Oct 24. Govt is supplying these devices free of cost to the fishermen with a 60: 40 funding pattern between Centre and states, and 100% central share for UTs.""The transponders, developed by ISRO using its vessel communication and support system (VCSS) and operationalised by NewSpace India Ltd, are also quite critical from a security point of view as they can track routes of fishing vessels, enabling fishermen to understand the limits of legal fishing areas clearly. In case of any suspicious activities, the security agencies will be able to inspect the vessels,"" said an official.It's a two-way communication system enabling fishermen to send short messages using their phone while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast covering entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In case the fishermen cross Maritime Boundary Line, alerts are sent to avoid unintentional transgression. Information related to Potential Fishing Zones is also made available on their mobiles.A national fisheries application named as 'Nabhmitra' is being used to push real-time, targeted advisories and mass alerts directly to vessels equipped with transponders. It has been designed to provide access to all features in the regional languages. It also has efficient harbour management tools like a token system for entry and exit of fishing vessels for voyages enabling the boat owner to enter crew and vessel details.""In view to establish traceability of fish catch, which is essential for compliance to international guidelines of 'illegal, unreported and unregulated’ (IUU) fishing, provisions for entry with geolocation are also being made,"" said the officialCurrently, a few EU nations, China, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, South Africa and Chile are using such high-tech transponders on fishing vessels to enhance safety, improve monitoring, and combat illegal fishing.“The successful use of indigenous transponders during the recent twin low-pressure systems stands as a shining example of how India’s technological ingenuity can directly safeguard lives at sea. By blending space-based innovation with grassroots connectivity, the VCSS has transformed how coastal safety is managed-turning real-time data into decisive action,” said the official.","Gujarat and Maharashtra have taken the lead among 13 coastal states and Union Territories in installing indigenous transponders in marine fishing vessels.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra police on Saturday arrested Prashant Bankar, one of two individuals accused in connection with the suicide of a woman doctor in Phaltan taluka, Satara district.According to news agency ANI, Bankar will be produced in court today. The other accused sub-inspector Gopal Badne, is still absconding.A doctor posted at Phaltan subdistrict hospital was found dead in a hotel room on Thursday evening, officials said.She had checked into the hotel late Wednesday night, as her rented accommodation was far from the hospital.Hotel staff found her body after she failed to respond to repeated knocks.In a note reportedly written on her palm, the doctor accused sub-inspector Gopal Badane of repeated sexual assault and software engineer Prashant Bankar, her landlord’s son, of mental harassment.Satara police have registered a case of abetment of suicide against both.According to a statement the doctor allegedly submitted to an internal inquiry committee, she faced ongoing intimidation and harassment from police officials.She claimed she was pressured to alter post-mortem and medical reports and taunted over prior crimes reported in her home district of Beed.One alleged incident involved police forcing her to declare a high-blood-pressure patient fit for custody and taking the patient away without proper treatment. Despite submitting a written complaint to the deputy superintendent of police in June, she claimed no action was taken.Satara police said the doctor had been in a five-month relationship with Bankar, which later turned sour. Her interactions with the sub-inspector were linked to her hospital duties, as she often conducted medical examinations for suspects in custody. Badane is currently absconding.“We have suspended him and formed a special team to trace and arrest him and the other suspect,” said Inspector General Sunil Phulari.Political leaders have demanded a swift and independent probe. NCP leader Dhananjay Munde called for a special investigation team (SIT) and a fast-track trial, saying ignoring her complaints due to her Beed origin would be a grave injustice. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Ambadas Danve demanded that officials from outside Satara conduct the inquiry, calling the suicide “a case where protectors turned predators.”Relatives said the doctor had repeatedly complained about police harassment and pressure to alter reports. Activist Nitin Andhale shared her purported statement online, highlighting the alleged inaction and intimidation that may have contributed to her death.Satara superintendent of police Tushar Doshi confirmed that her complaints, including WhatsApp messages, were used to file FIRs under sections 64 (rape) and 108 (abetment of suicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.A civil surgeon-led inquiry panel is being set up to determine if hospital authorities acted on her complaints.Civil Surgeon Yuvraj Karape said the doctor had joined the hospital on contract and was nearing the end of her second 11-month term.She often stayed at the hotel after late-night duties, and authorities are examining all complaints regarding alleged police interference in hospital work.","A doctor posted at Phaltan subdistrict hospital was found dead in a hotel room on Thursday evening.

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Even AI roles can face cuts

Research roles are being redefined

Adaptability matters more than titles

Understanding resources is part of the job

Career stability comes from flexibility

The takeaway

When Meta announced that around 600 employees from its artificial intelligence division would be leaving, it drew attention across the tech world, reports. The cuts affected teams within Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) and Meta Superintelligence Labs, two groups that sit at the center of Meta’s AI efforts.The decision came as part of a larger restructuring plan to make the company’s AI operations more efficient and faster to execute. Meta said it wanted to reduce layers of management and remove decision-making delays. At the same time, it plans to continue investing heavily in AI infrastructure and hiring new specialists in the field.For many in the technology sector, this move is a reminder that even in areas that appear secure, change can come quickly. The layoffs reflect how large companies are rethinking their approach to AI: fewer research-heavy roles, more focus on applied innovation, and a stronger link between research and product outcomes.Here are some lessons from Meta’s restructuring that can help current and future tech workers prepare for a shifting industry.Artificial intelligence is seen as one of the most promising fields in technology, but the Meta case shows that growth alone does not guarantee stability.The company continues to spend heavily on AI, yet it reduced positions that did not align directly with its immediate goals.For professionals, this is a sign that it is not enough to simply work in a trending area. It is important to stay relevant within that space. Learning how to apply AI skills to real-world problems, understanding how your work connects to products or business goals, and keeping pace with new tools can help maintain your edge.The changes within FAIR highlight a shift in how companies value research. Many organizations want their research teams to be more closely connected to products and to contribute to measurable outcomes. Long research timelines without clear applications are becoming harder to sustain.For students, PhD graduates, or early-career professionals interested in research, this means thinking more broadly about impact. It helps to link your research goals to how they can be used in practice, explain your work in simple terms, and remain open to collaboration with non-research teams.Mark Zuckerberg said Meta wants a structure that moves faster and works with fewer layers. This direction values flexibility and problem-solving over position or tenure.In many large companies, being adaptable can now be more valuable than seniority. Workers who can learn quickly, adjust to new priorities, and cooperate across departments are often the ones who continue to grow, even during organizational changes. Technical knowledge is essential, but the ability to adjust and work well with others is equally important.Meta’s restructuring was also driven by competition for limited computing power among its AI teams. Decisions on which projects to fund or scale often came down to available resources and strategic focus.This shows why tech professionals should understand more than just their technical work. Knowing how budgets, data access, or computing capacity influence a project can make it easier to adapt and to communicate your work’s value to decision-makers. The broader your understanding of how technology and business align, the stronger your position becomes.The people affected by Meta’s layoffs were skilled and experienced, but even they were not shielded from change. However, many of them will find new opportunities because their skills can transfer easily across companies and sectors.For today’s workers, the main takeaway is to build careers that can move with the industry. Strengthen your core skills, keep learning, and maintain professional networks. Instead of relying on one employer or project, focus on how your skills can create value in different settings. Flexibility has become a key part of long-term career stability.Meta’s layoffs are more than a company update. They reflect how technology work is evolving and how priorities in the AI field are shifting. The message for professionals is clear: keep learning, stay adaptable, and connect your work to real outcomes. As the industry changes, those who continue to grow with it will find the most opportunities.",Meta announced that around 600 employees from its artificial intelligence division would be leaving.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

CHANDIGARH: Justice Surya Kant, the most senior Supreme Court judge, is poised to assume the office of Chief Justice of India (CJI) next month. Few are aware of the extraordinary journey that brought him to the nation's highest judicial position.Unlike many who come from families with strong legal background, Justice Kant's journey began in Petwar - a nondescript village in Haryana's Hisar. He grew up far from privileges often associated with corridors of power. The first time he saw a city was when he travelled to Hansi, a small town in Hisar, for his Class X board exam.Until Class VIII, he studied in a village school that had no benches. As a student, he shared everyday responsibilities of rural life - working in fields during his spare time to support his family like any other rural boy. His father was a teacher.On formal confirmation, he will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24, and slated to serve until Feb 9, 2027.Those who have worked closely with him describe Justice Kant as a jurist of deep learning and measured wisdom, admired for his balanced judgments and unwavering commitment to justice. Having served for over 14 years in Punjab and Haryana HC before his elevation as Himachal Pradesh HC Chief Justice and later as SC judge, he has consistently demonstrated a keen sensitivity toward matters concerning protection of public resources, land acquisition and compensation, victims' rights, reservation policies, and broader balance of constitutional principles.Sometime ago, while visiting his alma mater, Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Justice Kant spoke about his early life and modest beginnings. Electricity was a rarity in Petwar, he recalled and fondly remembered studying at night with friends, huddled under dim lamps, driven by hope of securing a govt job - a goal, he said, inspired him to persevere through every hardship.Born on Feb 10, 1962, Justice Kant completed his early education from Petwar and LLB in 1984 from MDU. He started as a lawyer at Hisar district court before moving to Chandigarh to practice at Punjab and Haryana HC.Justice Kant became the youngest advocate general of Haryana at 38. In 2004, aged 42, he was elevated as a judge of Punjab and Haryana HC. Even then, he continued his academic pursuits, securing first-class-first in his master's degree in law in 2011 from Kurukshetra University's directorate of distance education.After serving as HC judge for over 14 years, he was elevated as Himachal Pradesh HC CJ on Oct 5, 2018. On May 24, 2019, he became SC judge.In his 14-year stint as HC judge in Chandigarh, Justice Kant passed several landmark judgments, including right of jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination for progeny.He also passed an order in a case where a husband had killed his wife. While punishing the guilty, he noticed the accused had four daughters. He personally spoke with a college principal, requesting free education for the eldest daughter.In Punjab and Haryana HC, he was part of the full bench that ordered sanitisation of Dera Sacha Sauda in 2017 following violence after imprisonment of the Dera chief in rape cases and directed a central probe into financial irregularities inside it. He served as a member of governing body of National Legal Services Authority from 2007 to 2011. In SC, he was part of benches that passed several landmark judgments.As CJ of Himachal Pradesh HC, he focused on administrative reforms and improving judicial efficiency. He reaffirmed access to basic amenities constituted an integral part of the fundamental right to life enshrined in the Constitution.",Justice Surya Kant is the most senior Supreme Court judge. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24. He will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI.

Visakhapatnam/Bhubaneswar/Chennai: Andhra Pradesh Odisha and Tamil Nadu are on alert in view of the gathering cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal, which is approaching India's eastern coast packing winds at an estimated speed of 90-100 kmph and is expected to lash the coastal regions with extremely heavy rainfall starting next week.According to India Meteorological Department ( IMD ), coastal areas and parts of Rayalaseema region in Andhra will have to brace for heavy to extremely heavy rainfall from Oct 27, since the cyclonic storm ""Montha"" (named by Thailand) is likely to cross the state's coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam around Kakinada on Oct 28. The disaster management teams in the state have been placed on high alert.On Saturday, the depression over southeast Bay of Bengal moved nearly westwards and lay centred over the same region about 460 km west-southwest of Port Blair (Andaman and Nicobar Islands), 950 km east-southeast of Chennai (Tamil Nadu), 960 km southeast of Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), 970 km southeast of Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh) and 1030 km south-southeast of Gopalpur (Odisha).S Karunasagar, a scientist at IMD-Amaravati, said squally weather with wind speed of 45 to 55 kmph gusting to 65 kmph is likely to prevail along and off the Andhra coast and Yanam on Oct 26.From Oct 27 till Oct 29, parts of Andra will receive heavy to extremely heavy rains.In Odisha, the storm is likely to bring sustained winds blowing at 90 to 100 kmph, gusting up to 110 kmph, and trigger heavy rainfall across southern coastal districts.Cyclone shelters have been prepared for possible evacuations and leaves of govt employees cancelled in several vulnerable districts, including Koraput, Ganjam, and Balasore.Revenue and disaster management minister Suresh Pujari held a video conference with collectors of 15 districts likely to be affected, reviewing readiness and response plans.

India to hold major tri-service exercise on western frontier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-hold-major-tri-service-exercise-on-western-frontier/articleshow/124820830.cms,"Operation Trishul

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Stresses Tri-Services Integration After Operation Sindoor’s Success

NEW DELHI: India is now conducting a major tri-Service combat exercise called “Trishul” on the western front with Pakistan, with a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued for all aircraft to avoid a vast swathe of airspace along the border in Rajasthan and Gujarat from Oct 30 to Nov 10.Pakistan, too, has issued a notification restricting multiple air traffic routes along its central and southern airspace, though somewhat away from the border, possibly for an exercise or weapons test on Oct 28-29.This muscle-flexing is reminiscent of the multiple NOTAMs issued by both countries in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor during which India conducted deep precision strikes against nine terror hubs as well as 11 airbases and radar sites from May 7 to 10.A senior military officer told TOI that the ongoing wargames are “routine”, in accordance with the practice to conduct a major tri-Service exercise at least once a year. The sheer scale, complexity and area of operations, however, is quite huge. “Multiple joint combat drills, both offensive and defensive in nature, will be executed during Trishul,” an officer said.Moreover, the exercise comes soon after defence minister Rajnath Singh warned Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, the 96-km-long tidal estuary between the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat and the Sindh province of Pakistan, which is a major bilateral dispute.“If Pakistan dares to act in the Sir Creek Sector, the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography,” he had said.Under the overall Trishul exercise, the armed forces will conduct joint operations across diverse and challenging terrains, including offensive manoeuvres in the creek and desert sectors, amphibious operations off the Saurashtra coast, and joint multi-domain operational drills.The Army has deployed well over 20,000 soldiers with main-battle tanks, howitzers, armed helicopters and different kinds of missile systems. Drills like `Trinetra’ with a focus on “full-cycle electromagnetic spectrum operations and counter-unmanned aerial system kill-chains” are already being conducted by the 21 `Sudarshan Chakra’ strike corps in the desert sector.The IAF, in turn, will soon swing into action with `Mahagujraj” high-tempo operations, with frontline fighters like Rafales and Sukhoi-30MKIs, special aircraft, helicopters, remotely-piloted aircraft and force-enablers like IL-78 mid-air refuellers and airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft being deployed from several air bases.The Navy, too, has deployed some frigates and destroyers off the Gujarat coast for the intensive combat manoeuvres. “Remember, the Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat will be a target for Pakistan in any full-scale war,” said the officer.“Different indigenous weapon systems and innovations will be fully tested during the Trishul exercise. In the non-kinetic domains, ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), EW (electronic warfare and cyber capabilities will also be a focus area,” the officer said.","India is conducting a major tri-Service combat exercise called ‘Trishul’ on the western front with Pakistan.

SRINAGAR: Political tempers are running high in Kashmir Valley after BJP won one of the four Rajya Sabha seats in J&K with support from four legislators outside the party on Friday. The National Conference (NC) leadership exonerated its legislators and allies of cross-voting charges, although party president Farooq Abdullah created a flutter by revealing that BJP had approached them before the polls.Chief minister Omar Abdullah said NC could not manage a clean sweep as it was betrayed, but he refused to disclose the names of those who cross-voted.“One shouldn’t have any complaints with a 3-1 score. We tried for a 4-nil victory, but we were ditched at the last moment by some people,” Omar said on Saturday.“Everyone knows the names of those who betrayed us and voted for BJP, I don’t want to repeat them. But, their act is regrettable,” Omar said, adding it was not appropriate to reveal the names.Giving a clean chit to his party members, the CM said, “I am satisfied that not a single NC vote went elsewhere. All NC legislators showed their polling slips to their party agent.”Omar thanked Congress and “some other colleagues” for their support, but did not name Membooba Mufti-led PDP, thus keep it in the circle of doubt. He also accused People’s Conference (PC) neta Sajad Lone of helping BJP by abstaining from voting, and “now lecturing us like a professor”.The retort came after Lone alleged that “all the cross-voting was done by NC”. “Omar Abdullah is the biggest supporter of BJP, bigger than their own leaders. The Rajya Sabha polls were a fixed match between BJP and NC. It was pre-decided that NC would take three seats and BJP one,” the PC chief told reporters.BJP on Friday sprang a surprise in J&K’s first RS elections since the abrogation of Article 370, winning a seat with 32 votes --- four more than its strength of 28 in the assembly.Farooq added more spice to the political debate, claiming that BJP had approached NC before the polls. Addressing a presser alongside the elected NC candidates, he said: “People will say whatever they have to say, but we didn’t gift any seat to BJP. They came to us ahead of the polls asking us for one seat. We refused and decided to fight it out.”Referring to Farooq’s statement, Lone said it was an admission that BJP and NC remained in touch. “That means a dialogue mechanism exists between the two parties. That means they had discussions about Rajya Sabha (polls)... Isn’t that what we have been saying all along --- fixed match,” he said.Jailed AAP legislator Mehraj Malik issued a statement saying he voted for NC in “the larger interests of J&K” despite no one from the party approaching him, but was “now being questioned by some of their leaders”.

Bihar polls: Sunset before sunrise for Jan Suraaj? 3 key challenges before the 'challenger',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-sunset-before-sunrise-for-jan-suraaj-3-key-challenges-before-the-challenger/articleshow/124804960.cms,"Jan Suraaj Party's Prashant Kishor Drops Bombshell, Reveals Why He Will Not Contest Bihar Elections

Challenges ahead of the challenger





Candidates’ desertion

Anger among party workers

Whose “B team” is Jan Suraaj anyway?

NEW DELHI: Bihar has long been a laboratory for political parties to test their ""prayogs"" to clinch power. The latest addition to such experiments is poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj, which has emerged as a third option for voters in the upcoming assembly elections and challenged the socialist forces — Janata Dal (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal — by fielding candidates on all 243 seats.Prashant has been camping in Bihar for three years. He formed his party on October 2, 2024, vowing to contest the elections on the plank of development. However, as the elections inch closer, several challenges seem to surround PK and his party, making the climb to Ek Anne Marg even steeper.Jan Suraaj has been defeated on at least three seats as candidates walked out even before a single vote has been cast — Dr Shashi Shekhar Sinha from Gopalganj, Dr Satya Prakash Tiwari from Brahmpur (Buxar), and Akhilesh Kumar alias Mutor Sao from the Danapur seat in Patna.Additionally, Jan Suraaj leaders, including state spokesperson Amit Kumar Paswan, former district councillor Anita Kumari, and founding member Karmveer Paswan, have also recently joined the BJP ahead of the elections.However, Prashant Kishor accused the Bharatiya Janata Party and Union minister Amit Shah of “coercing and intimidating” his party’s candidates out of fear of losing the elections.“Look at this picture: you can see home minister Amit Shah and Dharmendra Pradhan.You talk about the model code of conduct... the home minister kept a candidate with him for one full day so that he could not file his nomination,” Kishor alleged.Meanwhile, party workers are also upset with Jan Suraaj's choice of candidates across the state. Workers have accused the party and Prashant Kishor of deceiving them by dropping “parachute candidates” after they had done all the groundwork for the elections.Speaking to The Times of India, Jan Suraaj leader Ravi Nandan Sahay said that probable candidates had deposited Rs 21,000 each to contest elections on the Jan Suraaj symbol from Kumhrar. However, the party chose former Patna University vice-chancellor KC Sinha from the constituency, who had not even formally joined the party.“The party workers are feeling cheated. The party had promised that tickets would only be given to a person among the probable candidates. However, I was shocked by the party’s decision to field KC Sinha from Kumhrar, who had not formally joined the party till then. Each probable candidate was also mandated to hold sabhas and distribute Parivaar Labhaarthi cards. All our efforts went in vain,” Sahay said.“Now, almost every probable candidate has left the party and decided to contest the poll independently. This will cause a significant dent in Jan Suraaj during the campaign,” he added.In the run-up to the assembly elections, both the Mahagathbandhan and NDA have accused Jan Suraaj of being the “B team” of each other. The perception has also seeped among voters who remain unsure about PK’s political allegiance.“Kishor realised that he would not win elections, and that is why he announced that he would not contest polls. Whatever he had invested in forming the Jan Suraaj Party has already been recovered. His party is nothing but a *vote katwa* (a party that cuts into others’ votes),” Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh alleged after Prashant Kishor decided not to contest from Raghopur against RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.“Jan Suraaj is the ‘B team’ of the RJD,” Giriraj Singh added.Meanwhile, the RJD has maintained its accusation that Jan Suraaj is the “B team” of the Nitish Kumar-led ruling alliance in Bihar.Now, it remains to be seen how Prashant Kishor persuades voters that his party is a viable alternative and not merely a vote katwa or spoiler in the upcoming elections.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases — on November 6 and November 11 — with the counting of votes scheduled for November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, compared to 7.89 crore in the first draft list released before the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) on June 24 this year. According to an Election Commission release, around 65 lakh voters were removed during the revision process, bringing the number of electors in the updated draft list, as of August 1, 2025, to 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly elections, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and secured 0.9% of the vote share.","Prashant Kishor has been camping in Bihar for three years.

NEW DELHI: Back in 2020, when the police and paramilitary forces heavily depended on foreign dog breeds like German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Belgian Malinois etc for their dog squads, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought to challenge status quo, suggesting the equally agile and more resilient ‘desi’ dog breeds as an ‘atmanirbhar’ alternative.Five years later, the PM will witness the success of his proposed experiment, in person. A contingent made up exclusively of Indian breed dogs like ‘Mudhol Hound’ and ‘Rampur Hound’ — trained by the BSF and now serving as force-multipliers on the eastern and border border, in anti-Naxal operations and narcotics detection — will proudly march in his presence during the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade on October 31, at Ekta Nagar in Narmada district of Gujarat.Ekta Nagar is home to Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s towering statue, the tallest in the world at 182 metres.This year being the 150th birth centenary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas celebrations will include a grand parade by the Central armed police forces (CAPFs), including their dog squads, cavalry and camel contingents, and the state police forces. Prime Minister Modi, the guest of honour, will receive the ceremonial salute from the five CRPF Shaurya Chakra awardees as well as the 16 BSF personnel recently honoured with gallantry medals for their valour in Operation Sindoor.Also thrown in are a cultural show featuring grand performances by NCC cadets and school bands; an air show; motorcycle stunts; and tableaux of different states celebrating ‘Unity in Diversity’, BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary shared at a press conference here on Friday.The Guard of Honor to be presented to the PM will be led by a female officer. Women personnel of CISF and CRPF will demonstrate their martial arts and unarmed combat skills.The ‘desi’ breed dogs contingent will be led by female BSF Mudhol Hound ‘Riya’ — conferred the ‘Best Dog’ title at the 2024 All Indian Police Duty meet in Lucknow, after beating 116 foreign breed competitors. Indigenous breeds Rampur Hound and Mudhol Hound will also demonstrate their versatile skills like climbing 18 ft wall and intercepting terrorists or intruders.BSF commandant (veterinary medicine) Sandeep Gupta shared that the force had taken a cue from PM’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme and started researching ‘desi’ breeds; they were found better adapted to Indian weather, besides being resilient and agile. “We limited ourselves to studying the parent generation of breeds like Mudhol Hound and Rampur Hound. A breeding programme was started and the second generation was introduced to human socialisation and foundational training. ..it was only with the third generation that we started methodical training,” he said.Chawdhary on Friday said the force has trained 150 Indian breed dogs so far and deployed them “from Thar to Tawang”.","Border Security Force's nearly 40 India-bred dogs- Rampur Hounds and Mudhol Hounds- will participate in the National Unity Day Parade on October 31.

Mary Millben Lauds PM Modi’s Leadership, Says Rahul Gandhi ‘Not the Right Person to Lead India’

NEW DELHI: As Congress MP Rahul Gandhi slammed the rush in trains to Bihar, the railways reiterated it was running 12,000 special trains for Diwali, Chhath and Bhai Dooj to ease travel during the festive season.Rahul Saturday claimed on X that trains to Bihar are ""packed, tickets are impossible to get, and the journey has become inhuman"" during the festival season. ""Where are the 12,000 special trains?,"" he asked the Centre, as he also shared a video showing overcrowded trains at railway stations on one hand and PM Minister Narendra Modi flagging off trains on the other on a split screen.In response, railways asserted, ""Crowds are natural during festivals, but Indian Railways is striving for the convenience of passengers."" Listing its efforts for passenger safety and comfort, railways mentioned holding areas at 30 stations in Bihar for return journeys after Chhath Puja, war rooms and mini control rooms in every zone, and war room at the board level.The Congress neta alleged in his post, ""These are not just helpless passengers, they are living proof of the deceitful policies and intentions of the NDA.""Railways in its rebuttal said over 1.5 crore passengers have travelled on special trains; holding areas have been created at major stations, additional ticket counters have been set up, and there is 24x7 deployment for cleanliness, security and ensuring smooth travel.""It is a month of festivals - Diwali, Bhai Dooj, Chhath. In Bihar, these festivals do not just mean faith, they also mean a longing to return home - the smell of soil, the affection of family, the feeling of belonging in the village.

PATNA: Union home minister and top BJP campaigner Amit Shah Saturday urged voters in Khagaria to ensure that Bihar remains free from lawlessness and emerges a developed state.""I pray to Chhathi Maiya that our Bihar always remain free from jungle raj, that law and order stay strong, our sisters and daughters remain safe, and Bihar becomes a developed state in the years ahead,"" he said. Chhath, which begins today, is a revered festival in Bihar and eastern UP.Shah, who also addressed rallies in Munger and Nalanda, said, ""This electoral fight is not to make someone an MLA, a minister, or CM. This election will decide whether to bring back jungle raj or usher in an era of development. Tell me - do you want kidnapping, extortion, murder, ransom, abduction, jungle raj?""Shah said if NDA returns to power, the next Bihar assembly elections will be held in a single phase.

Even if 100 Bakhtiyar Khiljis come, no one can touch Nalanda University.PM Modi has pledged to ensure both development and heritage. A new era of AI and data science is about to begin in Bihar.

This is like 'the cat going to Hajj after eating hundreds of rats'. In the last 20 years, murder cases have declined by 20% compared to 2005, robbery and ransom cases have fallen by 80%, and not a single heinous massacre has taken place under the Nitish govt.

Lawyers representing the creditors allegedly pressured NCLT Ahmedabad-1 to move the matter. On Jan 9, 2024, that bench recused itself.

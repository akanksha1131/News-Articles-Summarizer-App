"DGCA allows HIV+ commercial pilot to fly, but with riders.

He now plans to file a fresh petition challenging the rider on his licence only because of his HIV status.""If the petitioner has any grievance of the subsequent developments and the fresh certification... it is for the petitioner to challenge the same as may be permitted in law,"" said Justices Girish Kulkarni and Advait Sethna.The pilot filed the petition last year through his father. In July 2021, a medical test deemed him fit to serve as a pilot in command. He had cleared DGCA exams to become a civil commercial pilot. In Oct 2021, he was informed of the HIV diagnosis and issued a 'temporary unfit for flying' medical certificate. In Dec 2021, DGCA informed him he was 'permanently unfit for flying' as a pilot in command. On appeal, in May 2022, DGCA deemed him 'fit for flying as (co-pilot) only.' Thereafter, he left for the US.DGCA's Dec 18 reply said the petitioner is on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), including medicines which have several adverse effects. It cited the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Manual of Civil Aviation Medicine on the risk of progression of the disease after commencing ART. ""Considering repercussions of disease progress, unpredictable side effects of ART, and frequent monitoring constraints, an aeromedical disposition is made declaring him fit to fly as pilot in command with qualified experienced pilot,"" it stated.DGCA's advocate Piyush Shah said the petitioner applied for medical certificate and ""in respect of that we have allowed him as pilot in command"" rostered along with a more experienced pilot. The pilot's advocates, Bhoomika Vyas and Sangram Chinappa, said if he required a pilot with more flying hours to be alongside, no one would hire him. ""This would render him unemployable,"" said Vyas, adding, ""similarly placed persons, who do not have HIV"" face no such rider on their licence.To the judges' query, Vyas said her client has now returned from the US. The judges said the petitioner's grievance that the DGCA was not considering him because of his status as an HIV+ person ""in our opinion, would stand redressed.""

'Contract largesse' to kin of Arunachal CM under SC lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/contract-largesse-to-kin-of-arunachal-cm-under-sc-lens/articleshow/119186183.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to conduct an in-depth inquiry into allegations of Arunachal govt's contract largesse to firms owned by chief minister Pema Khandu's relatives and asked the state to provide details of such contracts for the last five years.Appearing for petitioner NGO ' Save Mon Region Federation ', advocate Prashant Bhushan said numerous contracts worth hundreds of crores of rupees have been awarded to the firms owned by CM's relatives in complete violation of norms of the Union government and that comptroller and auditor general had not carried out a proper auditing of the award of contracts in alleged breach of the rules and regulations.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan asked the state government to file an affidavit in five weeks giving details of the contracts awarded to the firms owned by the CM's relatives as alleged in the petition.It also asked the Union ministries of home affairs and finance to file detailed affidavits regarding the norms governing the award of contracts to relatives of MPs, MLAs and ministers. It also asked the CAG to give a detailed report on these contracts, which was ordered to be audited by the SC in its Mar 20, 2024, order.The SC on Mar 20 last year had disposed of a 2010 petition filed by another NGO 'Voluntary Arunachal Sena', which was represented by Bhushan, seeking CBI probe into allegations of corruption against Khandu's relatives.

Open to ‘fair debate’ on Lokpal jurisdiction over HC judges: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/open-to-fair-debate-on-lokpal-jurisdiction-over-hc-judges-supreme-court/articleshow/119186054.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday created space for a “fair debate” on the contentious issue of anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal assuming jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of taint against high court judges even though the apex court had formed a prima facie view that this would be “dangerous” for independence of constitutional courts.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta protested strongly against Lokpal assuming jurisdiction over high court judges and told a bench of Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant and A S Oka that the Jan 27 order of the full bench led by Lokpal A M Khanwilkar, attempting to assume inquiry jurisdiction over HC judges, went against the procedure established through SC judgments for dealing with complaints against con stitutional court judges.The bench agreed and said the field was already occupied and a mechanism was in place to deal with complaints against SC and HC judges. Mehta said the Supreme Court should examine only Section 14(1)(f) of Lokpal Act, which formed the basis for Lokpal’s Jan 27 order.Supreme Court Bar Association president and senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the SC, in its 1991 judgment in the Veeraswami case, had made it mandatory to obtain the CJI’s consent before initiation of proceedings against a constitutional court judge. “The law must be clarified to ensure that complaints of this nature (corruption and misuse of office) are forwarded only to the CJI and not to any other authority,” he said.Lokpal’s order had come on a complaint filed by a person accusing an HC judge of influencing an additional district judge and another HC judge who were hearing suits filed by the complainant against a private company.However, Sibal said there was a wider issue involved. “What happens if a person goes to a police station and wants to file an FIR (for a criminal act allegedly committed by an HC judge)? The fundamental issue is whether a complaint can be filed against SC and HC judges outside the mechanism provided under the Constitution and the additions made through SC rulings. The court may have to examine this issue in this case,” he said.The SG said whether a person could go to a police station to lodge an FIR did not fall within the ambit and scope of the issue arising from Lokpal’s Jan 27 order. The procedure for lodging a complaint against a constitutional court judge was provided in the Veeraswami judgment, he said.The bench agreed and said it would examine the issues relating to Lokpal’s jurisdiction to entertain complaints against HC judges. Justice Kant said the proceedings should not appear one-sided and added that there should be an amicus to present the contrary view for a fair debate on the issue. In its order, Lokpal had clarified that it did not have jurisdiction over SC judges. The bench appointed senior advocate Ranjit Kumar as amicus and posted hearing on the matter to April 15.","Supreme Court created space for a ‘fair debate’ on the contentious issue of anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal assuming jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of taint against high court judges.

CBI must investigate builder-bank nexus: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-must-investigate-builder-bank-nexus-supreme-court/articleshow/119185877.cms,"Submit builder-bank nexus probe blueprint in 2 weeks: SC to CBI





NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to real estate firms and banks making “homebuyers cry” by not completing projects on time and forcing them to pay EMIs, SC on Tuesday said a CBI probe was needed to unearth the nexus between them and sought a proposal from the agency on how it intends to conduct the investigation, which could bring many realtors under the scanner.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the builderbank nexus had created havoc, leaving lakhs of homebuyers suffering and it was ultimately Supreme Court which was coming to their rescue. It said SC was dealing with multiple cases of homebuyers of different projects on a daily basis, and it was not the court’s job.“We will definitely have a CBI probe. That is clear. Thousands of people are crying. We can’t wipe their tears but we can address their issues. Something very effective has to be done in a time-bound manner,” the bench said. It asked CBI to come up with a proposal in two weeks on how to conduct the probe — whether project-wise or area-wise.Considering that the proposed probe against builders and banks would be a huge exercise, bringing virtually the entire real estate sector under the lens, the bench sought the assistance of former Intelligence Bureau chief Rajiv Jain. Court appointed the 1980-batch IPS officer, who is now practising law, as amicus curiae and asked him to file a note on how to proceed in the case.The court was hearing petitions filed by thousands of homebuyers who had booked flats under subvention plans in various housing projects in NCR and alleged that they were being forced by banks to pay EMIs despite not getting possession of their flats because of inordinate delay by developers. Under the subvention scheme, banks disburse the sanctioned amount directly to the accounts of builders, who pay EMIs on the amount till flats are handed over to homebuyers. As builders started defaulting in paying EMIs as per the tripartite agreement, banks initiated action against homebuyers to recover the payments.Realising the fallout of a CBI probe, some financial institutions urged the court not to bring the agency into the picture as it would create instability and requested that RBI be asked to look into the matter. Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Ranjit Kumar, appearing for financial institutions, urged the court not to paint all banks with the same brush and said their clients had already placed all information before the bench as sought by it.Singhvi said if a particular builder became insolvent, then the fault did not lie with banks. But the bench questioned how a bank could release money to a builder despite knowing that not a brick was laid at the site.The court made it clear that “no one will be spared” but those who acted fairly should not be afraid of the impending investigation.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appear ing for CBI, said at the outset that the agency would take the case if the court directed and suggested that the probe could start with investigation into any project in Greater Noida. The court, however, asked the agency to come back with a detailed proposal.SC decided to take stern action after very few builders and banks complied with its order to give details of their projects and loans sanctioned. Out of roughly 40 builders and 30 banks/financial institutions which are party in the proceedings, only nine banks and five builders filed their compliance affidavits. “This blatant disregard and ignorance of the court’s directions, coupled with their reluctance in appropriately assisting the court, hints to wards a possible collusion between builders-cum-developers and banks/financial institutions,” the bench said.The bench had directed the petitioners, builders and banks to furnish the following information regarding different projects — (i) The status and details of payments made by builders to banks or payments by homebuyers to banks/ builders, (ii) The date of offering possession where the project is stated to have been completed, (iii) The current status of completion of the project, (iv) The status of recovery from homebuyers, (v) The amenities advertised by builders at the time of launching projects and the status regarding completion thereof, (vi) The status as to whether the builder-cum-developers had undergone CIRP (under IBC) or any other coercive or non-coercive recovery procedure, and the stage of such proceedings, (vii) Whether homebuyers received any relief from statutory authorities like RERA. If so, the details of such orders were to be furnished.SC had in July last year protected homebuyers and directed that no coercive action be taken against them by banks or builders regarding payment of EMIs and no complaint shall be entertained against them for cheque bounce cases.The aggrieved homebuyers said they were victims of illegal disbursal of loans by banks directly into the account of builders in violation of RBI guidelines, which are statutory in nature.“This is a classic case where one rich man (bank/financial institution) gave money to another rich man (builder). The rich man who received the money (builder) ran away with it without fulfilling his obligations. The rich man who gave the money (bank/financial institution) disbursed it in violation of the law of the land. The poor man (homebuyer) is now made a victim and is pushed into litigation by the bank when he has not received a single rupee. And is deprived of his dream home,” one of the petitions said.","Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the builderbank nexus had created havoc, leaving lakhs of homebuyers suffering. It asked CBI to come up with a proposal in two weeks on how to conduct the probe — whether project-wise or area-wise.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119185867,imgsize-1015725,width-400,resizemode-4/119185867.jpg"
"ED searches Bengaluru offices of Soros’s foundation, and entities linked to it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-searches-bengaluru-offices-of-soross-foundation-and-entities-linked-to-it/articleshow/119185811.cms,"ED action coincides with heat Soros is facing back home

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday conducted extensive searches on Open Society Foundations (OSF), promoted by US billionaire currency speculator and hedge fund operator George Soros who has been accused by BJP of acting against India’s interests.The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.Sources said Open Society Institute, US, has been put under prior reference category (PRC) by the home mini stry since 2016 due to allegedly undesirable activities. So, OSI is required to secure prior sanction from the ministry to send funds to FCRA-registered organisations in India.Sources said investigation found Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF), OSI’s social impact investment arm, provided funds to 3 Indian companies — Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd (RSPL), Rootbridge Academy Pvt Ltd (RAPL), and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt Ltd (ASAR). These companies received approximately Rs 25 crore from SEDF between 2020-21 and 2023-24.SEDF funds to RSPL were through compulsorily convertible preference shares. However, since SEDF could not make foreign donations directly to Indian NGOs without MHA approval, the George Soros-funded entity explored alternative options to bypass PRC restrictions. FDI in RSPL is suspected to be a colourable arrangement violating FDI norms, officials said.“RAPL, incorporated in 2019, received Rs 2.7 crore from SEDF as commission agent services without rendering any services. This suggests RAPL acted as an agent for SEDF to bypass FCRA provisions for funding NGOs in India,” a source said.ASAR, incorporated in 2016, received Rs 2.9 crore from SEDF as ‘service fees’. The investigators, however, are not convinced and suspect the funds to be donations in disguise, meant for NGOs in lieu of services which were, in fact, never rendered to SEDF.OSI group also set up an investment company, Aspada Investment Company (AIC), in Mauritius to channelise funding to India.Aspada Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd was established in Bengaluru to manage SEDF’s investments in India. However, the body, now Lightrock Investment Advisors Private Limited, was not in the loop about Rs 300 crore SEDF provided to 12 NGOs.ED action coincides with the heat Soros has been facing back home in the US after the election of Donald Trump as President. The hedge fund operator had aligned with hardline liberals and openly opposed Trump.","The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.

But in the evening, there was a pre-planned attack in which select homes and establishments were targeted. A trolley of stones was found. Weapons were also recovered.""The CM said 33 cops including three deputy commissioners of police, one of whom was assaulted with an axe, were injured in the violence. ""We will take strong action against those involved. Attacks on police will not be tolerated.""Fadnavis said around 11.30am Monday, VHP and Bajrang Dal held a protest in Mahal area demanding removal of Aurangzeb's tomb. They burnt a grass replica of the tomb. However, a rumour spread in the evening that the replica which was burnt had a cloth cover with a religious text on it. This led to a mob of around 200-250 people gathering after namaz at Attar Road. They raised slogans and police had to use force to control them.While another 200-300 people, with their faces covered and carrying sticks, gathered in Hansapuri area and started throwing stones, the third incident occurred at Baldapura at 7.30pm, the CM said. A group of 80-100 people gathered and attacked cops. He spoke about the film 'Chhaava', which portrays the conflict between Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj & Aurangzeb. ""I'm not blaming any film, but it has fanned sentiments among people and their anger against Aurangzeb is coming out. I appeal to all to maintain calm and respect religious spaces.""While making a statement in the council on the violence, Shinde trained his guns on Sena UBT, saying: ""There was a plan (during MVA regime) to arrest BJP's Girish Mahajan, Ashish Shelar, Pravin Darekar and Fadnavis. I overturned the gameplan and brought Mahayuti to power. You became helpless in your lust for power. You decorated the grave of Yakub Memon (convicted in the Mumbai bomb blasts case) and during Lok Sabha elections showed the Pakistani flag.""Taunting Sena UBT for losing assembly elections and even failing to secure leader of opposition's post in the assembly, Shinde said: ""They gave up Hindutva, and now they are 'na ghar ka, na ghat ka'. Five times I told him (Uddhav), 'Let's form an alliance with BJP.' Why did you go with Congress?""Shinde criticised Maharashtra PCC chief Harshwardhan Sakpal for likening Fadnavis to Aurangzeb and demanded an apology.",Devendra Fadnavis says violence was pre-planned.

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication.

Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

GHAZIABAD: A day before Holi, a family reported a seven-year-old girl's death to police, and her neighbour was arrested.The allegation was that the girl had eaten ‘kadhi' made by the neighbour, which made her so sick that she never recovered. Shanti Devi, who lives in the Loni border area, was taken into custody and charged under Section 105 of BNS (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).Police sent the seven-year-old's body for an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Was it food poisoning?The report has thrown up answers far more terrible. According to the autopsy, the seven-year-old was sexually assaulted and died of strangulation. With the investigation turning on its head, the complaint itself became the centre of the probe.Yes, Shanti Devi had indeed cooked and sent over ‘kadhi', but all other claims – of the seven-year-old and six of her family members getting diarrhoea after eating it, and the girl dying during treatment at GTB Hospital in Delhi – were found to be fake.On Monday, the seven-year-old's father was arrested as the prime suspect of the rape and murder. The 52-year-old, who has five children, had put together a coverup plan using the other children to build an alibi. Police said he got himself and the other children checked at the OPD of GTB, claiming a tummy infection. They were evaluated and sent home.Ajay Kumar Singh, ACP of Ankur Vihar, told TOI, ""The accused had submitted an application that he didn't want a postmortem of the girl at GTB Hospital, and we have evidence for the same. To frame his neighbour, he filed a complaint at Loni border police station and an FIR was registered against Shanti Devi. She was remanded in judicial custody.""Police will now file an application in court to release Shanti Devi. ""On March 14, postmortem report revealed the child was raped and murdered. That same evening, her last rites were performed by the father. After that, he didn't return home. We arrested him near SRB school on Monday,"" the ACP said.While questioning, the accused, police said, admitted to what he had done. ""He said he was drunk. Around 3am on March 13, his five children and wife were sleeping in one room. He lifted his seven-year-old daughter from the bed and went into another room. He raped her. When she started crying, he strangled her. In the morning, around 7-8 am, he called a friend and told him that his daughter had fallen ill after eating kadhi. They took the minor on a motorcycle to a local clinic. The doctor at the clinic told the family to take her to a hospital. They took her to GTB, where doctors declared her brought dead,"" said Singh.Police said the accused called his other children to the hospital after this and told them to feign sickness. ""They were told to tell the doctors they had a stomach ache,"" said the ACP.Shyam Sunder, who runs the clinic the girl was taken to, told TOI he didn't find a pulse when he checked her. ""The child's father told me he had stomach pain since morning. When I didn't find a pulse, I told him to take her to a hospital immediately, but he insisted that I treat her. He wasted more than five minutes and left my clinic only when I shouted at him to go to a hospital.""An FIR has been filed against the 52-year-old man, a property dealer, at Loni border police station under sections 103 (1) (murder), 65 (2) (rape of a woman under 12 years old) and relevant sections of the Pocso Act. Police will submit a report in court so that Shanti Devi gets released from jail,"" Singh said.Shanti Devi had given kadhi to some other families in the locality as well, but none of them complained of any sickness.","A family reported a seven-year-old girl's death to police, and her neighbour was arrested. The allegation was that the girl had eaten ‘kadhi' made by the neighbour, which made her so sick that she never recovered. Shanti Devi, who lives in the Loni border area, was taken into custody and charged under Section 105 of BNS (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) The girl's body was sent for an autopsy to determine the cause of death. The report has thrown up answers far more terrible.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119139356,imgsize-643041,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/119139356.jpg"

He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence. Time and again, they decided to be at odds with India. They have waged a proxy war against us,"" PM Modi said in the podcast.He accused Pakistan of exporting terror, saying that India is not its only victim — terrorist activities linked to Pakistan have impacted the entire world.""Wherever terror strikes in the world, the trail somehow leads to Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face."" Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi, Tharoor admitted that India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a Prime Minister ""who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow"".Tharoor, who had previously called for India to condemn Russia’s aggression, said during a session, ""I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one of the few in Parliament who criticised India’s position in February 2022.""The Thiruvananthapuram MP explained that his criticism was based on the violation of the UN Charter and Ukraine’s sovereignty. However, three years later, he now recognises that India’s balanced approach has allowed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky within weeks of each other.""All of those principles had been violated by one party and we should have condemned it. Well, three years later it does look like I am the one with the egg on my face because clearly the policy has meant that India has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine (Zelenskyy) and the president in Moscow (Putin) two weeks apart and be accepted in both places,"" he said according to news agency PTI.With the caveat that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the government as he is in the opposition, Tharoor suggested that India might be open to sending peacekeepers if there was an agreed peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine.He noted that Russia has ruled out NATO peacekeepers, making non-European forces more viable. ""As an Indian parliamentarian, I don’t think there would be strong resistance to the idea,"" he said, citing India's extensive history in peacekeeping missions.Tharoor recalled how, in 2003, India’s Parliament firmly rejected sending troops to Iraq after the US-led invasion. However, he stated, “I don’t see that happening for Ukraine.”India has participated in over 49 UN peacekeeping missions, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to global stability.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face"" The Thiruvananthapuram MP said India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace.

If all Hindus unite, the TMC will bite the dust ... ""West Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari has once again raised the pitch against Mamata Banerjee 's Trinamool government as the state gears up for the Ram Navami festival on April 6. Suvendu, who had last week announced that around one crore Hindus will participate in over 20,000 processions to be held across the state on Ram Navami, on Tuesday said that any attempts to stop the festivities would be resisted strongly.""The situation in the state will be similar to that of Bangladesh if Mamata Banerjee remains in power. The days of her rule are numbered. Hindus will not accept her blatant appeasement of one community and attempts to crush Ram Navami celebrations any more,"" Suvendu said.""On the day of Holi attacks were carried on Dalits by jihadis in Sainthia. But no action was taken against the perpetrators. Internet services were suspended to cover up the violence against the 'Sanatanis'. Discussion on it was not even allowed in the assembly,"" he claimed referring to incidents of violence in the state during Holi.Suvendu also targeted assembly speaker Biman Banerjee after he did not allow discussion in assembly over a BJP adjournment motion on violence in the state during Holi.The speaker did allow BJP chief whip Shankar Ghosh to read out the first few paras of the motion, but then said that certain other references and contents including the word “Hindus” and “Hindutva”, ""were not appropriate"" for discussion on the floor of the House.""We don't need this anti-Hindu regime. We want to know why the administration kept mum and suppressed the actual incident during a festival like Holi.

""If the BJP assumes power, the Muslim MLAs of the Trinamool Congress would be ""thrown out"" of the assembly,"" the leader of the opposition had said evoking strong reactions.Mamata Banerjee had led the attack against Adhikari and said ""Your imported Hindu dharma is not supported by the Vedas or by our seers. How can you deny the rights of Muslims as citizens? This is nothing but a fraud. You are importing fake Hinduism.""""I have the right to protect Hindu dharma, but not your version of it. Please don't play the Hindu card,"" the chief minister had said in the assembly.""We are a secular, pluralistic nation. Everyone has the right to practice their religion. The duty of the majority is to protect the minority. We must protect our country's sovereignty and secularism. I love all religions, and we condemn any political party's attempts to spread hatred against any community,"" Mamata had added.Festivals in Bengal have been a flashpoint between the Trinamool government and the BJP which is now the main opposition party in the state replacing the Left and the Congress.

How flights will move from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai Airport & options for demolishing CSMIA T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-flights-will-move-from-mumbai-to-navi-mumbai-airport-options-for-demolishing-csmia-t1/articleshow/119169626.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from Mumbai’s Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) when the latter gets operational later this summer. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.The Adani Group is also weighing options for the demolition of T1 — whether to bring down the entire structure in one go this winter or do it piecemeal. T1 comprises of T1A, B and C buildings which were built over last 50 years with 1B being constructed in 1965; 1A in 1992 and 1C in 2010.“We are in talks with all airlines. As far as Indian carriers are concerned, the plan is to shift equal percentage of flights by them from CSMIA to NMIA. Foreign airlines with few flights will not like to split operations and will continue to operate from one hub only in Mumbai MMR. Some foreign airlines want to move fully to NMIA,” said people in the know. Air India has about 140 daily flights to and from CSMIA; Akasa 57 and AI Express about 15. IndiGo, the biggest Indian carrier in market share terms, did not give this figure.“We are weighing the option of either starting NMIA operations with domestic flights. In that case, domestic flights will be shifted first. Or we could start both domestic and international simultaneously, in which case both will be shifted,” said sources.The rate of shifting flights will also depend on how fast T2 capacity grows from 4 crore passengers annually (CPA) to 4.5 CPA and whether T1 goes down in one go or in phases — basically the capacity of CSMIA. “The existing T1 handles 1.5 CPA. T1 demolition will start 4-5 months after NMIA gets operational, which means by this Nov or Dec. We hope to increase T2 capacity by mid 2026. These decisions will be taken shortly,” they said.Airlines also want clarity on these issues. The reason: They are selling tickets for flights, some of which will get shifted. “Once we inform passengers that their flight, for say July/Aug, has been moved to NMIA, we don’t know whether it suits them or not. To minimise this, we need clarity at the earliest. We don’t have same issues with whenever Noida Airport opens as we are not selling tickets for there yet,” said a senior airline official.Meanwhile, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) is also in talks with aviation authorities to lift the cap on hourly flight movements. This was done to ease the severe congestion seen perennially at CSMIA. The aviation ministry had two years back directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during ""high intensity runway operations” (HIRO) periods from 8-11 am and 5-8 pm and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during non-HIRO period.“We are confident of handling more flights without affecting time performance, at least from our side as an airport. MIAL has been in talks with authorities to lift that cap. We are in process of increasing CSMIA runway capacity. Gatwick, the world’s busiest single runway airport handles 54-55 flights an hour,” sources added.",Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted to Navi Mumbai International Airport. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.

SRINAGAR: Chief minister Omar Abdullah fretted Tuesday about “discrimination” in distribution of assets after the 2019 bifurcation of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state into Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh .Lawmakers of Omar’s National Conference (NC) members argue that J&K UT has been given far less assets in Delhi, Chandigarh and other regions. But Omar, speaking in the assembly, vowed to take a reconciliatory route to resolve the issue.“Five years ago, J&K and Ladakh got separated. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were separated long ago (2014) but they are still engaged in disputes over assets in courts, spending huge amounts of money,” Omar said while responding to a question.The CM made it clear his govt would not go down the Andhra-Telangana path. “We want to resolve asset issues with Ladakh through consensus and through give and take,” Omar said. He acknowledged such a reconciliatory approach might be criticised in J&K and Ladakh but insisted it was the only way to solve it.After the abrogation of Article 370, assets between J&K and Ladakh were apportioned on the recommendations of an advisory committee constituted by the Centre under J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019.A key sticking point has been liabilities of the erstwhile state amounting to Rs 2,504.46 crore and how it should be shared between UTs of Ladakh and J&K. Omar’s govt has taken up the matter with the Union home ministry and Ladakh administration.About properties of the erstwhile state in Delhi, Omar said J&K got far less than Ladakh. “We are working on settling the issue. We have acquired land in Dwarka, where we plan to construct a new J&K Bhawan,” he said.According to the CM, J&K House on Delhi’s Prithviraj Road has vacant land and a new building will be constructed there for visiting MLAs. In Chandigarh, Omar pointed out that the govt already owns a building that will be modified to provide proper accommodation for J&K patients travelling to the city’s PGIMER.","Omar Abdullah fretted about ‘discrimination’ in distribution of assets after the 2019 bifurcation of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday asked the Netherlands to not provide arms, weapon systems, platforms and military technologies to Pakistan, which has sponsored cross-border terrorism for decades, in a meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Ruben Brekelmans.In the delegation-level meet, India and the Netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and new and emerging technologies like AI and drones .The clear takeaway, however, was Singh telling Brekelmans that “equipping” Pakistan with defence equipment and technologies “undermines regional security and stability” in South Asia, sources told TOI.“Singh said India has been fighting Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in J&K and elsewhere for decades. India tells all friendly countries that they should not arm Pakistan in any way due to its state policy of fueling terrorism in other countries,” a source added.The Netherlands, for instance, has supplied two Alkmaar-class mine countermeasures vessels or mine-hunters, which were built at the Van der Giessen-de Noord shipyard in Alblasserdam.Similarly, the country is also providing 1,900-tonne multi-role offshore patrol vessels from the Damen Shipyards to Pakistan. “Several Dutch companies are interacting with Pakistan in the military arena, especially in the naval domain,” another source said.India has upped the ante against terrorism and Sikh separatism in recent diplomatic meetings, with PM Modi on Monday seeking continuing cooperation from his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon to rein in pro-Khalistani separatists in his country.Parallelly, Singh also told US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that the Trump administration should designate Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which is banned in India for promoting secessionist and pro-Khalistani activities, as a foreign terrorist organization, as was reported by TOI.In the India-Netherlands meet on Tuesday, the two sides also explored the possibilities of collaboration in shipbuilding, equipment and space sectors, “optimizing the complementariness in skills, technology and scale of the two countries”.“They also discussed working together in domains like AI and related technologies, besides connecting the defence technology research institutes and organizations of the two countries,” a defence ministry official said.With India developing a “vibrant innovation and industrial ecosystem”, New Delhi also said Dutch armament companies should be encouraged to integrate Indian vendors into their supply chains.Singh said he was “delighted to meet the young and dynamic defence minister of the Netherlands, and the two reviewed the full range of bilateral defence cooperation. “We look forward to further deepening and elevating our defence partnership,” he said.","India and the Netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the Indo- Pacific.

JAMMU: Police arrested a woman pilgrim near the sanctum sanctorum of the cave shrine of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi in Reasi district of Jammu & Kashmir after they found a loaded pistol in her possession.Police identified the accused as one Jyoti Gupta , who claimed she is a retired police constable from New Delhi, who they intercepted with the pistol and six cartridges during routine checks on the intervening night of March 14-15.“The licence for the weapon in the possession of Ms Gupta expired a couple of years ago. Katra police are investigating the case further after registering an FIR,” police said. Police also booked one Sanjay Singh , a pilgrim from Uttar Pradesh, after they found two cartridges in his bag near the same area on Monday.Security remains high in and around the shrine since six pilgrims including a child were killed and 48 others injured in twin explosions set off by terrorists near the Banganga river, 2km from Katra, on way to the Vaishno Devi shrine on July 21, 2003. Security was further tightened around the holy cave shrine after security forces neutralized four terrorists in an encounter in Jammu’s Nagrota on Nov 20, 2020.","Police arrested a woman pilgrim near the sanctum sanctorum of the cave shrine of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi in Reasi district of Jammu & Kashmir.

Nasir Aslam Wani, CM Omar’s adviser, accompanied Choudhary.Showkat Ahmad Bajad’s body was found in a decomposed condition on March 16 in a river in Kulgam.

The three worked in a brick kiln.The magisterial probe was announced amid allegations by opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the NC govt was not acting on the issue. PDP MLA Waheed Parra had on Monday described deaths of Gujjars “as part of a pattern”. Parra cited another youth’s suicide after alleged police torture in Kathua last month as well as the latest deaths in Kulgam, saying all should probed as they were tied to one specific community.The home department comes under LG after J&K became a Union Territory following the Aug 2019 annulment of special status under Article 370.

HC also noted that I4C — home ministry’s nodal agency dealing with cybercrimes — has followed up with X and held meetings on the issue, but the microblogging site maintained it is not bound to come on board Sahyog as it has always cooperated whenever authorities reached out. The bench acknowledged that I4C has a grievance against X on grounds that in the past, when requests were made for information about sexual offences against children, no response came from X, which is why X ought to come on board Sahyog.Since, except for X, every other social media entity agreed to be linked to Sahyog, HC said these no longer needed to be part of the proceedings before it and agreed to examine objections by X on the next date in the matter that stemmed from a habeas corpus plea file by a woman trying to trace her missing son.On Tuesday, court observed that as per I4C’s status report, while 38 intermediaries have “onboarded”, 15 intermediaries are in the process.

NAGPUR: Authorities clamped a curfew across 30% of Nagpur Tuesday following clashes in the heart of the city on Monday night after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district in Maharashtra.Over 50 people have been arrested and 10 police teams deployed to track down other suspects. Police have filed six FIRs against more than 1,200 people, including members of VHP and Bajrang Dal. A single FIR at Ganeshpeth police station charged 650 people.Tensions remained high but no fresh violence was reported Tuesday. Over 1,000 security personnel fortified sensitive areas while 8,000 were on standby. Police conducted marches in central Nagpur.The riots left at least 70 wounded, two of them critically, and caused extensive damage, with mobs torching two bulldozers and 50 vehicles.Cops in motorbike helmets and an intelligence apparatus that allegedly missed clues to what was coming cut a sorry figure in central Nagpur late Monday as rioters, driven by rumours, outnumbered and overwhelmed them in a one-sided battle that left the Maharashtra city convulsing, report Proshun Chakraborty & Viraj Deshpande.After battling rioters for four hours at Mahal, where the violence originated over a demand to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from Khultabad in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, police apparently failed to fortify other communally sensitive localities within a 3km radius. Once the protest against Aurangzeb's tomb triggered rioting, the security establishment appeared ill-prepared to prevent the violence from spiralling.Sources said a police contingent was sent out to tackle the rioters in makeshift protective gear. The ferocity of the attack and the team's alleged lack of preparation left them exposed. ""There was no plan in place to control the mob, with police failing to anticipate the possibility of lanes and alleys turning into battle zones. While the cops were trying to push back stone-pelters, many began vandalising vehicles and shops,"" a witness said.A senior police officer admitted to ""misjudging the situation and failing to predict the mob's movements"".

The Paris Agreement is a globally agreed goal to strive to limit warming to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels.“While a single year above 1.5 degree C of warming does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, it is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies, and to the planet,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.The report attributed the record global temperatures, seen in 2023 and broken in 2024, to the ongoing rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, coupled with a shift from a cooling La Niña to warming El Niño event.It, however, noted that several other factors may have contributed to the unexpectedly unusual temperature jumps, including changes in the solar cycle, a massive volcanic eruption and a decrease in cooling aerosols.The report also shows the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was at the highest levels in the last 800,000 years, and the rate of sea level rise has doubled since satellite measurements began in 1993.Around 90% of the extra heat trapped by GHG is absorbed by the ocean, causing it to warm and affecting marine life, weather patterns, and sea levels. The report shows that the ocean continued to warm in 2024, reaching record high levels.The sea level rise has cascading damaging impacts on coastal ecosystems and infrastructure, with further impacts from flooding and saltwater contamination of groundwater.“Our planet is issuing more distress signals -- but this report shows that limiting long-term global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is still possible. Leaders must step up to make it happen -- seizing the benefits of cheap, clean renewables for their people and economies - - with new national climate plans due this year, ” said United Nations secretary-general António Guterres.","Year 2024 may be the warmest calendar year on record with a global mean near- surface temperature of 1.55 degrees celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 average) But the long-term warming (averaged over decades) remains below 1.5 degrees C, says World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119185045,imgsize-32382,width-400,resizemode-4/119185045.jpg"

MUMBAI: An international report has found that while nine Indian cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, focus on immediate responses to heat waves, long-term interventions remain scarce and, where they exist, are inadequately targeted.""Without efficacious long-term strategies, India is likely to witness a higher number of heat-related fatalities due to more frequent, intense, and prolonged heat waves in forthcoming years,"" cautions the study, co-authored by scholars from Sustainable Futures Collaborative, King's College London, Harvard University, Princeton University, and University of California, Berkeley.Utilising climate models, the study identified nine cities — Bengaluru, Delhi, Faridabad, Gwalior, Kota, Ludhiana, Meerut, Mumbai and Surat — with populations exceeding 1 million (based on the 2011 Census) that are anticipated to experience the most substantial increases in hazardous heat index values, combining temperature and humidity, relative to their recent historical averages.“Mumbai, with its 12.4 million population, is presently experiencing premature and extended heatwaves. Mumbai encounters elevated temperatures in summer and during the post-monsoon period due to heightened humidity. Increased humidity amplifies the heat index value of a locality, potentially diminishing bodily resilience and ability to cope with extreme heat through perspiration. Maharashtra possesses a State Heat Action Plan (HAP), while heat-resilience in Mumbai is additionally guided by the Mumbai Climate Action Plan. The HAP delineates actions to be undertaken by pertinent departments before, during and after a heat wave,"" the report said.The analysis found that while all nine cities implement short-term emergency response measures, crucial long-term actions are either wholly absent or poorly targeted. Essential interventions such as household cooling provision for the most heat-exposed, work-loss insurance coverage, enhanced fire management services, and electricity grid improvements are notably lacking across all cities.“In three cities — Mumbai, Bengaluru, Surat — we found the active, embedded engagement of civil society organisations over extended periods of time had the effect of focusing the bureaucracy on climate action, which suggests that more active civil society involvement is necessary to reduce state capacity deficits,” the report said.","Nine Indian cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, focus on immediate responses to heat waves.

EC set to tap UIDAI to iron out EPIC-Aadhaar linkage wrinkles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-set-to-tap-uidai-to-iron-out-epic-aadhaar-linkage-wrinkles/articleshow/119184069.cms,"NEW DELHI: Election Commission will begin technical consultations with Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) soon to sort out issues in linking electors' photo identity card (EPIC) with Aadhaar , including those arising from different eligibility criteria and purposes served by the two documents, reports Bharti Jain.The decision to start discussions was taken at a meeting held on Tuesday by the commission, represented by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi; secretaries of ministry of home affairs, legislative department and ministry of electronics and IT (MeiTY); and UIDAI chief executive officer, besides technical experts from both EC and UIDAI.While an EPIC can only be issued to a person who fulfils the criteria outlined by Article 326 - being an Indian citizen, age 18 years and above, ordinarily resident in the polling booth where registering, and not disqualified from voting under any law on grounds of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime or corrupt or illegal practice - Aadhaar only establishes identity of a person through photograph and biometrics like fingerprints and iris scan.Technical consultations seek to devise a foolproof system such that a person cannot claim voting right solely on the basis of Aadhaar. Only if the person fulfils all criteria under Article 326 can he vote, with Aadhaar use limited to establishing identity .It said the linking of EPIC with Aadhaar will be done only as per Article 326; Section 23(4), 23(5) and 23(6) of the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1950; and SC judgement in writ petition (civil) No. 177/2023.

"'Want fair peace for Ukraine, India has a key role to play'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/want-fair-peace-for-ukraine-india-has-a-key-role-to-play/articleshow/119183891.cms,"What is your Indo-Pacific policy all about?



There's increasing focus on defence cooperation. How can Sweden contribute to the Make in India initiative?



Sweden shunned long-standing neutrality to join NATO last year. Are you disappointed with the way Trump has targeted the organisation?



Can India still play a role in ensuring peace?



It’s important for like-minded democracies to together uphold the rules-based order , whether in Ukraine or in Indo-Pacific where China is posing challenges, Sweden’s foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard tells TOI’s Sachin Parashar in an exclusive interview. Excerpts:We came up with our strategy last year and it's on the side of defence. We are seeing how security in the world is becoming interlinked. The worst example of this is North Korean troops being present on the Russian side in the war against Ukraine. It shows how small the world has become, and we need cooperation among democracies who believe in the rules-based order. There is great interest in the Indo-Pacific in many parts of the world. We see potential here for enormous growth but also tensions. For instance, we see how China is challenging the rules-based order, the law of the sea, in the South China Sea.We have substantial cooperation already in place in defence. It's a big step that Swedish company Saab is coming here to produce the Carl Gustaf (shoulder-launched weapon system). We will both benefit from this cooperation and there is also potential as regards the defence industry. Sweden is very strong in that area, and with these many tensions in the world, there is great potential.My interpretation of the new administration is that they are 100% committed to the alliance. Pete Hegseth (secretary of defence) has said he would like to deepen the cooperation. I think the US intends to be a good ally. Having said that, I think their criticism against European countries, and also Canada, of not spending enough on their own security is absolutely legit. Sweden has done its homework. So, we have doubled our investments in the military in four years and we are heading for more. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The best way of keeping the US interested in European security is to show that we are interested in European security. Trump is trying to find a solution (to the war). We are very pleased with the agreement in Jeddah for a proposed ceasefire and now the pressure is on Russia. It's up to Russia to show they want to lay down their weapons. I'm not sure they will want that. Trump has contributed to that and for that we are grateful.I think India is a very important country standing up for the rules-based order. I'm convinced that India has a very important role to play regarding this. But it has to be peace that is fair and does not allow Russia to go back to its people perceived as winners, invest more heavily in their military and then return to attack another friendly country. Our full support for Ukraine (including Sweden's military aid) is a prerequisite for them to be able to negotiate from a position of strength. It's important for Ukraine to be in a position to say no to a bad deal.","It’s important for like-minded democracies to together uphold the rules-based order, says Maria Malmer Stenergard.

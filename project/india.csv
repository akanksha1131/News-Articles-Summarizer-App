NEW DELHI: Coming out in support of the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha on his alleged ""vote theft"" claims, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday said that the questions raised by Rahul Gandhi needed to be ""seriously addressed.""""These are serious questions which must be seriously addressed in the interests of all parties & all voters,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said while sharing the fellow party leader Rahul Gandhi's video explaining how ""Bangalore central Lok Sabha seat was stolen"".Tharoor further said, ""Our democracy is too precious to allow its credibility to be destroyed by incompetence, carelessness or worse, deliberate tampering. Election Commission must urgently act & should keep the nation informed.""Shashi Tharoor expressed support after Rahul Gandhi, in a press conference on Thursday, shared what he described as ""concrete evidence"" of large-scale electoral manipulation, alleging that the Election Commission collaborated with the BJP to ensure the ruling party’s win.Tharoor’s comments signaled a change in tone, following several months in which his statements, including praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and criticism of the Emergency period, imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had drawn criticism from within the Congress and were used by the BJP to target the grand old party.Gandhi, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, also made explosive claims of a ""huge criminal fraud"" in polls through collusion between the BJP and the Election Commission.Alleging that a ""vote chori model"" was being used in many constituencies across the country, Gandhi said that the judiciary needs to get involved in this because ""the democracy that we love so much, does not exist anymore"".He claimed that there was ""vote chori"" (stealing of votes) of 1,00,250 votes in the Mahadevapura segment, with 11,965 duplicate voters, 40,009 voters with fake and invalid addresses, 10,452 bulk voters or single address voters, 4,132 voters with invalid photos and 33,692 misusing Form 6 of new voters","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said that the questions raised by Rahul Gandhi needed to be ""seriously addressed"" Gandhi, in a press conference on Thursday, shared what he described as ""concrete evidence"" of large-scale electoral manipulation.

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Patiala House court Thursday allowed 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks plotter Tahawwur Rana to have a phone conversation with his family for the limited purpose of discussing the engagement of a new legal aid counsel.At present, advocate Piyush Sachdeva from Delhi Legal Services Authority is Rana's legal counsel.

Authorities had opposed the plea, reasoning that inmates aged 65 or older could be given a bed under the jail manual. Rana is 64. On July 9, after NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet, the court extended Rana's judicial custody until Aug 13.

"Typos, technicalities used to deny citizenship claims in Assam: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/typos-technicalities-used-to-deny-citizenship-claims-in-assam-report/articleshow/123176575.cms,"Even as citizenship issues are being raised in many parts of the country, a new report questions the legal process followed by the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) and Gauhati high court in declaring 1.6 lakh people as ""foreigners"" in Assam.According to the report, citizenship was denied on the basis of minor spelling errors and confusion between honorific titles and actual names, while credible oral testimony was dismissed. The findings were based on an analysis of over 1,200 Gauhati HC orders, key Supreme Court judgments, orders of the FTs, and extensive interviews with lawyers and litigants. Among the cases cited are:Barpeta resident Rahman Ali submitted documents for citizenship in 2012, listing his father's name as Khurshed Ali. His claim was rejected a year later with the authorities ruling that this was a discrepancy as his father's name registered as Furshed Ali in the 1965 and 1970 voter rolls, even though it was correctly registered as Khurshed in 1989, 1997 and 2010.Maharjan Nessa's uncle's testimony was dismissed in 2019 because he was unaware of when her father had purchased land in Gobardhana village in Baksa district, a detail irrelevant to her citizenship status.Ibrahim Ali's petition was denied because his father's name appeared as 'Late Nurul' in the 1989 voter roll and 'Nurul Islam' in the 1965 and 1970 voter rolls for Toktoki village in Nagaon district.Besides such rejections, there are over 85,000 pending cases. The FTs are expected to hear a million appeals from those excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The report titled 'Unmaking Citizens: The Architecture of Rights Violations and Exclusion in India's Citizenship Trials' by the National Law School of India University and Queen Mary University of London describes this as a ""burgeoning crisis"". It argues that the FTs - rather than being flawed exceptions-have become routine instruments of exclusion.The report comes at a time when Parliament has enacted the new Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025. In this context, the report calls for an urgent, fundamental rethinking of the legal structures governing citizenship in India, calling the current system not just broken, but actively unjust.""Even though the citizenship verification process has ostensibly been carried out under the cover of law and sometimes even under court supervision, our report shows that it fails to align with core constitutional and legal principles,"" says Mohsin Alam Bhat, law professor at Queen Mary University and co-author of the report. ""People are asked to produce unreasonable documentation. Worse, the system is designed to reject even the documentary and oral evidence they do manage to provide. ""Some of the reasons for denying citizenship are against settled law, the report says. For instance, FTs and the Gauhati HC routinely rejected crucial official documents, such as gram panchayat certificates and voter rolls, over minor formatting flaws, inconsistencies in ink color, or the absence of details like specific govt headers. Slight variations in a person's name, title, or age became grounds for denial, even though such inconsistencies are common in rural records. Even when credible witnesses, including family members with direct knowledge, testified to a person's citizenship or familial relationships, their statements were often dismissed just because they could not recall details like the precise year a family moved to a village, the date of a marriage, or a birth date.Additionally, FTs and the HC have routinely dismissed post-1971 documents as ""irrelevant"" or ""not proof of citizenship"". This led to documents like Aadhaar, PAN cards, and ration cards, which could establish continuous residence or familial ties, being summarily rejected.Another challenge has been the steadily weakening qualifications for FT members. In 2011, only retired officials of the judicial service were eligible. By 2015, advocates who had 10 years of experience could be appointed. In 2019, this was further broadened to include civil servants and lawyers with only seven years of experience.The report argues that the courts have not treated these procedural violations as errors of law serious enough to invalidate FT proceedings. Bhat says, ""The high court has adopted the same narrow approach to evidence as the tribunals, rejecting testimony and documents for minor, technical discrepancies without considering them in totality, as settled evidentiary practice would require.""","A new report questions the legal process followed by the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) in declaring 1.6 lakh people as ""foreigners"" in Assam.

Lone candidate in fray? SC weighs NOTA option,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lone-candidate-in-fray-sc-weighs-nota-option/articleshow/123176466.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to examine a proposal to make 'none of the above (NOTA)' choice available to voters even when a single candidate is in the fray to enable them to express their approval of him/her, and countermand the elections if NOTA votes exceed votes polled by the candidate.Despite Centre and EC terming NOTA, put in place based on SC's 2013 judgment, a failed idea for the poor response it received from voters, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh said, ""It is an interesting question. It is true that elections in India are keenly contested. But imagine a situation where the voters do not want the single candidate in the fray, who would otherwise be elected unopposed, to be their representative in the assembly or Lok Sabha?""Justice Kant added, ""If there is resentment among voters against the single candidate, then the voters will come out in numbers and choose NOTA. If NOTA votes exceed the votes garnered by the single candidate in the fray, then what should be done? This may be academic, but a very interesting question which may require judicial deliberation.""Attorney general R Venkataramani said it was purely a non-plausible concept in the Indian context. For EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said NOTA had never impacted an election since its inception. Every winning candidate has so far got higher votes than NOTA even though some of the losing candidates had secured less than NOTA votes, he said.However, he said EC would scrupulously conduct elections as mandated by law and the orders of the SC. Additional solicitor general S D Sanjay asked the bench what would happen if an election was countermanded because of NOTA getting more votes than the single candidate in the fray, and a similar situation emerged in the fresh election.Responding to a PIL on the issue filed by 'Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy', EC in its affidavit said candidates getting elected unopposed from a Lok Sabha constituency was very rare. Since 1991, there has been only one such instance, Dwivedi said. ""Since 1971 till today, that is in the last 54 years, there have been six uncontested elections in total. In the 20 general elections since 1951, there have been only nine uncontested elections,"" he added.""Treating NOTA as a mandatorily contesting candidate in all direct uncontested elections does not find place in the statute and the same would require legislative amendments in the provisions of Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961,"" EC said.","Supreme Court agrees to examine proposal to make 'none of the above (NOTA)' choice available to voters even when a single candidate is in the fray.

The crackdown at Borivli involved a deployment of 350 personnel, including 300 ticket checking staff, along with Railway Protection Force (RPF) and govt Railway Police (GRP) support.""This is the largest and most focused ticket-checking operation undertaken on Indian Railways at a single station,"" said Vineet Abhishek, chief public relations officer, WR.

Tuesday's drive at Borivli alone surpassed Rs 13 lakh and booked 5,192 cases — an all-time high for any single station.""Ticket checking staff usually work with shoulder bags containing hand-held terminals (HHTs) and Excess Fare Ticket (EFT) books, making it difficult to navigate overcrowded coaches and AC locals, especially during peak hours.Under NAMASTE, WR has introduced specially designed protective vests that securely hold essential devices like HHTs, EFTs, body cameras, and compact speakers for onboard announcements.""These new vests will significantly improve the mobility and safety of our ticket checking staff,"" Abhishek said. ""They allow devices to be strapped close to the body, reducing clutter and enabling better access in crowded conditions.""WR is also establishing pre-custody areas at major suburban stations to streamline the handling of ticketless or unruly passengers. These zones will operate under CCTV surveillance and follow standardised documentation protocols, reducing congestion at head ticket-checking offices and ensuring greater transparency.Abhishek added that the NAMASTE Abhiyaan will continue with more such surprise drives across key stations in Mumbai to reinforce ticket discipline and improve the overall travel experience for genuine commuters.","Western Railway conducted the most extensive ticket-checking drive in Indian Railways' history at Borivli station on Tuesday.

Connection to Gangster Aman Singh's Jail Murder

House Attached, Police Crack Down





LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh STF gunned down dreaded mafia criminal Ashish Ranjan alias Chhotu Singh, a resident of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, in an encounter near Shivrajpur Chauraha under Shankargarh police station limits in Prayagraj in the wee hours of Thursday.Ashish, wanted in at least four high-profile murder cases, including that of gangster Aman Singh, opened fire with an AK-47 rifle and a 9mm pistol at the STF team, prompting retaliatory action in which he was critically injured and later declared dead, said Additional DG, law and order, Amitabh Yash.ADG Yash said that acting on a tip-off that Ashish was en route to Prayagraj to possibly execute a major criminal plot with an associate, the STF laid a trap near Shivrajpur.“When intercepted, Ashish fired at the police team with lethal intent. STF officers JP Rai, Prabhanjan, and Rohit narrowly escaped bullets. In self-defence, the STF retaliated, injuring Ashish, who was rushed to a nearby hospital but succumbed to injuries,” said ADG Yash.From the spot, police recovered a loaded AK-47, 9mm pistol, large cache of live cartridges and spent shells, and a motorcycle. A case under multiple sections, including attempt to murder and Arms Act, has been lodged, and further investigation is underway, the officer added.STF said that Ashish had a long criminal history and was the prime accused in three high-profile murder cases in Dhanbad, including, the murder of police informer and coal trader Neeraj Tiwari in Katras on September 5, 2021. The murder of land dealer Sarful Hasan alias Lala Khan in Wasseypur on May 12, 2021. The murder of Ranjit Sahu in Jharia.Previously, Ashish had been jailed in the Samir Mandal land mafia murder case but was released on bail, after which he continued to commit heinous crimes. Jharkhand Police and CID had both been hunting him, and a permanent warrant had been issued against him.Ashish came into the spotlight after he claimed responsibility for the murder of mafia don Aman Singh inside Dhanbad Jail, in a viral audio-video confession. The feud reportedly began after Ashish accused Aman of plotting his murder. Police suspect the conspiracy to eliminate Aman was hatched in Nepal, where Ashish is believed to have been hiding before resurfacing in UP. A key accused in Aman’s murder, Ritesh Yadav alias Sundar Mahto, had told police that he met Ashish in Nepal days before the murder.Following his repeated absconding, police had already initiated property attachment proceedings at Ashish's residence in JC Mallick Road, Dhanbad, on orders of SDJM Poonam Kumari in September 2024.In two separate FIRs—one related to the murder of Neeraj Tiwari and the other involving land dealer Lala Khan—his house and belongings were seized by the local police. Ashish has over a dozen serious criminal cases registered against him.","Ashish Ranjan alias Chhotu Singh, a resident of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, was gunned down in an encounter near Shivrajpur Chauraha.

NEW DELHI: Political bigwigs gathered in New Delhi on Tuesday evening to attend the wedding reception of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra and former Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Pinaki Misra.The reception, held at Hotel Lalit, followed the couple’s private wedding in Germany.Photographs from the event showed Congress leader Sonia Gandhi seated at a dinner table with Rajya Sabha MP Ranjeet Ranjan.Also in attendance were Samajwadi Party MP Virendra Singh, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi.Other leaders, including Supriya Sule of the NCP, Telangana CM Revanth Reddy and DMK MP T Sumathy alias Thamizhachi Thangapandian, also offered their best wishes.Former Congress MP Danish Ali shared that the evening was marked by camaraderie and conversations, as he was seen mingling with leaders including Akhilesh Yadav, Revanth Reddy and Bhagwant Mann.Mahua Moitra, a two-time MP from West Bengal’s Krishnanagar, tied the knot with senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Pinaki Misra in a private ceremony in Germany earlier this year.Born in Assam in 1974, Ms Moitra began her career as an investment banker before entering politics with the Trinamool Congress in 2010.She was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2019 and re-elected in 2024.Mr Misra, born in 1959, is a veteran politician and senior advocate at the Supreme Court. An alumnus of Delhi’s St Stephen’s College and Delhi University, he began his political journey with the Congress Party, winning the Puri seat in 1996.He later joined the BJD and has since served multiple terms in Parliament.","The reception, held at Hotel Lalit, followed the couple’s private wedding in Germany.

Finland-based thinktank exposes US double standard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finland-based-thinktank-exposes-us-double-standard/articleshow/123151870.cms,"NEW DELHI: European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports against India's 13% since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, while G7+ tankers are currently transporting more than half of those barrels, data published by CREA (Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air) shows.Indian govt sources here said this further spotlighted Western hypocrisy in targeting India for securing its energy interests, while ignoring similar action by other countries. European Union has been procuring not just energy but also fertilizers, chemicals, iron, steel and transport equipment from Russia.""These figures only vindicate India's emphasis on ensuring for its citizens regular and affordable energy supplies,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.Seen in the backdrop of the US on Wednesday doubling tariff on India to 50% for ""fuelling the Russian war machine"" by buying its oil and last month's EU sanction on Indian refining entity Nayara Energy, the Finland-based independent think-tank's latest report exposes what New Delhi describes as West's ""double standard"" in singling out India.The report says Moscow has raked in EUR 923 billion (92,300 crore) so far from fossil fuel exports such as oil, natural gas, coal, refined fuels and intermediaries.Of this, EUR 212 billion (21,200 crore) came from EU countries compared with EUR 121 billion (12,100 crore) from India. China remained the top bu-yer of Russian energy with a tab of over EUR 200 billion (20,000 crore).The report points out the growing role of G7 tankers in transporting Russian oil since the EU's June sanctions. This underlines the disconnect between western policy and practice pointed out by New Delhi. ""Since Jan, the G7+ share in Russian oil transport has increased from 36% to 56%,"" it says. More than half of Russian seaborne oil exports were transported in G7+ tankers in June, reflecting a six percentage point increase over May.Use of western tanker fleet means those shipments were compliant with the price cap and other terms of the sanctions. India argues it has helped prevent a flare-up in oil prices by buying Russian oil, accounting for about 9% of daily global supply. That is also the key consideration that led the US and the EU to opt for a price cap - rather than choking off the flow with sanctions - for curbing funding for Moscow's war efforts without spooking the oil markets.Overall, however, the report does say that ""Russian fossil fuel revenues in second quarter of 2025 dropped by 18% year-on-year - lowest in a quarter since the invasion of Ukraine. This occurred despite an 8% increase in volumes exported in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025.""Read | Trump tariffs: Exporters on edge, fear losing orders","European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports.

'Can't act like a crook': Supreme Court's stern words for ED; bench says agency must work 'within four corners of the law',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-act-like-a-crook-supreme-courts-stern-words-for-ed-bench-says-agency-must-work-within-four-corners-of-the-law/articleshow/123168101.cms,"Supreme Court; Enforcement Directorate

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday sternly reminded the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that the central agency must function strictly within the bounds of the law, stating, ""You can’t act like a crook.""A bench comprising Justices Surya Kant, Ujjal Bhuyan, and N Kotiswar Singh made the observation while hearing petitions seeking a review of the top court's July 2022 ruling which upheld ED’s powers of arrest, search, and seizure under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Appearing for the Centre and ED, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju argued that the review petitions were not maintainable, describing them as mere “disguised appeals” against the earlier verdict. He claimed that “influential crooks” exploit the legal process to delay investigations by filing multiple applications, forcing ED officers to focus on court appearances instead of conducting probes.Justice Bhuyan pushed back, highlighting concerns about the agency’s low conviction rate.""You can't act like a crook, you have to act within the four corners of the law. I observed in one of my judgments that ED has registered around 5,000 ECIRs (enforcement case information report) in the past five years but the conviction rate is less than 10 per cent. We are also concerned about ED’s image. After 5–6 years of custody, if people are acquitted, who takes responsibility?” he said.The ASG further argued that the agency is often ""handicapped"" when ""influential accused"" flee to jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands. He also pointed out that in 2019, a Supreme Court Constitution bench had already upheld the PMLA’s constitutional validity.The hearing of review petitions will continue next week.","The Supreme Court sternly reminded the Enforcement Directorate that the central agency must function strictly within the bounds of the law.

SC judges take exception to order against HC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-judges-take-exception-to-order-against-hc-judge/articleshow/123151364.cms,"NEW DELHI: Top judges of Supreme Court have taken strong exception to the order passed on Tuesday by a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan castigating an Allahabad high court judge for lack of knowledge in criminal law and de-rostering him from hearing criminal cases for life, and are mulling steps to remedy an unpleasant situation created in breach of repeated SC rulings.A concerned Chief Justice of India B R Gavai consulted his senior colleagues and is now discussing ways and means to remedy the order that has created difficulties for the chief justice (CJ) of one of the oldest high courts of India, at Allahabad.SC has repeatedly ruled that the CJ of an HC is the master of the roster and he alone can allocate, roster and assign cases to single, division and three-judge benches in HC and that his discretion is not amenable to judicial orders.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan ordered the Allahabad HC CJ to ""immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the concerned judge"" and ""make the judge sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge"". They also said, ""We further direct that the concerned judge shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office"".Irrespective of the folly of the HC judge, SC, which gives primacy to principles of natural justice, passed the caustic and damaging order against the judge without giving him an opportunity to explain why he passed the impugned directive.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges, and said, ""The judge concerned has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what is wrong with the Indian judiciary at the level of HC.""TOI spoke to a number of former CJIs, who too expressed concern over the manner in which the bench led by Justice Pardiwala proceeded to castigate the HC judge, stressing that errors in HC orders are not uncommon and are regularly appealed in SC.A judge's mistake in appreciating legal points or facts in a particular case cannot empower SC, while deciding appeals against an HC judgment, to castigate the judge who authored that judgment and take punitive measures like de-rostering him, which, the ex-CJIs said, was the sole prerogative of the HC CJ.Incidentally, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had fixed timelines for the President and governors to grant or refuse assent to bills passed by state assemblies, while granting ""deemed approval"" to bills pending with the TN governor. The President has since sent a reference to SC seeking its opinion on whether the apex court has the power to fix timelines for her and governors when the Constitution does not provide for the same, and whether SC can use powers under Article 142 to grant deemed approval to bills.In the case of Braj Kishore Thakur vs. Union of India (1997), SC had ruled: ""Higher courts must remind themselves constantly that higher tiers are provided in the judicial hierarchy to set right errors which could possibly have crept in findings or orders of courts at the lower tiers. Such powers are certainly not for belching diatribe at judicial personages in lower cadre. It is best to remember the words of a jurist that 'a judge who has not committed any error is yet to be born'. ..""In Rajasthan vs Prakash Chand (1997), another three-judge bench said ""that the administrative control of HC vests in the chief justice alone. On the judicial side, however, he is only the first amongst equals. The CJ is the master of the roster. He alone has the prerogative to constitute benches of the court and allocate cases to the benches so constituted. The puisne judges can only do that work as is allotted to them by the chief justice or under his directions. No judge or judges can give directions to the Registry for listing any case before him or them which runs counter to the directions given by the chief justice."" This ruling was made applicable to SC by a three-judge bench's judgment in 2018.","Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges. SC has repeatedly ruled that the CJ of an HC is the master of the roster and he alone can allocate, roster and assign cases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123151387,imgsize-1026955,width-400,resizemode-4/123151387.jpg"
Adolescent romance can't be grounds to lower age of consent: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adolescent-romance-cant-be-grounds-to-lower-age-of-consent-government/articleshow/123176378.cms,"6 Anti-aging foods to reverse the clock

No intention to bring bill in Parl to lower age of consent: Govt

NEW DELHI: The Centre told Supreme Court Thursday that diluting the age of consent from 18 to 16 years would make young girls vulnerable to predators within and outside their family but conceded courts could exercise judicial discretion to determine whether an alleged 'rape' was actually adolescent romance warranting leniency.The Centre said, ""Diluting age of consent or introducing exceptions in the guise of adolescent romance would not only be legally unsound but also dangerous, as it would provide a defence mechanism even to those abusers who exploit the child's emotional dependence or silence.""In its written submissions settled by additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, govt said in a minuscule number of cases, where adolescents out of emotional curiosity or mutual attraction, may engage in romantic or physical relationships, courts must carefully scrutinise such instances on a case-by-case basis, using discretion and sensitivity to the facts.However, the Centre said it has no intention to bring a legislation in Parliament to lower the age of consent. ""This judicial discretion, however, is distinct from legislative dilution. The moment the statute begins to generalise such exceptions, it weakens the bright-line protective standard that currently acts as a deterrent and shield for all children,"" it said.Attempts to reduce the age of consent under the IPC/BNS was contrary to the legislative intent and undermined the protective object of the provision, as envisaged through the application of the 'mischief rule' of statutory interpretation, it said. The Centre quoted a nearly two-decade-old study by the WCD ministry, which found that 53.2% of children reported facing one or more forms of sexual abuse, and 50% of abusers were persons in positions of trust or authority, such as parents, relatives, neighbours or school staff.",The Centre told Supreme Court diluting the age of consent from 18 to 16 years would make young girls vulnerable to predators.

SC says evaluate NEET booklets manually,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-says-evaluate-neet-booklets-manually/articleshow/123176281.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a setback for National Testing Agency (NTA), Supreme Court has ordered manual evaluation of a NEET-UG 2025 answer sheet after a candidate alleged that the question paper was stapled incorrectly, resulting in a jumbled sequence of questions. The direction comes amid growing criticism that NTA has failed to adequately address students' grievances, with some even being told to seek redressal ""from courts.""Despite repeated representations by candidates about faulty booklets and scoring discrepancies, NTA has largely maintained that its processes are foolproof. However, in this case, SC took serious view of the complaint and rejected NTA's suggestion that no real harm was caused.TOI on June 11, in its report titled ""Students raise serious concerns over errors in NEET-UG papers"" highlighted the issue. Candidates interviewed had flagged faulty booklets with jumbled page orders, stating they marked incorrect answers due to mismatch between questions and the OMR sheet. When asked specifically about such instances, NTA responded by saying, ""There are four series of question papers. The jumbling is thus of four types.There are four sets of keys. These are applicable to the respective series."" Students, however, said this response ignored cases where jumbling was not just due to booklet series but stapling or printing errors. ""We were told that nothing could be done and that we should take it up legally if we had a problem,"" said a candidate from Odisha.In this particular case before the top court, the petitioner claimed the sequencing in his paper was highly erratic - running from question numbers 1 to 27, followed by 54 to 81, then 28 to 53, 118 to 151, 82 to 117, and 152 to 180. This disordered layout, he argued, made it virtually impossible to match the questions correctly with the standard serial OMR sheet, which was in the expected 1 to 180 format.In its Aug 5 order, SC said, ""We have heard learned ASG (additional solicitor general) appearing for the respondent(s). She has submitted a copy of the question paper in order to explain that there was a mistake merely in the stapling of the question paper which led to erroneous sequencing in as much as sequencing was not in seriatim and that this could not have caused any prejudice to the petitioner herein."" ""However, in order to satisfy ourselves, we direct that the petitioner's paper shall be evaluated manually and the result of the evaluation be placed on the record. The said exercise shall be carried out within a period of one week,"" it had said.","Supreme Court orders manual evaluation of a NEET-UG 2025 answer sheet.

‘Khalid Ka Shivaji’ Sparks Maha Row Over Historical Distortion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khalid-ka-shivaji-sparks-maha-row-over-historical-distortion/articleshow/123174160.cms,"Nagpur: Atop a gentle hill in Girad village in Wardha district, surrounded by lush greenery and revered equally by Hindu and Muslim devotees, stands the Sheikh Farid Dargah. A site known for harmony was used as a prominent plot in the Raj More-directed Marathi film, ‘Khalid Ka Shivaji', which has now triggered statewide controversy over an alleged historical distortion.The otherwise quiet village, 76km off Nagpur, has suddenly catapulted into the spotlight after the film slated for release on August 8, was selected for Cannes Film Festival. The movie features several key scenes, including a zilla parishad school along with the dargah and its scenic landscape. While the village itself is not the source of protest, the film has inadvertently pulled Girad into the narrative.The film follows a young Muslim boy whose worldview is transformed after reading about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj . However, right-wing groups have accused the filmmaker of twisting facts for communal appeasement. Protesters say the film falsely claims 35% of Shivaji's army was Muslim and even depicts a mosque on Raigad Fort, which they say amounts to historical misrepresentation. Protests erupted after two individuals interrupted CM Devendra Fadnavis's speech during the recent Maharashtra Marathi Film Awards in Mumbai and demanded a ban on the film.According to a local gramsevak, a 30-member film crew arrived in Girad last year and conducted a five-day shoot at various spots around the dargah. The team secured proper permission from the sub-divisional officer (SDO) for filming. During the shoot, the crew reportedly stayed at Jamb, a village near Hinganghat, 25 km from the location. The film's visuals of the dargah, open fields, and school in the background now stand out in the trailer, which has gone viral amid heated political reactions.Amid mounting backlash, cultural affairs minister Ashish Shelar has taken a firm stand. Talking to TOI, Shelar said, ""Distortion of history is absolutely unacceptable. We've written to the Union ministry of information and broadcasting to re-examine the film and reconsider the certificate issued by Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)."" He also questioned how the film passed review and added that an investigation will be conducted into how it was selected for Cannes Film Festival, raising concerns about possible procedural lapses.According to platforms like News Bharati, which is ‘loosely' linked to Sangh Parivar, the film falsely claims 35% of Shivaji Majaraj's army was Muslim, and erroneously depicts a mosque on Raigad Fort, which is an assault on the Maratha warrior's legacy.",Right-wing groups have accused the filmmaker of twisting facts for communal appeasement.

1 lakh fake voters in Karnataka seat that BJP swept in 2024: Rahul Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-lakh-fake-voters-in-karnataka-seat-that-bjp-swept-in-2024-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/123175972.cms,"NEW DELHI: Following through on his claim of ""atom bomb evidence of voter manipulation"" in favour of governing BJP, Congress' Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said over one lakh voters were downright fake in Mahadevapura assembly seat that BJP swept to narrowly win Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency in 2024. There are eight segments in the LS seat.He accused EC of colluding with BJP to ""destroy Indian democracy and steal elections"", and argued that if EC now does not provide electronic voters' data of 10-15 years and CCTV footage, then it is ""partaking in crime"" since the two are now ""evidence of crime"". He urged the judiciary to intervene to save Indian democracy.Addressing a press conference in the form of data point presentation of Congress' Mahadevapura study, with the national anthem played at the end, Rahul said, ""This is a crime being committed against the Constitution, Indian flag... I want the nation to know that there is a huge criminal fraud being perpetrated on India by EC and the party in office.""Citing the study, Rahul claimed BJP won Bangalore Central by 32,707 votes while 1,00,250 fake votes were polled for it. He said fake votes were in five categories - duplicate voters (11,965), fake/invalid addresses (40,009), bulk voters in one address (10,452), invalid photos of voters (4,132) and ""misuse of Form 6"" for becoming first-time voter (33,692).Showing files, he cited examples to assert people have voted multiple times in different booths of the seat, while addresses shown on voters' lists are like ""Street 0"", ""House no 0"". He said there were as many as 80 voters shown in one address, even 50 in one-bedroom house, while attempts to cross-check resulted in beating up of researchers or confirmation that they did not live there.Rahul said it is famously claimed that first-time voters vote for PM Modi, but Form 6 instances in Mahadevapura showed there were no first-time voters in the 18-23 age group, and instead the age group was in 90s and 50s, etc.""This is how Bangalore Central was stolen. The reason EC does not provide us data is because it is happening across country,"" he said, adding, ""The difference between (BJP) winning and (Congress) losing in Haryana polls was 22,779 votes, and in one Karnataka assembly seat they have stolen four times of that vote."" He said there is a pattern of BJP winning an LS seat by sweeping a solitary assembly segment, underlining, ""Modi is PM by a slender majority of 25 seats. ""To a question, Rahul said he is a politician and his word to the people should be taken as an oath, as he mocked EC for asking for it instead of reacting to his presentation by promising to check the information he had provided.Rahul said BJP has built narratives of specific issues influencing elections like Ladli Behna scheme, Pulwama, now Operation Sindoor, and anti-incumbency has eluded BJP. However, he said there were suspicions about BJP's victories, like in Maharashtra polls after being swept out in LS elections in the state. He said doubts became concrete when EC refused to provide machine-readable voters' lists, and then showed a surge in voting after 5.30pm while deciding to destroy CCTV footage.","Congress' Rahul Gandhi said over one lakh voters were downright fake in Mahadevapura assembly seat that BJP swept to narrowly win Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency in 2024.

Significantly, Congress was given copies of the draft as well as final electoral roll for Karnataka, Haryana and Maharashtra ahead of the last LS/assembly polls, but not a single appeal was filed against entries in the final roll at the level of the district magistrate or the CEO.Incidentally, a Congress govt was in office in Karnataka during the annual summary revision of the Karnataka roll ahead of the LS polls. The officials involved in roll revision - electoral registration officers (EROs), assistant EROs, booth level officers (BLOs), etc - are essentially state govt officials, though under the superintendence of EC for the duration of the roll update.","Chief electoral officers of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana say they will initiate the necessary proceedings after he declares under oath that he believes the wrongful inclusions and exclusions cited by him to be ""true to the best of his knowledge and belief"" The CEOs are expecting to receive the signed declarations from Rahul by Thursday evening.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123175763,imgsize-1236714,width-400,resizemode-4/123175763.jpg"

BJP allies like Anupriya Patel (Apna Dal) and Upendra Kushwaha (RLP) and Ramdas Athawale (RPI) were also a part of the discussions.The victory of an NDA candidate is a foregone conclusion.Against the maximum strength of 788, the effective strength of the two Houses is 781 due to one vacancy in the Lower House and six in the Upper House, including one caused by the recent death of former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren. NDA's strength is around 422, comfortably above the majority mark of 391.Asked if NDA will reach out to opposition to evolve a consensus on the next vice-president, Rijiju told reporters that as of now, Modi and Nadda have been authorised to identify the alliance's candidate.The opposition INDIA bloc already hinted at fielding its candidate.

Any adverse impact on the credibility of the institution could prove dear,"" it said, adding that no judge, be it in trial courts, HCs or in the SC, is above the law.SC also scotched attempts by Justice Varma to fault the process of inquiry and the CJI's decision in not giving him a personal hearing prior to recommending his removal. It said, ""The CJI has scrupulously followed the in-house procedure, which does not envisage a hearing to be given to the judge under probe after he has expressed his inability to resign or voluntarily retire.""Writing the 57-page judgment that surgically resected the core of argument senior advocate Kapil Sibal had made to shield the judge's intriguing behaviour post-discovery of sacks of burning cash at his official residence in Lutyens' Delhi on March 14 night and his participation in the inquiry without protest, Justice Datta said, ""Justice Varma's conduct does not inspire much confidence for us to entertain the writ petition.The bench faulted him for not raising objections in time to either the uploading of videos of the burning cash on the SC website, process of inquiry, findings of the committee and recommendation for removal, and questioned the audacity of the judge to doubt the legal sanction behind the in-house procedure.The only solace to Justice Varma was the bench's remark that since the entire inquiry process is essentially confidential, the then CJI could have avoided being too fair and transparent and not uploaded the video of the burning cash, since it was not required under the in-house procedure. At the same time, Justice Datta pointed out that the judge did not protest the uploading of the video at a relevant time.Justice Datta said even if the CJI had not made any recommendation for Justice Varma's removal, ""Parliament's power to initiate proceedings for removal of a judge for alleged misbehaviour or incapacity remains unfettered"". It can be initiated even when the committee finds the judge not guilty, it said.""The power, competence, authority and jurisdiction of Parliament to decide what is in the best interests of the nation is left untrammelled by the in-house procedure; hence, it is fallacious to argue that the in-house procedure is a parallel and extra-constitutional mechanism for removal of a Judge,"" Justices Datta and Masih said.The bench said it would be quixotic to argue that the in-house inquiry is a removal mechanism. It is only to help the CJI to take a prima facie view of a judge's alleged misconduct and decide whether or not to recommend the govt to initiate removal motion in Parliament.Rejecting aspersions on the CJI's actions after the inquiry report, the bench said, ""We have no hesitation to say that the CJI is not a mere post office between the inquiry committee and the President/PM that the report is to be forwarded without any remarks/recommendation. The CJI is clearly an important person, if not the most, in the larger scheme of maintaining institutional interest and credibility to ascertain whether a judge has indulged in misconduct.

While India has chosen to avoid any direct confrontation with Trump, Lula has taken him on, ruling out direct talks between him and the US president that he said would end in ""humiliation"". Brazil, however, is still negotiating for a trade deal with the US like India.Lula said during the hour-long conversation that Brazil and India are the two countries most affected by tariffs and both leaders, according to a Brazilian statement, reaffirmed the importance of defending multilateralism and the need to address the challenges of the current situation.On his talks with Lula, Modi later said in a post on X that a strong, people-centric partnership between Global South nations benefits everyone.As a preparatory step for Lula's visit, according to Brazil, the leaders agreed that Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin will travel to India next Oct for the Trade Monitoring Mechanism meeting.

Though the digging attempt failed, he still managed to escape with 30 litres of oil.With cooking oil prices soaring ahead of Onam later this month, coconut oil is being treated almost like a luxury item & grocery stores have started locking it up like treasure. In recent weeks, the price of coconut oil in Kerala has nearly doubled from around Rs 260 to over Rs 500 a litre.When grocery store owner Ayoob Puthanpurayil arrived at his shop in Ernakulam on Sunday, he found it ransacked. Thirty one-litre bottles of virgin coconut oil, priced at Rs 600 each, were missing, along with a few packs of gingelly oil, apples, and milk.""There was Rs 5,000 in the register and even a charity box - both untouched,"" he said. ""The real loss was oil. It was worth three times more.""The thief had tried to dig in through the sand behind the shop - a floor-level break-in attempt reminiscent of the Malappuram heist - but was thwarted by a plywood sheet installed to block rats.He eventually broke in through a narrow back door, likely limiting how much he could carry.""He must have worked for hours in low light to get that far,"" Puthanpurayil said. The shop was locked on three sides, one out of view from the road.Evidence showed the thief lingered inside. Curd packets were opened and partly eaten; empty water bottles lay scattered. Puthanpurayil said it was the fourth such attempt in the area. Though he had CCTV footage, he didn't pursue a case as police kept citing procedures. Police said no formal complaint was filed.","Thief ransacked a grocery store in Ernakulam, Kerala, stealing 30 litres of coconut oil.

But Maniki's march was unmissable. She was limping - a mahout on her back, her shattered foreleg folding with every step. The pain was visible. Someone recorded it. The truth exploded online.Maniki, 48, was being forced to walk from Kakopathar in Tinsukia district to Dibrugarh for medical care - 95km away, and a slow, brutal slog. Six days of hobbling. Just 36km covered. Her legs gave in. Her story didn't.The video sparked public outrage across Assam, pushing authorities into action Thursday. Forest personnel, veterinarians, activists, and district officials reached Makum, a midway town, where resident Krishna Majhi had offered her shelter Wednesday.First aid was administered. A three-day rest ordered. A truck arranged to transport her to either Kaziranga national park or Guwahati for advanced treatment.Her left foreleg was crushed in a logging accident two years ago in Arunachal Pradesh.

""What is this procedure of filing MAs two years after judgment was pronounced? The practice of waiting for judges, who delivered the judgment, to retire to file such an application is deplorable and amounts to forum shopping,"" he said.Taking a cue, Raju said these are influential and powerful people with huge money bags and they can resort to any tactics.This triggered Justice Bhuyan, who said, ""The crooks under investigation can resort to any tactics, but ED cannot behave like a crook. It has to investigate cases in accordance with law and the procedure laid down.""Justice Bhuyan also flagged the low conviction rate in PMLA cases filed by ED. ""I have observed in one of my judgments that ED has registered more than 5,000 ECIRs in the last five years but the rate of conviction is less than 10%. Even the minister admitted this in Parliament,"" he said.Raju, however, defended ED. ""When an affluent or influential person is proceeded against, he engages a battery of lawyers, who flood the trial court with applications. The trial judge gets mired in disposing of the applications and gets little time to focus on conducting the trial in the main case,"" he said.Justice Kant said, ""We are equally concerned about ED's image. You must improve your method of investigation and improve the rate of conviction. Why can't the govt set up fast-track special courts to conduct day-to-day trial of PMLA cases? Then the battery of lawyers would know that their delaying tactics would not work,"" he said.The bench then drifted towards the increasing possibility of cryptocurrency for money laundering. ""We are not saying ban cryptocurrency. But there should be some regulation. Indian currency is also under certain regulations.

The department reports to lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha.Press statements from district police headquarters described the action as part of an ongoing crackdown on publications allegedly promoting secessionist ideologies, glorifying terrorism, or disseminating distorted historical narratives.“The objective of the operation was to identify, seize, and forfeit literature that propagates false narratives or poses a threat to the unity of India,” Srinagar police said.Police in Anantnag said inspections were carried out across all police station jurisdictions. The enforcement aimed to curb material “that glorifies terrorism, vilifies security forces, or contributes to youth radicalisation,” a district statement read.

CPM opposed the ban and demanded its immediate revocation. Former CM and opposition PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said: “Democracy thrives on the free exchange of ideas. Banning books cannot erase history, it only fuels division.”Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called the ban an “exposure of insecurity and limited understanding” by those behind it. “The contradiction lies in hosting a literary festival while silencing dissenting literature,” he said.",Police seized five copies of “A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370” by Anuradha Bhasin.

Taylor Swift’s romance with Travis Kelce reignites debate over her past controversies and brand power

In 2020, Taylor Swift faced backlash after Black entrepreneur Amira Rasool accused her team of copying a design from her fashion brand for Folklore merchandise. As Swift's romance with NFL star Travis Kelce now amplifies her spotlight, past controversies are resurfacing, sparking renewed discussions about celebrity, ethics, and accountability.Back in July 2020, Taylor Swift found herself in the middle of a design controversy shortly after the release of her critically acclaimed album Folklore. A Black female entrepreneur, Amira Rasool, called out the pop star’s merchandise line for allegedly copying her brand’s logo style. Rasool, founder of The Folklore—a retailer focused on African designers—publicly criticized Swift’s team, stating, “I am not going to let this blatant theft go unchecked. ”Rasool’s accusation centered around the specific use of the phrase “the folklore album” on some of the merch. She claimed the typography and layout closely resembled her own brand’s identity, which had been in use well before the album dropped.Swift’s team, however, took a proactive and respectful stance. In a public statement, they clarified, “Yesterday, we were made aware of a complaint that the specific use of the word 'the' before 'folklore album' on some of the folklore album merchandise was of concern.Absolutely no merchandise using 'the' before the words 'folklore album' has been manufactured or sent out.” They went on to explain that in “good faith,” they honored Rasool’s request and alerted customers that their orders would feature a modified design.Rasool appreciated the response, tweeting, “I commend Taylor's team for recognizing the damage the merchandise caused to my company @TheFolklore's brand. I recognize that she has been a strong advocate for women protecting their creative rights, so it was good to see her team is on the same page.”Now, with Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce becoming pop culture gold, her reputation for navigating controversies with professionalism is again being praised.

Joe Alwyn wanted the world to stop obsessing over his past with Taylor Swift

As Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce dominate pop culture, Joe Alwyn remains out of the spotlight

Long before Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce became pop culture’s favorite power couple, she shared a six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn, a romance that ended quietly in 2023. But as Swift’s love life shifted, Alwyn’s rare comments in early 2025 reignited public curiosity over the breakup and its emotional aftermath.In a candid January 2025 interview with The Guardian, actor Joe Alwyn addressed his high-profile breakup with Taylor Swift and made it clear he’s long since turned the page. When asked about their 2023 split, Alwyn responded bluntly: “That’s something for other people to do. We’re talking about something that’s a while ago now in my life.”Despite fans still dissecting the end of their relationship, which inspired much of Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department album, Alwyn expressed disinterest in revisiting the past. “If you let all of that other stuff in… you’re living from the outside in. And then you’re pretty f*ed,” he told the outlet, adding that he leaned on “great family and friends and real things” to stay grounded.He emphasized his focus on personal and professional growth, not headlines. “Right from the beginning, I tried to focus on the things that are meaningful for me: friends, family, work.”Since Taylor Swift went public with NFL star Travis Kelce in late 2023, their relationship has drawn intense media attention.From public date nights to song lyrics nodding to Kelce, Swift seems to have embraced love in the limelight, a stark contrast to her ultra-private years with Alwyn.In a prior interview with The Sunday Times, Alwyn acknowledged the difficulty of ending a long, committed relationship under the scrutiny of the world. “What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that… it’s suddenly in the public domain,” he said, reflecting on the media frenzy surrounding their split.Also Read: “She has a larger impact on…”: NASA engineer reveals the power moves behind Taylor Swift's success and Travis Kelce’s role Now, while Swift dances into stadiums with Kelce by her side, Alwyn remains focused on his career and staying “in a good place.”","Actor Joe Alwyn addressed his 2023 breakup with Taylor Swift in a January 2025 interview with The Guardian.

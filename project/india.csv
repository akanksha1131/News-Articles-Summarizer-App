42 Muslims in batch of 50: J&K CM says Vaishno Devi college admissions are merit-based; BJP seeks changes — what’s the row?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/42-muslims-in-batch-of-50-jk-cm-says-vaishno-devi-college-admissions-are-merit-based-bjp-seeks-changes-whats-the-row/articleshow/125554717.cms,"What sparked the controversy?



'Seats should be for Mata Vaishno Devi devotees'



'Our constitution has the word secular'



NEW DELHI: Admissions into the newly established Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence in Jammu and Kashmir has sparked a political row after 42 Muslim students were selected in a batch of 50.The Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal protested, with the BJP demanding cancellation of admission list and questioning the merit of the students who got admission. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah called dismissed such accusations saying that the admissions were based on merit.The political row erupted after the medical college completed admissions through NEET’s merit list earlier this month. The college admitted students on NEET merit and allocated 85% of its seats to J&K residents. Eight Hindu students from Jammu were selected for the inaugural MBBS batch of 50.Following the completion of admissions, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal staged the initial protests, claiming that a college financed by the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should prioritise Hindu candidates.They further argued that, as the institution is supported by donations from Hindu devotees, it ought to advance Hindu interests.Officials maintained that admissions were merit-based since the institute lacked minority status and therefore could not apply any religion-based reservations.The Hindu outfit organisations demanded ""minority"" institution status for the medical college. Meanwhile, BJP demanded that the admissions should be given to those who have faith in ""Mata Vaishno Devi"", arguing that ""donations to the shrine board come from Hindus, for the welfare of Hindus.""“Donations to the shrine board come from Hindus, for the welfare of Hindus. We are upset with the board and the college because they did not consider this sentiment. We told the LG that only those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi should get admission. This year’s admission is not acceptable to people here. The rules should be changed,” said BJP’s Sunil Sharma, who lodged a protest with J&K LG Manoj Sinha.Criticising the outrage over the admissions, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said that the admissions were ""merit-based"" and those who wanted admissions otherwise should ""take permission from the Supreme Court"". He further questioned the BJP's demands saying that ""if you do not want to keep this country secular, remove that word"".“Some people do not seem to like merit-based admissions. If you want admissions without merit, take permission from the Supreme Court because as far as I know, you cannot give admission without merit,"" he said.“There is a demand that admissions be given on the basis of religion, by keeping merit aside, which is not permissible according to the Constitution. Will police perform their duty on the basis of religion,” the chief minister asked. “Our constitution has the word ‘secular’. If you do not want to keep this country secular, remove that word,"" he added.Regarding Sharma’s assertion that LG promised to review their demands to scrap the admission list and introduce reservations in the future, Abdullah said, “How can anyone assure such a thing? Then why are you separating the Mata Vaishno Devi University and the hospital? Then say that the hospital was set up from the donations received at the shrine, and that Muslims and non-Hindus won’t be allowed to get treatment there. ”",The political row erupted after the medical college completed admissions through NEET’s merit list.

Ash cloud from Ethiopia's volcano expected to reach North India by 10 pm (Photo - Sat: Meteosat-9)

Ethiopia’s ash cloud heads toward India

Here's the top 10 things to know:

DGCA issued an advisory on Monday asking airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions from the volcanic ash plume drifting from Ethiopia.

According to IndiaMetSky Weather the ash cloud entered Gujarat Monday evening before moving towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab. The service stated: ""Ash cloud is about to enter Gujarat (West side) and move towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by 10 pm, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.""

The plume is travelling 100–120 km/h at altitudes between 15,000 and 45,000 feet, carrying ash, sulphur dioxide and microscopic glass and rock particles.

Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM have cancelled flights, with routes to the Middle East and Europe particularly affected. Akasa Air said: ""Following recent volcanic activity in Ethiopia and the resulting ash plume in the surrounding airspace, our flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled for 24th and 25th November 2025 have been cancelled.""

DGCA instructed airlines to avoid ash-affected airspace, revise flight planning and immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine anomalies or cabin smoke/odour.

Airports have been told to inspect runways, taxiways and aprons and restrict operations until cleaning is completed if ash contamination is detected.

Mumbai airport warned passengers: ""A volcanic eruption in Ethiopia has affected airspace over parts of West Asia, which may impact some international routes.""

Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.

The explosive eruption, which began around 8:30 am UTC [1.30 pm IST] on Sunday, marks the first activity from the nearly 10,000-year-dormant volcano.

After the eruption, volcanic ash activity has been reported over parts of the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in airlines issuing cautionary notices for passengers flying through the Middle East, though no advisories have mentioned ash drift toward India.

NEW DELHI: Airline operations across parts of the country faced disruptions after volcanic ash from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi eruption drifted toward western and northern regions, prompting the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on MondayThe ash plume, travelling at high altitudes and significant speed, entered Gujarat and moved eastward through Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.With the cloud containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and fine glass particles, airlines have begun cancelling and diverting flights to avoid the dangerous plume.Airports have also been asked to remain vigilant and inspect surfaces for ash contamination that could affect aircraft engines and airfield operations.Multiple carriers, including IndiGo, Akasa Air, and KLM, have already modified schedules, while authorities continue monitoring the cloud’s trajectory. Disruptions are expected to evolve as the plume moves across northern India.IndiGo's Kannur-Abu Dhabi flight (6E 1433) diverted to Ahmedabad on Monday to avoid the affected corridor, while another Indian carrier operating into Abu Dhabi conducted extensive engine checks before beginning its return journey, reported news agency ANI.",The ash plume is expected to reach the Indian state of Rajasthan on Monday night. Airports have been told to be on alert for possible ash contamination. Airline flights to and from the Middle East have been cancelled.

Airline issue warnings



NEW DELHI: An ash cloud from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano hit parts of India Monday evening, according to IndiaMetSky Weather. The plumes first entered Gujarat from the west and then moved rapidly toward Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab by around 10 pm, and is drifting towards the Himalayas and other northern regions.Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.The ash plume is travelling at altitudes between 15,000-25,000 feet, rising up to 45,000 feet in some layers, and carries volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and tiny particles of glass and rock.IndiaMetSky Weather warned that skies could appear ""darker and hazier than usual"" and said that the plume may disrupt air traffic and lead to ""delays and longer travel.""The Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said the explosive eruption began around 8:30 am GMT on Sunday, marking the first activity from the almost 10,000-year-dormant Hayli Gubbi volcano.Thick columns of ash rose up to 14 kilometres into the sky from the Afar region, located around 800 km northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border.The VAAC confirmed that while the eruption had stopped, ""a large ash plume is moving toward northern India.""The volcano sits within the geologically active Rift Valley, where two tectonic plates meet. After erupting, the ash swept across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman before drifting eastwards into India and northern Pakistan, according to VAAC and regional media outlets.The windborne ash cloud swept across vast stretches of northwest India on Monday night, passing over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR and Punjab. Visibility dipped in several pockets as the plume drifted eastward.IndiaMetSky Weather said, ""Ash clouds moving towards North India. A large ash plume can be seen stretching from #HayliGubbi Volcano region upto #Gujarat. The eruption has stopped ever since the eruption, but this Ash plume has been sent up into the atmosphere, which is moving at a speed of 100-120km/h toward North India.”It added that the plume, containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and ""small particles of glass/rock,"" would likely darken the skies and impact flight routes. ""The Ash cloud is about to enter #Gujarat (West side) and move towards #Rajasthan NW #Maharashtra, #Delhi, #Haryana and #Punjab by 10 pm and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions,"" the agency said.By late night, the sulphur dioxide–rich plume was already moving over Delhi, NCR, Haryana and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh. IndiaMetSky Weather explained that although some pockets of ash could be seen over Rajasthan, chances of ashfall on the plains remained ""less.""Also read: 'Moving at a speed of 100-120km/h': Ethiopian volcanic ash drifts towards India — 10 things to know According to the meteorological service, the ash cloud’s altitude means that India’s surface-level AQI is not expected to deteriorate.It reiterated that the event was ""mostly safe"" and said it would ""not like to impact surface AQI levels as Ash clouds are in 25,000 to 45,000 feet above the surface.""The agency said the plume was stretching from the Oman–Arabian Sea region into northern and central India. ""Its will not impact AQI levels but it will impact So2 level at #Hills of #Nepal, #Himalayas and adjoining Terai belt of #UttarPradesh as some of the material will bump into the hills and later move into China,"" it posted on X.It clarified that the plume would drift over Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan, but the impact on the ground would be limited to darker skies and hazier conditions.While a few particles might fall to the surface, IndiaMetSky described the likelihood as ""low.”The agency also noted that residents might notice skies resembling a dust storm, though without harmful concentrations of particulate matter at ground level. People were advised to wear masks as a precaution, but officials stressed that the event was occurring at ""middle levels of the atmosphere.""Following the ash drift, airlines issued cautionary notices for flights operating through Middle Eastern airspace. In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) released an advisory on Monday instructing airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions.It directed carriers to avoid volcanic-ash-affected routes and adjust flight plans, routing and fuel loads based on the latest advisories. The DGCA also said airports must immediately inspect runways, taxiways and aprons if ash contamination is suspected and restrict operations until cleaning is completed.Several carriers, including Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM, cancelled flights on Monday. Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport also alerted passengers that volcanic activity in Ethiopia had affected West Asian airspace and may impact some international routes, advising travellers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport.","Ash cloud from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano hit parts of India Monday evening.

Delhi AQI today

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Police on Sunday detained 15 people protesting against Delhi’s worsening pollution at C Hexagon after they allegedly refused to disperse.A senior officer said the protesters used pepper spray on personnel, triggering a brief scuffle.Three to four policemen suffered irritation from the spray and were taken to hospital.Police said legal action will be taken against those involved.""Some of the protesters had entered the C-hexagon and attempted to cross the barricades put up to restrict movement. We tried to explain to them that many ambulances and medical personnel were stuck behind them and required emergency access, but they got very agitated,"" the senior officer said.The police personnel sensed the situation could escalate to a scuffle and advised the protesters to step back.""They refused, broke the barricade, came onto the road, and sat there. When our teams were trying to remove them, some of the protestors attacked police personnel using chilli spray. Three to four personnel sustained injuries and are undergoing treatment,"" the officer said.The protestors were subsequently removed from the C-hexagon to avoid traffic disruption.""This was very unusual. For the first time, protestors used chilli spray on officers managing traffic and law and order,"" deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Devesh Kumar Mahla told PTI.Earlier, on November 9, several people were also detained after they gathered at India Gate as part of a “clean air protest,” demanding urgent government action and strict policies to tackle what they called an “air emergency.”Some women even brought their children, holding nebulisers and medical prescriptions, to the site — symbolic reminders of the pollution crisis that has choked the city.Some took to social media, sharing visuals of people being herded into police buses. A post on X read: ""India Gate clean-air protest. We are being taken away, shoved into a bus"". A few protesters alleged that they were manhandled and some children also detained, but police denied both claims.In a press statement, the protesters demanded ""urgent, accountable and transparent action"" from Delhi govt to tackle the crisis. They called for the creation of an independent air regulator, real-time air quality data transparency, clear health advisories during pollution spikes and public accountability for funds to tackle pollution.Delhi woke up to dense smog on Monday, and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data indicates that the AQI has crossed the 400 mark in several areas, including Akshardham, ITO and Ghazipur, placing it in the ‘severe’ category.Water sprinklers were deployed as authorities attempted to tame the thick smog enveloping the area.Meanwhile on Sunday, Bawana recorded the highest AQI level of 435 at 7 am, falling under the 'severe' category. In contrast, NSIT Dwarka recorded the lowest AQI of 313, according to the data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A layer of toxic smog lingers in the air of Anand Vihar, as the Central Pollution Control Board reported that the Air Quality Index in the area is 429, categorised as 'very poor'.Chandani Chowk recorded an AQI of 390, RK Puram 397, ITO 384, Punjabi Bagh 411, Patparganj 401, Pusa 360, and Dwaraka Sector-8 386.","Police detained 15 people protesting against Delhi’s worsening pollution at C Hexagon after they allegedly refused to disperse.

NEW DELHI: In a major crackdown on synthetic drug trafficking, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Delhi Police’s special cell seized 329 kg of methamphetamine worth Rs 262 crore from a house in south Delhi’s Chattarpur on Nov 20. Two people were arrested.The joint exercise, codenamed Operation Crystal Fortress, was an intelligence-driven effort to dismantle a transnational drug network. Investigators believe the cartel is linked to a foreign-based kingpin who is also wanted in last year’s seizure of 83 kg cocaine in Delhi.Saying that the Centre “is shattering drug cartels at an unprecedented pace”, Union home minister Amit Shah called the operation “a brilliant example of seamless multi-agency coordination to achieve PM Modi’s vision for a drug-free India”.Officers in the know of things said that the breakthrough followed months of surveillance and technical intercepts that exposed a well-oiled cartel using multiple couriers, safe houses and layered handlers, with Delhi as a key hub for domestic and overseas distribution of drugs.One of the arrested suspects, Shane Waris (25), a resident of Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, was picked up from Noida’s Sector 5 on Nov 20. Employed as a sales manager in a company, Waris allegedly operated under instructions from his handler.He was directed to use fake SIM cards and encrypted apps, such as WhatsApp and Zangi, to discreetly run the operations.During interrogation, Waris admitted to his role in the syndicate and provided crucial leads to the investigators, including identifying a woman associate, Esther Kinimi from Nagaland, who recently managed one of the narcotic consignments transported through a rider of a logistics platform.Waris shared her address, contact numbers and other operational details with the investigators.Acting on Waris’ inputs, NCB personnel raided Kinimi’s Chattarpur Enclave Phase 2 residence the same day, recovering the massive consignment. She was arrested with assistance from Nagaland Police.Preliminary findings suggest that the syndicate was part of a larger cartel. “The investigation indicates Waris was actively involved in a synthetic drug trafficking syndicate functioning under foreign operators,” an officer said.Authorities are now working with international enforcement agencies to trace the kingpin and secure his deportation to India so that he could face legal proceedings.Further investigation is required to map the entire supply chain, financial trail, logistics nodes, and potential storage points, the officer said.This seizure is among the largest of methamphetamine in Delhi. The investigators said efforts are underway to dismantle the entire network and prevent its tentacles from spreading to overseas markets.","The joint exercise, codenamed Operation Crystal Fortress, was an intelligence- driven effort to dismantle a transnational drug network.

Almost 140 candidates from the economically weaker section (annual family income less than Rs 8 lakh) have chosen postgraduate seats in clinical specialties from management and NRI quotas of private medical colleges, for which tuition fees alone range from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore plus per year. This has raised questions about the credibility of EWS certificates.""They apply for PG NEET exam as EWS candidates and when their ranks turn out to be very low, they become NRIs and pay fees in crores or take management quota seats that can also cost more than Rs 1 crore for the entire course.

This had happened last year too and yet there was no inquiry by govt into the issue of candidates with fake EWS certificates who affect the chances of deserving candidates, added the doctor.An EWS candidate whose NEET rank was lower than 1.1 lakh has taken an NRI quota seat for MD in dermatology in Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Belagavi, where the annual tuition fees for NRIs are over a crore per annum for this specialty. Another EWS candidate with a rank below 84,000 has opted for an NRI quota seat for MD in general medicine in Vinayaka Missions Medical College in Puducherry, for which the tuition fee is over Rs 55 lakh per year.Three EWS candidate have opted for postgraduate seats in Santosh Medical College in specialties such as radio diagnosis (Rs 76 lakh per year), general medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology, which cost Rs 50 lakh per year. Out of 16 management quota seats for postgraduation in general medicine in Dr DY Patil Medical College in Navi Mumbai, four have been taken by EWS candidates.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.

'Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy': Op Sindoor Echoes As Indian Army Vows Stronger Response to Pak

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DLEHI: The French Navy on Sunday criticised Pakistani media for publishing what it described as “misinformation and disinformation” about India’s Operation Sindoor , after one outlet claimed a French officer had confirmed Pakistani air superiority and the shooting down of Indian Rafale jets during a border confrontation earlier this year in May.In a statement issued on its official X handle, the ‘Marine Nationale’ said the article had fabricated comments and even misidentified the officer involved.“FAKENEWS: These statements were attributed to Captain Launay who never gave his consent for any form of publication. The article contains extensive misinformation and disinformation,” the post said. Pakistan based broadcaster Geo TV’s November 21 report had quoted a “Jacques Launay” as allegedly praising the Pakistan air force during a supposed May 6–7 aerial engagement involving over 140 fighters, and claiming Indian Rafales were downed with Chinese support. The French Navy said the officer’s real name is Captain Yvan Launay - and none of the comments attributed to him were genuine.Clarifying his actual role, the Navy said: “First name is Yvan, not Jacquis. Contrary to what has been established in the article, his responsibilities are limited to commanding the organic naval air station where the French Rafale Marine aircraft are stationed.”According to the statement, Captain Launay’s presentation at the Indo-Pacific conference was strictly technical.“Captain Yvan Launay presented the assets of his naval air base, the missions of the Rafale fighter jet, and the French carrier strike group concept,” it said.Responding to questions at the event, Launay “neither confirmed nor denied that Indian aircrafts had been shot down” during Operation Sindoor and “refused to comment on possible jamming of the Indian Rafale by Chinese systems.” The Navy added that “he never mentioned the Chinese J10.”These clarifications directly contradicted another claim published by the Pakistani outlet, which had said Launay linked alleged Rafale performance issues to operational shortcomings and compared the jet with the Chinese J-10C. The Navy reiterated that such references were never made.The BJP spokesperson and its IT cell chief Amit Malviya reacting to the post by French navy called out the Geo TV's report as ""same old, fabricated claims."" He also took a dig at the journalist behind it Hamid Mir.In a post on X he said, ""The French Navy has called out Pakistan’s Geo TV and its correspondent Hamid Mir for spreading “misinformation and disinformation.” In his report, Hamid Mir peddled the same old, fabricated claims about Rafales and the so-called May conflict and has now been publicly exposed. When official institutions start debunking their propaganda, you know how desperate Pakistan’s misinformation machinery has become. Incidentally Hamid Mir has several friends in Indian media. Spot them.""France’s rebuttal comes days after a US report by US-China Economic and Review Commission exposed how in aftermath of Operation Sindoor, China initiated a “disinformation campaign” to “hinder the sales of French Rafale aircraft in favour of its own J-35s, using fake social media accounts to propagate AI images of supposed debris from the planes that China’s weapon destroyed.”The Operation Sindoor was launched in response to the dastardly Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir on April 22 earlier this year, in which 26 civilians were killed - the incident later prompted Indian response targeting Pakistan-sponsored terrorist sites.",French navy slams Pakistan's misinformation campaign about India's Operation Sindoor.

"Sandesaras to pay Rs 5.1 k crore, SC drops bank fraud case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sandesaras-to-pay-rs-5-1kcrore-sc-drops-bank-fraud-case/articleshow/125552508.cms,"Representative image

Trial futile as public money is returning to banks: SC

NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind order to drop criminal proceedings in a multi-crore bank fraud case after the accused agreed to pay back the money, Supreme Court allowed fugitive Sandesara brothers - Nitin and Chetan of Sterling Biotech Ltd - and their associates to be let off after the Centre and Enforcement Directorate agreed to their proposal to pay Rs 5,100 crore as one-time settlement (OTS) to put quietus on the litigations with respect to cases by CBI, ED, SFIO and income tax department.The siblings have till Dec 17 to deposit the amount.Though the bench said its order should not be treated as a precedent, some in govt think it might have implications for cases involving fugitives such as Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya who can seek similar relief.A bench of Justices JK Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi in its November 19 judgment said continuation of criminal proceedings would not serve any useful purpose, considering that public money is coming back to lender banks.Centre, after consulting various agencies, which were pursuing cases against the Sandesaras, gave the figure of Rs 5,100 crore as OTS and the assurance that it will have no objection to quashing of criminal proceedings against the accused. ""In view of the foregoing, subject to deposit of Rs 5,100 crore as indicated towards full and final settlement with the lender banks and investigating agencies, these petitions deserve to be allowed granting the following reliefs - writ petitions filed by the petitioners are allowed directing quashing of proceedings...The quashing would be operative on deposit of Rs 5,100 crore as a full and final payment based on consensus, on or before Dec 17, 2025,"" the order said.""The litigation with respect to the loan amount of the petitioners for which FIR was registered and OTS was sanctioned and approved, shall be put to an end by way of full and final settlement as per consensus and this litigation shall be put to quietus. These directions as issued are in peculiar facts of this case, therefore, they shall not be treated as precedent,"" the order said. SC directed its registry to disburse the amount to the respective lender banks on proportionate basis.The willingness of Sandesara brothers also marks a success of agencies in choking their funds and leaving them with few options than to negotiate. Besides them, Chetan's wife Dipti and family member Hitesh Patel were also declared Fugitive Economic Offenders in Sept 2020. The four, including the Sandesara brothers, had pending non-bailable warrants against them and have been forced to move from country to country, including Nigeria, the UAE, the UK and the US to escape arrest since 2017, according to ED.Late Congress neta Ahmed Patel, political adviser to Sonia Gandhi, was among the dozens who were investigated for their alleged dealings with the Sandesaras. ED had attached more than Rs 14,500 crore of assets in this case, which included Rs 4,700 crore in India and over Rs 9,778 crore overseas, including oil rigs, ships, aircraft and properties in the US, the UK and other countries, an action that brought the Sandesaras under pressure.Govt's acceptance of the Sandesaras's offer is also for the fact that a large part of the attached assets are in foreign jurisdictions and were difficult to realise because most were paper attachments, and foreign countries were not cooperating with ED orders, sources said.They also said the Sandesaras owed over Rs 14,000 crore, including interest and penalties to banks, and banks have recovered almost Rs 3,500 crore through deposits by the fugitive siblings and by selling off properties worth Rs 1,100 crore through insolvency. After OTS, banks will have recovered Rs 8,600 crore - a good amount, considering that they very often take haircuts of up to 80% during insolvency proceedings.The bench noted that proceedings in the case from inception were focused on bringing back public money as the accused had agreed to pay back the amount.","Supreme Court allowed fugitive Sandesara brothers to be let off. Centre and Enforcement Directorate agreed to their proposal to pay Rs 5,100 crore as one- time settlement. The siblings have till Dec 17 to deposit the amount.

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Arshad Madani's remarks alleging discrimination against Muslims while citing the example of Al-Falah University, which is under the scanner in the Delhi blast probe, have triggered a storm. Accusing the govt of working relentlessly to ensure that Muslims don't progress, Madani claimed that while Zohran Mamdani and Sadiq Khan could become the mayors of New York and London, respectively, Muslims in India cannot even become vice chancellors of universities.""And even if someone does, they will be sent to jail, like Azam Khan. Look at what is happening today with Al-Falah. He (the founder) is in jail, and how many years he will spend in jail, no one knows,"" Madani, chief of one of the two JUH factions, said, speaking at a session at Jamiat headquarters in Delhi Saturday.The founder of Al-Falah University, Jawed Siddiqui, is in custody of the Enforcement Directorate. Besides the current probe, it is alleged that Siddiqui was held in Delhi in an earlier case following a complaint of cheating and spent over two years in Tihar jail. He came out on bail in Feb 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by court the next year, after he and his brother agreed to make repayments.Madani said, ""The govt, since the time India got freedom, has been working on preventing Muslims from raising their heads.It is the result of this that today you hear people saying that there is a lack of leadership among Muslims."" Citing a Hindi idiom, he said the govt wants the Muslims ""to feel the ground slipping under their feet"", and ""it is happening...""BJP netas hit back on Sunday over Madani's remarks. Party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told PTI, ""In the name of vote bank, the 'bhaijann of appeasement' and the 'aatanki bachao jamaat (save terrorists group)' has become active."" He added, ""Arshad Madani ji, leave aside this talk of mayor; this country has seen Muslims becoming president, vice president, chief justice, home minister. The biggest artists and businessmen have also come from the Muslim community.

Former MP Sandeep Dikshit said, ""This govt has launched a very systematic campaign against a particular religion."" At the same time, he made it clear that Madani's linking the issue to Al-Falah is not right.

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said. He added that the location was selected as it allowed simulation of riverine obstacles similar to those found in Punjab. ""We conduct exercises in operational areas under other commands too to ensure readiness,"" he said.A senior Army officer involved in the exercise told TOI, requesting anonymity, that the drill tested operational agility, multi-domain capabilities and real-time coordination across land, air and cyber domains.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retired), former deputy director general of military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI the drill was vital to test preparedness for the Punjab sector.""Pakistan has constructed numerous canals in Punjab to act as barriers against our armoured and mechanised units. Exercises simulating such conditions enhance operational efficiency because ultimate victory comes under the boots of infantry on enemy land,"" said Lt Gen Bhandari (retired)who conducted similar drills during his time in Western Command.","The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday said that the ""pollution of Marx and Mao"" is denser in the brains of the agitators after slogans condemning Naxal commander Hidma's encounter were raised during a protest over rising air pollution levels in Delhi.During a press conference, BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the ""real face"" of protestors was out soon as they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander.""Some people reached India Gate with a mask on their faces that they are there to protest against the pollution. The masks were off as soon as they reached there, and the real face was out, and they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander,"" the BJP leader said.He also latched on the incident to target Congress and claimed that the party ""dreams"" of coming to power with the support of the extremists.""The PM has said that the Congress has become the Muslim League-Maoist. More than the air pollution, the pollution of Marx and Mao is denser in their brains. Along with that, they dream of coming to power with the support of extremist 'Kathmullas'.

But the protesters were holding posters of Maoist commander Madvi Hidma.

Security forces had said the group initiated firing during a cordon-and-search operation, sparking an extended encounter.Meanwhile, Delhi Police also arrested 15 activist on charges of obstructing its personnel and assaulting them, besides blocking the road during the protest.Patiala House Court remanded 5 accused in 2 days' judicial custody. The court has asked the police to file a copy of the videos in the court.Additionally, the court asked to send one accused to a safe house till his age is verified, as he has claimed to be a minor.The situation at the protest escalated as some demonstrators allegedly used pepper spray on police personnel while being removed from the scene, the official said.""The situation then turned into a scuffle, and some protesters used pepper spray on our personnel, which is unusual and rare,"" the officer said, adding that so far, police have arrested at least 15 protesters.When asked about slogans allegedly raised in support of Maoist leader Madvi Hidma, the officer said they are probing the matter from all angles.The Delhi Coordination Committee for Clean Air, in a statement, said the city's worsening air quality has become a ""serious risk"" to public health and alleged that authorities have failed to address the root causes of pollution.It further alleged that air quality has remained in the ""severe"" category, while the government relies on ""cosmetic measures"" such as water sprinklers, cloud seeding and spraying near Air Quality Index (AQI) stations instead of finding long-term solutions to tackle the issue.Meanwhile, Scientists for Society (SFS), one of the organisations that participated in Sunday's ""Delhi Against Clean Air"" protest here, has distanced itself from certain groups that allegedly raised slogans unrelated to the protest’s central theme of air pollution.In a statement issued on Monday, the SFS said it had joined the protest “solely on the issue of pollution” and emphasised that the primary objective of the demonstration was to highlight Delhi's severe air quality crisis, educate citizens, and question what they described as the government's “failure and unwillingness” to act.","BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the ""real face"" of protestors was out soon as they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander.

'We Fly For You': Russian Fighter Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

SHIMLA: Wing Commander Namansh Syal, who perished in the Tejas crash at Dubai Air Show on Friday, was a high flyer all his life - house captain in Sainik School, Academy Cadet Adjutant (ACC) at National Defence Academy (NDA), and an instructor with Indian Air Force (IAF), training the next generation of combat pilots.The air warrior will be cremated at his ancestral village, Patialkar, in Kangra district's Nagrota Bagwan tehsil, on Sunday, his father Naib Subedar Jagan Nath (retd), an Army Medical Corps veteran, told TOI. In a tragic twist, the 71-year-old said he was searching for videos of his son's aerial acrobatics at the air show when news reports of the crash popped up. Speaking to TOI over phone from Sulur, the grief-stricken father said, ""Then, officers from my son's squadron arrived to convey the tragic news. ""When the family got the news, Namansh's wife, Wing Commander Afshan, was in Kolkata on a training course. Their six-year-old daughter was with her grandparents in Sulur, where Namansh was serving with No. 3 Squadron.The high-achiever was an inspiration for hundreds not only in his hometown but also his alma mater, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira in Hamirpur district, and NDA. The school held a remembrance meet Saturday.He was part of the school's 21st batch, passing out in 2005. Group Captain Rachna Joshi, the school's principal, said: ""Teachers here tell me he was exceptionally well in academics. Joining the school in Class IX and becoming the captain of Chenab House speaks volumes about him. He will continue to remain in our hearts forever as a braveheart,"" said the principal. His 'home' at NDA - Hunter Squadron - also held a remembrance meet.After his Class XII, Namansh enrolled in National Institute of Technology , Hamirpur, but his heart was set on NDA. After his first semester, he cleared SSB and joined NDA 115th course in 2006. He was appointed academic cadet captain, and commanded NDA's passing-out parade in Nov 2008, earning the President's Silver Medal in overall merit. Commissioned as a fighter pilot in Dec 2009, he flew MiG-21 and Su-30MKI before getting into Tejas at Sulur AFS in Coimbatore.

Justice Surya Kant , the 53rd CJI , will have a tenure of nearly one year and three months. He spoke to Dhananjay Mahapatra shortly after taking oath

Hailing from a family of agriculturists, what encouraged you to choose law as a profession?

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Did you ever dream of becoming CJI?

In a hierarchical seniority-cum-merit-based system, is becoming CJI more dependent on luck and timing rather than merit, ability and suitability?

Your priorities as CJI, the first from Haryana?

Have PILs served the purpose for which they were invented by SC, or are they increasingly becoming tools to malign, political vendetta and corner the establishment?

Does distorted projection of court proceedings in social media impede the justice delivery process?

Growing up tilling the family fields in Petwar taught me patience in the most practical way. Every farmer knows growth can't be rushed, it needs time, care and resilience. This lesson early in my life shaped my approach towards law, to handle every case steadily and thoughtfully, listen intently, weigh evidence and let the process run its course. Justice, like harvest, can't be forced. It has to be nurtured with consistency and respect for due process.My decision to study law came from a genuine love for debate and a curiosity about social issues. But choosing law was still a leap of faith. It is a demanding profession that asks for long-term commitment and ability to adapt. Choosing law meant taking responsibility for shaping my own journey in a field that is challenging and deeply rewarding.Every person who enrols as an advocate, dreams of making a difference. I was no different. As a young lawyer, I wanted to have a meaningful career. The dream of heading the judiciary never crossed the mind as long as I was an advocate. I didn't plan my career. From being a govt pleader to becoming the advocate general of Haryana to becoming an HC judge, all happened organically.One thing remained common with me, both as advocate and a constitutional court judge - I am immensely passionate about the law and court craft.I got good guidance from my seniors and able assistance from my juniors, who are the real architects of my career in law.Journey to chief justiceship is a long and winding one built on years of hard work, integrity and the ability to decide cases with fairness and balance. No one arrives in SC (as a judge) suddenly or by accident. It comes after decades of judging difficult cases, carrying institutional responsibilities, consistently exhibiting fairness in letter and spirit, clarity of thought, and restraint.A judge's demeanour and conduct in the courtroom, ability to inspire confidence among colleagues and an unwavering commitment to institutional values form the core of what ultimately determines suitability of leadership. But, yes, timing and circumstances may play a small role in the sequence of appointments. But this can never replace merit, credibility and character. Every judge entrusted with the CJI post puts in a lifetime's labour.The CJI post is not a reward of chance or luck. It is an outcome of sustained excellence, measured ability and a reputation for balance and integrity built over entire judicial life. The CJI post casts an additional duty to strive to improve, perform at your best and remain genuinely committed to constitutional fidelity.It is, of course, a moment of personal pride to be the first from Haryana to become CJI. But once one takes oath, he does not belong to any particular state, he belongs to the entire country. My duty is to every litigant, from every corner of India, to keep intact his hope and trust in the judiciary.My priorities are clear and pressing. We must bring down the backlog in a steady and meaningful way, not through short-term measures, but through structural improvements in case management. Speedy justice must not be at the cost of fairness, but delay must not frustrate justice. It is important that justice reaches the marginalised, poor, voiceless and the invisible victims of the system who often do not have the wherewithal to knock at the doors of temples of justice. By making the system more accessible, humane and responsive to them, we strengthen its very purpose and honour the cardinal constitutional goals.PIL has been one of the most significant judicial innovations in our constitutional history, essentially to advance and protect the rights of the poor and voiceless and those who do not have access to justice. The guarantees under Article 32 of the Constitution cannot be diluted as the reliefs given by constitutional courts through PILs are always to achieve the larger objective of protecting the rights of those who do not have access to justice.At the same time, SC judges are conscious of jurisdictional limitations, and in some cases, are cognisant that there has been flagrant misuse of such petitions which bypass HCs. We have repeatedly emphasised that such petitioners must approach HCs which have wide power under Article 226. HCs are well attuned to the jurisdictional demographic needs. Asking such petitioners to move HC is to ensure that the tiered judicial structure functions effectively.By and large, judges remain detached from social media, and that is a blessing. We simply do not have time, nor the inclination, to take to heart what is said or circulated about us outside the courtroom.About two decades ago, judges functioned almost entirely outside the public view. But in today's digital age, every utterance, every exchange in the courtroom, is instantly broadcast, often without context or accuracy. A stray sentence is clipped, shared and misconstrued within minutes, sometimes creating a wholly misleading impression. This has happened several times over the past year itself.That said, while the present environment naturally makes us more cautious in expression, it cannot and must not deter us from asking probing questions necessary for justice. We may weigh our words carefully today, but we cannot allow fear of distortion or dilute the pursuit of truth. Ultimately, justice delivered in accordance with law is the only measure that matters.",Justice Surya Kant is the 53rd CJI of India. He took oath at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Monday.

SC to hear plea to end income tax exemption for political parties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-hear-plea-to-end-income-tax-exemption-for-political-parties/articleshow/125550275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday agreed to hear a plea to do away with the exemption granted to political parties under Income Tax law and to restrain the parties from receiving donations in cash.The court sought responses from Centre and Election Commission on the plea which challenged the validity of a provision of the Income Tax Act that allows political parties to receive ""anonymous"" cash donations below Rs 2,000.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta also issued notice to all recognised political parties and sought their response on the PIL.According to section 13A, the income of a political party from the following sources is exempt from tax: income from house property, income from other sources, capital gains and income by way of voluntary contributions the party receives from any individual.The petition, filed through advocate Jayesh K Unnikrishnan, said that clause (d) of section 13A of Income Tax Act is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, and political parties must disclose the names and all other particulars of persons donating any sum of money and no amount must be received in cash so as to maintain transparency in political funding.""The clause allows political parties to receive anonymous cash donations below Rs 2,000.This lack of transparency deprives voters of crucial knowledge about the source of political funding, including the donors and their motives, preventing them from making a rational, intelligent and fully informed decision when casting their vote. Ultimately, this undermines the purity of the election process and compromises the integrity and accountability of a healthy democracy by allowing the potential influence of undisclosed or tainted money,"" the petition said.It said political parties are central entities in a democratic form of govt, and they must function in a transparent manner, with there being special reason for financial transparency to avoid unlawful influences of money power in the policymaking of the political party in govt. Receipt of huge amounts by political parties through purported donations from undisclosed sources is a breach of the public trust doctrine, it said.The bench was initially reluctant to entertain the PIL and suggested that the petitioner move the high court but agreed to examine it after senior advocate Vijay Hansaria stressed that the issue had pan-India implications and involved all recognised political parties.","Supreme Court agrees to hear a plea to do away with the exemption granted to political parties under Income Tax law.

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said on Monday that right to freedom of speech and expression ""is doubtless one of our most valued rights"" requiring further strengthening but emphasised the need for a framework that ""ensures responsibility, accuracy and respect in public discourses"".Speaking to TOI after taking oath as the 53rd CJI, the first from Haryana, Justice Kant said, ""It is not freedom of speech that causes harm to the dignity or reputation, it is the misuse of that freedom and the inefficiency of our remedies that causes it.""Importantly, his predecessor, ex-CJI B R Gavai also shared the view. ""Right to free speech is always subject to reasonable restrictions specified in the Constitution. If a person's speech is in violation of those reasonable restrictions, it falls foul of the fundamental right,"" Gavai said.Asked whether the existing mechanism provides for adequate remedies against abusive or hate speeches, the outgoing CJI said, ""I feel there should be a regulatory mechanism that needs to be put in place regarding this. It is for Parliament to take a decision on this issue.""CJI Kant said the right to free speech comes with an equally important obligation - exercise in a manner that aligns with a citizen's fundamental duties.""The Constitution envisions not just a free society, but a respectful and harmonious one. When we forget that duties are intrinsic to rights, we distort the balance that keeps democracy functional and we risk making the Constitution unworkable,"" he said.To a question whether distortions in social media through selective reporting is a deterrence for judges from posing probing questions or criticising actions of litigants, CJI Kant said such incidents, which have proliferated in the past few years, ""makes us more cautious in expression, but it must not deter us from asking probing questions necessary for delivering justice"". On Saturday, he had told the media that he does not get pressured by social media.Asked whether the rich, influential and powerful, represented by renowned senior advocates, get more time from Supreme Court compared to common litigants, the CJI said, ""The guiding principle of all courts in the country, including SC, is that the justice system must be equal for all regardless of status, profession, or representation.""""Cases are taken up based on objective criteria such as urgency, nature of rights involved and the stage of proceedings. Individual stature or resources cannot, do not, and shall never determine priority or even time allotted to such cases,"" he said.He said it is a myth that senior and renowned advocates get a better audience in courts. ""Every judge reads the petition and pleadings in each case prior to commencing adjudication in the courtroom. If a matter requires more time due to its complexity, that consideration applies to the case, not for the counsel representing the litigant. In my courtroom, many will attest that I regularly encourage junior advocates to argue their cases, irrespective of whether or not their seniors are present,"" he said.","Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said on Monday that right to freedom of speech and expression ""is doubtless one of our most valued rights"" He emphasised the need for a framework that ""ensures responsibility, accuracy and respect in public discourses"" The 53rd CJI is the first from Haryana.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125551471,imgsize-1005130,width-400,resizemode-4/article-43.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday sought the investigation status report from NIA which was tasked to investigate alleged extra-judicial killings of 10 Kuki-Zo tribal youth in Nov last year, a year and half after ethnic strife engulfed the state, allegedly by CRPF in Jiribam district.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and A S Chandurkar refused to act on the plea for five Kuki-Zo community members seeking a court monitored SIT to inquire into the more than one year incident saying already one of the best agencies in NIA is seized of the investigation.However, the bench agreed with the petitioner and sought a probe status report from NIA regarding the progress made in the investigation so far. The petitioners said they cannot approach Manipur HC ""because they belong to the minority community who are at loggerheads with the majority community, and as such, the HC being in Imphal city, they are not in a position to go there physically because of constant threats to life and property"".According to the petitioners, the incident took place when the ten men belonging to Hmar tribe of Kuki-Zo community, claiming to be relief volunteers from Churachandpur, went inside CRPF premises at Borobekra police station in Jiribam district for talks regarding security of villages in the area as a day before their villages were attacked.""It is learnt that as the ten were leaving from the compound, a Manipur police commando in the compound opened fire on them...

Invoking criminal law when ties sour a disturbing trend: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invoking-criminal-law-when-ties-sour-a-disturbing-trend-sc/articleshow/125550466.cms,"NEW DELHI: That criminal law is often being invoked when a consensual relationship between adults goes sour is a matter of profound concern, Supreme Court remarked Monday, quashing criminal proceedings against a lawyer against whom a rape complaint was filed by his client. The woman had alleged that she got into a physical relationship with her lawyer after he promised to marry her, only to back out later. Interestingly, the lawyer was representing the woman in divorce proceedings when the two got into a relationship.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said it is not a case where a person was lured solely for physical gratification and then dumped, given that the relationship continued for three years during which the two remained close and emotionally involved. ""In such cases, physical intimacy that occurred during the course of a functioning relationship cannot be retrospectively branded as an instance of offence of rape merely because the relationship failed to culminate in marriage,"" the court said.""This court has, on numerous occasions, taken note of the disquieting tendency wherein failed or broken relationships are given the colour of criminality. The offence of rape, being of the gravest kind, must be invoked only in cases where there exists genuine sexual violence, coercion or absence of free consent.To convert every sour relationship into an offence of rape not only trivialises the seriousness of the offence but also inflicts upon the accused indelible stigma and grave injustice. Such instances transcend the realm of mere personal discord. The misuse of the criminal justice machinery in this regard is a matter of profound concern and calls for condemnation,"" it said.At the same time, it accepted the institution of marriage holds deep social and cultural significance, and it is therefore not uncommon for a woman to repose complete faith in her partner and consent to physical intimacy on the assurance the relationship would culminate in a lawful and socially recognised marriage.""'In such circumstances, the promise of marriage becomes the very foundation of her consent, rendering it conditional rather than absolute. It is, thus, conceivable that such consent may stand vitiated where it is established that the promise of marriage was illusory, made in bad faith, and with no genuine intention of fulfilment, solely to exploit the woman. The law must remain sensitive to such genuine cases where trust has been breached and dignity violated, lest the protective scope of IPC section 376 be reduced to a mere formality for those truly aggrieved. At the same time, the invocation of this principle must rest upon credible evidence..."" it said.","A woman had alleged that she got into a physical relationship with her lawyer after he promised to marry her, only to back out later.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday slammed comments by functionaries of governing parties in West Bengal and Jharkhand targeting the special intensive review of electoral rolls, as it accused INDIA bloc of being the biggest roadblock in ensuring a free, fair and transparent polling process.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi also played the angry comments of West Bengal CM and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee in Lok Sabha in 2005 against the presence of suspected infiltrators from Bangladesh in the state, which was then governed by the Left, and her demand that voters must have a proven citizenship.She raised the issue of infiltrators 14 times in 22 minutes and then threw a file towards the Speaker after a discussion was not allowed, he said, and referred to her current stand against SIR to prod the Bengal CM for the reason behind her about-turn on the subject.Trivedi referred to reports of suspected infiltrators in the state crossing over to Bangladesh to escape action by authorities to note that infiltration into India used to make news earlier. Under Modi govt, infiltration had come to a stop, he said, adding that an Assam governor had once stated that over 5,000 people were illegally crossing over into the country daily.In a swipe at Trinamool and Congress, Trivedi said he understood why people with suspected citizenship are scared and leaving, but he could not fathom the fear in these two parties.This, he suggested, is because of their dependence on the votes of infiltrators.Jharkhand minister and Congress neta Irfan Ansari, he said, had asked people to lock up booth-level officers if they seek to delete their names from the voters' list in the absence of documents. A TMC functionary, he added, had threatened a BLO. ""These parties appear to support the ongoing conspiracy to grab power with the help of infiltrators and to disrupt the constitutional process,"" the BJP MP said, noting that former Union minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, a Congress MP, had said in 2004 in Parliament that over 2 crore Bangladeshis were staying illegally in India.","BJP slammed comments by functionaries of governing parties in West Bengal and Jharkhand.

NEW DELHI: An Indian was detained for nearly 18 hours by Chinese immigration authorities at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport on Nov 21, after officials allegedly refused to recognise her Indian passport because her birthplace was listed as Arunachal Pradesh.Pema Wang Thongdok, who was travelling from London to Japan with a transit stop in Shanghai, stated that immigration officers declared her passport ""invalid"", insisting that Arunachal Pradesh was ""part of China"" and therefore could not appear as a birthplace on an Indian document.In a series of posts on X, Thongdok said officials seized her passport, blocked her from boarding her onward flight despite holding a valid Japanese visa, denied her access to food and other basic facilities, and repeatedly mocked her, telling her she should apply for a Chinese passport. She alleged China Eastern Airlines staff also forced her to buy a fresh ticket before returning her passport. Thongdok said she contacted the Indian consulate in Shanghai through a friend in the UK, and consular intervention eventually allowed her to exit the airport late that night and continue her journey.Calling the incident a direct affront to India's sovereignty, she urged that protections be put in place for citizens from Arunachal.India lodged a strong protest with China both here and in Beijing, saying that at a time when both sides were working on restoring normalcy in ties, such actions introduced unnecessary obstructions to the process.The Indian consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally. ""It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports,"" said a source.Govt sources also said that the actions of the Chinese authorities were in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation that establish basic rules for international air travel.In a social media post, Congress wrote: ""This kind of treatment cannot be tolerated with any Indian. The Modi govt should lodge a strong objection with China on this matter. Modi ji, this is the right time to show China your 'red eyes' and respond.""Earlier this year, China released a list of names for 27 places in Arunachal.

"India-EU summit: FTA, defence and connectivity among key outcomes, EU seeks Paris commitment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eu-summit-fta-defence-and-connectivity-among-key-outcomes-eu-seeks-paris-commitment/articleshow/125548280.cms,"'Some Last-Mile Issues...': Piyush Goyal Remarks On Trade Pact With EU And US, India's Export Growth

Feeling the heat from an unpredictable Trump administration, EU and India have lined up ambitious outcomes for the summit in late January that the 27-nation bloc believes will help set not just bilateral but also global agenda. These include not just the free trade agreement (FTA) under discussion but also a defence and security partnership and a determined effort to accelerate the IMEC connectivity project.These are expected to be among the key takeaways from a joint statement that will follow the summit. Both sides have not allowed the lack of a geopolitical alignment, most noticeably on Russia, to come in the way of trade negotiations in a sign of the political will at the highest level to carry the relationship to the next level.While a dozen chapters are yet to be closed, India and EU are confident they will be able to reach a deal in time for the summit that is tentatively scheduled for January 27. However, both sides need to address differences over critical issues related to steel, cars and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a carbon tax on certain goods. These 3 issues remain major sticking points in the FTA talks.If the summit does materialise on the same day, EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, will likely also be the chief guests at India’s Republic Day parade a day earlier.India has invited both to attend the annual celebrations. Before that summit though, the EU will observe with interest the outcomes of another summit that PM Narendra Modi will have with Russian President Vladimir Putin in December.Another contentious issue is the Paris Agreement, the international treaty for climate action, that both sides have joined but EU wants the same commitment as an essential element in the agreement. India, however, sees it as a sovereignty issue that should not be mixed with trade. Political intervention at the highest level will likely be required to break this deadlock.The FTA of course tops the list of expected deliverables from the planned January summit. Keeping in mind that both sides are at different stages of development and have different sensitivities, diplomatic sources said, the EU is looking for a balanced, commercially meaningful and living FTA agreement that will evolve over time, allowing both sides to engage on any difficult issue in the future.According to the EU, the economic case for an FTA with India, which can facilitate reliable trade relations along with stable and integrated supply chains, had always been there but it has now been reinforced by the geopolitical situation. The FTA will be tailored specifically to meet the needs of both sides and the EU, accepting an asymmetry in favour of India, is ready to liberalise five percentage points more trade than India does.While only 12 chapters have been closed so far, and a lot of difficult technical and political work is still required, the EU believes that’s not really a good indicator of progress in talks as 90-98 percent of work on most remaining chapters or issues, including agricultural and non-agricultural market access, has been completed. India and EU need to address each other’s concerns related to steel and cars respectively for a relevant agreement though. While the Indian government seeks greater clarity about its steel exports, the EU wants decent market access for its car sector for the agreement to be commercially meaningful.Carbon import tax levied by EU remains a contentious issue amidst reports that it could even act as a deal-breaker. According to the EU, both sides have their own internal laws and one can’t negotiate amendments to these through an FTA. Any politician doing that would be dead-on-arrival back home, said a source on condition of anonymity. However, both sides are looking at whether they can use a “living FTA” as a platform to facilitate the navigation of each other’s regulatory environment.Fortunately for the FTA, India’s purchase of Russian oil is not an issue in the ongoing talks. Creation of an EU-India Security and Defence Partnership that would also facilitate defence industrial collaboration, without discounting technology leakage threat, is expected to be a significant deliverable. Progress is also expected in efforts by the EU to advance, in the IMEC framework, the EU-Africa-India Digital Corridor through a submarine cable system connecting Europe to India via the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. This EU initiative, as the new strategic agenda says, will provide ultra- high-speed, secure, and diversified data connectivity resilient to disruptions caused by natural disasters or acts of sabotage.","EU and India have lined up ambitious outcomes for the summit in late January.

SRINAGAR: Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council–Kargil chairman Dr Muhammad Jaffar Akhoon alleged Monday that LG Kavinder Gupta is sidelining the district in development planning and demanded a white paper on all works undertaken in Ladakh since its 2019 transition to Union territory status after Article 370’s abrogation. It marks a rare public charge by an elected body in Ladakh against the LG.Akhoon said Kargil’s health infrastructure has faced “systemic neglect” for decades. “We were sanctioned a 100-bed hospital in 1979. Since then, we have been running it as a 200-bed hospital with staff strength of a 100-bed facility,” he said, adding the district has sought an AIIMS for years without progress. Winter deployment of civilians and the armed forces pushes the hospital to capacity, he said, adding Kargil needs a full-fledged 300-bed facility capable of handling a high load of emergencies, including cardiac cases.He contrasted this with Leh, which has been sanctioned a medical college set to begin MBBS admissions next year and already has a 300-bed hospital alongside a major Army-run medical facility. He said Kargil lacks an airport, forcing civilians and Army personnel to travel through Srinagar or Leh for flights. While Leh remains connected by several daily services, Kargil is cut off through winter.Akhoon said he recently met Gupta, who allegedly agreed Kargil has faced discrimination “but it doesn’t reflect anywhere”.He added: “The LG is LG of the entire UT of Ladakh. He should treat every region equally.” Gupta was not available for comments.LAHDC-Kargil is currently the only elected body functioning in Ladakh. LAHDC-Leh completed its five-year term on Oct 30, but govt has yet to announce new polls. Panchayat elections have also been pending for several years.The Leh council was created under the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council Act, 1995, during PM PV Narasimha Rao’s tenure, with its first elections held the same year. A parallel council for Kargil was formed in 2003 during CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s tenure. Elections for both are held every five years.",Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council–Kargil chairman Dr Muhammad Jaffar Akhoon alleged LG Kavinder Gupta is sidelining the district in development planning.

MUMBAI: A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan 's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand, on Friday following a complaint about coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violations during renovation of the property.The property comprises Mannat, a heritage structure, and an annex structure, a multi-storey building. As Khan and his family have shifted to a nearby place due to the renovation, the officials were met by his staff who told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.Pooja Dadlani, Khan's manager, said ""There are no complaints. All work is going on as per guidelines.""The property is undergoing renovation, and clearances were earlier sought from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for it. The renovation included adding two additional floors to the annexe structure.A forest department official said, ""A team carried out a site inspection as we received a complaint about renovation permissions. A report will be prepared based on findings and submitted soon.""An official, who was part of the team, said the staff present at the site told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.The BMC's H-West ward building and factory department and the building proposal department officials were asked to accompany the forest team for carrying out the inspection. ""Our officials were accompanying the team, based on a request by the forest department. We had no other role,"" said a BMC official.Activist Santosh Daundkar had earlier lodged a complaint with the BMC regarding the construction at Mannat.Former IPS officer and lawyer Y P Singh Friday alleged the layout of Mannat comprised one main heritage building called Villa Vienna as per the heritage regulations. ""The name of this building was changed to Mannat later. In 2005, an extension building of seven floors was made behind the heritage bungalow and since at that time Urban Land Ceiling Act was in force, a large apartment could not have been made. To overcome this legal hurdle, approval for 12 small independent flats was taken from the BMC by the owners namely Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan. However, once the approval was obtained, all these 12 small flats, which were essentially meant for mass housing under the Act, were merged and a super luxury accommodation of a single family was constructed,"" said Singh.","A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand.

Chandigarh gets distinction

NEW DELHI: The performance gap in school education between India's top and bottom-ranking states and Union territories has narrowed from 51% in 2017-18 to 42% in the 2023-24 cycle, according to the education ministry's latest performance grading index (PGI) 2.0, suggesting that many states are catching up with the better performers.Yet, the report underscores a significant concern - none of the 36 states and UTs have reached the top four performance grades of Daksh, Utkarsh, Atti-Uttam, and Uttam. Chandigarh, with a score of 703 out of 1,000, is the only entity to enter the Prachesta-1 band (701-760), with most of the states/UTs still in lower bands.Among states, Punjab led with 631.2 points, followed by Delhi (623.7), Gujarat (614.4), and Odisha (595.6). At the bottom end were Meghalaya (417.9), Arunachal Pradesh (461.4), Mizoram (464.3), Nagaland (468.6), and Bihar (472.0), all placed in Akanshi-2 or Akanshi-3, the lowest performance tiers.PGI 2.0 evaluates school education systems across 73 indicators in six domains - learning outcomes, access, infrastructure and facilities, equity, governance processes, and teacher education & training - assigning each state and UT a score out of 1,000.Grades range from Daksh (top) to Akanshi-3 (bottom), based on performance on these indicators, which are derived from sources such as UDISE+, NAS 2021, PRABANDH, PM Poshan and Vidyanjali.As many as 25 states and UTs are currently in the Akanshi category (scores below 580), indicating acontinuing need for systemic improvements. At the same time, this represents a slight improvement from the 28 states/UTs in Akanshi category in 2022-23. Also, the highest grade attained has moved from Prachesta-2 to Prachesta-1.""The narrowing of the inter-state performance gap is a testament to the collective efforts of states and our commitment to cooperative federalism in education,"" said Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan. ""PGI 2.0 reflects the transformational impact of NE, which has empowered states to pursue evidence-based reforms.""The best performers over a two-year period were Himachal Pradesh (up 41 points to 573.8), Telangana (up 22.6 points to 511.9), Chandigarh (up 15.2 to 703), Odisha (up 11.1 to 595.6) and Goa (up 8.4 to 589.7). Delhi recorded the sharpest single-year rise - 44.4 points - driven largely by improvements in school infrastructure and teacher training. However, its 2021-22 score was not published, making it ineligible for the two-year comparative analysis.In contrast, Chhattisgarh posted the steepest decline, falling 38.6 points from 533.2 to 494.6 due to slippage in governance and equity indicators. West Bengal dropped by 14 points and Tamil Nadu registered a marginal fall of 4.5 points.A domain-wise breakdown highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of major states. Kerala, for example, stood out by becoming the only state to achieve Daksh in the teacher education & training domain, scoring 91.4 out of 100 - reflecting its consistent investment in teacher quality and professional development. Odisha showed strong equity outcomes, with one of the highest scores in bridging gender, caste, and regional disparities. Gujarat, with an overall score of 614.4, excelled in governance (87.8/130) and teacher training (83.3/100), but lagged in learning outcomes.Bihar, a state which faces longstanding educational challenges, showed some improvement in access and teacher training but continued to struggle with infrastructure, scoring only 55 out of 190 - placing it in Akanshi-1 for that domain. Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, moved up to Akanshi-1 grade with 528.1 points, driven by better equity and teacher indicators, though governance remained a weak domain.Maharashtra (582.0) entered Prachesta-3 band with gains in equity and teacher training but needs to improve in infrastructure and governance. Tamil Nadu (559.2), despite a legacy of educational progress, saw a dip in its overall score and domain-wise fall in governance and teacher metrics.The report concluded that while progress is evident, states still have significant ground to cover. ""The highest grade achieved so far is only Prachesta-1, and all states/UTs still have considerable work to do to reach the 1,000-point benchmark,"" the ministry said. And whether they do so or not will reflect in future PGI 2.0 scores, which remain a critical monitoring and reform tool under NE to help align education systems with Sustainable Development Goal 4.","The performance gap in school education between India's top and bottom-ranking states and Union territories has narrowed.

NEW DELHI: It has been a week since the tragic Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that claimed 274 lives. On Thursday, officials said that debris, including the aircraft’s damaged tail fin, still remains at the crash site as investigators continue to search for clues to determine the exact cause of the accident.The debris, including the tail fin, is still lying at the site. There are no orders yet to move the rubble elsewhere,” Ahmedabad's additional chief fire officer, Jayesh Khadia said.Inspector DB Basiya of Meghaninagar police station confirmed that the AAIB will decide the fate of the plane wreckage.“The police’s role is limited to securing the area. AAIB will determine what to do with the remains, which may later be moved to another location for further examination,” he said.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, is leading an investigation to understand the cause of one of the worst air disasters in recent times. AAIB officials have been making regular visits to the crash site as part of the ongoing probe.Local fire personnel are assisting forensic and aviation experts with site operations.On June 12, the London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, carrying 242 people, crashed into a hostel building of BJ Medical College in Meghaninagar just minutes after taking off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 1.39 pm.After the crash, the aircraft’s tail fin got stuck at the top of the damaged building and was brought down using cranes on June 14, two days after the incident.Days after the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was recovered, investigators also located the Cockpit Voice Recorder on June 16. Officials said this crucial discovery could help in understanding the cause of the crash.Officials confirmed the recovery of black boxes to PK Mishra, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who inspected the site on Sunday.While the AAIB has launched a detailed investigation, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting a parallel probe under international protocols, as the crashed aircraft was American-made, according to an official release.","It has been a week since the tragic Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that claimed 274 lives.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7.

A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.Also read: Iran strikes southern Israel; thick black smoke fills sky as missile hits high-rise apartment In the midst of this turmoil, US President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a large-scale overnight operation in Tehran, targeting “dozens of military industrial sites for missile production” and the Spand nuclear R&D headquarters. According to the IDF, over 60 fighter jets struck around 120 targets using “precise intelligence guidance.”“These sites were built over years and were the industrial centre of gravity of the Iranian Ministry of Defence,” the IDF said, adding that it also struck a key facility used for producing raw materials for rocket engines.The Spand headquarters, founded in 2011 by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was also hit. The IDF described it as central to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. During the same operation, four Iranian drones were intercepted.President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.” He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center.

While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime.

We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue. The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.

Woman deboarded after alert from flight captain

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag





BENGALURU: A 36-year-old doctor was arrested on Tuesday after she created ruckus aboard an Air India Express flight from Bengaluru to Surat and allegedly threatened to crash the aircraft when cabin crew objected to her placing baggage in a restricted area near the crew cabin.The incident delayed the flight by two hours and led to a security scare. The accused, identified as Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, from Shivanahalli near Yelahanka, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.Also read: Air India cuts frequencies across North America, UK, EU, Far East & Australia 'at least' till July 15 According to police, the Ayurvedic doctor bypassed the check-in counter, insisting on carrying both bags on board. The situation escalated after Mohanbhai boarded the flight and left one of her bags near the crew cabin while taking the other to her seat, 20F.When the cabin crew asked her to keep the bag in the overhead compartment near her seat, she refused and insisted they keep it with them. Despite repeated requests by the crew and later the captain, Mohanbhai refused to comply and began abusing the staff.The confrontation soon involved fellow passengers, who also tried to reason with her, but she reportedly shouted at them. At one point, she allegedly threatened to crash the flight if the crew moved her baggage.With the situation spiralling, the captain alerted security and called CISF personnel, who boarded the aircraft and offloaded her.The incident took place between 2.45pm and 5.30pm, according to a complaint filed by Agnimitra Bahinipati, associate manager of security at KIA. Police said Mohanbhai did not stop there. Once taken to KIA police station, she continued to abuse and manhandle police officers, creating further disturbance. “This was the first time we heard such abusive language in the station,” a senior officer claimed.Her husband, who works in an educational institution in the city and hails from Odisha, appeared before police. He informed them that Mohanbhai had stopped practising medicine and was en route to Gujarat to visit her family.He reportedly told police she had created disturbances in public spaces in the past. Police are now verifying her background and previous incidents.","Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, 36, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: SC Probe Panel Report Says Misconduct Proved, Proposes Justice Varma’s Removal

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence.

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him.

Indian student's deportation sparks outrage

Over 1,000 Indians deported in recent months

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year. The recent crackdown in Los Angeles has also seen mass immigration sweeps, with Trump declaring, “They spit, we hit,” in a controversial order during unrest in the city.","The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right” The statement emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.

Any change in plan could have put the govt in an awkward position in a state where BJP swept the Lok Sabha polls, winning 20 of the 21 seats, and stormed into office by winning 78 of the 147 assembly seats.Speaking at a rally in Bhubaneswar to mark one year of Mohan Charan Majhi-led BJP govt in Odisha, PM Modi said, ""The President of United States called me, saying, 'Since you are in Canada, please come over. We will have a meal together and talk.' I thanked him and politely declined, saying that visiting the land of Mahaprabhu (Lord Jagannath) was essential for me. The devotion for Mahaprabhu and your love drew me here.""In what was Modi's sixth visit to the state in the past one year, the PM praised Odisha's progress under the BJP govt, emphasising the state's role in India's cultural and economic development. He highlighted initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure, healthcare, and economic opportunities for the people of Odisha, particularly tribal communities.Attacking the previous Congress regimes, the PM said the party which governed India for decades had neglected the tribal community and ""used them merely for political benefits"".He said over 125 tribal-dominated districts were affected by Maoists for years. ""Most of these districts were declared backward, and the then govts did not take the responsibility to develop them,"" Modi said. In contrast, the BJP-led govt freed tribal society from Naxal violence, ushering in development in these areas.The PM also highlighted the role of eastern India in the country's growth trajectory.

But as it comes at the fag end of the peak summer holiday season, it will impact a large number of passengers.Due to enhanced checks on the Boeing 777s, frequencies of North America sectors on which AI is the only direct operator have been cut. So now Delhi and San Francisco will have seven weekly flights instead of 10 earlier; Delhi and Toronto will go down from 13 weekly to 7 weekly; Delhi & Chicago will drop from seven to three; Delhi & Washington (Dulles) from five to three and Delhi & Vancouver from seven to five. Between India and North America, AI is the largest operator of direct flights. United and American have only a daily between Delhi & New York.Europe routes will also see frequency cuts. Delhi & London Heathrow (LHR) will go down from 24 to 22 weekly; Delhi & Paris from 14 to 12 and Bangalore & LHR from seven to six (see box). Australia, Tokyo and Seoul will also see temporary cuts.Apart from aircraft shortage due to multiple factors, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s temporary one-month dispensation to AI for making its pilots fly longer due to Pakistan airspace closures that required longer detours ended on June 12.So AI’s pilot requirement for the longer west flights will also increase. “These reductions will be effective from June 21 and last until at least July 15, 2025…. arise from the decision to voluntary undertake enhanced pre-flight safety checks, as well as accommodate additional flight durations arising from airspace closures in the Middle East. The objective is to restore schedule stability and minimising last-minute inconvenience to passengers,” AI said in a statement, adding, “AI apologises to passengers affected by these curtailments, and is proactively offer(ing) re-accommodation on alternative flights, complimentary rescheduling or full refunds as per their preference.”• Delhi-Nairobi1 (AI961/962) – 4x weekly flights• Amritsar-London (Gatwick) (AI169/170) – 3x weekly flights• Goa (Mopa)-London (Gatwick) (AI145/146) – 3x weekly flights• Delhi-Toronto: Reduced from 13x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Vancouver: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-San Francisco: Reduced from 10x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Chicago: Reduced from 7x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Washington (Dulles): Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 24x weekly to 22x weekly• Bengaluru-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Amritsar-Birmingham and Delhi Birmingham: Reduced from 3x weekly to 2x weekly• Delhi-Paris: Reduced from 14x weekly to 12x weekly• Delhi-Milan: Reduced from 7x weekly to 4x weekly• Delhi-Copenhagen: Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Vienna: Reduced from 4x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Amsterdam: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Melbourne and Delhi-Sydney: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Tokyo (Haneda): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Delhi-Seoul (Incheon): Reduced from 5x weekly to 4x weekly2(Source: AI)","Air India will suspend flights between Amritsar & London Gatwick, along with those between Goa (Mopa) & LGW and Delhi & Nairobi.

The success against Naxals wouldn’t have happened overnight…

But the Pahalgam attack was a major setback. Congress has blamed the govt for it.

The situation in Manipur is not of terrorism, nor is it an anti-national issue. It is related to ethnic tension. Today, there is no atmosphere of violence, but the rift between the two communities (Meiteis and Kukis) has not been healed. We are seeking to bring about reconciliation; we invited them separately and then asked them together, and now we are discussing this at the political level. We are hopeful of success soon Amit Shah

Was the Pahalgam attack an act of desperation by Pakistan?

There has been a radical shift in approach towards terrorism as the govt has said that any terrorist attack from now on will be considered an act of war.

Do you see the possibility of fresh attempts by Pakistan to disrupt normalcy?

Congress is making an issue of the decision to pause Operation Sindoor.

No one will have any reason to complain when the delimitation exercise is conducted. We will establish a very good balance and no one will be dissatisfied. DMK is raising the issue only because of the 2026 assembly elections. Delimitation is not going to happen by then, and they know this.

When is an elected govt likely to be restored?

It has been alleged that in its third term, the Modi govt has been making key decisions under pressure, such as the one on caste census.

The opposition has said that the govt notification does not mention caste census.

But the PM had earlier opposed it and you had said this was an attempt to divide Hindus.

By when should we expect the Census numbers?

Is delimitation a possibility before the 2029 elections?

The southern states have concerns around delimitation. How do you propose to balance that with the demand of northern states that their representation in Parliament should be proportionate to their numbers?

BNS has been enacted, how far have you progressed with implementing it?

There were attempts to integrate various aspects through e-courts and e-prisons.

Infiltration has been a major issue and steps have been taken in recent months. The govt has been accused of communal bias in dealing with it.

Communal violence appears to have decreased…

But Bengal seems to be an outlier?

In Delhi, are you happy with the work done by the govt in the first 100 days?

Drugs have emerged as a major concern. How are you tackling the issue?

What about the new BJP president?

Will you be able to repeat the electoral successes of Maharashtra and Haryana in Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala, especially with anti-incumbency factor against Nitish Kumar?

There is a debate around language in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Southern states have raised the issue of lower fund transfer and the formula being skewed against them. How do you view it?

Are you hopeful of a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court on the waqf law?

There is an effort to remove Justice Yashwant Varma. Is the govt seeking to use the opportunity for a National Judicial Appointments Commission-type body? Will we see some action during the monsoon session?

Will the same keenness be shown in the case of Justice Shekhar Yadav?

Let’s not get caught in numbers... certain things cannot be quantified. There was widespread pessimism in 2014, and people voted for Modi ji as PM, seeking an end to corruption, weak internal and external security, a severe image deficit abroad, social disharmony, and the poor state of the economy, which had landed us in the unenviable ‘Fragile Five’ club. The youth were particularly apprehensive. Now, in 2025, people are confident that India will become a developed country by 2047. The transformed mindset is a result of hard work over 11 years, marked by farsightedness and microplanning. I consider the renewal of hope and confidence about the country’s future a significant achievement. We are marching ahead with a sense of encouragement derived from the changed national psyche.Let us be real. There are some issues which cannot be eliminated altogether. But can anyone say that the level of poverty and the number of poor are the same, or that their status has not changed? Over 26 crore people have been moved out of the BPL category, and more than 80 crore have benefited from welfare schemes, including housing, water, electricity, toilets and free LPG connections. Free health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh, 5 kg of free ration and free LPG connections are available.These things had not been provided for in 70 years; in these 11 years, we have come a long way.Can India’s rise to becoming the fourth largest economy from the 10th, surpassing six front-running nations in just 11 years, be termed an underwhelming performance? Is doubling of GDP from $2 trillion to $4.2 trillion underperformance? Isn’t the unprecedented rise of capital expenditure from Rs 1.9 lakh crore to Rs 10.5 lakh crore a marker of the nation’s stupendous growth? Since they demitted office, even per capita income has risen from Rs 68,572 to Rs 133,488 and transformed lives for good. And all these are besides the remarkable 143% jump in FDI, which is reflective of international confidence in India’s economic policies. I can go on. Average inflation rate has been brought down from 10.1% to 4.6% and forex reserves have more than doubled to $654 billion. On the infrastructure front, the pace of highway construction has accelerated, Metro rail network has expanded four-fold to 1,000 km. In the banking sector, the turnaround is equally impressive. When we took office, non-performing assets were in double digits. Today, it is just 2.3%. As part of a historic push for financial inclusion, over 55 crore bank accounts have been opened in the last 11 years. Through Direct Benefit Transfer, Rs 44 lakh crore has been disbursed. Today, India accounts for nearly 50% of global digital transactions. Clearly, development under the Modi govt is not just a claim — it is a lived reality of 140 crore citizens.Considerable progress has been made towards Aatmanirbharta. We manufactured defence products worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore and exported Rs 21,000 crore worth of defence products. The target is to increase it to Rs 50,000 crore by 2029. We are now the second-largest exporter of mobile phones — from 26% mobiles being domestically produced, the share is now over 99%. Modi ji’s push to the toy sector has not only ensured that our next generation grows up playing with indigenously manufactured toys but has also reversed the export-import ratio of toys. In 2014, only 20% of toys were manufactured indigenously, 40% of manufacturing units had shut down, and 20% of them were on the verge of shutting down.The biggest challenge was govt’s approach. Earlier, the focus was on containing the problem; our approach has been to eliminate it. Earlier, the concern was to manage a threat somehow while you were in office. It was not helpful. Take, for example, the issue of Naxalism. They had a plan to develop a red corridor from Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) to Pashupatinath (Nepal), and the threat appeared realistic to many. In 11 years, the challenge has shrunk from 123 districts to just six. I am confident that by March 31, 2026, the entire country will be free of the Naxal menace. Similarly, in the North-east, violence has come down almost 70%, not only by using force. We have negotiated over 20 peace agreements with insurgent groups, and over 10,000 people have surrendered. By the time the report for the year is released, the level of violence is likely to decrease by 90%.By 2020, we began to choke off their supplies, whether it was money, arms or food. We set up over 500 camps, approximately every 8 km, to fill the security vacuum. Forces could now go out in the morning and return by evening after completing an operation. This helped reduce casualties significantly. Besides, we used the camps to distribute grains and medicine to the local population, which eroded the Naxals’ support base. We also enhanced communication systems, utilising the latest technology, including drones that capture the chatter. Most states extended support, regardless of which party was in office. The Congress govt of Chhattisgarh was an exception. It refused to act, and so, the Naxals converged there. Initially, I found it to be a challenge. But it turned into an opportunity. First, a BJP govt was formed there. Second, it became possible to strike the Naxals since they were all located in one place.It needs to be analysed differently. There was a time when 70% of terrorists killed in the Valley would be Indians from Kashmir, while 30% were from Pakistan . Now, that ratio stands at 5:95, which means that if you leave out the Pakistan element, then the homegrown component has almost come to an end. We decided to look at the root of local recruitment. It was fuelled by discontent over rigged polls and corruption that resulted in lack of development. Article 370 was another important factor, as it gave people a sense that they could break away. Nullification of the provision ended that subterranean feeling, with people realising that India is their sole destiny. Free and fair polls at all levels — from local bodies to Parliament — were conducted. Even opponents have not questioned their fairness and so the perception that elections are a sham and managed by Delhi gave way to a sense that the future of a village gets decided only by its residents. Efforts were made to promote Kashmir’s local products. As a result, the enlistment in terrorism decreased. At the same time, there is zero tolerance for terrorists. Funeral procession of a slain terrorist is not allowed, and he is buried where he gets killed. Sympathisers of terrorists have been punished and weeded out from govt jobs, while those involved in stone pelting are debarred from govt jobs. This is why movie theatres have resumed and there are night screenings after 33 years. Tazia procession was taken out after 32 years and Krishna Janmashtami was celebrated at Lal Chowk, where Army had to guard Murli Manohar Joshi ji and Modi ji when they went to unfurl the tricolour there. As for Pakistan-sponsored terrorism that you mentioned in the context of the Pahalgam attack, we have a clear policy: be it Uri, Pulwama or Pahalgam, we have given a strong reply, and today, through your interview, I want to ask Congress, what used to happen during their time? How can Congress question us on the issue of terrorism? It used to do nothing except change a minister. Of all political parties, Congress certainly has no right to criticise us.It was a deliberate attempt to sabotage peace in Kashmir, to stop rising tourism and distract Kashmiri youth, who were employed, enjoying prosperity and were distanced from terrorism. The youth in Kashmir realises the evil plan. There were protests in every town in the Valley after the attack on tourists. The Valley had not shown such solidarity with the country before.Yes, PM Modi has said so repeatedly, there should not be any confusion about it.We cannot control what they are planning but any misdeed of theirs will be responded to with full force. We will not hesitate in acting against whatever Pakistan chooses to do, without any delay.No special effort is required. Tourists have resumed their travel and we will soon be able to reach earlier levels.The PM has stated this in his Independence Day speech, and I have said in both Houses of Parliament that J&K will be granted the status of a state at an appropriate time. There should be no doubt about that.In line with the PM’s public declaration to punish terrorists responsible for the Pahalgam attack, we launched limited strikes on terror launchpads and made it very clear that was a targeted strike. Pakistan treated our strike on terrorists as an attack on its territory, ending the distinction. It attacked our civilian locations. We gave a befitting reply on May 10 by damaging their airbases, while sparing civilian areas. Within no time, Pakistan sought a suspension of strikes.I will only say that when the country is facing hostilities, one should refrain from saying things which hurt the morale of our armed forces, who have done a sterling job. Our agencies gave precise coordinates of specific targets for our forces to strike them with full force. Our scientists also deserve praise for developing weapons systems that proved so effective.No, it will never be restored. International treaties can’t be annulled unilaterally but we had the right to put it in abeyance, which we have done. The treaty preamble mentions that it was for peace and progress of the two countries but once that has been violated, there is nothing left to protect.We will use water that rightfully belongs to India. Paani Rajasthan tak jayega.We will take the water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.The situation in Manipur is not of terrorism, nor is it an anti-national issue. It is related to ethnic tension. We had an open border with Myanmar and when that country faced instability, infiltration started. Then the court order (on Meiteis also deserving quotas) triggered a spark. We need to keep in mind that in all the previous cases of ethnic violence in Manipur, the situation could be stabilised only after threefour years. Today, there is no atmosphere of violence, but the rift between the two communities (Meiteis and Kukis) has not been healed. We are seeking to bring about reconciliation; we invited them separately and then asked them to come together, and now we are discussing this at the political level. We are hopeful of success soon.Until the differences between the two communities are sorted, it will be difficult. Peace is very important.This decision was not taken under pressure. The Modi govt has made the most significant contributions to inclusive and balanced development, encompassing both social and regional dimensions. Most of the poor are Dalit, backwards and minorities, and a larger part of the budget has been allocated to them. There is no bigger anti-OBC party than Congress; they tried to suppress the Kalelkar Commission report, and they did the same with the Mandal Commission. When the recommendations of the Mandal Commission were implemented by a non-Congress govt, Rajiv Gandhi gave the longest speech as leader of opposition, a record that has not been broken also because you don’t have such leaders of opposition now.Caste count will be part of the Census, period. The PM has said so and there have been three press releases.We did say that it is an attempt to divide society. But we also decided to blunt it by agreeing to the demand. Our goal is to keep everyone united.They should be available towards the end of 2027, may be a few months earlier as we are deploying a lot of technology. Instead of five to six years in the past, it may take five to six months.The 2029 elections will be held with women’s reservation.No one will have any reason to complain when the exercise is conducted. We will establish a very good balance and no one will be dissatisfied. DMK is raising the issue only because of the 2026 assembly elections. Delimitation is not going to happen by then, and they know this.The three laws (IPC, Indian Evidence Act and CrPC) were enacted by the British to preserve their rule. The idea was to protect their forces, their property and their own security. We have kept people’s interests at the forefront. We have provided for technological changes that will remain relevant for a century; the definition of an e-document will remain unchanged, despite changes in technology from floppy disks to pen drives, for instance. It allows for e-hearing and e-arguments, and the entire chargesheet can be filed electronically, making the process paperless. Forensics have been made compulsory for several offences; videography of search and seizures is also compulsory. We have provided timelines to ensure that justice is available promptly, and rights have been provided to victims. Along with all this, there is computerisation of police stations, and multiple types of databases will be available, such as those related to narcotics or terrorism. In two years, our legal system will be the most modern in the world. The improvement in Assam shows that we are on track to reach the global average of convictions.There is an arrangement called ICJS. Legacy data has been added, and 95% of the integration is nearly complete. A common software will be introduced by Sept, connecting all police stations, forensic labs, prosecution wings, courts and prisons.Lies should not deter us from doing the right thing. An infiltrator has to leave India. Our country is not a dharamshala. If you need to visit India, you must obtain a valid visa from our embassy. Whatever the perception or political colour, the country’s security is paramount.That is because we (BJP) are in office in most states.Things will improve there too after the next electionsRekha ji’s govt has made a very strong start, whether it is on health, ration cards, tackling water issues, cleaning and development of Yamuna. Her govt has started work on stopping revenue loss. You can’t do much more in 100 days. We have been able to successfully convey to officers that they have to work hard.For any fight, infrastructure is crucial and that is in place now. There is a fourlevel arrangement — at the national level, between state and central, in districts and it is now going to the level of DySPs and police. Apart from Bengal and Kerala, states have also set up narcotics control wings. We have managed to step up recoveries, laws have been strengthened, we can attach property, keep people in jail for longer duration, now police stations can test samples. Over the next five-six months, we will strike on cartels in a very coordinated way.It will happen soon.We will post convincing wins in Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Bengal. We are confident of victory in Tamil Nadu.It’s been raised in Tamil Nadu due to the polls. The public has clarity on the issue, and Indian languages have a bright future.This is propaganda. Between 2004 and 2014, Rs 18.3 lakh crore was given as grants to states, and between 2014 and 2024, it was Rs 70 lakh crore. This aligns with the population of states.Absolutely. The law is entirely in line with the Constitution. The objective is not to offend or hurt religious sentiments in any way, but to eradicate corruption and make the operation of waqf transparent through the use of technologyThere is no thinking within the govt (on NJAC-type body). For us, corruption is a major issue and when the Chief Justice of India in a letter has acknowledged Varma’s culpability, then there is no reason to doubt. I am hoping that the removal happens unanimously.It is not a corruption case, it is a case about conduct (of a judge), which is not within the purview of an elected govt, it has to be decided by the Supreme Court. Corruption and misconduct are two distinct issues with clearly defined boundaries.",The Modi govt has completed 11 years in office. What would you count as the five biggest achievements? The success against Naxals wouldn’t have happened overnight… But the Pahalgam attack was a major setback.

So what could have caused the problem?



Air India in a statement said an aircraft undergoes multiple engineering checks before it is cleared for flight operations, with top priority given to safety issues, and the June 1 Delhi-Hong Kong flight too went through the process.""A hissing sound started emanating from the decorative door panel mid-flight, and after assessing that there was no risk to safety, crew took action to alleviate the noise. After landing in Hong Kong airport, the aircraft underwent checks by the engineering team.""All safety parameters were found to be in compliance and the aircraft was cleared for service. There was no such noise during the return flight AI315 from Hong Kong to Delhi. We would like to reiterate that the safety of our customers and crew remains top priority,"" the Air India statement added.""As the aircraft climbs, the atmospheric pressure difference within and outside the aircraft increases. The pressure inside the B787 passenger cabin is what you would experience at around 6,000 ft altitude. But the aircraft could be cruising at 40,000 ft. If the door seal is compromised, pressurised air (meant to circulate in the passenger cabin) could leak through it, making these noises,"" said a source, requesting anonymity. Unlike the Boeing 777 or 737 aircraft, Boeing 787 has an advanced plug-type door which is electronically monitored. The door swings outward and then moves forward to open. To close, it is plugged into the fuselage for pressurisation. The B777 door on the other hand is operated manually, while the narrow body B737 has a manual, mechanical plug-type door.TOI looked into door plug problems reported by airlines worldwide. The most recent documented case occurred in Oct 2022, when an American Airlines Boeing 787-800 flight to Paris returned to Philadelphia after fumes were detected around two doors.Flight attendants checked lavatories and other places but couldn't find the source of the fumes and when they began spreading in the passenger cabin, the crew declared an emergency and diverted to land safely.In Feb 2022, a TUI airlines B787-800 flying from Amsterdam to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic returned to Amsterdam after a howling noise came from door 2L. A small hole in the door seal caused the sounds and the pilots decided to divert.In Aug 2019, a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo to Bangkok landed back in Tokyo two hours after departure. Passengers complained of growling sounds and vibrations coming from the main door towards the front of the Boeing 787-800 Dreamliner, according to reports. On ground inspection a small gap was found in the door seal through which pressurised air was escaping, creating strange noises and vibrations. There were no cabin pressurisation problems, and no oxygen masks were deployed. The aircraft was returned to service about 30 hours after the incident.In none of these three cases did the aircraft suffer from a cabin depressurisation problem. A senior commander said, ""This kind of leak can happen if a door seal is slightly out of place or it has gone old. It does not affect cabin pressurisation at all. Hypothetically if we assume all 8 doors develop this problem, even then pilots get enough advance warning to initiate a descent down to 10,000 ft as is the standard practice in a cabin decompression emergency. ""Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, said, ""The question is, was it a one-off thing or is it a regular occurrence? It could be a combination of maintenance issues and how the door was closed.""","Aircraft undergoes multiple engineering checks before it is cleared for flight operations, with top priority given to safety issues.

Another section of candidates, who were waitlisted, moved HC for a stay on the scheme, arguing it ""frustrated"" the SC order.Justice Amrita Sinha held that the people whose jobs were terminated by the SC order could not be provided such support after the apex court had decided the issue of illegal appointments conclusively and opined that the appointments were a result of ""fraud"". Getting refund of money already disbursed to the beneficiaries would be a problem if the scheme was found to be in violation of law after the final hearing on a state review petition, she reasoned.HC also took note of the fact that the state welfare scheme was announced for a particular group who would not be doing any work.

(AP Photo/Ajit Solanki)

NEW DELHI: India has been holding yoga events every year on June 21 since 2014, when UN adopted India's resolution to mark the day as International Day of Yoga (IDY).Celebrating IDY was first proposed by PM Narendra Modi at the United Nations General Assembly in 2014. Highlighting yoga's universal appeal, he suggested the Summer Solstice - June 21 - as the appropriate day for the purpose. With 177 UN member states co-sponsoring the resolution, the proposal received overwhelming support, with IDY being first celebrated in 2015.A survey commissioned by Ministry of Ayush has found that this exercise has led to nearly one in every four persons in India incorporating yoga - which includes asana sequences, breath control exercises and meditation - into their lifestyle.While 11% of the respondents - 30,084 people from across the country - said they practise yoga daily, 13% said they do it sometimes.However, 75% of people still don't practise yoga. To encourage such people, the survey report suggests complementing high-visibility flagship events such as IDY with grassroots mobilisation, digital platforms, and institutional partnerships. One of the moves by govt in this direction is a plan to upgrade existing parks in various panchayats (rural) and municipalities (urban) into Yoga parks where people can practise yoga every day.The Ayush ministry report also calls for embedding yoga instruction within school and university wellness programmes to foster early habit formation among young adults (18-24 years).The middle-aged groups can benefit from flexible work arrangements and digital access, which offer opportunities to scale virtual and office-based yoga interventions and convert occasional participants into consistent practitioners, the researchers suggest. They highlighted that nearly 17% of the elderly - the highest of any age group - practise yoga regularly.""The elderly people recognise the benefits of yoga, but they face barriers in including the practice in their daily lives. To address this, senior citizens-focused modules-such as chair-based asanas, balance exercises, and guided breathwork- should be delivered through community health centres and assisted-living facilities, ensuring that older adults can safely and confidently integrate yoga into their daily routines,"" said Raghvendra Rao, director of Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN).He also stressed the need for more yoga trainers and accessibility to yoga classes, offline or through digital mode. Subhash Giri, professor of medicine at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, stressed that yoga provides numerous physical, mental, emotional, and long-term health benefits.Saima Wazed, regional director of WHO Southeast Asia said: ""The benefits of yoga are well-documented. Studies have shown that 77% of people report feeling physically stronger after practising yoga regularly; 82% of patients with chronic inflammation experienced a nearly 50% reduction in symptoms after just six weeks of daily yoga. A study by Harvard Medical School found 60% of participants with depression experienced a significant reduction in symptoms after practising yoga twice a week for eight weeks"".","India has been holding yoga events every year on June 21 since 2014.

“What is not granted by fate cannot be gained by effort,





What is given by fate will not leave, even if discarded”

In 1998, Thai actor-singer Ruangsak Loychusak boarded Thai Airways flight TG261. Midair, the aircraft suddenly plunged. Out of 146 passengers, 101 perished. Ruangsak survived. Decades later, Vishwas Kumar Ramesh was left the sole survivor of the tragic Air India flight AI-171, which had 242 people onboard. An eerie detail stood out: both were seated inA mere coincidence , perhaps.Take the case of Tsutomu Yamaguchi. On August 6, 1945, he was in Hiroshima for a work trip. He witnessed the first atomic bomb drop but lived to tell the tale. Reeling from the horror, he returned to his hometown, Nagasaki—only to survive a second atomic bombing three days later. He lived till the age of 93.On the other hand, there are also stories of those who were not supposed to be in these situations, but were still present, as if to embrace death.In the folktale ‘Appointment in Samarra’, a merchant in Baghdad sends his servant to the market who returns terrified. The servant claims he saw the lady of death who looked at him strangely. He borrows a horse from his master saying he will escape to Samarra, another city. The same evening, the merchant meets the lady of death. She reveals that she was surprised to see his servant in Baghdad because she had an appointment with him that night in Samarra.The parallels in the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy feel almost fabricated—except they are not. Both were elected to Congress in years exactly a century apart (1846, 1946). Both became presidents, in 1860 and 1960. Both were succeeded by men named Johnson—Andrew and Lyndon—also born 100 years apart. Their assassins, too, were born a century apart. And both were shot in the head on a Friday, with their wives present. Lincoln had a secretary named Kennedy; Kennedy had one named Evelyn Lincoln. Even their assassins were silenced before trial. How does one explain this? Are we in the realm of probability or prophecy? Were they enacting the same scene, unknowingly?The world is not short of such ironies—coincidences that nudge the line between chance and destiny.Sceptics argue that the mind is an expert at finding patterns. We remember the hits and forget the misses.I once heard a tale that haunted me. Ten strangers, caught in a storm, took refuge in an inn. One among them, an astrologer, sensed ominous forces and predicted that lightning would strike soon. The group decided that each person would walk to a nearby tree and return. Nine went, but nothing happened. As the tenth stepped out and touched the tree, lightning struck. Not the tree—but the inn. He stood alone in the rain, the only survivor.Was that fate—or chance?Winston Churchill once raised a toast and said, “I wish you all luck. Not health or wealth. Because most people on the Titanic were healthy and rich—but very few were lucky.”There was a time when I dismissed such statements, confident in science and its promise of order. I believed the universe had no room for unseen hands. But now, I pause, I no longerWhat we know about the hidden hands that sculpt our destinies, is as small as a grain of sand pinched between two fingers. The unknown stretches beyond imagination—vast, silent, and as infinite as the universe itself. In that stretch lies the answer to the question why the passenger in seat 11A alone was spared.The wisdom of Valluvar declares that there are things beyond our efforts. He exclaims how fate could outpace even the most guarded plans of human beings.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121977508,imgsize-50570,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/121977508.jpg"

BENGALURU: Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has become the first Indian firm to fully acquire technology of a launch vehicle. HAL secured the transfer of technology (ToT) for Isro 's Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) at a cost of Rs 511 crore.Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) announced Friday that this first-of-its-kind complete ToT marked a significant milestone. Unlike the manufacturing contract of PSLV - shared between HAL and L&T - the SSLV has been fully offered to HAL. The company will own the rocket, build it, market it, and launch it independently.The selection process involved two stages. Out of nine applicants, six were shortlisted in the first round. A committee led by former principal scientific adviser to govt of India, Prof Vijaya Raghavan, and co-headed by former Isro director Suresh, then evaluated the techno-commercial bids of three firms. All were technically qualified but HAL emerged as the highest bidder at Rs 511 crore, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka said.While HAL submitted an independent bid, the other two finalists were consortia - one led by Bengaluru-based Alpha Design and the other by Bharat Dynamics Ltd from Hyderabad.""Payment will be done in phases. ToT will take two years. HAL will make at least two SSLV prototypes with complete help and hand-holding by Isro and after two years, they will be on their own. The initial ToT agreement will be for the first two years and then another contract will be signed between HAL and Isro,"" Goenka said.After the initial two years, HAL will function independently and can even modify the rocket design or choose new partners. A formal contract involving NewSpace India Ltd (Nsil), HAL, Isro and IN-SPACe will be signed soon. Nsil will manage the commercial aspects while IN-SPACe, in collaboration with Isro centres, will oversee the technology transfer.Barenya Senapati, HAL's director of finance, said the win aligned with HAL's broader goal of significantly expanding its space portfolio. He assured the new programme would not affect HAL's other operations.Regarding liability for rocket launches, Goenka noted that, under international norms, the state bore primary responsibility. ""It is up to govt to decide how much of the liability will remain with the state and how much will be transferred to HAL. The company will comply with applicable laws once the contract is finalised,"" he said.","Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has become the first Indian firm to fully acquire technology of a launch vehicle.

The gunmen later opened fire on the forces, prompting a retaliation and the crossfire. Haokip was later found dead with a bullet wound. A hunt is on for the gunmen.CoTU described the attacks and death as ""another targeted assault in a systematic campaign"" and held state govt responsible for allowing such atrocities to unfold under its watch. Manipur has been under President's rule since this Feb.

BENGALURU: Karnataka's govt has resolved to crackdown on fake news and misinformation by constituting a six-member social-media regulatory authority to ban promotion and spread of fake news on social media, prohibit posting of content insulting to women, ban publication of content that disrespects Sanatana Dharma, its symbols, beliefs, and content that promotes superstition.Under the Karnataka Misinformation and Fake News (Prohibition) Bill, 2025, accessed by TOI, govt has proposed up to seven years in prison or Rs 10 lakh fine, or both, if social-media users are found guilty of sharing fake news. It has also suggested a two- to five-year jail term and fine for misinformation on social media or in publications. These offences will be considered cognisable but non-bailable.The social-media regulatory authority will ensure content posted on social media should be based on authentic research on subjects related to science, history, religion, philosophy and literature.To fasten accountability, the bill states special courts will be set up with Karnataka HC's concurrence, with a sessions judge presiding over one or more districts.

Election Commission allows post-result mock polls to check EVM integrity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commission-allows-post-result-mock-polls-to-check-evm-integrity/articleshow/121983903.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: Election Commission has revised its standard operating procedures (SOPs) for post-result checking of burnt memory or microcontroller of EVM (EVM C&V), allowing the candidates who finished second or third, to also opt for a mock poll on the selected EVM units, in addition to the simple diagnostic check already offered.As per the earlier SOPs issued on June 1, 2024, EVMs could be subjected to C&V as a set, that is, a combination of ballot unit, control unit and VVPAT, as used in an actual election. A diagnostic check would be performed under the supervision of the district in-charge engineer of the manufacturer, Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) or Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) and the district election officer. There was no provision for a mock poll.The new administrative SOPs, issued on June 17, 2025, have also split the charges to be paid by the candidates applying for EVM checks, into two slabs. While plain EVM C&V charge is now fixed at Rs 23,600, inclusive of 18% GST, C&V check with mock poll will cost the applicant candidates Rs 47,200 (GST included). These charges shall be payable to the EVM manufacturer. However, if the EVM is found to be tampered with or modified, the charges will be refunded to the applicant concerned and borne by central or state govt, depending on the election.Eligible candidates can, within seven days of declaration of result, request a check or verification of burnt memory for any tampering or modification in 5% of EVMs - BU, CU and VVPAT - per assembly constituency or assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency.The new SOPs have also cut the period for the chief electoral officer to send the consolidated list of EVM C&V applications received, to the EVM manufacturers, to 15 days from the date of declaration of result, against 30 days earlier.Meanwhile, in another important decision, EC, concerned at the possible misuse of still and video records maintained by it for each stage of the election process, has fixed the period of retention of such records to 45 days, provided no election petition is filed.Time limits ranging from six months to a year were previously laid down for retention of photos and videography from different stages of elections - pre-nomination, nomination, EVM preparation, polling, counting and declaration of result - even though not mandatory under the law.""The instructions to destroy records after 45 days is prospective,"" an EC official told TOI, hinting that they may kick in only with the upcoming Bihar assembly poll.""The retention period is in sync with the 45-day time-bar for filing election petitions. When an election petition is filed, the relevant records will not be destroyed till after the petition is disposed of finally,"" added the officer.EC, in a letter sent to the all state CEOs on May 30, had justified the modified instructions by citing the ""recent misuse of this content by non-contestants for spreading misinformation and malicious narratives on social media by selective and out-of-context use of such content, which will not lead to any legal outcome"".","Election Commission has revised its standard operating procedures (SOPs) for post-result checking of burnt memory or microcontroller of EVM.

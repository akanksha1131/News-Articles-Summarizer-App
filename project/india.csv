How Russia's S-400 helped India in Operation Sindoor against Pakistan



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin were seen sharing light moments and walking hand-in-hand during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin on Monday, while Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif looked on as the leaders passed him during the group photo session.PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were also seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation, underscoring the camaraderie among the three leaders at the summit.“Interactions in Tianjin continue! Exchanging perspectives with President Putin and President Xi during the SCO Summit,” PM Modi posted on X, along with pictures from the event.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that Pm Modi will address the plenary session of the 25th SCO Heads of State Council Summit later in the day. “Prime Minister will be addressing the plenary session of the Summit, where he will outline India’s approach to fostering regional cooperation under the SCO umbrella,” Misri said.Following the plenary, PM Modi is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin. On Sunday, PM Modi also met Xi, where both leaders agreed that India and China are “development partners, not rivals.”They emphasised the need for peace along the border, supported a mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue, and agreed to resume direct flights.Modi also invited Xi to attend the 2026 Brics Summit in India.In another engagement, PM Modi met Xi’s close aide Cai Qi in Tianjin. During the meeting, PM Modi shared his vision for India-China relations, while Cai reaffirmed Beijing’s intent to deepen exchanges. Misri said a banquet was replaced by a brief interaction due to scheduling constraints.The SCO currently has 10 member states, with India becoming a full member in 2017.Meanwhile, India’s S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” missile defence systems played a crucial role during “Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 7 and 8. The Indian Air Force successfully intercepted Pakistani drones and missiles aimed at 15 Indian cities, according to ANI reports quoting domain experts.Officials confirmed that debris from Pakistani drones and missiles was recovered at multiple sites, providing evidence of the attack. India’s Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems thwarted the attempt, preventing damage to key assets.The S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” — India’s name for the Russian-made Triumf system — can engage targets up to 400 km away and detect threats as far as 600 km. Equipped with phased-array radar, it can track over 100 targets simultaneously and neutralise threats ranging from drones to ballistic missiles.India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 for five S-400 units, the first of which was deployed in Punjab in 2021. The advanced system is seen as a game-changer in South Asia, bolstering India’s multi-layered air defence and giving it a strategic edge against Pakistan and China.The government described the May 7 strikes as “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,” clarifying that no Pakistani military installations were targeted. However, after Pakistan escalated on Wednesday, Indian forces struck back, neutralising Pakistani air defence systems, including one in Lahore.","PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were also seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation.

It has also suggested that quality of generic drugs available in the market should be monitored citing hesitancy among medical professionals in prescribing them.According to the committee, headed by Narain Dass Gupta, though the govt has taken significant steps in recent years towards strengthening the regulatory framework for governing the pricing of cancer drugs and promoting affordability, a substantial segment of such drugs remains beyond the ambit of current price control mechanisms.""The number of anti-cancer medicines under price control has increased from 40 (in 2011) to 63 (in 2022), still, a significant number of oncology medications are not included under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013, and thus are not subject to any statutory price ceiling,"" the committee has pointed out and said that this regulatory non-inclusion has led to excessive and often unaffordable pricing.""In view of this, the committee strongly recommends that the govt undertake urgent measures to expand the scope of the DPCO to include the widest possible range of cancer drugs,"" the committee on petitions has recommended.","A parliamentary committee has recommended that the price caps enforced by the govt, for example, the existing 30% trade margin cap on 42 essential anti-cancer drugs - should be extended.

Sept too likely to be wetter than normal in India: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sept-too-likely-to-be-wetter-than-normal-in-india-imd/articleshow/123623336.cms,"Delhi Rain Chaos: Waterlogged Streets, Massive Traffic Jams Hit City After Sudden Change in Weather

Heaviest August rain since 1996, says IMD

NEW DELHI: Monthly average rainfall over the country as a whole in Sept is most likely to be 'above normal', at more than 109% of the long-period average, the IMD said on Sunday. It also warned of possible heavy rainfall events during the month in Uttarakhand, north Rajasthan, south Haryana, Delhi and parts of north Chhattisgarh, saying the extreme events may trigger landslides, mudslides, flash floods and urban flooding.Geographically, most parts of the country are likely to receive 'normal' to 'above normal' rainfall in Sept, while some parts of the northeast and east India, many areas of extreme south peninsular India and some parts of northernmost India are likely to receive 'below normal' rainfall, the IMD said.Underlining a trend of increasing rainfall in Sept since the 1980s, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said it was advisable for the authorities to remain alert and take all precautionary measures to avoid potential risks.He attributed increasing rainfall in the month to shifting of the monsoon withdrawal date from Sept 1 to Sept 17 over the years, saying the interaction of western disturbances with the monsoon system during the transition month leads to higher-than-normal rainfall.The IMD's data for Aug shows that though the average rainfall during the month was merely 5% above the normal, northwest India and the South Peninsula reported 34% and 31% above the normal rainfall, respectively.This led to cloudbursts, landslides and flash floods in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K; the flooding of farms in Punjab that damaged agricultural crops; and many episodes of urban flooding in cities, including in Delhi.IMD's data shows that rainfall over northwest India in Aug was the highest for the month since 1996 and the 13th highest since 1901, whereas it was the third highest for south peninsular India since 2001 and the eighth highest since 1901.Mohapatra said though there was no increasing trend of cloudbursts in the country, the data at least showed an increasing trend of 'mini-cloudbursts' that led to landslides and other disasters, specifically in the hilly region of the country. A cloudburst is a short-lived extreme weather event in which heavy rainfall occurs over very small areas (20-30 sq km) at a very fast rate (100mm per hour). In a mini-cloudburst, rainfall occurs at the rate of 50mm per hour. In India, cloudbursts occur during the monsoon season, normally over orographically dominant regions like the Himalayan region, northeastern states and Western Ghats.Citing the example of heavy rains in Chennai on Saturday, Mohapatra said cloudbursts or mini-cloudbursts are not limited to hilly regions.","Monthly average rainfall over the country as a whole in Sept is most likely to be 'above normal', says IMD. It also warned of possible heavy rainfall events during the month in Uttarakhand, north Rajasthan, south Haryana, Delhi and parts of north Chhattisgarh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123623347,imgsize-995007,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Health speculation lingers

Still firing on Truth Social





The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.Dressed in a white polo, black slacks, and his trademark red MAGA cap, Trump appeared relaxed as he left the White House with his grandchildren before heading to the links. The White House press pool confirmed his departure in the presidential motorcade at 8:49 am, providing definitive proof that the 47th President is alive and well.For much of Saturday, Trump was the top trending search on Google and across social media platforms, with phrases like “Is Trump dead?” and “Trump is dead” flooding timelines. The rumors, though baseless, spread rapidly, fueled in part by his recent absence from the public eye and lingering speculation about his health.Trump’s last major appearance was on August 26, when he chaired a televised cabinet meeting. Before that, he was spotted on August 24 golfing in Virginia alongside former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens.Concerns about Trump’s health have persisted for weeks after photos surfaced of him with a large bruise on his right hand and visible swelling around his ankles.The White House did not address the images directly but last month released a letter confirming Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition linked to age and prolonged standing. Doctors have suggested the ankle swelling may be connected to routine aspirin use.Adding fuel to the rumor mill, Vice President JD Vance recently told USA Today that he was “ready to step in” if a “terrible tragedy” struck, though he emphasized that Trump remained in “great health.”Despite skipping public events this weekend, Trump has remained active online. Hours before his golf outing, he posted on Truth Social lashing out at a US appeals court for striking down most of his tariffs, a reminder that, contrary to internet whispers, the President is still very much at the helm.","The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.

Farmer In Village, Sewadar In Delhi: Singh Handled 2 Jobs To Help Family





NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old sewadar was on Friday brutally beaten to death with sticks by a group of men inside the premises of southeast Delhi's Kalkaji Temple following a dispute over the distribution of chunni prasad.Police have arrested five people so far, including the father of one of the men for harbouring him.The victim, Yogendra Singh , hailed from Fattepur in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district, where he used to work as a farmer. He visited Delhi every few months, serving at the temple for the past 15 years.Also read: 'They came with iron rods, sticks': How a request to wait for prasad ended in fatal assault at Delhi Kalkaji temple Investigation revealed the group had an argument with temple staff, including Singh, over the same issue just days earlier. On Friday, police received a PCR call around 9.30pm about a quarrel at the temple.To support his family and fund the treatment of his six-year-old differently-abled daughter, Yogendra Singh balanced two jobs, working as a farmer in his native village in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district and as a sewadar at Kalkaji Temple in Delhi.Every few months, he would travel to the city to serve at the temple and earn some money before returning home to tend to his wheat and bajra crops.On Saturday morning, Singh's elder brother, Kaushal Singh, stood tearfully outside the AIIMS Trauma Centre, waiting to collect the body. He recalled how Yogendra worked relentlessly and without complaining driven by the single goal of securing a better future for his children. His daughter, who has problems performing basic tasks with her arm and leg, has been undergoing treatment for over a year, costing the family over Rs 1.5 lakh.Yogendra, the youngest of three brothers, last met his wife, mother and two children when he left home two months ago. ""I don't know how to tell his wife that he is no more; she still thinks he is undergoing treatment,"" said Kaushal, who also works as a sewadar. The brothers last met last week. ""I was going to Puri in Odisha for work and he asked me to travel safely and take care of myself. He was such a simple man, who never hurt anyone and only ever cared for others,"" he said.Eyewitnesses to the horrible attack on Yogendra at the temple described the scene as ""complete chaos"", with the attackers using sticks to brutally assault the victim while cursing at him. Brijesh Kumar Singh, 87, said, ""It was around the usual aarti timing and it was raining a little. I remember running away in fear when I saw a large group barge in and beat up a man that I have been seeing around for years.""Speaking to the media, Raju, another sewadar at the temple, said, ""Yogendra was pulled out from the temple dharmshala around 9pm. The mob had iron rods and sticks in their hands and beat him to death."" Another 21-year-old sewadar, who was a close friend of Yogendra for over a decade, was filled with fear and anxiety: ""We get into minor arguments with devotees all the time but such issues can be resolved with conversation.

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","US federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal. The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war. The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123592969,imgsize-1007470,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-file-ap.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi's KN Katju Marg area following a heated argument over a birthday gift for their son.The accused, Yogesh Sehgal, was later arrested in Rohini, where he was detected roaming around with his two sons.On Saturday, around 3.50 pm, police received a PCR call reporting the murder of the caller's mother, Kusum Sinha, 63, and sister, Priya Sehgal, 34, both residents of Rohini.Read also: ‘No gifts from your family’: How a birthday remark sparked Delhi double murder with scissors A police team rushed to the third floor house in Rohini Sector 17, where they found two female bodies lying in a pool of blood. The crime team and forensic experts were summoned to the scene.According to Sinha's son, Megh Sinha, his mother visited Priya's house on Aug 28 to celebrate the birthday of Priya's son, Chirag. Megh alleged that Yogesh killed his mother and sister and fled with the children. Sehgal was arrested and the cops seized his blood-stained clothes and a pair of scissors, the alleged weapon of offence.The murder is attributed to domestic disputes and frequent quarrels.""A dispute erupted between Priya and her unemployed husband, Yogesh, over gifts exchanged between the two families and Kusum stayed at Priya's residence to help resolve the issue,"" said Rajeev Ranjan, DCP (Rohini).When Megh couldn't reach his mother by phone on Saturday, he visited Priya's house and found the flat locked and spied bloodstains near the door.

During interrogation, he revealed that the family was celebrating their youngest son's 15th birthday. He told the cops that his wife made an uncharitable comment about his family not bringing gifts, which triggered his anger. Around 11.30pm, he allegedly stabbed Priya in the neck with a pair of scissors and then attacked his mother-in-law.After committing the crime, Yogesh attempted to clean up the blood. He then locked the door and waited for his sons to return from school. When they arrived, he informed them about the murder and said he would take them somewhere before the police caught up with him. However, he was apprehended before he could execute his plan. According to the investigators, the couple's frequent arguments, coupled with the comment about gifts, seemed to have triggered the violence.","A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances. The visit follows an almost year-long effort by both sides to narrow down their differences on the contentious border issue and normalise the relationship in the form of steps already taken like resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage for Indians and tourist visas for Chinese nationals.As has been reported earlier, Modi will have a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, the first of his many engagements over the next 2 days. However, among the highlights on the first day will also be a likely meeting with Myanmar’s acting president and military chief Min Aung Hlaing.“Landed in Tianjin, China. Looking forward to deliberations at the SCO Summit and meeting various world leaders,” said Modi in a post on X, after arriving in China.India has had limited high-level contacts with Myanmar since the military took control of state power in 2021 but this will be Modi’s second meeting with the Myanmar leader this year, after their talks on the margins of the BIMSTEC summit in Thailand. Ahead of a planned election in December, as announced by the military, Modi is likely to stress the importance of an early restoration of democracy in the country torn by ethnic violence through inclusive and credible polls and dialogue.Myanmar under its military has struggled to shed its pariah status in the West but continues to maintain strong ties with both China and India. For India, which has a 1600 km land border with Myanmar, it’s imperative to work with the military rulers to deal with the persistent challenge of border insurgency.While Modi is in China for the SCO summit, his most crucial engagement will likely be the meeting with Xi that is expected to cement the recent progress in ties after an almost 5-year-old military standoff. According to sources, the PM will approach the meeting with the intention to take the relationship forward with a long-term and strategic perspective. The meeting will take place at a time India’s relationship with the US is at its lowest ebb in decades. While both sides have not indicated signing of any big-ticket agreement, the leaders are expected to endorse efforts to resume direct air services between the 2 countries.There will be focus on trade and economic cooperation with Modi likely to underline the need for a fair trade partnership and seek a reaffirmation of the Chinese commitment to address India’s needs in critical areas like rare earths, fertilisers and equipment. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi recently assured his counterpart S Jaishankar Beijing will lift curbs on export of some of these items. Modi is also likely to raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in the context of the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack.","PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances.

Trump’s ‘Worst Nightmare’ Comes True: Putin’s Friends Modi & Xi Are All Smiles In China, Hold Talks





Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge, which could begin within days.The order, issued on Saturday, bars the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement, patrols, traffic stops, checkpoints, or arrest operations.Johnson said the measure was necessary to “guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents amidst the possibility of imminent militarised immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government,” according to news agency AP.When asked whether he would follow instructions from federal agents, Johnson replied, “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”The order also requires Chicago police, including undercover officers, to wear uniforms and prohibits them from covering their faces, contrasting with federal immigration officers, many of whom now wear masks since Trump took office. At the same time, Johnson urged federal officers deployed in Chicago to identify themselves with names, badge numbers and body cameras, Politico reported.Two US officials cited by AP said the immigration crackdown could start as early as September 5 and last for 30 days. The officials said the operation was part of a wider Trump administration strategy to expand federal law enforcement in Democratic-led cities, similar to earlier actions in Los Angeles.At a news conference, Johnson accused Trump of using federal power for political retribution, calling him ‘reckless and out of control.’“He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country”, he added.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday, pointed to Chicago’s recent gun violence and attacked Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”The White House described Johnson’s executive order as a “publicity stunt.” Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted as saying by CNN, “If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticise the President, their communities would be much safer. Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue.”Illinois governor Pritzker also condemned Trump’s plan, accusing the administration of trying to “circumvent our democracy, militarise our cities and end elections,” CNN reported.Vice President JD Vance, however, defended the administration’s approach, saying during a visit to Wisconsin, “Chicago has had a lot of crime problems. Why is it that you have mayors and governors who are angrier about Donald Trump offering to help them than they are about the fact that their own residents are being carjacked and murdered in the streets?”","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge.

Ties looking up but key border difference remains; India says border peace insurance for ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-looking-up-but-key-border-difference-remains-india-says-border-peace-insurance-for-ties/articleshow/123621680.cms,"From Border Dispute to Terrorism: Vikram Misri Details Key Issues Raised in Modi-Xi Talks

As he reiterated the significance China attaches to a dragon-elephant tango, at a time the world is seeing “once-in-a-century"" transformations, President Xi Jinping made 4 suggestions from a strategic and long-term perspective to build a steady and healthy relationship in his meeting with PM Narendra Modi.These included deepening strategic communication and mutual trust, expanding exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefits and win-win results, accommodating each other's concerns and strengthening multilateral cooperation to safeguard common interests.While talking about accommodating concerns though, Xi reiterated China’s long-held position – stressed repeatedly during the eastern Ladakh military standoff – that India and China should not allow the border issue to define the overall China-India relationship.This latest assertion of the Chinese position that development of the relationship be ring-fenced from the border issue will likely see India treading cautiously in its efforts to normalise the relationship with China.Responding to the Chinese readout of Xi’s remarks, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said PM Narendra Modi had made it very clear that the boundary situation will have an impact on bilateral relations.“I would just say that we have been stating this from the beginning, and, on different levels, that the situation on the boundary will have an impact on bilateral relations in certain ways. Because of this, the insurance policy for bilateral relations is to maintain peace and tranquility on the boundary. So, even the Prime Minister has made this very clear,” said the foreign secretary.According to the Indian readout too, Modi underlined the importance of peace and tranquility on the border areas for continued development of bilateral relations. During the standoff that lasted for well over 4 years, India had maintained that there would not be business as usual until the border issue was resolved.However, the border issue was not a deal-breaker in the meeting that Modi described as fruitful. Xi also said India and China should work together to maintain border peace and tranquility and agreed with Modi that there has been peace and stability in the border areas since their meeting in Kazan last year.Xi told Modi an elephant-dragon dance is the right choice for both countries, while describing the global situation as both chaotic and fluid. “We are the world's two most populous countries, and we are also, equally, members of the Global South. We both shoulder the historical responsibility of improving the well-being of our two peoples, promoting the solidarity and rejuvenation of developing countries, and promoting the progress of human society,” said Xi in his opening remarks in the meeting.“It is the right choice for both of us to be friends, to have good neighbourly and amicable ties, partners who enable each other's success, and to have the dragon and the elephant dance together,” he added.Unlike the Indian statement, the Chinese readout made no direct mention of trade or terrorism but it quoted Xi as saying that the relationship will flourish as long as the 2 countries act as partners and not rivals. While Modi said a stable India-China relationship is important for both multipolar world and multipolar Asia, Xi only mentioned multipolar world while underlining the need to work together.On Sunday, Modi also had a separate meeting with Cai Qi, Member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, and a powerful political ally of Xi. According to Indian authorities, Modi shared with Cai his vision for bilateral relations and sought his support to realise the vision of the 2 leaders. Cai reiterated the Chinese side's desire to expand bilateral exchanges and further improve relations in line with the consensus reached between the two leaders, said the government.","President Xi Jinping made 4 suggestions from a strategic and long-term perspective to build a steady and healthy relationship with PM Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: The admissions by the automobile industry and the govt that ethanol-blended petrol (E20) can cause a drop in a vehicle’s mileage in the range of 2%-6% is a double whammy for consumers as they keep paying higher price for fuel but their vehicles run less.Take the example of Surender Pal Singh, a Delhi-based automobile engineer, who claimed the mileage of his less than three-year-old car reduced significantly in the last 4-6 months. “The average mileage of my car was around 17-17.5 km on Delhi roads when I bought it. The mileage slipped to 16.5 km last year and I thought it may be because of my driving habits and traffic conditions. But 4-5 months back I saw the mileage touching 14.5 km,” Singh claimed, who was the principal of a major vehicle driving institute. Singh claimed that recently, he switched to “premium fuel”, which is about Rs 7 costlier, and the fuel mileage has improved, adding that he himself drives his car.Several car users have posted such observations and complaints on social media, raising questions why they should keep paying the price for a fuel that gives them less mileage.Govt think tank Niti Aayog in its 2021 report on ‘Roadmap For Ethanol Blending in India 2020-25’ had recommended that “for better acceptability of higher ethanol blends in the country, retail price of such fuels should be lower than normal petrol to compensate for the reduction in calorific value and incentivise switching to the blended fuel.Tax breaks on ethanol as a fuel may be considered by the govt”.The report had highlighted that while using E20 fuel, there would be a drop in fuel efficiency by nearly 6%-7% for four-wheelers and 3%-4% for two-wheelers designed for E0 (100% petrol) and calibrated for E10, and 1%-2% for four-wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20. “However, with the modifications in engines (hardware and tuning), loss in efficiency due to blended fuel can be reduced,” the report mentioned.Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), citing two studies of 2016 and 2021, said that in testing it found E20 not to have any adverse impact on vehicles.",The automobile industry and the govt have admitted that ethanol-blended petrol (E20) can cause a drop in a vehicle’s mileage in the range of 2%-6%.

NEW DELHI: India is likely to get more than normal rainfall in September, adding to a monsoon season already marked by extreme weather and heavy damage from rains.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday said that rainfall in September is expected to be more than 109% of the long-period average of 167.9 mm. The forecast indicates that most parts of the country will receive normal to above-normal rainfall, although the northeast, east, several areas in the extreme south peninsula and pockets of northwest India could record below-normal rain.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra cautioned that intense rainfall could lead to fresh disruptions. He said Uttarakhand may face landslides and flash floods, while south Haryana, Delhi and north Rajasthan could also see major impacts.""Many rivers originate in Uttarakhand. So, heavy rainfall means many rivers will be flooded and it will impact cities and towns downstream. So, we should keep this in mind,"" he said.He further warned that heavy showers are also likely in the upper catchment areas of the Mahanadi River in Chhattisgarh.Mohapatra noted that September rainfall has shown a slight rising trend since 1980, except for lean years such as 1986, 1991, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2015 and 2019.Alongside the rain forecast, the IMD said September temperatures will vary across regions. Maximum temperatures are expected to stay normal to below normal in many parts of west-central, northwest and south India, while they could be above normal in east-central, east, northeast India, parts of northwest India and the western coast.Between June 1 and August 31, India received 743.1 mm of rainfall, around 6% higher than the long-period average of 700.7 mm. June saw 180 mm of rain, nearly 9% above normal, followed by July with 294.1 mm, 5% above average. August recorded 268.1 mm, about 5.2% above normal.Northwest India had an unusually wet August, with 265 mm of rainfall, the highest for the month since 2001 and the 13th highest since 1901. Cumulatively, the region logged 614.2 mm of rain from June to August, 27% higher than the normal 484.9 mm.South Peninsular India also saw heavy rainfall in August, receiving 250.6 mm, 31% above normal, making it the third highest August total since 2001 and the eighth highest since 1901. Overall, the region registered 607.7 mm between June and August, a surplus of 9.3%.The unusually heavy rains have fuelled extreme weather events across several states. Punjab saw its worst floods in decades, with overflowing rivers and breached canals inundating vast stretches of farmland and displacing lakhs of people. In Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, cloudbursts and flash floods triggered landslides and caused extensive loss of life and property.The IMD said the surplus rainfall was the result of active monsoon conditions, boosted by frequent western disturbances. Mohapatra explained that disturbances between July 28 and August 14 brought heavy to very heavy rainfall to the western Himalayas and nearby plains, including a flash flood and landslide in Uttarkashi on August 5 and riverine floods in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.He added that a rapid revival of the monsoon after August 14, sustained by four low-pressure systems over 15 days, prolonged active rainfall across large areas.According to Mohapatra, northwest India and adjoining Himalayan states faced ""extremely and exceptionally heavy rainfall events"" between August 21 and 27. He said this included very heavy rain over east Rajasthan from August 22 to 24, over Punjab and Haryana between August 23 and 26, and severe flooding and landslides in Jammu and Kashmir from August 23 to 27.Other intense spells were recorded in Konkan and the ghats of Madhya Maharashtra on August 20, east Rajasthan on August 23, Jammu on August 27 and Telangana on August 28.Mohapatra said these events were driven by ""the slow movement of two successive very active western disturbances, interaction with remnants of monsoonal low-pressure systems, strong southerly winds with moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and formation of two low-pressure systems over north Bay of Bengal and their movement across central India"".",India is likely to get more than normal rainfall in September. Rainfall in September is expected to be more than 109% of the long-period average of 167.9 mm.

"Punjab floods: CM Mann urges PM Modi to release Rs 60,000 crore state funds; schools to remain shut till Sept 3",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-floods-cm-mann-urges-pm-modi-to-release-rs-60000-crore-state-funds-schools-to-remain-shut-till-sept-3/articleshow/123614623.cms,"More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

NEW DELHI: Punjab is battling one of the worst flood disasters in decades, with chief minister Bhagwant Mann urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release Rs 60,000 crore of the state’s funds which, he said, were “stuck” with the Centre.In a letter sent on Sunday, Mann said that about 1,000 villages and lakhs of people have been hit by the devastation caused by the swollen Sutlej, Beas and Ravi rivers, along with seasonal rivulets fed by heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.“Heavy monsoon rains, coupled with the release of waters from dams, have caused extensive flooding in seven districts, namely Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Amritsar, Pathankot, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Hoshiarpur,” wrote Mann.He further added, ""With the situation still evolving, there is a grave concern that conditions may further deteriorate in the coming days.""The CM said that around three lakh acres of farmland, largely paddy fields, remain submerged, with crops destroyed just weeks before harvest. “In addition, there has been a widespread loss of livestock, which is severely impacting rural households whose livelihoods are heavily dependent on dairy and animal husbandry,” he wrote.As floodwaters continue to disrupt life across the state, the Punjab government has extended the closure of all schools until 3 September.“In accordance with the directives of chief minister of Punjab, Bhagwant Singh Mann, keeping in view the flood situation in Punjab, holidays have been declared in all government/aided/recognised and private schools in the state until September 3, 2025,” state education minister Harjot Singh Bains announced. He added, “Parents and students are requested to prioritise safety and comply with the instructions issued by the administration. ”The schools had previously been shut from August 27 to August 30.Mann claimed that Rs 60,000 crore of Punjab’s funds are pending with the Centre. Breaking down the figure, he said the state suffered a permanent revenue loss of Rs 49,727 crore due to the implementation of GST and transition from the VAT regime, for which “no compensation has been provided by the government of India”.He also pointed out that cuts in the rural development fund (RDF) and mandi development fund (MDF) had cost the state over Rs 8,000 crore, while the scrapping of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) projects worth Rs 828 crore “can adversely impact the state’s rural connectivity in the long run”.“Punjab is facing a tough time due to the worst flood conditions. You are requested to release all funds of Punjab stuck with the Government of India, which is to the tune of Rs 60,000 crore,” he urged.The CM also asked the Centre to revise norms under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), calling them “totally unrealistic”. At present, compensation norms fix input subsidy for crop loss above 33% at Rs 17,000 per hectare, equivalent to Rs 6,800 per acre. He said that paying such a petty amount would be a cruel joke with the farmers, further noting that the state government had been topping it up to Rs 15,000 per acre by contributing an extra Rs 8,200.“Since the crops were almost at the harvesting stage, I feel that at least Rs 50,000 per acre should be paid to the farmers. So I request you to revise the norms of compensation of SDRF. Needless to say the state government shall continue to contribute 25 per cent as per the scheme of SDRF,” Mann said.The flood-hit districts include Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Fazilka, Kapurthala, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, with relief efforts continuing as water levels remain high.","Punjab is battling one of the worst flood disasters in decades. Chief minister Bhagwant Mann urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release Rs 60,000 crore of the state’s funds.

Being a Union minister, I want to share the stand of our govt. Our govt and party (BJP) think about (bringing) a Uniform Civil Code in the country as per the Constitution. When criminal law is equal for all, why should civil law also not be (equal for everyone)?""He added that while some states have already started work on UCC, tribals will remain outside its scope. ""We have clearly said that tribals will be exempted from it. Let Adivasis be given the freedom to live in their own way. This (UCC) will not be implemented in Schedule 6, Schedule 5, the northeast and other tribal areas in the country,"" Rijiju said. The issue of a UCC is being examined by the Law Commission. Uttarakhand has already brought it into force. At the event, Rijiju joined Union urban development and energy minister Manohar Lal Khattar and RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale in unveiling a statue of tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda.Hosabale underlined the importance of tribal culture in shaping India's national identity. He said tribals should not be seen as relics of the past but as a ""living culture"" that enriches the country. ""India's national identity cannot be imagined without the tribal heritage. Development in tribal areas should empower them, not displace them. Tribals must be partners in growth, not bystanders,"" he said, praising the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram for its decades-long work to protect tribal identity and traditions.Rijiju also reflected on the role of cultural organisations. ""Except for the Sangh family and a few other organisations, no organisation has genuinely tried to connect tribals in this country. It is said that the tribals should come into the mainstream. I don't understand what the mainstream is because Sanatan includes diverse cultures and is united with them all,"" he said.The organisers of the event said the new centre would serve as a hub for research, youth leadership training, and awareness programmes aimed at preserving tribal traditions, coinciding with the 150th birth anniversary of Birsa Munda.",Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said tribals in the northeast and other parts of the country will be kept out of the ambit of the proposed Uniform Civil Code.

Sadhguru Reveals Its Mystical Power

Poll Do you agree with Sadhguru's view on India's ability to thrive despite challenges? Yes, I believe in India's resilience No, challenges are too overwhelming

Sadhguru on Saturday completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, just 18 months after undergoing two emergency brain surgeries.He was welcomed at the Coimbatore Airport, with locals, villagers and volunteers lining the route to the ashram in a devotional procession.Speaking to journalists at Coimbatore Airport, Sadhguru noted, “As per medical advice, I was not supposed to ride a motorcycle, yet I went to 18,000 feet above mean sea level. This demonstrates the power of yoga.”Describing how yoga helped him in the journey, he said, “Yoga means you become one with the very source of creation, which is within every one of us. So when you are in touch with the source of creation, this is not a challenge. Effortlessly, I have done this at this stage.”Sadhguru began his yatra on a motorcycle, from Gorakhpur on August 9, travelling through Nepal and Tibet amid rain, landslides, rough terrain and altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. His route took him through Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Thulikhel in Nepal, before crossing into Tibet via Zhangmu, Nyalam and Saga.After reaching Lake Manasarovar, he trekked to Mount Kailash.Ahead of the journey, in an interaction with actor Dino Morea he had said, “I am not going to see Shiva. For me, the dimension we refer to as Shiva—when I close my eyes, that is where I am. I don’t have to go to Kailash for that. Kailash is the most spectacular library, but these days I am not going even for that.”He further added, “I'm taking a few hundred people with me. People when they wake up in the morning, do they say Shiva? No, they'll say stock market or cinema. So for those people with altitude and variety of other challenges, it lowers their concerns about stock market and we can get them to focus on something more profound.”Talking about the tariffs that the US has imposed on India, he said, “When challenges are thrown at us, it's for us to stand up sharper and stronger, which I think India will do for sure. Maintaining India's sovereignty, its freedom to do its business the way it wants to do, is something that we cannot give up as a free nation.”“Even when things are against you, you must thrive. That is the capacity we need to build. And this is a good example, this is a good lesson for us. To make sure that India thrives no matter what kind of conditions,” he furher added.","Sadhguru completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore.

This is a property of the state government, right?

Do you want commission?

Social media reacts



A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing. In the clip, which is now going viral on social media, the judge can be seen calling out the officer over alleged discrepancies and irregularities.The IAS officer’s name and posting remain unverified, but the judge is heard warning that an FIR will be filed to initiate an investigation.The incident reportedly took place when the judge was hearing a case related to land acquisition and compensation, but the IAS officer had objected to the compensation being offered to the petitioner.“Who are you to object? Ye state ka property hai na? () the judge can be heard saying in the video.""If the state has recognised any person as a ryot, who are you to say that person is not a ryot. You are an alien to the dispute,"" the judge further added.The judge also accused the officer of taking commissions while questioning his authority to object, saying he was preventing rightful awards from being given.“Commission chahiye aapko? () You want commission in each and every case? Under what authority you have objected? The award has been prepared.You are depriving the person of getting the award” the judge said.“You have to take contempt or I will lodge an FIR against you” he said.“Don’t raise a dispute if you are an outsider. In a property dispute, will you come in like a monkey to claim a share?” the judge can be heard saying.The video has drawn appreciation from the public for how the judge handled the situation.“Wow!! Simply awesome. So satisfying to watch this episode. The bureaucrat thought he was above law for a moment. Hats off to you, the judiciary, and judge,” a user commented.“If all Judges take the right approach and ask all IAS officers, EC, and ED to apply law as per the Constitution, 50 percent cases will go away from court,” commented another.“Judicial accountability in action! The judge's sharp questioning demonstrates that courts are taking corruption seriously. This direct approach could deter future misconduct if consistently applied across all levels of bureaucracy,” read another comment.","A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing.

I felt very elated… well, people outside India also know me. So I am thankful to them for giving me this recognition,” he quipped. “And I have also been receiving messages saying that apart from dog lovers, dogs are also giving me blessings and good wishes. In addition to human blessings and good wishes, I have their good wishes also.”On August 22, the bench led by Justice Nath stayed the August 11 ruling by a smaller two-judge bench, which had directed that stray dogs picked up from Delhi-NCR must not be released from shelters.The earlier ruling had sparked widespread protests by animal welfare activists and dog lovers.Modifying the order, the three-judge bench ruled that the dogs should be returned to the same location from where they were picked up — but only after being vaccinated and sterilised, aligning the directive with the existing animal welfare guidelines.The CJI shifted the case to Justice Nath's bench after it was brought to his (Gavai's) notice that the August 11 order was in conflict with earlier coordinate bench orders on the same matter.",Justice Vikram Nath headed the Supreme Court bench that overturned an earlier ruling on stray dogs in Delhi-NCR.

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The Army is raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

Both Himalayan states are battling extensive damage to lifeline routes as restoration crews raced against worsening weather.More than 660 roads, including four NHs, remained blocked in Himachal.

NEW DELHI: Dirty toilets. Delays in baggage retrieval. Long queues at check-in, security and immigration. Airports may soon pay for these lapses with reduced user development fees under a proposal from Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA).The regulator has issued a consultation paper to create uniform performance standards for all major airports - those handling more than 35 lakh passengers annually - and link compliance to tariff structures. Rewards will be offered for exceeding standards, penalties imposed for failing them. Third-party audits will verify compliance.Airport services are characterised by natural monopoly or limited competition, wherein users have limited options on service providers. In such an environment, the role of the regulator extends beyond tariff determination to ensuring that services are delivered efficiently, transparently, and to a standard that meets both operational and user expectations,"" the paper states.The proposed standards cover maximum wait times at every touchpoint - terminal entry, check-in, security, immigration and baggage retrieval. Cleanliness, availability of basic facilities, and use of tech such as Digi Yatra and immigration e-gates will also be assessed.""These standards are instrumental in safeguarding passenger interests, enhancing accountability, and promoting continuous improvement across airport operations,"" Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) said.The authority plans to categorise airports handling over 60 lakh passengers separately, citing differences in infrastructure and operational complexity.While airlines, CISF, Bureau of Immigration and ground-handling agencies handle specific functions, airport operators must ensure adequate counters and infrastructure, an industry insider said.""The aviation ecosystem is inter-linked. Ensuring checked-in baggage is on conveyor belt within allowed time is the airline's responsibility. A ground handling agency does this job for the airline and the agency has an agreement with the airport operator. Check-in is airline's responsibility, security check is CISF's... everything is connected,"" the insider said.A stakeholders' meeting is slated for next week. Comments on the proposal are open until Sept 24.","Proposed standards cover maximum wait times at every touchpoint.

We promised all states, all princes, that we will not take any wrong decision for any prince or king.

2L file objections seeking their names struck off Bihar poll rolls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2l-file-objections-seeking-their-names-struck-off-bihar-poll-rolls/articleshow/123622158.cms,"NEW DELHI: The over 2-lakh objections seeking the exclusion of 'ineligible' electors from Bihar's draft electoral roll, received till 3 pm Sunday, are essentially on behalf of those who had filled and submitted their enumeration forms as part of 'SIR' while already registered as a voter in a different polling booth, constituency or state, EC sources have said.After EC started serving notices to the likes of Muzaffarpur mayor and her relatives as well as to CPI(ML) Liberation MP Sudama Prasad's wife for maintaining two voter IDs, people who were listed on the draft roll based on enumeration forms signed by them but were simultaneously enrolled at their place of usual residence elsewhere, found it prudent to get their names struck off the roll, a commission official told TOI.Every enumeration form under SIR requires an elector to make a signed declaration that their name is not included in the roll of any other assembly or parliamentary constituency and the elector is aware that a false declaration is punishable under section 31 of Representation of the People Act, 1951, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year. ""The objections seeking exclusion from Bihar draft roll may have been prompted by fear of penal action under sect 31 for falsely claiming no prior enrolment as an elector,"" said an official.Significantly, the claims received from electors for inclusion in electoral roll number just 33,326, which is barely 16% of the objections seeking exclusion from the roll.Even at the level of political parties, the objections filed by their booth level agents (BLAs) seeking exclusion of ineligible electors (103) are more than four times the claims for 'inclusion' of eligible electors left out from the draft roll.Over 15.3 lakh enrolment applications had been received from newly eligible electors until 3 pm on Aug 31. With a nine-month gap between the last revision and SIR and the usual 2% addition of new voters every year, a figure of 12 lakh new additions on account of citizens attaining 18 years of age is normal. ""The remaining 3.3 lakh additions may be of electors who were never enrolled, despite being of eligible age,"" said an official. Around 3 lakh electors have been served notices over discrepancies in their documents - which put into doubt their eligibility under Article 326 of the Constitution that requires an elector to be at least 18 years of age and a citizen of India.","Over 2-lakh objections seeking the exclusion of 'ineligible' electors from Bihar's draft electoral roll, received till 3 pm Sunday.

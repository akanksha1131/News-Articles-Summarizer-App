'Why is it not paying tax?': Priyank Kharge levels ‘money laundering racket’ charge against RSS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/guru-dakshina-means-flag-priyank-kharge-levels-money-laundering-racket-charge-against-rss/articleshow/128405383.cms,"NEW DELHI: Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge on Sunday accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of indulging in “money laundering”, questioned its sources of income and asked why it was not paying taxes.Addressing a gathering at an event here, Kharge alleged financial irregularities and sought greater accountability from the organisation.""It (RSS) has a network of more than 2,500 organisations, they are from America, England. They take money from them. I am telling -- that these people are into money laundering,"" he said.Questioning the source of its funds, he added, ""they want us to be good citizens, pay income tax, but they want to remain free. How is it possible. We will have to question this.""Kharge said the same law and Constitution applicable to everyone in the country should apply to the RSS as well. Later, speaking to reporters, he pointed out that the RSS is an unregistered organisation and asked whether ""they are above law or Constitution.""""It is good that all organisations should come under the ambit of law and constitution, whether it is RSS or any other organisations. Are they above law and constitution. Mohan Bhagwat (RSS chief) says it (RSS) is a body of individuals. So is Bangalore Club, have they not registered? Are they not paying taxes?"" he further asked.Stating that his question is why the RSS was unregistered, he said, ""Where is their Guru Dakshina (donation) coming from.""Kharge said, ""If we ask about the source of RSS money, they tell us that we will get Guru Dakshina. However, when I did some research, according to them, Guru Dakshina means 'flag'. So, tomorrow morning, if I also hoist the blue flag and collect money, I will ask the government and them (RSS) whether they will agree. Thus, no one can escape baseless words. From now on, I will not give up until this RSS organisation is registered under the Constitution and the law. """"Who is paying it? Why is it (RSS) not paying tax? When every rupee of others is being accounted for, why is there no accountability for their (RSS) money,"" he asked.Kharge also took a swipe at the organisation over patriotism, saying, ""RSS did not hoist the national flag in their office for 52 years. They teach us about patriotism.""""Ramayana, written by Valmiki, is different; what is happening now is different. Politicians and religious leaders are talking about religion as they wish. No religion incites violence. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who says that one should have three children, is not getting married. However, he talks about raising other people's children. Thus, the BJP is constantly saying things outside and inside, and is sending the children of the poor to the streets,"" Kharge said.Meanwhile, Kharge launched a sharp attack on the demand to confer the Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar, asking why a person who, according to him, ""worked against Bharat"" should receive the country's highest civilian honour.In a post shared on X, Kharge posted a long list of questions targeting Savarkar's role during the freedom struggle. His attack came in response to comments made by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on February 8, at a two-day lecture series titled '100 Years of Sangh Journey - New Horizons'. Addressing questions over the delay in honouring Savarkar, Bhagwat said the award would elevate the prestige of the Bharat Ratna itself. Bhagwat further said that he was not on the decision-making committee but would raise the issue if given the chance.",Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of indulging in ‘money laundering’ He also questioned its sources of income and asked why it was not paying taxes.

'Pick up the baton': Mani Shankar Aiyar's pitch for Pinarayi Vijayan sparks row; Congress draws line,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pick-up-the-baton-mani-shankar-aiyars-pitch-for-pinarayi-vijayan-sparks-row-congress-draws-line/articleshow/128406148.cms,"‘No connection whatsoever with the Congress’

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Sunday stoked a fresh controversy after lauding Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and expressing hope for the return of the Left government in the upcoming assembly elections.This comes as the Congress seeks a return to power in Kerala in the polls scheduled for May this year.Speaking at an international seminar titled “Vision 2031: Development and Democracy”, Aiyar asked Vijayan to “pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped.”He added that it may appear ironic that the state which has made the most commendable progress towards that goal is Kerala, ruled by a “Marxist-Leninist party”.“I do not know whether this is a compliment or an insult, but I deeply regret the absence of my party colleagues on this occasion, which is a state occasion and therefore a national occasion. While Kerala is the first state in panchayati raj in practice, it ranks only second in law,” Aiyar said.“So, in the presence of the chief minister, who I am confident will continue in office, I renew my plea — to reinforce Kerala as the best panchayati raj state in the country.State laws should be amended based on practical experience, Thomas Isaac’s insights, the five-volume report I chaired, and the note on district planning by V K Ramachandran circulated by the Planning Commission when it truly supported panchayati raj,” he added.“Therefore, I must fall at your feet, Chief Minister Vijayan, and request you to pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped. Thank you, and may Kerala prosper,” he further said.Vijayan described Aiyar’s remarks as “charismatic words” that resonated with the current context.In a social media post about the Vision 2031 International Conference, he said Aiyar’s observations reflected the contemporary scenario and reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening grassroots democracy.“We stand united in the belief that democracy flourishes only when power resides with the people. We will continue to strengthen our local bodies as the heartbeat of growth,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader said.Meanwhile, Aiyar’s remarks did not go down well with the Congress leadership.Congress national spokesperson Pawan Khera sought to distance the party from Aiyar’s comments, saying he has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years.In a post on X, Khera said Aiyar “speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity”.""Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years. He speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity,"" Khera said.Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh also rubbished Aiyar's remarks and said that the United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to return to power in Kerala.“Let there be no doubt. The people of Kerala will bring the UDF back for more responsible and responsive governance. They also know the LDF and BJP are covert partners,” he said.","Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar asked Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to “pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped” He added that it may appear ironic that the state which has made the most commendable progress towards that goal is Kerala, ruled by a “Marxist-Leninist party”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128406192,imgsize-772505,width-400,resizemode-4/former-union-minister-mani-shankar-aiyar.jpg"
"Gujarat, Maharashtra, UP lead rooftop solar figures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-maharashtra-up-lead-rooftop-solar-figures/articleshow/128403876.cms,"NEW DELHI: Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP have emerged as frontrunners in rooftop solar installations, even as over 23 lakh rooftop solar systems (RTS) were installed across the country in the last two years under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana.Launched on Feb 13, 2024, with a financial outlay of Rs 75,021 crore, the scheme aims to install RTS in one crore households by March 2027. The Centre provides a one-time financial assistance of up to Rs 78,000 per household, while several states offer additional subsidies.According to the national portal, 23,68,383 systems with an aggregate capacity of about 8,691 MW have been installed till Feb 13 this year. Govt has released Rs 16,932.4 crore in subsidies.Under the scheme, a 3-kW solar plant can generate about 300 units of electricity per month — enough to reduce the bill to zero if consumption stays within that limit. More than 12.5 lakh consumers have received zero electricity bills in at least one month since the launch.The number of installations is estimated to be close to three million when statelevel subsidy programmes are included.Gujarat leads with nearly 5.6 lakh installations, followed by Maharashtra (4.5 lakh), UP (3.7 lakh) and Kerala (1.9 lakh).Adoption remains low in the Northeast: Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura together account for only 4,174 installations. Delhi, Goa, West Bengal and Chandigarh also have recorded modest numbers, with 6,209, 1,721, 1,265 and 1,050 installations, respectively.Govt acknowledged that nearly three-fourths of installations are concentrated in 1011 states. Many states are yet to notify virtual net-metering guidelines that allow consumers to feed surplus power into the grid and receive payment. “This is a model with a customer-first approach. It has become immensely popular,” said JVN Subramanyam, joint secretary, ministry of new and renewable energy.","Gujarat leads with nearly 5.6 lakh installations, followed by Maharashtra (4.5 lakh), UP (3.7 lakh) and Kerala (1.9 lakh).

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

Parliamentary approval process underway

Double contributions convention to be implemented in parallel

Tariff reductions and market access

The India-UK free trade agreement signed in July last year is expected to be implemented from April 2026, a government official said.India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025, under which 99 per cent of Indian exports will enter the British market at zero duty, while India will reduce tariffs on a range of British goods including cars and whisky.“We are expecting the pact to be implemented from April this year,” the official said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The agreement requires approval from the UK Parliament before it can take effect. In India, such trade agreements are cleared by the Union Cabinet.According to PTI, after ratification by the British Parliament, the pact will be implemented on a mutually agreed date. The House of Commons held a debate on the India-UK CETA earlier this week.Chris Bryant, minister of state in the UK Department for Business and Trade, responded during the debate on behalf of the Labour government, describing CETA as a significant achievement that goes “well beyond India's precedent in opening the door for UK businesses”.The British Parliament is currently ratifying the agreement, including debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, along with committee reviews, before implementation in the coming months.Alongside CETA, the two countries have signed a Double Contributions Convention (DCC) pact to prevent temporary workers from having to pay social security contributions in both countries.The official said both CETA and the DCC are likely to be implemented in parallel, as per PTI.CETA aims to double bilateral trade, currently estimated at $56 billion, between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies by 2030.Under the agreement, India will reduce import duties on Scotch whisky from 150 per cent to 75 per cent immediately, with a further reduction to 40 per cent by 2035.Also read| India-UK trade deal: From 99% duty-free access to benefits for Indian professionals - Here’s the FTA in 10 big numbers Import duties on automobiles will be cut to 10 per cent over five years from the current levels of up to 110 per cent, under a quota-based liberalisation system.In return, Indian exporters are set to gain improved access to the UK market for goods such as textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, sports goods and toys.India has also agreed to lower tariffs on British consumer products including chocolates, biscuits and cosmetics.During his visit to India in 2025, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed the desire for the agreement to be implemented as soon as “humanly possible.”Speaking in Mumbai in October last year, Starmer described the trade deal as Britain’s largest post-Brexit trade achievement and said he had instructed his team to ensure it is executed “as quickly as humanly possible”.Also read| India-UK trade deal: Starmer wants FTA implementation as soon as 'humanly possible'! The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to London in July 2025.Economists estimate the pact could increase trade between the two countries by about £25.5 billion ($34 billion) by 2040, with UK officials describing that figure as a starting point for further growth.If implemented as expected in April 2026, the agreement would mark a significant step in expanding bilateral economic ties and reducing tariff barriers across key sectors.","India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025.

In a format where supremacy is often short-lived and margins razor-thin, the team has an opportunity to defend a men’s T20 World Cup title — an achievement that would further strengthen their legacy in the shortest format. India are also aiming to become the first nation to lift the T20 World Cup trophy on home soil.A successful campaign would also make India the first team to win the men’s T20 World Cup three times.India’s journey in the tournament began with glory in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they defeated Pakistan in the final at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win. India edged past South Africa in a thrilling final to finally end their prolonged title drought.Now, with momentum on their side, India will look to script another historic chapter in T20 World Cup history.","India begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against USA on Saturday.

"Villages in Noida in grip of child-lifting rumours; parents quit jobs, change shifts: ‘We can’t take chances’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/villages-in-noida-in-grip-of-child-lifting-rumours/articleshow/128401541.cms,"Image used for representative purpose only





NOIDA: Guddi has quit two cooking jobs so she can be home at Sarfabad early each afternoon. Her six-year-old son walks back from school, and the fear of what might happen on the way has become overwhelming.""Once children leave the school gate, the school authorities say that they are not responsible,"" she said. ""That scared many of us. We can't take chances.""Guddi's decision was driven by panic as rumours of girls going missing swirled through village pockets across Noida, with unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in recent weeks. Neighbourhood conversations and social media forwards have triggered panic among parents despite repeated assurances from police and NGOs that there is no evidence to support them.The latest rumours, similar to the pre-Covid hysteria about children going missing — which led to several lynchings and WhatsApp enforcing curbs on forwards — have been triggered by a report circulating on social media in Jan about girls going missing in Delhi, police said.Senior police officers told TOI that no complaint or verified report of a child abduction had been received. “These appear to be hoaxes, possibly triggered by misleading social media messages,” an officer said, urging residents to avoid spreading unverified information.Fear has nonetheless reshaped daily routines. Several women have quit jobs, men have changed shifts, children are not being sent to school, and locals are putting up watches for child lifters. “We rush back every day to be with our children,” said another domestic staffer from Sarfabad, who works in a nearby high-rise society. “Even if this turns out to be false, the fear is real.”Several non-profits and schools reported a visible impact. Mala Bhandari, founder of a Noida-based NGO, said attendance dropped sharply in centres operating in Nagla, Tugalpur and Haldoni. “Parents stopped sending children altogether,” she said. “When our team did field visits, we found no incidents.”Another NGO temporarily shut operations after first hearing the rumour from children. “We closed for a few days because attendance dropped,” the owner said. “When we cross-checked with families, no one had seen or knew a victim. It was unverified talk, but the panic had already spread.”Primary schools in nearby villages reported similar disruptions. A teacher in Harola said attendance dropped as rumours intensified, though follow-ups revealed no abduction cases. “Some absences were also for personal reasons, like family weddings,” she said.In some schools, the response was precautionary. Sunita, a teacher at a private school in one of the villages, said the management circulated consent forms asking parents to pre-declare how children would commute and who would collect them. “Students are released only to authorised guardians,” she said. “There are no such cases here that we know of, but awareness feels necessary.”A police officer said such episodes are not new. Similar rumours have surfaced in the past, briefly fuelling fear before being debunked. The concern, they added, is that misinformation, especially when amplified online, can quickly disrupt community life and strain trust.The panic echoes 2018 and 2019, when India witnessed a spate of mob violence sparked by suspicions of child lifting, many of them triggered by viral WhatsApp messages. According to data compiled by Centre for Study of Society and Secularism, there were 41 reported incidents of mob violence in 2018 linked to such rumours, making child-lifting fears the leading trigger that year. Though National Crime Records Bureau does not maintain data for mob lynching, making comprehensive tracking difficult, at least 20 people were killed in the mob attack during the period.","Unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in Noida, India.

Stock market today: After deep cuts towards the end of last week, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened in red on Monday. While Nifty50 was below 25,450, BSE Sensex dropped over 100 points in opening trade. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,434.35, down 37 points or 0.14%. BSE Sensex was at 82,520.90, down 106 points or 0.13%.Last week, Nifty and Sensex closed in red, with benchmark indices slipping about 1% as concerns over artificial intelligence-led disruption and heavy selling in technology stocks weighed on investor sentiment. Analysts said that with technology shares undergoing repricing and uncertainty surrounding AI-driven disruption persisting, investors should adopt a selective and risk-managed investment approach.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The IT sell-off last week will continue to weigh on markets in the near-term. The mild recovery in IT ADRs on Friday is unlikely to support IT stocks. Institutions are likely to continue selling IT stocks and switch to sectors like financials, automobiles, capital goods, telecom and pharma where there is good earnings growth visibility.Brent crude is delicately balanced at around $68 on the concerns surrounding the geopolitical tensions between US and Iran. This has to be closely watched.Investors can use the current volatility in the market to churn portfolios in favour of growth sectors like those mentioned earlier. Overall, the market prospects for 2026 appear good since fundamentals are improving and valuations have turned reasonable in tune with long-term averages. Mid and small caps, though relatively overvalued, are reporting better-than-expected earnings.""In the United States, the S&P 500 ended marginally higher on Friday after inflation data indicated easing price pressures. However, the Nasdaq finished lower as major technology and communication services stocks declined amid continuing concerns about the potential impact of artificial intelligence on existing business models.Asian markets traded in a narrow range, alternating between modest gains and losses. Softer US inflation data strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates later this year, helping stabilize sentiment after recent volatility linked to AI-related disruption fears.Foreign portfolio investors remained net sellers, offloading equities worth Rs 7,395 crore on Friday. Domestic institutional investors, in contrast, were net buyers, purchasing shares worth Rs 5,554 crore, according to exchange data.","After deep cuts towards the end of last week, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in red on Monday.

Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25.

Combat Proven SCALP Missiles Push India, France Defence Ties Into Next Phase After Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: US commander of Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel J. Paparo, during his India visit on Sunday, “applauded the tactical execution” of the Indian military operations against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and said “there is always a lesson to learn from every conflict in the world”.He said the US-India defence relationship is on a “steeply upward trajectory”, even as he flagged concerns about increasing “coercion” and “aggression” in the Indo-Pacific region.In reply to a TOI query about his views on Op Sindoor, the US commander, who was interacting with a select group of journalists, said, “First of all, I have tremendous reverence for the terrible event (Pahalgam terror attack) that preceded the crisis. In my discussion with my partners, I applaud the tactical execution (of operations). We also sincerely applaud the restraint that was exhibited. We hope to work together to see that such a terrible event doesn't happen again. ” The Admiral also said that he has seen a deep commitment from the Indian military to learn lessons from this conflict.Asked what lessons the US took away from Op Sindoor which saw Chinese weapons being used by Pakistan, Admiral Paparo said, “Complex long-range weapons have complex long- range kill chains”.With the “combination of sensors, communication, propulsion, warheads, seekers in the 21st century, geography is no longer a commodity...”On China’s increasing military might, the Admiral, who is responsible for all US military operations in the region, said, “Deterrence is our highest duty. It is my job to think through the worst-case scenario and to be prepared for that. India shares some of those concerns in the Indo-Pacific, as the region is home to 60% of the world’s population, more than 60% of the world’s GDP and seven of the world’s largest militaries.“We deal with those concerns with the growing partnerships... mutually respectful, sovereign relationship between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy,” he said, adding both the US and India are committed to the principles of sovereignty, freedom of navigation and freedom of seas.“We applaud India as a great net contributor to the security of the Indian Ocean region,” he said. The two sides are also looking at boosting maritime security cooperation, including in the sphere of undersea domain awareness.With the impending MILAN exercise in mind, Admiral Paparo said, “It is great to see the deepening of Indo-US defence partnership, enshrined in the recent defence agreement signed in Kuala Lumpur (Oct 31, 2025) between US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh. A number of joint exercises like Yudh Abhyas in Alaska, MILAN, Malabar series, COPE India exercise and Tiger Triumph series and people-to-people contacts are strengthening the ties between India and the US. And we treasure this relationship.”About modern warfare strategies, the Admiral said, “Increasingly, the 21st century will be dominated by actors who master the information environment, that is, space, counter-space, electronic warfare, low observability and other technologies.”On the upcoming AI summit hosted by India, he said, “PM Modi’s visionary AI summit. I celebrate India’s vision on how to make use of AI in the 21st century. AI has many defence connections and United States Indo-Pacific Command is at the forefront of AI employment for defence.”",US commander of Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel J.

Pakistan Admits US-Backed Jihad In Afghan Wars A Mistake, But Still Accuses India Of Proxy War

NEW DELHI: India must continue to expose Pakistan’s nexus with terrorist groups and its tendency to pursue a proxy war against neighbouring countries as Islamabad has long evaded accountability due to the apathy of the international community, a latest report in a US-based independent journal has said.“Simultaneously, India needs to enhance its anti-terrorism apparatus to effectively tackle the scourge of Pakistan sponsored terrorism single-handedly and in addition to military retribution, also consider non-kinetic measures that impose a prohibitive cost on Islamabad,” said the report in Eurasia Review.Writing for Eurasia Review, former army officer Nilesh Kunwar said, “While its designation may sound impressive, the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee is unfortunately just a ‘paper tiger’ that bases its reports on feedback from member states without investigating the same or giving any directions. Its recently released 37th report has linked Pakistan based proscribed terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad to the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam attack, the Nov 9, 2025, Red Fort suicide car bombing, as well as its formal announcement of a women-only wing named Jamaat-ul-Muminat created for waging global jihad. However, by qualifying that these incidents or developments were what a member state (implying India) had noted, the UN report has characteristically not endorsed its own observations on the same.”It further said, “While there’s no doubt that the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team lacks ‘teeth’ and doesn’t act as an effective deterrent, yet, this report does provide diplomatic leverage. In the instant case, India definitely has an advantage since unlike Islamabad’s palpably false claim of JeM being “defunct,” which is a feeble defence -- New Delhi’s assertions on JeM’s activities are corroborated by irrefutable hard evidence,” it said.The attempt of DG ISPR (media wing of Pakistan armed forces) to deny JeM chief’s presence in the country was laughable because just a few days earlier, Pakistan’s then foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not only confirmed Masood Azhar’s presence in Pakistan but even given his health update by saying, “He is very unwell… to the extent that he cannot leave his house,” the report said.There is definitely a need for India to be more proactive and expose Pakistan’s ongoing use of terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy more forcefully by following the ‘name and shame’ policy, it said.",India must continue to expose Pakistan’s nexus with terrorist groups.

COLOMBO: It was barely five minutes after the match was over at the Premadasa Stadium on Sunday when Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube were back in the middle, bowling on the practice pitches. No over-the-top celebrations, no outpouring of emotions, just a sense of another routine victory against a Pakistan team that India don’t think are their match at the moment.The 61-run win, the fourth on the bounce after their hat-trick of victories against their once arch-rivals in the Asia Cup, have now ensured a Super-8 spot for India. A lot had happened in the build-up to this game and even on Sunday, the much-anticipated handshakes between the captains didn’t happen.While the unease off the pitch persisted, India were just too much when the ball rolled. Even a few months ago, Ishan Kishan (77 off 40 balls) wasn’t even close to a spot in the Indian T20 team. But now that he is there, the 27-year old is proving that he can give his teammate Abhishek Sharma a run for his money as the best T20 opener in the world.Abhishek’s early dismissal on a slow Premadasa track could have been a big blow, but not when Ishan was in the form that he is in. The Pakistan bowlers were dealt with disdain and the cuts and sweeps that the Jharkhand boy unleashed took India to 52 runs in the first six overs, which was at least 20 over par on this track.“The pitch was not that easy. Sometimes, you just have to believe and focus on your strengths. I was just watching the ball, sticking to my strengths and making them run as much as possible,” Man of the Match Kishan said at the end of the match.After his exit, India showed smartness to reach a total of 175 against some quality spin, pushing Pakistan into taking tremendous risks right at the beginning of their chase.They were not up for it with Jasprit Bumrah (2-17) and Hardik Pandya (2-16) doing the early damage. The spinners, who bowled 18 of Pakistan’s 20 overs, came into play for India only after the pacemen had all but sealed the deal.“This is for India. We played the brand of cricket we wanted to play. We thought 175 was 15-20 runs over par — 155 would have made it a very tight game,” captain Surya Kumar Yadav said, as the thousands of touring Indian fans went home a happy lot.",India beat Pakistan by 61 runs to reach the Super-8 stage of the Asia Cup.

Faith Versus Access Debate Erupts As Char Dham Temples Kedarnath, Badrinath Weigh Ban On Non Hindus

The big picture: Growth almost identical to the world

A religion defined by geography

Growth driven by births, not conversions

Living mostly as a majority

Age structure and fertility patterns

The global future of Hinduism

There was once a phrase that economists used, sometimes flippantly and often unfairly, to describe India’s slow economic expansion in the decades after Independence. They called it the “Hindu rate of growth” — a shorthand for stagnation, caution and incremental change. The term has long since fallen out of favour in economic discourse. But in an unexpected way, it could be used to describe the actual Hindu growth of rate.According to the Pew Research Center’s global demographic study “How the Global Religious Landscape Changed From 2010 to 2020,” the actual Hindu rate of growth today turns out to be strikingly literal. The world’s Hindu population has been expanding almost exactly in line with the growth of humanity itself. Neither surging dramatically nor shrinking in relative terms, Hinduism’s demographic story is one of stability in a century defined by rapid religious change.New global religion data suggests that when it comes to population trends, Hindus today embody something remarkably close to that old metaphor. The global Hindu population is growing, steadily and predictably, almost exactly in step with the world itself.Neither surging dramatically like some faiths nor shrinking in relative terms like others, Hinduism’s demographic story is one of continuity rather than upheaval.Between 2010 and 2020, the global Hindu population rose from roughly 1.07 billion to about 1.2 billion — an increase of around 126 million people in just one decade. Yet their share of the world’s population remained nearly unchanged at about 15%.This reflects an almost perfect demographic alignment. During the same period, the world population itself grew by roughly 12%, and the Hindu population expanded at nearly the same pace.By contrast, other major religions experienced sharper shifts. Muslims increased their share of the global population, while Christians saw their proportion decline. Hindus stood out as the only major group whose global footprint remained essentially stable.One of the most striking numbers in global religious demographics is the degree of Hindu concentration. About 99% of Hindus live in the Asia-Pacific region. Even more remarkably, roughly 95% reside in just one country: India. Nepal accounts for most of the remaining share. This makes Hinduism the most geographically concentrated major religion in the world. India alone determines the demographic trajectory of nearly a billion people.Unlike Christianity or Islam, which are spread across continents and cultures, Hinduism remains overwhelmingly anchored to a single civilisational geography.Another key finding is that Hindu population change is driven overwhelmingly by natural increase rather than religious switching.Globally, conversion into or out of Hinduism occurs at relatively low levels compared with other religions. This means births minus deaths — not changes in religious identity — shape the long-term trajectory.In demographic terms, Hinduism is one of the least mobile religious identities. Most followers continue to identify with the religion in which they were raised.Few religions are as closely associated with majority status as Hinduism. About 97% of Hindus worldwide live in countries where they form the dominant religious group, primarily India and Nepal. This is the highest majority concentration among all major faiths. By comparison, Christians and Muslims are far more geographically dispersed, with large shares living as minorities in multiple regions.The age profile of Hindus closely mirrors India’s demographic structure. India’s median age is around 28 years, significantly younger than Europe’s median age of over 40. Because India is home to about 95% of Hindus, the global Hindu population also has a relatively youthful base.This youthful demographic momentum helps sustain population growth even as fertility rates decline. India’s total fertility rate has fallen dramatically over the past half century, yet its large young population continues to drive expansion.Looking ahead, the future of Hinduism will remain tightly linked to India’s demographic transition. As fertility rates continue to fall and the population gradually ages, growth will slow in relative terms, even though total numbers will continue to rise for decades. In that sense, the modern “Hindu rate of growth” no longer implies stagnation. It reflects something far more distinctive: a billion-strong religion growing steadily, predictably, and almost perfectly in step with the world itself. In an era of dramatic religious shifts, that kind of numerical stability is a story in its own right.","The world’s Hindu population has been expanding almost exactly in line with the growth of humanity itself.

Railways quietly upgrades network: 81% tracks ready for 110 kmph speed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-quietly-upgrades-network-81-tracks-ready-for-110-kmph-speed/articleshow/128395262.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The govt informed Parliament in the last sessionthat nearly 81% of railway tracks are ready to allow trains to run at speeds of over 110 kmph, a two-fold increase compared to 2014. One-fifth of the existing tracks allow trains to run at speeds of more than 130 kmph.This is significant since the increase in sectional speeds has happened across the railway network rather than being a limited, corridor-based upgrade. As per govt data, 84,888 km out of the little less than 1.1-lakh-km of railway network has been upgraded to support speeds of 110 kmph and above and 23,477 km of this is capable of train operations at 130 kmph and above.This systemic upgrade is allowing railways to introduce new-age Vande Bharat -- both chair car and sleeper trains -- and Amrit Bharat trains that can run at faster speeds.Experts said the upgrade of sectional speeds is also important considering that unlike countries such as China, Japan and France, which achieved higher speeds primarily through the laying of new, passenger-only high-speed rail lines, India has pursued a fundamentally different and more complex path.The Indian approach has focussed on upgrading existing tracks that carry mixed traffic -- passenger and freight — which is far more challenging than building segregated high-speed corridors, as it requires strengthening track geometry, signalling, electrification and safety systems without disrupting daily operations.Railway ministry officials said India’s strategy has seen large contiguous stretches of tracks being upgraded progressively from 110 kmph to 130 kmph and further to 160 kmph.“This creates a laddered speed ecosystem rather than a sharp division between ‘slow’ conventional lines and isolated high-speed routes. Such gradation allows trains, crew training and signalling systems to evolve organically, reducing transition risks,” said an official.The speed capability is also spread across all railway zones, including freight-intensive zones such as East Central Railway, South East Central Railway and South Central Railway. “This ensures national uniformity and avoids the creation of elite, passenger-centric corridors disconnected from the rest of the network,” the official said.Railways run some of the world’s longest freight trains, carry over 2.5 crore passengers daily, operate with heavy axle loads of 22.9–25 tonnes, and maintain long welded rails, full electrification and increasingly automated signalling—all on the same tracks. No other railway system has attempted speed upgrades under such constraints at a comparable scale, they added.",Nearly 81% of railway tracks are ready to allow trains to run at speeds of over 110 kmph. This is significant since the increase in sectional speeds has happened across the railway network.

“From Compassion To Combat, Operation Sindoor Reflects New India” Rajnath Singh

Trade deals part of global integration: PM

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday cited the global context to argue in favour of modernising India’s defence sector, while calling upon the private sector to step up its act and share the gains with workers and shareholders.“Since Day 1, our govt has been clear we will do whatever it takes to support our defence forces and strengthen them. Yes, this year’s allocation is a record high, but viewing it in isolation only provides a limited perspective...As technology reshapes the world, our armed forces must be equipped with the best of Indian innovation and industry. As a nation that is playing an increasingly important role in the world, we have a duty to modernise our defence sector in line with current realities,” PM Modi told PTI in an interview.The comments come in the backdrop of an increasingly-fragile world, which is undergoing a shift in the power equations with the US and China seeking to stamp their expansionist policies, while conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia have been going on with no immediate resolution in sight. India has to contend with hostilities in the neighbourhood with cyber technology adding to challenges.The PM referred to Operation Sindoor, which showed India’s familiarisation with the tech warfare.The entire nation is proud of the courage shown by our armed forces during Operation Sindoor. During the operation, one could see the benefits of the reforms we have undertaken in the last decade. Therefore, defence budgets, modernisation, etc, all these are parts of our continuous effort and need not be linked to any particular issue. Yes, the reality is that our nation has to be strong and be prepared at all times, and that is what we are doing,” PM Modi said.Asked about the recent trade agreements, the PM said that they have been part of India’s global integration with the world, which has picked pace in recent times. Asserting that the recent deals — from the UK to the EU — have been in the pipeline for years and will help Indian producers diversify their markets besides opening opportunities for service professionals.“These trade agreements are significant not merely because of tariff reductions but because of supply-chain integration and market access in advanced economies. They gradually liberalise manufacturing tariffs, deepen services integration and create new avenues for labour-intensive exports such as textiles, footwear, electronics and engineering goods. In that sense, they support structural transformation rather than simply boosting headline trade numbers. These FTAs also anchor domestic reform to external commitments. They widen export opportunities, reduce tariff disadvantages relative to competitors, and integrate Indian firms more deeply into global value chains,” the PM said. PM Modi also called on the private sector for a “decisive response” to the govt’s reforms, for which he redoubled his vow.“Indian firms must invest more aggressively in research and development, adopt frontier technologies, deepen supply-chain capabilities and compete on quality and productivity rather than on protected margins. Incentives and tariff preferences can catalyse growth, but durable competitiveness must rest on innovation, efficiency and scale. Equally, as productivity rises, the gains must be shared fairly between workers, shareholders and owner-managers. Sustainable growth requires social legitimacy. Rising real wages, skill upgrading, and stable employment reinforce domestic demand and social cohesion, which, in turn, support long-term investment,” he said.Asked about the Budget’s emphasis on women, PM said welfare of women guided every govt decision. “...it is a matter of national pride that our finance minister, Nirmala Ji has presented the Budget nine consecutive times, which is a record and a matter of pride in itself. Several women across India feel inspired by this,” he said.While listing out several initiatives in the Budget, the PM made special reference to the announcement related to hostels. “Many girls drop out not because of a lack of talent, but because commuting long distances to labs and late study hours are difficult. This intervention directly addresses that constraint.”Further, PM Modi said the steps related to training of Allied Health Professionals, which will benefit women. “Women have always been at the centre of caregiving, but this is largely in the informal sector. By training 1.5 lakh caregivers next year and expanding institutions for Allied Health Professionals, with a target of 1 lakh trained over 5 years, we are embarking on a large-scale effort to formalise care work. This does two things: it creates dignified, certified employment for women and simultaneously strengthens India’s healthcare capacity.”","Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited the global context to argue in favour of modernising India’s defence sector. He called upon the private sector to step up its act and share the gains with workers and shareholders.

'New World Order Emerging, India Ready To Lead As Global Growth Engine', Says PM Modi At ET Summit

Congress calls PM Modi's interview 'scripted'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday outlined India’s reform priorities for the next decade, asserting that his government’s “Reform Express” has delivered systemic transformation and benefitted common citizens in a significant way.In an interview to PTI, PM Modi said that his top three reform priorities for the coming decade will be continued structural reforms, deeper innovation and further simplification of governance, as India moves towards the goal of a “Viksit Bharat”.Asserting that his government’s reform push has moved beyond incremental changes, PM Modi said, “Reform is the commitment of this government, something we have shown in letter and spirit. I am proud to say that we have moved from incremental adjustments to systemic transformation.”When asked to prioritise three economic reforms for the next decade, he said, “Our direction is clear, rather than limiting it to a fixed number.“First, we will continue structural reforms that improve competitiveness and productivity. Second, we will deepen innovation in technology, manufacturing and services. Third, we will simplify governance further so that citizens and businesses can operate with greater ease and trust,” he said.He said that India’s growth story is being shaped by fundamental changes in governance and economic policy. Highlighting the country’s digital transformation, PM Modi said, “India is a digital leader in the world made possible by fundamental reforms in how people transact via the UPI platform.”The prime minister also emphasised the role of data infrastructure in the coming years. “Data centres will be a massive job creator for our youth; we invite whole world’s data to reside in India,” he said.On infrastructure, PM Modi said that India is witnessing an unprecedented expansion. “India witnessing most expansive infra push in its history, built with future readiness in mind,” he told PTI, underlining that infrastructure development is being planned with long-term needs in focus.PM Modi also described productive capital expenditure as a hallmark of his government and said the latest Union Budget avoided short-term populism. Instead, it prioritised record capital outlays to create jobs and strengthen long-term growth.Also Read | 'Focus less on margins': PM Modi says private sector 'critical' for Viksit Bharat, offers strong advise - top quotes He said that India’s goods exports have repeatedly broken earlier records in recent years, reflecting improved competitiveness and global integration.“Our national character has revealed itself even in challenging times; we are bright growth spot in difficult global circumstances,” he said, pointing to India’s resilience amid global economic uncertainty.On trade policy, the prime minister said that India’s free trade agreements are aimed at expanding opportunities for small businesses.“Our FTAs designed to expand market access for MSMEs in textile, leather, chemicals, handicrafts, gems and other sectors,” he said.Looking ahead, PM Modi stressed that the next leap towards a developed India will depend heavily on private sector participation. “Next leap to Viksit Bharat will depend on bold investment by pvt sector in innovation, long-term capacity, global competitiveness,” he said.He also underlined the role of women in India’s development journey. “It is my conviction that women will play the most important role in creating Viksit Bharat,” he said.Framing the broader vision, PM Modi said that the current policy direction should be seen as laying the foundation for long-term national goals. The reforms and investments being undertaken now, he suggested, are meant to prepare India for sustained growth over the next quarter-century.The Congress party reacted sharply to PM Modi's interview calling it “carefully scripted and desperate PR exercise”. Party leader Jairam Ramesh in a post on X said that the interview was timed to divert attention from criticism over the Union Budget and the Opposition’s attack on the government in Parliament.“The PM knows that this year’s Budget has been a damp squib and shows every sign of intellectual exhaustion.

“Deal Favours US farmers” Opposition Attacks India-US Trade Framework

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday reacted sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s interview with news agency PTI, calling it a “carefully scripted and desperate PR exercise” and alleging that it was aimed at diverting attention from key issues.Party leader Jairam Ramesh said that the interview was timed to divert attention from criticism over the Union Budget and the Opposition’s attack on the government in Parliament.“The PM knows that this year’s Budget has been a damp squib and shows every sign of intellectual exhaustion. Markets have reacted negatively and investors have been unimpressed. Hence, he feels the need to give an interview a fortnight after the Budget was presented and a few days after it was taken apart by the Opposition in Parliament.

He maintained that none of his government’s budgets were prepared with the attitude of creating a routine “bahi khata” document.Highlighting digital growth and infrastructure expansion, PM Modi said India is a global digital leader due to reforms in transactions through the UPI platform and added that data centres would be a massive job creator.He also said India is witnessing the most expansive infrastructure push in its history and emphasised that the government will do whatever it takes to support and modernise the defence forces.The prime minister criticised the previous UPA government’s record, saying that during its rule, talks would begin and then break down, with little real substance achieved despite long negotiations.He also said political stability and predictability have restored investor confidence in India and asserted that the welfare of women guides every decision taken by his government.",The Congress on Sunday reacted sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s interview with news agency PTI.

UN Flags Jaish-e-Mohammed Role In Delhi Red Fort Attack Raises Alarm Over Masood Azhar's Women Wing

NEW DELHI: The “white-collar” terror module recently uncovered by J&K Police, in which several doctors were arrested, revealed that after being radicalised in 2016 they formed a new terror outfit called “Ansar Interim” to carry out subversive activities in the Union Territory and beyond, officials said on Sunday.The case is now being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The inter-state terror network first came to light after JeM posters appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, on the outskirts of Srinagar, on October 19. Srinagar police registered a case and analysed CCTV footage, leading to the arrest of three locals — Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid — all of whom had prior stone-pelting cases, reported PTI.Their interrogation led to the arrest of Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic turned Imam from Shopian, who allegedly supplied the posters and used his access to radicalise the doctors.Investigators later found that the accused doctors — Muzamil Gannie, Umer-un-Nabi (now dead), and Adeel Rather — along with his brother Muzzafar Rather (absconding), Maulvi Irfan, Qari Aamir, and Tufail Gazi had met at Eidgah in downtown Srinagar in April 2022.During this meeting, they decided to form the terror organisation “Ansar Interim,” naming Adeel as the ‘Ameer’ (chief), Maulvi Irfan as ‘Deputy Ameer,’ and Gannie as treasurer.Officials noted that among militant groups, “Ansar” is commonly associated with the globally banned terror outfit Al-Qaeda.The arrested doctors and preachers told interrogators that they formed a new group after losing contact with active terrorists. Roles and operational codes were assigned, with Umer taking charge as coordinator and, along with Gannie, handling finances and procurement.In 2023, the group began acquiring materials, including fertiliser from Sohna and Nuh in Haryana. On Umer’s instructions, NPK — commonly known as Potassium Nitrate in this context — was also purchased from a chemical shop in Faridabad.During interrogation, the arrested doctors said Umer watched online videos to learn rudimentary Improvised Explosive Device (IED) construction and managed to prepare Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP), a peroxide explosive used in several terrorist attacks as the filling for IEDs, as reported by PTI.Officials said Adeel began recruiting members and brought in an individual named Danish, alias Jasir, from South Kashmir. Adeel took him to a rented accommodation within Al-Falah University in Faridabad, where both saw Umer and Gannie preparing TATP explosive materials.Umer later tried to persuade Danish to carry out a ‘fidayeen’ (suicide) attack, but he backed out at the last minute, citing his poor economic condition and the belief that suicide was forbidden in Islam.Umer, a 28-year-old doctor from Pulwama, is believed to have been the most radicalised member and key operative in a network spanning Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Officials suspect he had been planning a powerful Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) blast, intending to place it in a crowded location in the national capital or at a site of religious importance and then flee.However, the plot collapsed after Srinagar police arrested Gannie and seized explosives, prompting Umer to panic and leading to the premature blast outside the Red Fort on November 10, which killed over a dozen people. Investigators also found that Umer had earlier tried unsuccessfully to join terror groups in 2016 and 2018.","The inter-state terror network first came to light after JeM posters appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, on the outskirts of Srinagar.

AI models & campus labs: India's tech push at summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-models-campus-labs-indias-tech-push-at-summit/articleshow/128397778.cms,"“Delhi Fully Prepared For AI Summit,” Says Kuljeet Chahal As NDMC Unveils Grand Illumination Drive

NEW DELHI: India will launch its first set of sovereign AI models, announce major national AI research programmes, expand shared computing facilities, and roll out AI labs across 500 universities at AI Impact Summit 2026.Earlier, electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had said home-grown models are ready for public use and will be unveiled at the summit. Trained on Indian datasets, the models are designed to handle the country's linguistic diversity and sector-specific challenges, ranging from governance and healthcare to science and industry.A key focus of the push is talent creation. Vaishnaw said industry-led AI labs, along with GPUs, models and standardised curriculum, will be introduced in 500 universities to build a large national talent pipeline. Students will get hands-on access to AI infrastructure and real-world use cases, helping bridge the gap between education and industry needs.The fourth AI Impact Summit will be the largest edition so far and the first to be hosted in the Global South. It is expected to see participation from over 100 countries, and of more than 100 global AI leaders at CEO and CXO level and over 500 experts. The summit aims at delivering at least 10 actionable outcomes, backed by over 500 pre-events held in India and abroad.Highlighting India's focus on industry-driven AI deployment, Vaishnaw said Indian IT firms have already built over 200 sector-focused AI models aimed at improving productivity and efficiency. On infrastructure, he said nearly $70 billion has already flowed into AI-related investments, with the figure expected to rise further. He also underlined India's energy readiness, noting that almost half of the country's power capacity now comes from green sources.With sovereign models, campus labs and clear roadmaps on safe and trusted AI, the summit marks India's strongest push yet to turn AI ambition into real-world impact.","The fourth AI Impact Summit will be the largest edition so far and the first to be hosted in the Global South.

NEW DELHI: At least nine people were injured on Sunday after a confrontation broke out between BJP and Congress workers in Pune during a protest over remarks made by Congress leader Harshwardhan Sapkal that allegedly equated Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with Tipu Sultan.The clash took place outside the Congress Bhavan, where BJP workers had gathered to protest against Sapkal’s comments. The situation escalated into sloganeering and stone pelting from both sides, leading to minor injuries.Joint Commissioner of Police Ranjan Kumar Sharma said that three Congress workers, two BJP workers, two police personnel and two journalists were injured in the incident.""A protest was held near the Congress Bhavan, which saw sloganeering from workers of BJP and Congress. Workers of both parties climbed onto walls and there was stone pelting from both sides. Cases are being registered against workers of both sides,"" Sharma informed.Police deployed heavy security in the area to prevent further escalation.The controversy stems from Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal’s recent remarks, in which he referred to the valour of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and cited Tipu Sultan’s resistance against the British as being on similar lines.The comments triggered political backlash in the state.Speaking to reporters, Sapkal said: ""The kind of bravery that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj possessed and the concept of 'Swarajya' (self-rule) that he introduced... much later, following in that very tradition and taking inspiration from his ideals, Tipu Sultan waged war against the British.""""In that sense, Tipu Sultan was a great warrior who displayed immense bravery and was a true son of India. He never allowed any poisonous or communal ideas to sway him. As a symbol of bravery, we should view Tipu Sultan as equivalent to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,"" he added.A day earlier, a separate row had erupted over a portrait of Tipu Sultan displayed in the office of the deputy mayor of the Malegaon Municipal Corporation, which was opposed by Shiv Sena corporators and Hindu outfits.Pune city Congress chief Arvind Shinde said that the party has submitted a written complaint against BJP functionaries and demanded action.He said a case should be registered against Mayor Manjusha Nagpure, BJP city president Dheeraj Ghate, Dushyant Mohol and other workers.Speaking to PTI, Maharashtra Congress vice-president Mohan Joshi alleged that BJP workers initiated the violence.""During the protest, stones were pelted at Congress workers and two sustained injuries. We are currently holding a sit-in protest outside the police station in Shivajinagar seeking action,"" he said.Krishikesh Rawale, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 1), said that police intervened promptly to prevent the situation from worsening.Meanwhile, BJP Pune city unit president Dheeraj Ghate lodged a complaint against Sapkal at Parvati police station for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiments. A FIR has been registered.The political exchange intensified as Maharashtra Congress leader Sachin Sawant accused the BJP of “double standards” and pursuing a polarisation agenda.In a statement, Sawant cited past instances where BJP leaders had supported references to 18th-century Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan in public spaces and official forums. He referred to resolutions passed in civic bodies in Akola and Mumbai and alleged that BJP leaders had earlier praised or associated with the historical figure.""What should this hypocrisy be called? Tipu Sultan used to wear a ring bearing the name of Lord Ram,"" he claimed.Sawant alleged that the BJP was now portraying Tipu Sultan negatively to create religious divisions and engage in “distorted religious politics”.He further cited examples, including a 2012 resolution in the Akola Municipal Corporation to name a hall after Tipu Sultan, a 2013 proposal supported by BJP corporators to name a road in Mumbai, and a 2001 road naming in Andheri (West).He also claimed that former Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had visited Tipu Sultan’s tomb and written words of praise and that then President Ram Nath Kovind had praised Tipu Sultan in the Karnataka Assembly in 2017.","Clash took place outside the Congress Bhavan, where BJP workers had gathered.

NEW DELHI: Resuming his aggression against the India-US trade deal, Congress’s Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asked five “simple questions” that he said PM Narendra Modi must answer since “farmers deserve clarity” if “we are giving another country a long-term grip on India’s agricultural system”.Rahul asked if provisions in the interim trade deal, as mentioned in the joint statement, suggests that India will be importing pulses and grains that are not explicitly mentioned in the statement, and if India will be opening the hitherto shut door through which the US can in future put more and more items on the table for import by India. He asked what the fate will be of soya farmers in MP, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and other states of the country if India imports GM soya oil from the US, and if farmers will survive “another price shock”.He asked the PM to clarify what comprises “additional products” mentioned in the statement for reduction or elimination of tariffs. “Does it signal pressure to open up pulses and other sensitive crops to US imports over time?” the Congress MP asked. Referring to the proposed import of DDG, Rahul asked if feeding Indian cattle the distillers grain made of GM American corn will not “effectively integrate our dairy chain with the US agricultural system”.Rahul also urged the PM to clarify if removing “non tariff barriers” implies that India will be pushed to dilute its stand against GM crops, weaken procurement, or undermine MSP and bonuses in the future.","Rahul asked if provisions in the interim trade deal suggests that India will be importing pulses and grains.

Lok Sabha may take up opposition's notice against Speaker Om Birla on March 9,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-may-take-up-oppositions-notice-against-speaker-om-birla-on-march-9/articleshow/128400786.cms,"No-Confidence Against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Explained: Process, Rules And Numbers In Parliament

NEW DELHI: The opposition's notice for a resolution for Speaker Om Birla’s removal is likely to be taken up in Lok Sabha on the first day of the Budget session ’s second part on March 9, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said on Sunday, as govt looks to get on with its legislative agenda in the sitting after disposing of the move against the chair.As the BJP-led NDA has 293 members in the 542-member House and is likely to draw support of several fence-sitters, the opposition’s bid for Birla’s ouster for his alleged partiality looks set to fall through.“On March 9 in Lok Sabha, we will have the debate on the no-confidence motion moved against the Speaker. There will be a vote following the debate,” Rijiju told TOI .Official sources said the governing NDA is keen to deal with the issue urgently so that Birla, who has decided to not attend the House till the notice is dealt with, could return to preside over proceedings in the crucial session.Govt’s decision to send Birla for the swearing-in ceremony of BNP leader Tarique Rahman as Bangladesh PM on Feb 17 is being seen as signalling govt’s combative support for the Speaker who attracted Congress’s wrath for saying that the party had planned to deploy its women contingent in LS to do something unprecedentedly indecorous against PM Narendra Modi during his speech on the motion of thanks to the President’s address.The lead up to the vote will see Congress making an effort to get TMC and AAP to support the anti-Birla move. Congress is learnt to have dangled the carrot of a motion to remove chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar as a quid pro quo. TMC has been on the warpath against against the CEC over the Special Intense Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound West Bengal.Talking to PTI in Arunachal Pradesh, Rijiju expressed hope that Congress and other opposition parties would allow Parliament to function, but made it clear that the govt will carry on with its legislative agenda, noting that the Finance Bill will have to be passed. The Appropriation Bill will also be passed during the session.Amid deepening acrimony between the treasury and opposition benches, govt has at times got its key bills passed amid uproar, insisting that governance cannot be allowed to be obstructed by disruptions.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s notice for taking up a motion for expulsion of the leader of opposition in LS, Rahul Gandhi , is also likely to figure on the session’s agenda. If the issue is mentioned in the House, it is bound to face massive protests from opposition parties.Rijiju termed the next part of the session interesting, noting that it coincides with the upcoming assembly elections in four states and a Union Territory — West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry.“We will bring some important bills, including one critical bill. We will not disclose now as to what the bill is, but we will bring up one very important business in the second part. We will pass all these bills,” he said.","The opposition's notice for a resolution for Speaker Om Birla’s removal is likely to be taken up in Lok Sabha on the first day of the Budget session ’s second part on March 9.

However, there was never any question of the PM travelling as the date and even the time of the swearing-in was clashing with his bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Mumbai that was scheduled weeks in advance.The foreign ministry said Birla’s participation at this “important event” underscored the deep and enduring friendship between the peoples of India and Bangladesh, reaffirming India’s steadfast commitment to the democratic values that bind the two nations.“As neighbours united by a shared history, culture, and mutual respect, India welcomes Bangladesh’s transition to an elected govt under the leadership of Tarique Rahman, whose vision and values have received an overwhelming mandate of the people,” MEA said in a statement.Modi was among the first global leaders to congratulate Rahman on X on Friday morning, shortly after it became evident the BNP leader was going to form the new govt with absolute majority. Modi said the results reflected the trust that the Bangladesh people had in Rahman’s leadership. Later in the day, he also became the first foreign leader to speak to Rahman and offer cooperation with him in his efforts to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.Importantly for India, BNP responded positively to Modi’s messages as it said Bangladesh remained committed to upholding democratic values, inclusivity, and progressive development for all its citizens.“We look forward to engaging constructively with India to advance our multifaceted relationship, guided by mutual respect, sensitivity to each other’s concerns, and a shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in our region,” said the party.","Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will represent India at swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected govt of Bangladesh led by Tarique Rahman.

In the case of two other major ports — Paradip and VO Chidambarnar, two such boats were delivered late.The four major port authorities awarded these contracts to Mumbai-based Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd. Patrol boats for ports are specialized, fast, and agile vessels designed for security, surveillance, and law enforcement in harbours and coastal areas.The four major port authorities awarded these works to Mumbai-based Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works LtdThe MPA awarded a tender to the firm in September 2024 to hire two fully operational patrol boats for deployment over seven years. The boats were scheduled to be delivered by March 23, 2025, but the company failed to meet the deadline.Last month, the port authority issued a termination notice to the company, citing its failure to provide substitute patrol boats with similar technical specifications during the period of non-availability or delay. The letter, dated January 8, 2026, also stated that the delay had caused a loss of Rs 35 lakh to the port authority.The company was asked to confirm compliance by January 20, failing which the contract could be terminated.The MPA did not respond to repeated queries regarding the status of the contract.Similarly, the NMPA awarded a contract to the same firm in August 2024 for hiring one patrol boat, with delivery scheduled for May 2025. The company was permitted a delayed delivery until July 2025, subject to the maximum applicable liquidated damages. However, the boat has still not been delivered.A senior NMPA official said the contracted cost of the patrol boat was Rs 9.7 crore, and it remains undelivered. The port authority has also not terminated the contract despite the delay.Sources in the ports and shipping ministry said that since port authorities are empowered to take decisions regarding contracts and operations, they are responsible for initiating appropriate action.","The Mumbai Port Authority and the New Mangalore Port Authority are still awaiting the delivery of three patrol boats.

The Delhi government has launched an initiative to issue a 'Bhu-Aadhaar' card, according a unique 14-digit identification number to each land parcel in the city, in a move aimed at ending land boundary related disputes, chief minister Rekha Gupta said on Sunday.A new digital land map of Delhi will be prepared using drone survey and high-resolution imaging, she said, asserting that the Bhu-Aadhaar is a ""revolutionary step"" towards realising the prime minister's vision of ' Digital India '.The Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN), dubbed Bhu-Aadhaar, was launched as part of the Centre's Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP) in 2021.This step is part of the government's push to modernise Delhi's land records, freeing citizens from long-standing land disputes, the Delhi CMO said in a statement.The implementation of ULPIN has been entrusted to the IT branch of the revenue department, which will also be supported by the Survey of India.Approximately 2 TB (terabyte) of high-quality geospatial data and drone-based Ortho Rectified Images (ORI) are being obtained from the Survey of India for generating accurate ULPINs for all areas of Delhi, including 48 villages already covered under the SVAMITVA scheme, the statement said.Earlier, Rs 1.32 crore had been allocated for the project, with financial management overseen by the IT branch. The government will now expand the system across Delhi in a phased manner under a standard operating procedure with defined timelines, it said.A pilot project has already been completed in Tilangpur Kotla village in West Delhi district, where 274 ULPIN records have been successfully generated.The Bhu-Aadhaar system will ensure complete transparency in land ownership. The 14-digit code will be geo-referenced, thereby minimising disputes over land boundaries, the CMO said.It will facilitate coordination of land data among various government departments and effectively curb fraudulent transactions and multiple registrations, it saidFor citizens, the move is expected bring ease and convenience. Instead of navigating multiple documents to establish land ownership, a single number will provide comprehensive details of the property, the statement added.","The Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN), dubbed Bhu-Aadhaar, was launched as part of the Centre's Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP) in 2021.

Amit Shah’s 'Tamil Apology' In Focus As Stalin Speaks Tamil Without Apology In Bihar

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Sunday dismissed allegations that Tamil Nadu is “hostile” to Sanatan Dharma, contending instead that people in the state are “more Hindu than North Indians.”The BJP has frequently accused the Congress, its ally the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu, and their other INDIA bloc partners of being “anti-Sanatan Dharma.” The political attack stems from controversial past remarks by Udhayanidhi Stalin , son of Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK supremo MK Stalin. Udhyanidhi now serves as the state's deputy chief minister.“What is Sanatan? That is not a term anyone in Tamil Nadu uses… We are more Hindu than North Indians. Per square kilometre, we have more temples. We break more coconuts every day. I personally visit more temples than many people in the BJP combined,” Chidambaram told ANI.“There isn’t a single day that I step out of my house without applying vibhuti or kundalama. ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is not a phrase we use,” he added.Addressing the controversy sparked in 2023 by remarks from Udhayanidhi Stalin, the Sivaganga MP attributed the uproar to “differing interpretations” of the term.“This issue became controversial because Udhayanidhi Stalin made a comment about the term. In Tamil Nadu, it is understood to refer to caste hierarchy—that’s how it is commonly interpreted here. He was speaking about caste hierarchy, not about the practice of the Hindu faith,” Chidambaram stated.In 2023, Udhayanidhi had likened “Sanatana” to diseases such as malaria and dengue, saying it should be “eradicated” rather than merely opposed, triggering a nationwide political debate.He had remarked, “Sanatana is like malaria and dengue, and therefore it must be eradicated, not just opposed. I thank the organisers for naming this event the ‘Sanatana Abolition Conference’ instead of the ‘Anti-Sanatana Conference.’ Some things cannot simply be opposed; they must be abolished. We don’t oppose dengue, mosquitoes, malaria, or corona—we eradicate them. In the same way, Sanatana should be eradicated rather than opposed. ”Tamil Nadu is set to hold assembly elections in April. Although the Congress is an ally of the DMK, it is not part of the state government, in line with the prevailing political practice in the southern state.","The BJP has frequently accused the Congress, its ally the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu, and their other INDIA bloc partners of being “anti-Sanatan Dharma” The political attack stems from controversial past remarks by Udhayanidhi Stalin, son of Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128386798,imgsize-21302,width-400,resizemode-4/karti-chidambaram.jpg"

Kiren Rijiju Explains Why Modi Govt Paused Privilege Notice Against Rahul Gandhi After Dubey's Move

NEW DELHI: Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said that the debate and voting on the no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker will be taken up on March 9.""On March 9 in the Lok Sabha, we will have the debate on the no-confidence motion moved against the speaker,"" Rijiju told news agency PTI.""It is the rule to take it up on the first day. There will be a vote following the debate,"" he added.Additionally, a speedy review will be conducted as per the rules, news agency ANI reported citing sources.This comes after Congress MPs submitted a no-confidence motion against the Om Birla , signed by 118 MPs. The Opposition MPs alleged ""blatantly partisan"" conduct and that leaders of opposition parties were not allowed to speak.However, this is not the first time when a no-confidence against Chair has been moved by the opposition. Earlier in 2024, the opposition moved a similar motion against then Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar.History also records at least three instances since Independence when a no-confidence motion was moved to remove the Speaker. The first was against the first Lok Sabha Speaker, GV Mavalankar, in 1954, after MP Vigneshwar Misra alleged that the Speaker was not impartial.In 1966, opposition MPs moved a motion against Speaker Sardar Hukum Singh, with Madhu Limaye leading the charge and Deputy Speaker S V Krishnamoorthy Rao in the Chair.The third motion was moved on April 15, 1987, for the removal of Speaker Balram Jakhar by CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee, with Deputy Speaker Thambi Durai presiding. This motion was axed by the House.What was Nehru's message to Congress MPs when oppn move a no-confidence motion against Speaker GV MavalankarThe first such situation surfaced on December 18, 1954, when the Opposition moved a resolution for the removal of then Speaker Mavalankar. It was admitted after over 50 members stood up in support, and a debate took place over it.India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru 's message to Congress MPs during the debate in 1954 on the Opposition's resolution to remove then Speaker GV Mavalankar was that they are not bound by any whip or direction, and that all legislators must consider the matter ""regardless of party affiliations"".He had urged Lok Sabha MPs to look at the issue not through the lens of the party but as a matter concerning the dignity of the House.It was a fiery debate during which the Opposition, though weak in numbers, tore into Nehru and accused the speaker of being partisan.Intervening in the debate, Nehru said, ""I would like to address the House, if I may, in my capacity and the high privilege of being the Leader of this House and not as a leader of the majority party. So far as this majority party is concerned, I would like to tell them that not one of them is bound by any whip or any direction: let them vote as they like. It is not a party matter. It is a matter for this House, for each individual, to consider, regardless of party affiliations. """"Therefore, let us try to think of it not as a party issue but as members of this House, because this matter affects the hon. speaker, of course, but it affects the high dignity of this House as Parliament, it affects the first citizen of this country, that is, the speaker of this House,"" he added.What is said about the speaker, what is done about the speaker comes back on each one of us who claim to be members of this House, the then PM said.""I wish members to realise this because I have felt sad and very sad ever since this matter came up before the House. We have known the speaker for many years and we have seen him function and it is possible that some of us may not have exactly the same opinion about him as others have; it is possible,"" he said.""It has so happened that some of us have not particularly liked a decision of his or a ruling of his. It is one thing not to like a ruling or to disagree with it or even to feel, if I may say so, slightly irritated about something that has happened. These things happen. But, it is completely a different thing to challenge the bona fides of the very person in whose keeping is the honour of this House,"" Nehru had said.""I do not say that it is not possible at all to raise a motion against the Speaker. Of course, the Constitution has provided it. Nobody challenges the right of the Opposition or any Member of the House to put forward this motion. I do not deny that right since it has been given by the Constitution. The point is not the legal right but the propriety; the desirability of doing it,"" he said.Nehru then went on to strongly defend the speaker and hit out at the Opposition for questioning his bona fides.The Congress had a brute majority with over 360 members, and the resolution was negated by a voice vote.","Congress MPs submitted a no-confidence motion against the Om Birla. Opposition MPs alleged ""blatantly partisan"" conduct and that leaders of opposition parties were not allowed to speak.

'White Collar Terrorism...': Ex-DGMO AK Bhatt On Biggest Challenge For The Army In Jammu & Kashmir

Security agencies in Jammu and Kashmir have identified and frozen over 8,000 “mule accounts” in the past three years.According to the officials, these accounts form the financial backbone of global scam networks and could fund separatist and anti-national activities.Officials described these accounts as the “weakest yet most crucial link” in the cybercrime chain, noting that without them, stolen money could not be converted into untraceable cryptocurrency , news agency PTI reported.Central security agencies have asked the Jammu and Kashmir Police and other law-enforcement bodies to consult with banks to curb the rise of mule accounts and identify middlemen commonly called “mulers” who facilitate these frauds.After the National Investigation Agency ’s 2017 crackdown on illicit money flows into the region, officials said anti-national elements may have shifted to a “digital hawala” model, where commissions earned by mule account holders could be used for activities against the country.A muler typically does not contact victims or send fraudulent links. Instead, officials said, their role is arranging and maintaining a steady supply of mule accounts for scammers while concealing their identities.Such accounts often belong to ordinary individuals lured with promises of “easy commission” and minimal risk. They are persuaded to give full control of their bank accounts, including their net banking credentials.Investigators found that a single scammer may be supplied with 10 to 30 mule accounts at a time. In several cases, accounts are opened in the names of fictitious companies, enabling large transactions of up to Rs 40 lakh in a single day without immediately raising alarms.Officials said the money trail is deliberately complex, with funds quickly shifted across multiple accounts and broken into smaller transactions to avoid detection.Law-enforcement agencies stressed that even if mule account holders do not design scams or interact with victims, they remain active facilitators of money laundering. “The entire scam ecosystem depends on these accounts. Without a destination for the money, the scam fails at the first step. Those renting out their accounts are not just victims of circumstance; they are the engines of the crime,” a senior official said.A study by central security agencies also found individuals in countries such as China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia directing people in the Union Territory to create private crypto wallets. These wallets are often set up using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to avoid detection and requiring no Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. The J&K police have already suspended the use of VPNs in the Valley, noting that terrorists and separatists often exploit the technology to evade tracking, PTI reported.","Security agencies in Jammu and Kashmir have identified and frozen over 8,000 “mule accounts’ in the past three years.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said that central projects worth around Rs 55,000 crore have been sanctioned for the state over the past year, marking significant progress on infrastructure commitments made earlier.Addressing a press conference, Sarma outlined a series of projects that have either received approval or are in advanced stages of clearance. He linked the developments to the commitments made during the second Advantage Assam investment summit.""The Centre had assured infrastructure projects worth Rs 80,000 crore during the second Advantage Assam investment summit last year, and the state has already received approval for different projects worth Rs 55,000 crore,"" he said.The ‘Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment and Infrastructure Summit’ was organised by the state government in February 2025 to attract investments and push major infrastructure expansion across the state.Among the key projects, Sarma said that the government has floated the tender for the Kamakhya Ropeway Project, which will connect Kamakhya railway station to the Kamakhya temple in Guwahati.""When the PM visits Assam next, he will lay the foundation for it,"" he said.He added that the Centre is likely to approve a Rs 1,500 crore project within the next few days to build an elevated corridor from Guwahati airport to Jalukbari, the main entry point to the state capital. The project is aimed at easing traffic congestion and improving connectivity.Sarma also said that a major highway expansion project is nearing final approval.""The Rs 14,000-crore project for four-laning of the national highway from Baihata Chariali to Tezpur is at last stages of approval. We hope for it very soon,"" he added.On the stalled Kamakhya corridor project, the Chief Minister said work is expected to resume soon after expert bodies found no ecological risks.""After some people opposed the corridor, the Gauhati High Court asked IIT Guwahati and the National Institute of Hydrology to study if the project would have any ecological impact. They said there would be no impact,"" he claimed.In the healthcare sector, Sarma said expansion works worth Rs 2,200 crore are underway at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, while projects worth Rs 600 crore are ongoing at Assam Medical College and Hospital.He further said that another strategic highway project is under consideration. The proposed route will connect the semiconductor plant at Jagiroad in Morigaon district to the Bhutan border via Udalguri and will include construction of a new bridge over the Brahmaputra river.""This project is under active consideration of the Centre. These strategic assets will also be used by civilians,"" Sarma said.Separately, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, on Friday approved the construction of India’s first 34-km-long twin-tube road-cum-rail tunnel under the Brahmaputra river between Gohpur and Numaligarh at a cost of Rs 18,662 crore.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that central projects worth around Rs 55,000 crore have been sanctioned for the state.

The politics of scent

The actor at the centre

More than just a soap

When a bar of soap becomes the centre of a political slugfest, one knows the story runs deeper than lather and fragrance.The appointment of actor Tamannaah Bhatia as the new brand ambassador of Karnataka ’s iconic Mysuru Sandal Soap has triggered a heated debate that cuts across politics, identity, branding strategy and regional pride.What began as a marketing announcement has spiralled into a controversy over language, representation and the cultural ownership of a 108-year-old legacy product.At the heart of the row is Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL), the government-owned company that manufactures Mysuru Sandal Soap. Founded during the reign of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the brand is not merely a commercial product. For many Kannadigas, it is an aromatic symbol of heritage.The controversy intensified after Karnataka industries minister MB Patil announced that Tamannaah Bhatia would serve a two-year tenure as brand ambassador for KSDL. The actor reportedly signed for a fee of approximately Rs 6.2 crore. Her contract, which was finalised last year, formally came into effect this month.The announcement coincided with the relaunch of Mysuru Sandal Soap in refreshed packaging and a broader strategy to reposition the brand for national and global markets.Several advertisements featuring the actor were unveiled at an event in Bengaluru, along with an expanded portfolio of nearly 60 products.But almost immediately, political opposition emerged.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP K Sudhakar accused the Congress-led Karnataka government of displaying what he called an “anti-Kannada mindset”.He questioned why a Mumbai-born actor was chosen to represent a brand rooted in Karnataka’s cultural identity when several Kannada film stars enjoy national and international recognition.He named actors such as Ramya, Rashmika Mandanna, Srinidhi Shetty , Pooja Hegde and Rukmini Vasanth, arguing that they have carried Kannada cinema to wider audiences and would have been more appropriate faces of the brand.The debate quickly moved from business logic to emotional ownership.To understand why a soap can trigger such strong reactions, one must go back to its origins.Mysuru Sandal Soap was born in 1916 in the princely state of Mysore. At the time, the region was rich in sandalwood, a precious and aromatic resource. During the First World War, the export of sandalwood was disrupted. Faced with surplus stock, the Mysore administration decided to explore value addition.Under the guidance of chemists and the encouragement of Maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the government established a soap factory that used pure sandalwood oil. The idea was simple but visionary. Instead of exporting raw material, produce a finished product of premium quality.The result was Mysore Sandal Soap, one of the few soaps in the world made with genuine sandalwood oil.In 1980, the operations were reorganised under Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL), a state enterprise. Over the decades, KSDL expanded into detergents, cosmetics and other personal care products. Yet the flagship soap remained its crown jewel.For many households in Karnataka, the soap is associated with childhood memories, temple visits, wedding gifts and the distinctive scent of sandalwood that lingers long after use.It is not merely hygiene. It is nostalgia.Minister MB Patil has defended the appointment, saying the decision was based purely on marketing considerations. According to him, KSDL is entering a transformative phase with ambitious targets. The company aims to achieve a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore by 2030.Currently, the company’s turnover is expected to touch around Rs 2,000 crore this year, with profits reportedly exceeding Rs 500 crore. However, only a small percentage of sales occur within Karnataka. Patil has said that roughly 8 to 12 per cent of sales are in the state, with significant portions in Telangana, other southern states, north India and a small international presence.The government’s argument is straightforward. If the brand wants to expand aggressively in North India and overseas markets, it needs a face with pan-India recognition.Tamannaah Bhatia, though born and brought up in Mumbai, has worked extensively in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi cinema. With millions of followers on social media and cross regional appeal, the government says she fits the bill.Officials have stated that several names were evaluated, including actors from Karnataka. However, some were reportedly endorsing competing brands, which made them ineligible under marketing norms.The state government maintains that branding decisions must align with commercial objectives, not political sentiment.Critics, however, view the decision through a different lens.For them, Mysuru Sandal Soap is intertwined with Karnataka’s linguistic and cultural pride. In a state where language identity remains politically sensitive, the selection of a non-Kannada-speaking actor to represent a heritage brand has symbolic implications.Mysuru MP Yaduveer Wadiyar , a descendant of the Mysore royal family, publicly questioned the rationale. He argued that soap is not gender-specific and that a cricketer or prominent Kannadiga could have been chosen. He also clarified that he had no interest in serving as brand ambassador himself, despite his name circulating on social media.Forest minister Eshwar Khandre defended the appointment but assured that Kannadigas would continue to receive priority in other contexts.Meanwhile, housing minister Zameer Ahmed indicated that although the decision had been taken, there were numerous capable Kannada actresses who could have been considered.The disagreement even within the ruling establishment reflects the sensitivity of the issue.For pro-Kannada groups, the controversy touches on a larger fear of cultural dilution. They argue that state-owned enterprises should reinforce regional identity rather than dilute it for broader appeal.Beyond the politics, KSDL is attempting a major brand refresh.At the recent relaunch event, the company unveiled 57 products, including new variants of soaps, sandalwood oil, jasmine scented bars, perfumes, toothpaste, coconut oil, petroleum jelly and organic lines. Two coffee table books documenting KSDL’s heritage were also released.The refreshed packaging aims to appeal to younger consumers who are increasingly drawn to premium natural and heritage brands.In recent years, India’s beauty and personal care market has undergone a rapid transformation. Consumers shifted towards global brands and K-beauty trends. However, there has also been a renewed interest in Ayurvedic and traditional formulations.Mysuru Sandal Soap, with its authentic sandalwood oil base, occupies a unique niche. It combines tradition with premium positioning.The launch of KSDL eStore, an e-commerce platform for its products, signals a shift toward digital retail. The company has established stock-keeping units closer to consumers to ensure timely delivery and freshness.In this context, the appointment of a high-profile celebrity ambassador is part of a broader strategy to reposition the brand as aspirational and nationally visible.The row highlights how even consumer goods can become sites of political contestation.In Karnataka, language and regional identity have historically shaped electoral politics. Debates over Hindi imposition, local employment and cultural representation frequently surface in public discourse. Against this backdrop, the choice of a brand ambassador becomes more than a marketing decision.Opposition leaders have framed the issue as evidence of disregard for Kannada pride. Supporters of the government argue that commercial pragmatism should not be conflated with cultural betrayal.The controversy also raises a larger question about public sector branding. Should government-owned companies prioritise regional representation as part of their mandate, or operate strictly on business metrics?For private corporations, such decisions are typically driven by reach, cost and market impact. But when the brand belongs to the state, expectations shift.Tamannaah Bhatia has not publicly commented on the controversy in detail. At the Bengaluru event, she described Mysuru Sandal Soap as deeply associated with emotion and trust. She said she felt privileged to be associated with an institution of such legacy.Her filmography spans multiple industries, and she enjoys a significant social media presence. From a marketing standpoint, that digital footprint is valuable in an era where brand recall is shaped as much by Instagram reels as by television commercials.Yet, the backlash shows that brand endorsement in India cannot be divorced from identity politics.Mysuru Sandal Soap’s enduring appeal lies in its authenticity. Unlike synthetic fragrance soaps, it reportedly uses genuine sandalwood oil, a resource historically associated with Karnataka. The state has long regulated sandalwood harvesting due to its high value and ecological importance.The soap’s emblem, featuring the royal insignia of Mysore, reinforces its historical roots. For many, it represents a time when princely states invested in industrial innovation and self-sufficiency.In that sense, the brand is a bridge between pre-independence industrial vision and modern state enterprise.As of now, the appointment stands. Tamannaah Bhatia’s two-year tenure has begun, and marketing campaigns are underway. KSDL is pushing forward with its expansion plans, eyeing higher turnover, greater exports and a stronger digital footprint.Whether the controversy fades or continues to simmer will depend on political developments and public reception.If the refreshed branding leads to significant growth in north India and overseas markets, the government may point to it as vindication of its strategy. If the backlash persists, opposition parties may continue to frame it as symbolic of deeper cultural concerns.","Tamannaah Bhatia is the new brand ambassador of Karnataka ’s iconic Mysuru Sandal Soap. Her appointment has triggered a heated debate that cuts across politics, identity, branding strategy and regional pride. For many Kannadigas, it is an aromatic symbol of heritage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128380214,imgsize-83974,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-28.jpg"

Tamil Nadu polls: Congress seeks ‘due respect’ ahead of seat-sharing talks with DMK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-polls-congress-seeks-due-respect-ahead-of-seat-sharing-talks-with-dmk/articleshow/128378545.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Sunday refuted speculations about a rift between DMK and the grand-old party over seat sharing ahead of Tamil Nadu assembly elections, claiming that the party will receive the ""respect that is due. ""While talking to reporters, Tagore reiterated that Congress is in alliance with DMK and a committee, for seat sharing talks, will be formed on the 22nd February.""We are not like other parties that switch directions after merely putting on an indicator and turning right. We are a national party with principles. We are in an alliance with the DMK as part of the INDIA bloc,"" Tagore said.""It has been 70 days since we were told that a committee would be formed for talks, and we are still waiting. They have now said that the committee will be formed on the 22nd February. We believe that we will receive the respect that is due to us,"" he added.Earlier on Saturday, Tagore pushed his party's demand for a larger share of seats in its alliance with the DMK.He said the Congress was seeking constituencies that the DMK had lost in the 2021 polls and emphasised that ""power-sharing was essential"" in state's governance. However, days earlier, Stalin ruled out the possibility of sharing power with allies.Tagore’s remarks came in response to comments made by DMK leader and state minister RS Raja Kannappan in Madurai on February 13, where he asserted that the DMK would contest 170 constituencies and win 160 seats in the upcoming election.Reacting to the statement, Tagore, the MP from Virudhunagar, said in a post on X: “In 2021, you contested in 173 seats and secured 133. What we are asking (now) are the seats which you failed to win.”He further underlined the Congress’s position on governance, saying, “Power sharing is necessary. The share in power is our right. The people will decide,” while sharing a video clip of Raja Kannappan’s speech.In the video, Raja Kannappan ruled out the possibility of a coalition government, expressing confidence that the DMK would independently secure 160 seats.Days earlier, CM Stalin strongly ruled out sharing power with allies, while maintaining that the alliance with the Congress remained “intact” and free of confusion.“We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,” Stalin said.The Tamil Nadu assembly has 234 seats, and the DMK-Congress alliance had won 151 seats in the 2021 elections.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore refuted speculations about a rift between DMK and the grand-old party.

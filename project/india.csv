Cargo already entered into India may be allowed to exit the Indian territory as per the procedure,” the circular mentioned.The facility had enabled smoother trade for Bangladesh to Bhutan, Nepal, and Myanmar. But Indian exporters, particularly in the apparel sector, had long objected to the arrangement. Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) Chairman Sudhir Sekhri earlier said that 20–30 Bangladeshi trucks arrived daily in Delhi, clogging cargo terminals and spiking freight costs.“Now we will have more air capacity for our cargo,” said FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai. “In the past, exporters have complained about lesser space due to the trans-shipment facility given to Bangladesh.”The move comes as global trade tensions rise, with the US recently announcing new tariffs on both India and Bangladesh.Trade experts say the cancellation will hit Bangladesh’s export logistics hard. “The previous mechanism had offered a streamlined route through India, cutting transit time and cost,” said Ajay Srivastava , founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, as quoted by PTI. “Now, without it, Bangladeshi exporters may face delays, higher costs, and uncertainty.”The geopolitical undertone became unavoidable after Yunus’ comments in Beijing, where he pitched Bangladesh as “the only guardian of the ocean” for Northeast India and invited China to deepen its economic presence in the region.“The eastern part of India, the Seven Sisters, are a landlocked region. They have no way to reach out to the ocean. This could be an extension of the Chinese economy,” Yunus had said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar swiftly countered the narrative, emphasizing India’s strategic maritime and regional links. “We have the longest coastline in the Bay of Bengal… Our North-Eastern region is emerging as a connectivity hub for BIMSTEC,” he said.With both countries being WTO members, Srivastava cautioned that India’s move may raise concerns over transit rights under WTO rules, especially for other landlocked nations like Nepal and Bhutan.","India has withdrawn a key trans-shipment facility granted to Bangladesh.

Why Rana’s extradition matters

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , a key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, will finally reach India after being extradited from the United States after over a decade of legal wrangling. A multi-agency Indian team is en route with Rana, and he is expected to land in India by Thursday afternoon, according to media reports citing sources.The 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman is accused of helping David Coleman Headley , his childhood friend and co-conspirator, carry out reconnaissance of targets later attacked by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists in 2008. The siege left 166 dead, including six American nationals, and lasted for nearly 60 hours.Upon arrival, Rana is likely to be produced before a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court at Patiala House in Delhi. The NIA is expected to seek custodial interrogation to confront him with evidence, including emails, travel records, and testimonies already collected.Officials believe Rana’s questioning could provide fresh leads on the involvement of Pakistani state actors in the attack. He may be lodged in a high-security cell in Tihar Jail, where security has already been tightened.India had earlier given assurances to US authorities regarding Rana’s safety, legal rights, and prison conditions—a key factor in securing his extradition.According to the NIA charge sheet filed in 2011, Rana was deeply involved in planning the 26/11 attacks. He allegedly helped Headley gain a visa to India and established a Mumbai office — 'Immigrant Law Centre' — as a cover for reconnaissance activities.The agency claims Rana not only knew of Headley’s terror affiliations but actively supported him. He accompanied his wife on a tour through multiple Indian cities — Hapur, Delhi, Agra, Kochi, Ahmedabad, and Mumbai — between November 13 and 21, 2008. During these visits, Headley made dozens of calls to Rana.Their collaboration extended to planning attacks on Chabad Houses and the National Defence College. Rana was also in touch with Major Iqbal , a suspected ISI officer and co-conspirator.Rana was arrested by the FBI in Chicago in 2009 for supporting a failed LeT plot in Copenhagen. Though acquitted of direct charges in the 26/11 attacks by a US court, he was convicted for other terror-related offences and sentenced to 14 years in prison.India has pursued his extradition since, filing a request and securing a Red Notice from Interpol. Rana resisted the process through multiple legal appeals, including two emergency stay applications this year—one each to US Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Chief Justice John Roberts. Both were denied.On April 7, the US Supreme Court formally rejected his last-ditch plea, stating simply: “Application denied by the Court.”The NIA hopes Rana’s interrogation will uncover more evidence about the network of conspirators, including LeT operatives Hafiz Saeed , Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Sajid Mir, and HuJI leaders like Illyas Kashmiri—some of whom are linked to Pakistan’s ISI.The NIA special court has issued non-bailable warrants against absconding accused and submitted letters rogatory to Pakistan, though no response has been received so far.The NIA had earlier retrieved trial records from a Mumbai court, consolidating the multi-city legal effort into one court to streamline prosecution.Rana’s arrival in India marks a major breakthrough in the 26/11 case, which had seen only partial justice with the 2012 hanging of Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman from the attacks.With Rana in custody, India may be able to expose the operational and institutional links between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistani military-intelligence networks—potentially reopening diplomatic and legal pressure on Islamabad.As India prepares for what could be one of the most consequential terror trials in its history, the return of Tahawwur Rana has reignited hope that long-delayed justice may finally be served.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, will finally reach India after being extradited from the United States.

Singapore SC quashes ex-CJI Dipak Misra's 'copy-pasted' arbitration award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised. While, as we have noted, there is no evidence as to what transpired between the members of the tribunal, it is known that the two co-arbitrators in this case were not privy to the parallel arbitrations. They would thus have had no direct access to any material or knowledge derived from those proceedings, but which appeared to have significantly influenced the outcome of the present arbitration. The integrity of the arbitration was, therefore, further compromised as a result,"" it said.",Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV) The tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120142141,imgsize-543479,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
AI puts flyer who urinated on co-passenger on no-fly list for 30 days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/business-class-peegate-redux-this-time-on-air-indias-delhi-bangkok-flight/articleshow/120129817.cms,"NEW DELHI: A business class passenger seated in the second row of an Air India Airbus A320 flying from Delhi to Bangkok Wednesday urinated on a traveller in the front row, just before landing. Sources say this person “had alcohol like a significant number of travellers on flights between Delhi & the Thai capital but he was not sloshed.” Air India has barred him from flying for 30 days, pending action to be decided by an independent panel like the first peegate the airline had seen in Nov 2022.Cabin crew “provided assistance” to the victim — who declined to file a complaint against the passenger after he apologised profusely — and shifted the latter to another seat on the erstwhile Vistara A320 which has 2 by 2 seating in business. In Nov 2022, a business class passenger on AI’s New York-Delhi flight had urinated on an elderly lady in the same cabin class.“Air India confirms that an incident of unruly passenger behaviour was reported to the cabin crew operating flight AI-2336, from Delhi to Bangkok, on April 9, 2025. The crew followed all laid down procedures, and the matter has been reported to the authorities. In addition to warning the unruly passenger, our crew offered to assist an aggrieved passenger to take up a grievance with authorities in Bangkok, which was declined at the time,” an Air India spokesperson said.“The standing independent committee will be convened to assess the incident and determine the action, if any, to be taken against the unruly passenger. AI continues to follow the standard operating procedures as laid out by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in such matters,” the spokesperson added.AI-2336 had taken off from Delhi just after 2 am on Wednesday and landed in Bangkok a little over four hours later. “He urinated just before landing. The aircraft lavs were functional. The crew had offered to help the victim in filing a complaint with the authorities on arrival in Bangkok but he declined to do so. Now the internal panel will decide on the course of action to be taken against the person who urinated,” said sources.In the earlier case on AI’s New York-Delhi flight, the person who had urinated was first barred from flying AI for 30 days and then put on the no-fly list for four months. Delhi Police had lodged a case against him under various sections and he was arrested in Bengaluru. He later lost his corporate job.Since that case, AI has become stricter with its liquor service policy. It put emphasis on cabin crew training to help them better recognise and manage possible cases of intoxication. Before the Nov 2022 peegate case, full service Indian carriers that fly abroad like Air India, and earlier erstwhile Jet Airways , were far more liberal in liquor service than their foreign counterparts, especially western carriers. That changed after the earlier urination case.On budget airlines, passengers have to buy liquor on board but even there crew was asked to generally limit sales to two drinks to avoid unruly behaviour by someone getting sloshed. LCC crew sell more only if a passenger seems to be in complete control of him/herself after two drinks on a case-to-case basis, said sources.Flights between India (especially north India Delhi) and Thailand are particularly known for rowdy behaviour by passengers “who are too happy to be going on vacation on the way out or too sad after the same is over and returning home,” say crew members. For instance, low cost AI Express had seen one of its highest ever liquor sales on its inaugural Surat-Bangkok last Dec.","A business class passenger seated in the second row of an Air India Airbus A320 flying from Delhi to Bangkok Wednesday urinated on a traveller in the front row, just before landing.

"26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times in India, says dossier",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-mastermind-tahawwur-rana-contacted-david-coleman-headley-231-times-in-india-says-dossier/articleshow/120140513.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Rana , one of the main plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attack, had contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times during his visits to India ahead of the 26/11 carnage, according to the Indian dossier on him. Rana conducted eight reconnaissance missions and the highest number of calls (66) were made during the final visit before the attack.According to the dossier, Rana and Headley, along with other operatives, had mapped other targets in India, including National Defence College and India Gate in Delhi and multiple Jewish centres, as part of their plan to carry out spectacular terror attacks. NIA's chargesheet on him details Rana, along with Headley, Hafeez Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Ilyas Kashmiri, Sajid Mir and Major Iqbal, among others, had conspired to orchestrate the attack.Investigation by both India and US confirmed that Rana's Chicago-based immigration firm - First World Immigration Services, was used as a front to facilitate Headley's entry into India. Headley and Rana had a thorough discussion about their future plans when they met in US. ""As Rana was a deserter from the army, Headley offered to provide assistance through his connection with Major Iqbal,"" reads the dossier.Backed by the ISI, Rana exploited every option available to him to thwart his extradition. He even claimed pleas of double jeopardy/double prosecution which essentially holds that a person cannot be prosecuted twice for same offence. The US court, however, rejected his contention that American judiciary had already tried and acquitted him of charges for which India wanted him. The US court said the crimes he had been charged with in India were different from those for which he was prosecuted in the US. ""For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the US,"" the court observed.Rana's 2013 conviction in US, where he was sentenced to 14 years in prison, was for supporting Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba and the terror plot in Denmark. Rana was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a plot from Oct 2008 to Oct 2009 to commit murder in Denmark, including a plan to behead employees of Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten, a Danish newspaper which published a cartoon of the Prophet , and throw their heads on streets of Copenhagen, as well as providing material support, from late 2005 to Oct 2009, to Lashkar-e-Taiba.The website of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons has updated the status against Rana's name saying he wasn't in their custody as of Tuesday. Rana's register number (22829-424) read: ""Not in BOP custody as of 04/08/2025.""A team of officials drawn from Indian agencies in the US was tasked with facilitating his return. Sources said the chief investigating officer, DIG (NIA) Jaya Roy, signed off on the 'surrender warrant' Tuesday, following which swift arrangements were made to fly him to Delhi. The team left Wednesday around 6.30am, aiming to complete the journey with a brief pit stop. Incidentally, NIA is headed by Sadanand Date , a Maharashtra cadre IPS officer who, along with other colleagues, had rushed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus area on the fateful evening of Nov 26, 2008 after the terrorists struck at targets selected by, among others, Rana's partner in the massacre David Coleman Headley.Rana's interrogators, a source said, will aim to get him to divulge details about Pakistani state actors involved in the 26/11 plot, details of ISI network, as well as LeT's local collaborators and sources of funding. There also seems to be recognition that breaking down a hardened terrorist, especially one motivated by jihad, may not be easy.""He has already been probed extensively, and cracking him will not be an easy task. He would know where to mislead us and create smokescreens. This will be time-consuming,"" said a source in the know.Rana (64) is learned to have already got his contacts to engage his defence counsel. Due to security reasons, Rana may not be taken to court and his remand proceedings may be held in camera, sources said.","Tahawwur Rana, one of the main plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attack, had contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times during his visits to India ahead of the 26/11 carnage.

India ends transshipment facility for Bangladesh exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-ends-transshipment-facility-for-bangladesh-exports/articleshow/120141297.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy. The customs circular, issued Tuesday, said cargo that had already entered India would be allowed to be shipped out. Confirming the development that comes amid the strife in India-Bangladesh ties, MEA said the transshipment used to cause congestion at Indian airports and ports, but added the order won't hit Dhaka's exports to Nepal and Bhutan passing through India. tnnThe trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh had over a period of time resulted in significant congestion at our airports and ports. Logistical delays and higher costs were hindering our own exports and creating backlogs. The facility, therefore, has been withdrawn, w.e.f. April 8, 2025. To clarify, these measures do not impact Bangladesh exports to Nepal or Bhutan transiting through Indian territory,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal , adding India needs to create space for its own exports.While exporters had petitioned govt last year, the customs notification came days after Muhammad Yunus made controversial remarks in China, saying India's northeastern states, which share a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, were ""landlocked"", prompting a strong rebuttal from PM Modi ""India has always supported the Bangladesh cause. India allows one-way zero tariff access to Bangladesh goods (all except alcohol and cigarettes) to the vast Indian market for the last two decades. However, Bangladesh plans for creating a strategic base near Chicken's Neck area with China's help may have prompted this action. Bangladesh has invited Chinese investment to revitalise the air base at Lalmunirhat near India's Siliguri Corridor ,"" said trade research body GTRI.Industry here said this will help Indian players. ""It was the Apparel Export Promotion Council's long-standing demand for stopping trans-shipment of Bangladeshi cargo, meant for shipments to third countries, through Indian ports, which has now been accepted. This will help in rationalisation of freight rates resulting in less transportation cost to the Indian exporters besides decongesting the airports leading to the shorter transit time to ship the goods,"" said the industry body's secretary general Mithileshwar Thakur .The MEA spokesperson also reiterated India's demand that Bangladesh probe cases of violence against minorities, saying this was an issue that PM Modi strongly raised with chief advisor Muhammad Yunus during their recent meeting in Bangkok. ""This is not an issue that Bangladesh can wish away by calling it media exaggeration,"" said Jaiswal. Yunus had said in the meeting that most of the cases of atrocities committed on minorities were fake news.","Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy.

NEW Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday slammed the Centre regarding delays in establishing a cashless medical treatment scheme for motor accident victims.

They warned of potential contempt proceedings.The secretary was instructed to appear on April 28 for explanation.The court additionally instructed the transport department secretary to provide written directives to district magistrates regarding uploading hidden hit-and-run claims on the GIC portal.On January 8, the court had directed the Centre to create a scheme for cashless treatment during the 'golden hour' as per law.Referencing Section 162(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988, the government was ordered to implement the scheme by March 14.The Act defines golden hour under Section 2 (12-A) as the crucial one-hour period post-trauma when medical intervention is most effective.The court emphasised that financial and procedural delays often result in fatalities.It highlighted the Centre's statutory obligation under Section 162 to create a cashless treatment scheme, supporting Article 21's right to life guarantee.The law requires insurance companies to provide treatment for accident victims during the golden hour according to the MV Act scheme.Despite being effective from April 1, 2022, the scheme remained unimplemented, necessitating court intervention.The Centre proposed a draft limiting treatment cost to Rs 1.5 lakh for seven days, which the petitioner's counsel deemed inadequate.The GIC was assigned to manage hit-and-run compensation claims and develop a streamlined portal. This portal would facilitate document uploads, notify states of deficiencies, and reduce processing delays. As of July 31, 2024, 921 hit-and-run compensation claims remained pending due to documentation issues.

NEW DELHI: BJD president and former Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday came out in strong defence of his close aide VK Pandian, calling for unity within the party after signs of internal rift emerged over the controversial Waqf (Amendment) Bill , 2025.The bill, now a law following Presidential assent, saw the BJD divided in the Rajya Sabha with MPs casting split votes, an unusual move for a party known for its discipline. While MP Sasmit Patra supported the bill, another MP, Muzibulla Khan , opposed it. One member, Debashish Samantaray, remained absent. The confusion has prompted criticism from the BJP and concerns within the BJD ranks.Naveen Patnaik also came down heavily on his party colleagues for holding large meetings in hotels amid growing internal rift following party members' split voting on the Bill in Rajya Sabha five days ago. While he didn’t name anyone directly, the remarks were widely seen as a response to speculation around growing discontent in the party, particularly over Pandian’s influence.Rejecting all such talk, senior BJD leader Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak told ANI, “There is no infighting at all. All MPs, MLAs and workers are united under the leadership of Naveen Patnaik. We are and will always remain a secular party.”Backing him, BJD veteran Bhupinder Singh warned against any attempt to undermine the party's unity. “There is no groupism... An outsider cannot lead the party. Naveen Patnaik is the only leader,” Singh said, in an indirect reference to Pandian’s critics within the organisation.BJD’s Shashi Bhushan Behera echoed the sentiment, saying the meeting in Bhubaneswar was a routine affair. “The public stands with Naveen Patnaik. He is aware of everything. All leaders are with him.”But outside the party, the BJP remained unconvinced. Rajya Sabha MP Sujeet Kumar questioned the BJD’s flip-flop on the bill. “They are totally confused. One MP supported, another opposed, and one didn’t even show up. It’s a drama. Let them explain this to the public,” he said.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill was passed last week by the Rajya Sabha with 128 votes in favour and 95 against, after the Lok Sabha cleared it with 288 votes for and 232 against.

NEW DELHI: London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari , a defence consultant wanted on charges of tax evasion and money laundering. The judgement also said that Bhandari, in Tihar jail , would be at risk ""of extortion and violence"" from ""other prisoners and prison officials""""In our judgment, having regard to all the evidence and information provided on this ground, including the fresh evidence, we conclude that in Tihar prison, the appellant (Bhandari) would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials,"" their judgment said.The application, part of a two-step process to escalate the case to the UK Supreme Court, was the government's first move—but with this stage denied, officials have yet to confirm whether they will seek direct permission from the Supreme Court.""The court received an application from the government of India seeking certification of points of law of general importance and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court,"" justice Timothy Holroyde said.""Having considered the written submissions, the court is satisfied that no oral hearing is necessary, and no further submissions required. The two points on which leave to appeal was sought is refused. The reasons being that neither of the points of law of general importance were involved in the court's decision,"" he added.The court granted Bhandari's appeal against extradition on human rights grounds, ruling that sending him to India would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) due to concerns over the conditions of his proposed custody in Tihar Jail. Additionally, the court upheld a second ground under Article 6 of the ECHR, citing concerns about the burden and standard of proof in Indian criminal trials, which could undermine his right to a fair trial.Bhandari was ordered to be discharged in February after a ruling by Westminster Magistrates' Court in November 2022, which led to the withdrawal of then UK home secretary Suella Braverman’s extradition order.He faced two separate extradition requests from India—one certified in June 2020 for alleged money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and another in June 2021 for allegedly attempting to evade tax under the Black Money Act, 2015.","London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari.

""But there were many other things which also happened during this period, some of it was a collateral of the situation; some of it was actually a carryover from the Covid era.

Though almost 78% of the waste is processed per day in the region, other parts of the country don’t have records of processing that much waste.The rules, notified by the environment ministry last week, will now make it mandatory for producers, recyclers, operators of waste storage facilities and collection points to register themselves on a dedicated portal for tracking and monitoring of their specific roles and time-bound targets in properly disposing of those waste.Every registered producer will have specific targets for recycling of waste under the EPR framework. Non-compliance of the rules will attract fines (environmental compensation) from state and central pollution control boards/committees as per guidelines, depending on the loss and damage the waste may cause to the local environment including air and water quality.“The payment of environmental compensation shall not absolve the producer from the extended producer responsibility, and the unfulfilled extended producer responsibility for a particular year shall be carried forward to the next year and so on for a period up to three years,” said the notification.The rules will, however, not apply for waste generated from defence projects, atomic energy sites and natural disasters.Under the rules, Bureau of Indian Standards and Indian Road Congress will also prepare code of practices for use of recycled materials in road construction.The money collected as environmental compensation under this rule will be kept by the CPCB in a separate account and will be utilised only for collection and recycling of uncollected, legacy and orphan waste.The urban development and municipal bodies of the states/UTs will be responsible for formulation and implementation of waste management policy, and issuance of directives for management of waste and utilisation of processed waste in its jurisdiction.These agencies will also be responsible for setting up of intermediate waste storage facilities and processing sites on local or regional or cluster basis within a year of notification of these rules.",India generates 150-500 million tonne of construction & demolition waste every year.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday responded sharply to criticism over his recent interaction with Union ministers, particularly his stroll with minister Kiren Rijiju at Srinagar's Tulip Garden by the Dal Lake.The backlash from Valley leaders comes after the passage of contentious Waqf Amendment Act in Parliament.In his remarks, Abdullah clarified the encounter, saying, “It is right that two days ago, I took my father to the Tulip Garden. It is a coincidence that a Union minister was present there at the moment. We greeted each other. He wanted to get a picture with me, how could I refuse?”Dismissing the criticism as politically motivated, he added, “Now, those who gave BJP an entry into J&K are trying to use that against me. Those who have not apologised to the people of J&K for what happened in 2016, should first take a look into their own actions and the price J&K had to pay for their alliance with the BJP.”His comments come as leaders like PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti accused Abdullah of legitimising the Centre’s unilateral decisions. “The chief minister’s actions not only deepened the sense of alienation and helplessness within the Muslim community but also lent legitimacy to this unilateral decision widely perceived as dismissive of their interests,” she said, urging the assembly to pass a resolution rejecting the bill.""The drama created by the ruling party in the assembly from the last three days, and what we saw in the Tulip Garden, is shameful. The BJP is attacking the Muslims of the country left, right, and centre. By welcoming and entertaining Union Minister Kiren Rijiju, the CM has sent a message to all Muslims of the country that J&K government supports Waqf Amendment,"" Mufti said later to ANI news agency.Echoing her, People’s Conference leader Sajad Lone said Abdullah should have distanced himself from Rijiju as a symbolic protest. “There was no need to meet him. It sends a very wrong message,” Lone said.During his Kashmir visit, Rijiju also met NC president Farooq Abdullah , while Omar Abdullah welcomed Union home minister Amit Shah for a high-level meeting in Srinagar.",Omar Abdullah responds sharply to criticism over interaction with Union ministers. Comments come as leaders like PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti accused Abdullah of legitimising the Centre”s unilateral decisions. The backlash from Valley leaders comes after the passage of contentious Waqf Amendment Act in Parliament.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120123365,imgsize-1429663,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-58.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday asked all chief electoral officers (CEOs) — particularly of states/UTs due for assembly polls next year — to start training booth level officers (BLOs) and urge the political parties to appoint adequate number of booth level agents (BLAs) ahead of the impending announcement of a staggered, pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of their electoral rolls.These directions were given by EC on the concluding day of CEOs conference — presided over by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar in the presence of election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi. The Commission on Thursday also held separate, one-on-one interactions with the CEOs of the five poll-bound states/UT — Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam and Puducherry -- to understand any issues unique to them.The SIR process in these states/UT and a few others to be covered in the initial phase, is likely to stretch over three months, culminating with the publication of their final roll in January end or start of February.Having heard all CEOs at the two-day conference, on the progress of mapping of their electors with the roll published after the last intensive revision undertaken in 2003-2004 and also having clarified their queries on the SIR process, EC is set to hold internal deliberations over the next couple of days to finalise the pan-India SIR schedule.As reported by TOI on Wednesday, EC may announce the nationwide SIR exercise — covering the five poll-bound states/UT and a few others in the initial phase — within the next 3-4 days.Elaborating on the need for CEOs to start training BLOs immediately, a senior EC official said: “BLOs are a crucial link in the implementation of SIR”. The officer added that BLOs shall be updated on the processes to be followed, including distribution of enumeration forms and aiding the electors to sign and submit them, either physically or online. The mandatory requirement of making three visits to the electors’ addresses shall be emphasised during their daylong training.Also, given that EC is keen to hold the pan-India SIR with full involvement of the political parties, it has directed the state/UT CEOs to engage with the parties and encourage them to appoint BLAs. These BLAs may also be trained on aspects of SIR.Sources said it was explained to CEOs that any elector in their state/UT can easily be mapped with the 2003/04 roll of any state/UT as rolls of all states/UTs are now available in a digitised form.",Election Commission on Thursday asked all chief electoral officers (CEOs) to start training booth level officers (BLOs) EC is set to hold internal deliberations over the next couple of days to finalise the pan-India SIR schedule.

‘Criminal illegal aliens’: White House flags 'disturbing pattern' after Indian trucker crash in California; calls out 'serious gaps',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/criminal-illegal-aliens-white-house-flags-disturbing-pattern-after-indian-trucker-crash-in-california-calls-out-serious-gaps/articleshow/124776067.cms,"Jashanpreet Singh has been arrested for driving a truck under the influence and killing 3 in California.

ICE Puts Illegal Indian Trucker On Notice After California Crash | ‘High On Drugs, Didn’t Brake’





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday highlighted what she called a “disturbing pattern” of criminal illegal aliens being issued commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs), after trucker Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old 'illegal' immigrant from India, was charged in a California crash that killed three people.Leavitt accused California of issuing a CDL to Singh, who drove under the influence and caused a fiery pile-up on Interstate 10 earlier this week. The Department of Transportation (DoT) has launched an investigation into how Singh obtained his license.“California gave this individual a license, and it’s something the Department of Transportation has already looked into,” Leavitt said during a White House briefing. “Secretary Duffy has been cracking down on licenses being wrongfully issued to people who clearly should not hold such positions.”""As for this case in California, on October 22, ICE lodged an immigration detainer for this individual following his arrest by local authorities in California on charges of manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence. He killed three people. And he first entered the United States in 2022 through the southern border.And he was released into our country by the previous administration. ICE has lodged a separate detainer for this individual. And these tragedies are following a disturbing pattern of these criminal illegal aliens being issued commercial vehicle licenses. The Department of Transportation is absolutely cracking down on that,"" she said.Singh, who entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2022, was released pending an immigration hearing under the Biden administration’s “alternatives to detention” policy. He has since been arrested and charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence causing injury.Federal authorities confirmed that ICE has lodged a detainer against him following his arrest.Dashcam footage from the crash showed Singh’s semi-truck slamming into multiple vehicles on the I-10 freeway in San Bernardino County, killing three people and injuring four others. Investigators say he was impaired and never hit the brakes before impact.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Singh’s case reflects a broader safety concern involving commercial drivers who lack proper immigration status or English proficiency.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy renewed criticism of California’s licensing policies, arguing that the state’s refusal to enforce federal English-language requirements for truck drivers has created safety risks.“This tragedy wouldn’t have happened if Governor Newsom had followed the new rules,” Duffy said, adding that the federal government will withhold $40 million in highway safety funds from California for failing to comply.California officials, however, said Singh’s federal work authorization was approved multiple times by the US government — allowing him to legally obtain a commercial license under existing law.The fatal crash follows another high-profile incident in Florida, where Harjinder Singh, also an Indian national who entered the US illegally in 2018, was charged in August for a truck crash that killed three people. Both cases have reignited debate over immigration, licensing, and road safety in the trucking industry.Immigrants make up nearly one in five long-haul truck drivers in the US, according to the American Trucking Associations.","Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old 'illegal' immigrant from India, was charged in a California crash that killed three people.

Toxic air in their metros made them pollution refugees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toxic-air-in-their-metros-made-them-pollution-refugees/articleshow/124774617.cms,"Amid increasing pollution in metros, especially after Diwali, couples are finding fresh beginnings in Goa, where clean air and blue skies promise a healthier future for them and their children

Delhi’s Air Quality Deteriorates Sharply to ‘Red Zone’ as Diwali Fireworks Trigger Severe Pollution

Last Oct, hotelier Ankit Gupta flew to Delhi from Panaji to celebrate Diwali with his parents in Maharani Bagh, an upscale residential area in South-East Delhi. Within hours, he developed a sinus infection. Ten days later, he remained on medication, struggling with respiratory problems.“Every friend of mine in Delhi is suffering from some form of respiratory illness,” Gupta said.Gupta, his wife Meenakshi Rajput (45) and 10-year-old daughter had moved to Goa in Jan 2024 after repeated bouts of respiratory problems left them scrambling for sanity, amid repeated visits to doctors’ chambers.Families that uprooted themselves from Delhi to settle in Goa — with great reluctance at first — are glad they made the shift.Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) on Diwali touched 345, in the ‘very poor’ category — the highest since 2021, when it had reached 382. Toxic smoke caused PM2.5 levels to soar to 675 micrograms per cubic metre at midnight, again the worst since 2021.PM2.5, or particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, are tiny airborne particles that pose significant health risks when inhaled.Because of how small they are, they can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma, coughing, breathing difficulties, and increased risk of conditions like lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.Mumbai, too, saw a sharp rise, with AQI levels up 9% on Diwali, compared to the night before.“Our respiratory issues were getting worse,” said Gupta. “We had chronic bouts of respiratory illness after every Diwali. Given our health concerns, we had no choice but to move. My daughter developed an adenoid infection because of respiratory illness and we had to get them surgically removed. We were asked by our doctors to go to a cleaner area. Delhi is like a gas chamber.”For Prashant Kalra and his wife, their decision to relocate was driven by concern about their daughter’s health. He put up a post on Instagram recently, explaining why — as a responsible father and a husband — he took the seemingly “reckless” decision. His post soon went viral, with many joining in and sharing their own reasons for leaving Gurugram and Delhi.“We were on a road trip in 2018, around Diwali,” Kalra said. “We were headed to a boutique hotel in Rajasthan to escape the Diwali pollution. While on that trip, our very boutiquey hotel decided to have a Diwali firework display, which prompted a coughing bout from our daughter. At that point, we decided that the north was no longer going to be home, and that a relocation was unavoidable.”In 2019, the Kalras made the journey south, seeking refuge in Goa, where the air was free from toxic smog.“Young parents like us are looking for cleaner air for our kids,” Kalra explained. “The main challenges are giving up work, the social circle, the convenience of a big city, the fear of the unknown and similar issues. But increasingly, there are parents who just don’t have a choice as their kids are getting sicker each year.”Gupta and Kalra are part of a growing tribe of Indian parents fleeing the deadly air pollution that envelops the country’s metros. These ‘pollution refugees’ have found that Goa’s palm-tinged villages and sunny climes are kinder to their lungs.On Aug 6, 2022, four-year-old Damian (name changed) lay gasping for breath at Hiranandani Hospital in Powai, an upscale suburb in Central Mumbai. His fretful parents watched their son, his face dwarfed by the oxygen mask that was helping his lungs.Midnight visits to the emergency room had become routine for Damian’s parents. This was not the first time that they had seen doctors pump steroids and medicines into the wiry frame of their boy. But it would be the last, they decided.“We realised that this was the tipping point for us,” said Damian’s father, Lionel. “Our company was going remote and there was nothing keeping us in Mumbai any more.”Musician Stefan Kaye and his wife were in the same boat. Their move away from the national capital began with the search for suitable schools for their three-year old daughter.“It got to a stage where we were checking schools to see if they had air purifiers in every room and if the children were made to exercise outdoors or indoors. There were serious ramifications for her health and we were dissatisfied with the facilities that schools had to counter the effects of pollution,” Kaye said.The Kayes could feel their eyes stinging in Delhi because of the toxins in the air. “There used to be a yellow haze, and we always had a burning sensation at the back of our throat. This can take years of your life,” said Kaye, who now lives in Goa.According to the India State Level Disease Burden Initiative study published in The Lancet, one out of every eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution. The study says that the average life expectancy in India would have been 1.7 years higher, had the air pollution level been less than the minimal level causing health loss.The ambient air quality in Delhi dances between hazardous and very severe. A deadly cocktail of construction dust, vehicular emissions and ash from crop burning chokes the national capital region, which fumes from firecrackers only exacerbates.“We moved to Goa because the health of our daughter was a real concern. As parents, we felt that it was irresponsible to raise a child and almost negligent in a way to live in Delhi,” Kaye said.","Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) on Diwali touched 345, in the ‘very poor’ category.

Why Sushant Singh Rajput inspires this Left candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-sushant-singh-rajput-inspires-this-left-candidate/articleshow/124774479.cms,"Acting and activism

A different script

PATNA: The famous Sinha library was closed. But outside the gate, Divya Gautam, still in her teens and in the middle of a break from structured education, saw the poster of a film fest, named Cinema of Resistance. Some of the movies she saw that week, Iranian auteur Majid Majidi’s ‘Children of Heaven’, and the documentaries of displacement and forest rights by the Jharkhand filmmaker duo, Meghnath and Biju Toppo, including their aching ‘Gadi Lohardaga Mail’, stayed with her long after the lights came on.It was the beginning of a realisation for Divya that she wanted to do something different. “I wasn’t really interested in the bazaar of competitive examinations for wannabe engineers. I failed the tests,” says the 34-yearold theatre activist-cum-academic, also an unusual CPIML (Liberation) candidate contesting the Digha assembly seat in suburban Patna in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections Divya is also a cousin of Sushant Singh Rajput , the promising Hindi film star (‘Kai Po Che!’, ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’, ‘Chhichhore’) who was found dead at his Mumbai residence in 2020.Sushant was five years older than her. Both started their acting careers in theatre. Then their trajectories changed. Sushant moved to Hindi cinema.After joining college, Divya found herself drawn towards Left cultural groups that reflected her own sensibilities.She started working in college theatre and with study groups associated with the radical Left party. In Patna College, the Saharsa-born daughter of an engineer and homemaker acted in plays like Mannu Bhandari’s ‘Mahabhoj’, discussed Occupy The Wall Street movement with fellow students and showed films such as ‘Modern Times’ to underline how capitalism dehumanises people.From culture, Divya gradually moved towards a more active role in campus politics. As a student of mass communication, she mobilised fellow students for better facilities at the department. “There was no camera, no newspaper, no studio, no library, only lectures,” she recalls. The movement achieved limited success.In 2012, Divya took the big step of agreeing to contest for the president’s post on an AISA ticket in the students’ union election. She lost narrowly to the ABVP candidate. This was also the time when she formally joined CPIML(L). When the Nirbhaya rape horror happened a few months later, she took to the streets, staging plays such as ‘Bekhauf Azaadi’ and highlighting the need for women’s agency and the importance of consent.It’s been a long and twisted journey since then. Divya has post-graduated in women’s studies from TISS, Hyderabad, worked on rural development and land rights in Jharkhand, cleared and dumped state civil service, taught mass communication in Patna’s Women’s College, and acted in Italian dramatist Dario Fo’s plays while working on her PhD on ‘Caste, class and masculinity in Bhojpuri stardom’. “I refused the govt job because I knew I won’t be able to speak up,” she says.A few weeks back when the party asked her to contest from Digha, a seat that BJP retained, polling 57% votes in 2020, she readily agreed. CPIML(L) had got 30% of the votes cast.Santosh Sahar of CPIML(L)’s central committee says that voters in Digha are predominantly middle class. “As an educated woman, who has always spoken up for gender rights, and has been committed to the rights of the marginalised, Divya was a good choice for the seat,” he says.Divya has started campaigning and says “there are so many issues”. “Unemployment, absence of quality education for the youth, migration... We have a Patliputra Industrial Area, but no industries,” she said.The activist-academic points to the city’s open drains, harassment of daily-wagers, atrocities against the urban poor and the ‘saffron’ politics of polarisation.She also talks about Sushant, who taught her mathematics when she was a kid and whose work she admires and is inspired by. “I remember him as an artiste,” she says. “No matter what, I will always do 1-2 plays every year. It will be my tribute to the theatre and him.”","Divya Gautam is contesting the Digha assembly seat in suburban Patna in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.

Bihar polls: BJP almost confirms Nitish Kumar is NDA’s CM pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-bjp-almost-confirms-nitish-kumar-is-ndas-cm-pick/articleshow/124773868.cms,"""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

PATNA: Nitish Kumar is the leader and CM of NDA govt in Bihar and people trust him and PM Narendra Modi to deliver on their promises in the state, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said Thursday while NDA tore into INDIA bloc after the opposition named RJD ’s Tejashwi Prasad as its chief ministerial face before elections in Nov. NDA called the bloc’s move a “shameful alliance of corruption and opportunism”.“Charges have already been framed against Tejashwi in the IRCTC case. The court has stated that this is a very serious case of corruption. Tejashwi is an accused in this case under Section 420 of the IPC,” Prasad said. When reporters asked him who will be the NDA’s CM face, Prasad said: “Where is a vacancy?”BJP, JDU, and LJP (Ram Vilas) functionaries — joined by political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor — accused the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam. Bihar deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP said RJD was “torturing even its allies”. “This is a day of shame for Bihar that Grand Alliance promised to make the son of a thief the CM for sake of power. Everyone knows when Lalu was in office, criminals were encouraged. They want to bring back the same govt, and Congress is encouraging this.”The IRCTC land-for-jobs scam dates back to the period when RJD chief Lalu Prasad, as railway minister during first UPA govt of 2004-2009, allegedly awarded contracts for two railway hotels in exchange for land plots transferred to a firm linked to his family.Both Lalu and Tejashwi have denied wrongdoing, calling the case politically motivated.UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said RJD-Congress tie-up was “a mismatched game”, recalling that Lalu was jailed during Congress’s tenure. “Now he is aligned with the same Congress. This alliance will not work in Bihar,” Maurya said.Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan mocked the alliance for sidelining Congress. “After so many controversies, what would they do if they accepted your face? Congress was insulted as the face of just one man was visible in the entire press conference,” he said.JDU targeted both Tejashwi and INDIA bloc’s social arithmetic, taking a swipe at reports VIP chief Mukesh Sahani was promised the deputy CM post. “Laddoos for 2.60% of the Mallahs, pumpkins for 18% of the Muslims. Are Muslims there only to scare them to vote?” JDU wrote on X.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor ridiculed Tejashwi’s promise to provide govt jobs to one member of every family. “The one who promises three crore jobs isn’t saying what he did when his parents were in power. Now all that’s left to hear is that Tejashwi will make Bihar a golden Lanka in a few days,” he said.BJP national spokesperson Ajay Alok said Congress had “sold its self-respect” by agreeing to Tejashwi’s projection. “Sitting on a stage where Rahul Gandhi’s photo was not even on the poster, Ashok Gehlot exposed his party’s helplessness by declaring Tejashwi as CM face.... Let Nov 14 come, they will be seen fighting each other,” he said, referring to the date of poll results.","BJP, JDU, and LJP functionaries accuse the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam.

The case had been registered by Vadakkencherry police after parents complained that the teacher struck their children on the legs during class at 10am on Sept 16, 2019. The complaint was lodged four days later on Sept 20.The court said there was no explanation for the delay and no proof the children suffered injuries, indicating that only minimal force was used. It found that the teacher had “no intention to cause harm beyond what was necessary to enforce discipline” and had acted with restraint.Calling the prosecution “unfortunate”, the court said parents failed to appreciate the teacher’s intentions. It said when a child is entrusted to a teacher, there is implied consent for the teacher to exercise parental authority to correct the pupil.With that reasoning, HC quashed the criminal proceedings, affirming a teacher’s right to maintain discipline within reasonable limits.","Kerala high court quashes criminal case against schoolteacher who caned three class 5 students for fighting.

In such circumstances, the court is obliged to restore the party to the very position he would have occupied had the error not occurred,” the bench said.SC accepted there was an omission on its part, wherein it did not clarify in its judgment that possession of a building in Chandigarh would be handed over upon receipt of amount awarded by it. Taking advantage of its omission, an “unscrupulous litigant” refused to hand over the possession of the building despite being paid Rs 2 crore as directed by the apex court.In this case, the litigant had agreed to buy the property in 1989, paid an advance of Rs 25,000 and took possession of the property.But soon litigation started and the property’s ownership could not be transferred to him. Thirty-nine years down the line, SC brought the litigation to an end by directing he should be paid Rs 2 crore in lieu of the earnest money of Rs 25,000 that was paid in 1989. However, SC, while delivering its judgment, did not mention that he, in turn, had to hand over the possession of the property to its owner. This led to a fresh round litigation as the owner approached trial court and then Punjab and Haryana HC, which granted order in his favour.The apex court upheld the order passed by the courts and imposed a cost of Rs 10 lakh on the “unscrupulous litigant” — the buyer.","SC accepted there was an omission on its part, wherein it did not clarify in its judgment that possession of a building in Chandigarh would be handed over upon receipt of amount awarded by it.

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

""They are going to stop..."" Trump Reiterates Claim That India Is Cutting Down Russian Oil Imports





NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports after the US on Wednesday sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, the largest exporters of those barrels.Reliance, the single-largest Indian consumer of Russian oil, will be the biggest loser as it buys most of those barrels directly from Rosneft under a term contract. Russian crude makes up about half of the feed at the company's 35-million-tonne complex.“Recalibration of Russian oil imports is ongoing and Reliance will be fully aligned to GOI (Government of India) guidelines,” a Reliance spokesman told Reuters.The curbs on Rosneft will also make life harder for Nayara Energy, which is half owned by the Russian giant and struggling to stay afloat since September when the EU imposed sanctions. Analysts said selling products from its 20-million-tonne refinery at Gujarat's Vadinar will be tough.Importers can receive contracted shipments till November 21. Unlike previous sanctions, when Russian oil could be traded within the $60 price cap, this time the curbs are directed at the companies, making their barrel tainted after the cut-off date.So far this year, 36% of India’s crude has been from Russia, with Rosneft and Lukoil supplying nearly 60% of this.A senior executive of IndianOil, one of the largest consumers of Russian oil among state-run refiners, said those barrels make up 15-18% of their crude basket.“It is too early. We are looking at the fine print. But it will not be too difficult to arrange alternative supplies from West Asia or other geographies such as Africa, the US etc. But others will also be crowding those markets, which will jack up benchmark prices and premia on other crude. This will impact margins. But Russian oil somehow finds its way into the market as we have seen in the past… but banking issues may crop up,” he said.Sure enough, benchmark Brent crude price shot up 5%, or by $2.9 a barrel, to 65.50 on Thursday. ""The good thing is prices are in their 60s. Even if they rise to $70, it will be manageable.""US President Donald Trump has been mounting pressure on countries such as India and China to lower oil imports from Russia as part of a plan to squeeze Moscow to come to the negotiating table on the Ukraine conflict. Trump imposed secondary tariffs of 25% on India, in addition to 25% reciprocal tariffs, citing Russian crude purchases.Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hit back at the US. “This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia. But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure.” He said breaking the balance in the global energy markets could lead to a hike in prices that would be uncomfortable for countries such as the US.As a country, the loss of discounted Russian oil could potentially cost India, which meets 85% of its crude requirement through imports, an estimated annual savings of about $4-5 billion on its oil import bill. Ratings agency ICRA estimates that replacement supplies at market prices would increase the oil import bill by 2%, potentially impacting the macroeconomic parameters.Sumit Ritolia, analyst at global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler, said the term arrangement with Rosneft could “introduce some near-term friction, especially from a compliance standpoint for RIL. The company would understandably wish to avoid any exposure to OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) and it will need to look at its Russian crude strategy.”The immediate operational impact on state-run refiners, he said, ""should remain limited"" as they buy Russian crude through tender from third-party traders. “However, secondary sanctions related to logistics and financing could pose indirect challenges.”","Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports.

NEW DELHI: Punjabi singer Teji Kahlon was shot in Canada in an attack claimed by associates of gangster Rohit Godara, highlighting an ongoing transnational gang feud.In a social media post, the men named Mahender Saran Dilana, Rahul Rinau, and Vicky Phalwan said Kahlon was targeted for allegedly supplying weapons and money to rival gangs and acting as an informant.""We carried out the shooting in Canada at Teji Kahlon. He was shot in the stomach. If he understands, fine.

Local authorities in Canada are investigating the attack.Earlier this month, 40-year-old businessman Ramesh Rulania was shot dead while exercising at a gym in Rajasthan’s Kuchaman town.Police said the assailant entered the gym around 5:20 am and shot Rulania at close range before fleeing.

Several other businessmen in the region have reportedly received similar threats.Rohit Godara, also known as Rawatram Swami, is a notorious gangster from Lunkaransar in Bikaner.Police say he may be linked to several high-profile killings, including the December 2022 murder of gangster Raju Thehat in Sikar, the May 2022 killing of popular Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, and the December 2023 killing of Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi—both of which Godara reportedly claimed responsibility for.",Punjabi singer Teji Kahlon was shot in Canada in an attack claimed by associates of gangster Rohit Godara.

Lack of real match practice for India’s star batters Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shreyas Iyer could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup. The recent Perth ODI against Australia was a small warning sign.Kohli, Rohit, and Iyer form India’s top four, but all three are currently playing only one format. Rohit and Virat have retired from T20Is and Tests, while Shreyas Iyer, who has taken a six-month break from red-ball cricket, is not part of India’s T20I setup for the upcoming World Cup in February next year.The Indian cricket team was slated to play 27 ODIs according to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP) 2023–27. The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, which was scheduled for August, has been postponed, and the first ODI at Perth was not a promising start for India’s quest for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Rohit, Virat, and Shreyas lasted just 46 balls between them, managing only 19 runs.Rohit and Virat were playing a competitive match after a gap of five months and looked rusty. Meanwhile, Shreyas, who has played for India A and in the Duleep Trophy, had his technical flaws exposed again. Both Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who stand six feet six inches tall, have a high release point of almost 2.15 metres (nearly 7.05 feet).Whatever length they bowled, the duo generated extra bounce, with almost every ball hitting the top half of the bat. Perth was a bouncy track, and India’s top order looked all at sea.The ball that dismissed Rohit Sharma wasn’t particularly short, but it rose sharply to armpit height outside the off-stump, striking the upper portion of Rohit’s bat. He could have left it alone, but ended up poking at it. The unexpected bounce surprised him; yet it wasn’t due to the pitch — it was Hazlewood’s skill that gave it its sting.Virat Kohli, who registered his first duck on Australian soil, was also troubled by that length. Starc and Hazlewood had troubled Kohli in the past too. In 10 ODI innings, Hazlewood had dismissed Kohli five times — averaging a wicket every second innings. But it was Hazlewood’s new-ball partner, Starc, who sent Kohli back. Kohli went for a booming shot, chasing the ball away from his body, and Cooper Connolly, patrolling at backward point, took a spectacular catch. It was a shot born out of desperation to get off the mark, which we have rarely seen from Kohli in a format where he is an undisputed king.Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer’s struggles against short-pitched balls are well documented. The newly appointed ODI vice-captain had been prolific in the last two 50-over ICC tournaments. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, he was India’s leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. Iyer had hammered 530 runs during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He had been pivotal in India’s success in both tournaments, but in Perth, Hazlewood exposed a chink in Shreyas’ armour again. Relentless Hazlewood denied Shreyas any width, hitting the deck hard and creating an angle from a good length, which tangled Shreyas up. As he tried to adjust and negate the extra bounce, rising around his ribs, the ball ended up brushing his gloves.The three dismissals have raised eyebrows as the next World Cup will be held in South Africa, where pitches will be bouncy. India will play only two away ODI series to tackle the bounce factor: the ongoing three-match series against world champions Australia, and another against England in July 2026. However, the spice in English pitches has lessened, as it doesn’t suit their “Bazball” approach.In the case of Shreyas, he is playing for India A and, after taking a break from four-day cricket, will likely be available for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But the big question is whether the two senior stars, Kohli and Rohit, will play domestic 50-over tournaments to stay match-ready. It doesn’t matter how hard they train in the nets; having played enough cricket, they know there is no substitute for real match scenarios.Since Rohit and Virat now play only one format, their rustiness was visible in the first outing. Playing just the IPL won’t guarantee them a spot in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad. If they want to pursue their broken November 19 dream and win the trophy in South Africa, they must play domestic cricket to stay match-fit. If they choose not to, they are doing a disservice to Indian cricket and their own reputations.After India’s Test series win against West Indies in New Delhi, coach Gautam Gambhir was asked , “Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still part of India’s plans for the 2027 World Cup?”Gambhir said: “Look, the 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and it is very important to stay in the present. Obviously, they are quality players; their experience will be invaluable in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two will have a successful tour, and more importantly, the team will have a successful series.”Gambhir may have dodged the big question, but he knows the clock is ticking. If he and Shubman Gill want India to take a step forward in 2027, they will need their ageing superstars match-ready. If not, India must blood talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Verma, giving them limited matches to prepare for the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer produced paltry returns in the first ODI vs Australia in Perth.

Poll Do you believe the construction of the Ram Temple has a significant impact on the celebration of Deepavali this year? Yes, it's very impactful No, it doesn’t change much

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday penned a letter to citizens on the occasion of Deepavali , highlighting the festival as a time of energy, enthusiasm, and reflection on the nation’s achievements. In his message, he noted that this is the second Deepavali after the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and emphasised Lord Shri Ram’s teachings on righteousness and courage in fighting injustice.PM Modi referred to “Operation Sindoor” as a recent example of upholding justice, adding that the festival is particularly special this year as lamps will be lit in many districts, including remote areas, where Naxalism and Maoist terrorism have been eradicated. He praised citizens who have abandoned violence and embraced development, viewing it as a major achievement for the nation.""I extend my heartfelt greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Deepavali, a festival filled with energy and enthusiasm. This is the second Deepavali after the grand construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Lord Shri Ram teaches us to uphold righteousness and also gives us the courage to fight injustice. We have seen a living example of this a few months ago during Operation Sindoor . During Operation Sindoor, Bharat not only upheld righteousness but also avenged injustice,"" he said.""This Deepavali is particularly special because, for the first time, lamps will be lit in many districts across the country, including remote areas. These are the districts where Naxalism and Maoist terrorism have been eradicated from the root. In recent times, we have seen many individuals abandoning the path of violence and joining the mainstream of development, expressing faith in the Constitution of our country.This is a major achievement for the nation,"" he added.Highlighting recent economic reforms, the Prime Minister mentioned the implementation of lower GST rates during the “GST Bachat Utsav” (Savings Festival), which has helped citizens save thousands of crores of rupees. PM Modi also underlined India’s growing global stature, describing the country as a symbol of stability and sensitivity and projecting it to soon become the world’s third-largest economy.As he highlighted India's reforms, achievements and policies, he added, ""In a world going through multiple crises, Bharat has emerged as a symbol of both stability and sensitivity. We are also on track to become the third-largest economy in the world in the near future.""Calling for collective responsibility, PM Modi urged citizens to adopt Swadeshi products, promote “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat”, respect all languages, maintain cleanliness, prioritise health, reduce oil consumption, and embrace Yoga. He drew inspiration from Deepavali’s symbolism, saying, “when one lamp lights another, its light doesn’t diminish, but it grows further,” and encouraged spreading harmony, cooperation, and positivity. ""Let us adopt ""Swadeshi"" (local products) and proudly say: ""This is Swadeshi!"" Let us promote the spirit of ""Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat"". Let us respect all languages. Let us maintain cleanliness. Let us prioritize our health. Let us reduce the use of oil in our food by 10% and embrace Yoga. All these efforts will rapidly move us towards a ""Viksit Bharat"", he said.The Prime Minister also urged citizens to contribute to building a “Viksit” (developed) and “Aatmanirbhar” (self-reliant) India.This comes a day after PM Modi celebrated aboard INS Vikrant with Navy personnel during which he witnessed MiGs in action, singing programs and addressed armed forces.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi penned a letter to citizens on the occasion of Deepavali.

Deletions took place using VoIP between Dec 2022 & Feb 2023





BENGALURU: Karnataka police’s special investigation team probing the alleged voter deletion scam in Aland constituency during the 2023 assembly polls has reportedly uncovered evidence of attempts to remove names from the electoral rolls, and identified six suspects.Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application. SIT sources said they suspect accused paid Rs 4.8 lakh to those who facilitated the deletions. Officials are probing how the centre gained access to EC’s portal to file fake voter deletion requests. The probe was carried out by CID cyber crime unit before SIT took over. “At least 6,000 votes have been allegedly deleted,” a CID official said.According to CID sources, preliminary findings show that the deletions took place between Dec 2022 and Feb 2023 using voice over internet protocol (VoIP). “There were requests to delete 6,994 votes. While a few were genuine, most were bogus. The applications allegedly targeted Dalit and minority voters. The deletions were halted after the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) ordered a status quo,” CID officials said.The irregularities have been traced to local resident Mohammed Ashfaq, who was questioned in Feb 2023 and let off. He is currently in Dubai and a blue corner notice is being processed to locate him.Aland, part of Kalaburagi district, is represented by Congress MLA B R Patil. He along with Kalaburagi district minister Priyank Kharge were the first to flag the irregularities to the CEO. The Congress govt later formed the SIT, headed by Additional Director General of Police B K Singh, after Rahul Gandhi raised allegations of vote theft in Aland— the home turf of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.Reacting to the reports, Priyank Kharge posted on X: ``Voters deleted for just Rs 80 in Aland. The latest findings from the Karnataka SIT confirm what we've been saying all along, over 6,000 genuine voters were struck off the rolls through a paid operation ahead of the 2023 elections in Aland. A full-fledged data centre was operating out of Kalaburagi, where operators were systematically deleting voters' names and tampering with our democratic process. All investigations now point to foul play by BJP functionaries and their associates. Every dirty trick and modus operandi from the BJP's #VoteChori playbook will be exposed, and every single person responsible will be held accountable and put behind bars.”On Oct 17, SIT searched the residences of former BJP MLA Subhash Guttedar, his sons, and their chartered accountant Mallikarjun Mahantagol, seizing seven laptops and several mobile phones.Following the revelations, Congress accused the BJP of vote theft, calling it a direct assault on democracy. “The truth about the BJP's vote theft is now before the country. The cost of deleting a vote was Rs 80. This exposé pertains to just one assembly seat. This 'vote theft' by BJP is a direct attack on democracy—where the rights of the poor and marginalised are being snatched, and their voices suppressed,” the party posted on X.Aland MLA BR Patil said he is unaware of the headway made by SIT and declined to comment, adding, “SIT is moving in the right direction.”","Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (AoN) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (LPDs) Another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles -- with ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380-km -- for the S-400 Triumf air defence systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,imgsize-717429,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

"From rushing trains to crowd control, Railways uses real-time map to manage Chhath rush",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-rushing-trains-to-crowd-control-railways-uses-real-time-map-to-manage-chhath-rush/articleshow/124771994.cms,"Viral Video: IRCTC Staff Fight At Delhi’s Nizamuddin Station, 4 Suspended, Rs 5 Lakh Fine Imposed

NEW DELHI: To deal with the upcoming Chhath rush, the railways is using real-time heat-mapping of 35 major stations to monitor heavy passenger movement, rushing standby unreserved trains close to these stations to clear the surge of travellers and creating holding areas for crowd control. These measures are based on passenger data from the festive seasons of the past two years, including this Diwali.In a massive operation, the national transporter is set to run around 13,000 special services before and after the biggest festival of Bihar — nearly double than the number of trains operated last year — to ferry an estimated more than 2.5 crore passengers, similar to the population of Australia.Special trains are in addition to normal trains that the railways operates. Most of these trains are headed for poll-bound Bihar.The number of special trains was determined through analysis of past two years of data, which was fed into a model to assess the demand for each destination, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said. He added that micro monitoring is being done at three levels — divisional, zonal and at the Railway Board.Sources said that freight services on identified routes have been minimised to clear the rush and even Dedicated Freight Corridors are being used.Vaishnaw said on Oct 19 (a day before Diwali), there was a sudden surge of passengers at the Udhna station in Gujarat. “As soon as this started showing on the heat map, passengers were put in queue and a standby unreserved train in the vicinity was moved to clear the traffic build up,” he added. Officials said two special trains were operated from Udhna to Jayanagar in Bihar on that day to clear the rush.There was a similar situation at Ambala in Haryana on Tuesday and the railways followed suit to deal with the situation. “We have three categories — normal traffic, crowded situations and overcrowding. Once there are signs of overcrowding, the entire system moves swiftly to deal with the situation,” Vaishnaw said. He added that learning from earlier experiences, the railways increased the number of destinations in Bihar from 7-8 in 2024 to 28. “We identified the closest station for the convenience of passengers,” the minister said.Vaishnaw also said that the railways has issued orders for construction of permanent holding areas at 76 high footfall railway stations such as Mumbai, Howrah, Lucknow, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Chennai, and Patna, and Secunderabad, Bengaluru, Tirupati, and Ujjain, among others.","The railways is using real-time heat-mapping of 35 major stations to monitor heavy passenger movement.

Bihar polls: Mukesh Sahani emerges as Mahagathbandhan's wildcard; is Congress the weakest link?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-mukesh-sahani-emerges-as-mahagathbandhans-wildcard-is-congress-the-weakest-link/articleshow/124766308.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav Named CM Face, BJP Retaliates with ‘Weak Alliance’ Remark at Mahagathbandhan

Tejashwi formally declared CM face, Sahani named his deputy





Mukesh Sahani: From political exile to deputy CM face





Congress on shaky ground?





The weakest link?





NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Thursday announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate and Mukesh Sahani as the deputy CM face ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. While Tejashwi’s candidature was widely expected, Sahani’s unexpected rise - from a one-time NDA ally often dismissed by rivals to a key power centre within the alliance has become the defining development, signalling a shift in the coalition’s caste arithmetic and leadership dynamics.Behind the show of unity, however, tensions simmer. As Sahani celebrates his political revival, Congress appears to be the uneasy partner in this new equation. Grassroots dissatisfaction over ticket distribution, coupled with its declining influence in seat-sharing talks, raises questions about whether the grand old party is losing ground within Bihar’s opposition bloc.The Mahagathbandhan formally announced Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face for the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. Alongside, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani was declared the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial candidate.The announcement, made during a joint press conference of alliance partners in Patna, ended weeks of speculation over leadership and marked a new phase of coordination within the opposition bloc.Senior Congress leader and election observer Ashok Gehlot said, “All of us sitting here have decided that in these elections, we support Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face.”He confirmed that the Mahagathbandhan would contest the upcoming polls in complete unity, adding that Sahani would serve as Tejashwi’s deputy if the alliance comes to power.Mukesh Sahani’s recent elevation marks a remarkable political comeback. The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had originally been part of the Mahagathbandhan, but disagreements over seat-sharing—stemming from the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s reluctance to prioritise smaller allies—led Sahani to exit the coalition. He later joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and was allotted 11 seats in the 2020 Bihar elections. Although Sahani lost his own contest, his party managed to win four seats.Sahani was subsequently elected to the Bihar Legislative Council, albeit for a shorter term of one and a half years, which expired in July 2022.Once an NDA ally, Sahani faced political isolation after his fallout with the BJP. His decision to contest against the BJP in both the Bihar Legislative Council and Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections further marginalized him, with several VIP MLAs defecting to the BJP in 2022. In the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, Sahani announced plans to field 160 candidates to “oust the incumbent BJP government,” and in Bihar, he fielded 55 candidates against his former ally—but none won. Following these setbacks, a BJP MLA suggested that Sahani’s political chapter in Bihar was over, hinting at his removal as minister and even a potential internal coup within the VIP. Sahani also defied NDA seat-sharing arrangements in the Bihar Legislative Council elections, fielding seven candidates against the BJP once again.In 2025, however, Sahani has staged a political revival, now named the deputy chief ministerial candidate of the opposition bloc.Speaking to reporters in Patna ahead of the announcement, he appeared confident: “Why would I have a problem with anything? Can't you tolerate so much happiness on my face? Mahagathbandhan is moving forward very strongly.”His elevation seems a calculated strategy by the Mahagathbandhan to consolidate Nishad (fishermen) votes and appeal to smaller caste groups that have drifted away from the major alliances. The support base for the Vikassheel Insaan Party consists mainly of the Nishad, Nonia, Bind, Beldar community, which comprises 20 sub-castes of fisherman and boatmen. It also signals social inclusivity — a card the RJD-led bloc has traditionally used effectively in Bihar’s caste-driven politics.While the alliance celebrated unity on stage, discontent brewed within the Congress. In recent weeks, several party workers have expressed anger over the ticket distribution process, alleging bias and manipulation by senior leaders in charge of Bihar affairs.Congress worker Munna Shahi told ANI, “Those whom Rahul Gandhi had entrusted and sent here are from the five-star hotel culture, and they don't like to be brought down to poor ashrams here... We have only one demand, 'ticket chor, gaddi chod'... The selection process has lost its basis. Only eye wash remains now.”After the Congress CEC meeting on Bihar polls, another worker said, “It was said that those people who will be on the screening committee, those who will have their online application will be given tickets. But a few leaders like Krishna Allavaru and Rajesh Ram are making women work hard and go from door to door but cheating them at the end. The promise made by Rahul Gandhi, to honour the youth and women is being broken by Krishna Allavaru. We, the Congress workers, will not stand it. Bihar will not accept it.”Interestingly, on Thursday elevating Congress also replaced Allavaru as Youth Congress chief and brought in Manish Sharma.The internal tensions in the recent weeks by local leaders point to a widening gap between the Congress high command and its state unit. This recurring issue has hurt the party’s performance in multiple states.The Mahagathbandhan’s recalibrated leadership matrix leaves the Congress in an uncomfortable spot. With the RJD holding the chief ministerial claim and the VIP now rewarded with the deputy slot, Congress finds itself without a distinct bargaining chip. Its performance in the 2020 polls, where it contested 70 seats but won only 19, has weakened its ability to negotiate.The current configuration suggests a more RJD-centric alliance, with Tejashwi and Sahani symbolising the blend of legacy and new social representation, while Congress remains peripheral.The joint manifesto of the Mahagathbandhan is set to be released on October 28, after Chhath Puja, with Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expected to join the campaign. However, unless it manages to address internal dissent and project a clear message, Congress could risk further erosion in Bihar’s evolving political narrative.The Bihar assembly elections will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results scheduled for November 14. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising RJD, Congress, CPI, CPI(M), CPI-ML, and Mukesh Sahani’s VIP — faces the NDA alliance led by BJP and JD(U), along with the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and HAM(S).",The Mahagathbandhan on Thursday announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate.

MP: 300 suffer eye injuries after firing carbide guns; 30 may lose sight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mp-300-suffer-eye-injuries-after-firing-carbide-guns-30-may-lose-sight/articleshow/124771807.cms,"Despite curbs, e-comm sites continued to offer carbide-based cannons



BHOPAL: Diwali celebrations turned tragic in Madhya Pradesh when about 300 people, including children , suffered severe to minor eye injuries after they “fired” carbide guns, or agri-cannons, used mainly by farmers to scare away monkeys and birds, on Monday and Tuesday. As many as 30 of them are said to be serious and could lose their sight.Deputy CM Rajendra Shukla said, “A review meeting was called as soon as we got to know. Seven children were seriously injured in Bhopal and admitted in Hamidia hospital, some in Gwalior and Vidisha.Carbide guns have a mixture of calcium carbide, matchstick heads, and gunpowder, officials said. While adding water to calcium carbide generates acetylene gas, ignition creates powerful explosions that result in intense heat, noxious gases, and projectiles. Unofficial reports suggested 300 cases of varying degrees of “alkali injury”, which can cause permanent damage.Doctors at AIIMS-Bhopal said there were two primary types of injury to the eye — acid and alkali. While acid injuries tend to be less severe due to limited penetration, alkali injuries are significantly dangerous.“Alkali eye injuries cause irreversible damage and treatment focuses on preventing further deterioration.In some cases, vision loss may occur. Of the patients admitted to AIIMS-Bhopal, only one has sustained injuries in both eyes,” said Dr Bhavana Sharma, head of department of ophthalmology at AIIMS-Bhopal.While most of the cases were reported from Bhopal and a few neighbouring districts and were being treated in hospitals here, about 50 were reported from Gwalior and Jabalpur.Bhopal chief medical and health officer Dr Manish Sharma said there were 13 patients at AIIMS-Bhopal and 12 at Gandhi Medical College on Thursday. One critical case was sent to AIIMS-Delhi. The others were discharged. He said 15 in Bhopal underwent surgical procedure.Nearly three dozen cases were reported from Bhopal while additional patients were referred from neighbouring Vidisha and Hoshangabad districts. While about 150 patients were treated in Bhopal, many were being treated in district hospitals, he added.Officials said carbide guns, marketed online as “PVC monkey repeller gun”, emerged as alternatives to traditional fireworks.Authorities identified the issue two weeks before Diwali and implemented curbs. Govt had also put a ban on its sale and use. The devices, priced between Rs 150 and Rs 200, were marketed as entertainment items in the open market while their price ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 on e-commerce platforms.Police on Thursday seized at least 42 carbide guns being sold on the roadside, along with 1.5kg of calcium carbide explosives. A vendor was arrested and booked under Section 288 of BNS. He was later released on bail.Despite restrictions, e-commerce platforms continued to offer carbide-based cannons.","As many as 30 of them are said to be serious and could lose their sight.

"Collegium preserves judiciary’s autonomy, say CJI B R Gavai, Justice Kant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-preserves-judiciarys-autonomy-say-cji-b-r-gavai-justice-kant/articleshow/124772986.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Thursday stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges and said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.CJI Gavai was speaking at Royal Institute of Management in Thimphu, Bhutan, while Justice Kant was addressing Sri Lankan Supreme Court in Colombo. The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, stoutly defended the much- criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges.

Poll Do you support the Supreme Court's ruling allowing minors to challenge property sales by guardians? Yes, it's a fair decision. No, it could lead to confusion.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that minors can challenge any property sale or transfer done by their parents or guardians without a lawsuit, after turning 18.The court said adults can cancel such transfers by taking clear actions, like selling or transferring the property themselves.""It can safely be concluded that a voidable transaction executed by the guardian of the minor can be repudiated and ignored by the minor within time on attaining majority either by instituting a suit for setting aside the voidable transaction or by repudiating the same by his unequivocal conduct,"" Justice Mithal, authoring the judgment, said.The verdict came in K S Shivappa vs Smt K Neelamma case. The case involved two plots in Shamanur village, Karnataka, bought in 1971 by Rudrappa in the names of his three minor sons.Rudrappa sold the plots without court permission. After the sons became adults, they sold the plots to K S Shivappa. Third parties who had bought the plots earlier claimed ownership, leading to disputes.Lower courts were divided on whether the minors needed to file a suit to cancel the original sale. The Supreme Court clarified that a formal suit is not needed. Adults can repudiate the guardian’s sale by acting clearly, such as selling the property themselves.The court added that sometimes, minors may not even know about the original sale, or the property may still be in their possession, so filing a suit is not always necessary.","The verdict came in K S Shivappa vs Smt K Neelamma case.

NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for the assembly elections, the ruling National Democratic Alliance and the opposition Mahagathbandhan have cornered each other over issues such as development, migration, and unemployment. However, it all appears to have boiled down to the perennial theme of caste-based politics, with every party fine-tuning its manifesto and candidate list to gauge how various caste communities will vote and how best to retain their traditional voter bases.Swearing by Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur’s legacy of social justice, a caste survey was conducted in Bihar in 2023 to determine the exact population of each caste, aiming to bolster demands for expanded quotas.The survey found that the EBCs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent, which amounts to 63 per cent of the total 13.07 crore population of the state; together, they constitute the socially hefty segment of backward classes. Meanwhile, the “upper caste” groups among Hindus account for only 10.6 per cent.However, the caste proportions seem unlikely to be reflected in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha after the results, as parties appear to be prioritising their traditional voter bases and other factors over population-based representation during the screening of candidates.In the upcoming assembly elections, parties have not only fielded candidates from dominant castes to strengthen their poll prospects but have also calibrated diverse caste combinations to counter caste hegemony across regions.Under the seat-sharing deal between NDA partners, BJP was allotted 101 seats. Riding on the vote banks of the upper castes, BJP gave 49 tickets (48.5%) to upper-caste candidates. Meanwhile, 34 candidates (33.7%) from the OBC community were fielded, including 6 Yadavs, 15 Vaishyas, 7 Kushwahas, and 2 Kurmis.Only 10 EBC candidates (9.9%) and 12 SC candidates (11.9%) are in the poll fray with BJP's symbol.Interestingly, BJP had fielded only 16 Yadavs in 2020 assembly elections. The choice of BJP’s replacements for some of its sitting Yadav MLAs points to its new gameplan: it has gone for a Kushwaha, the most populous OBC community after Yadavs; a Nishad, an increasingly assertive extremely backward classes group; and a Vaishya, the party's traditional supporter, for the Patna Sahib, Aurai and Munger seats, respectively.Chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) has fielded the most candidates from the OBC, EBC, and SC communities.Nitish, who has positioned himself as the poster boy of non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs, has fielded 37 candidates from the OBC community (36.6%) and 22 candidates from the EBC community (21.8%).Additionally, 15 candidates from the SC community (14.9%) and 1 candidate from the ST community (1.0%) are in the poll fray. JD(U) has also distributed tickets to 22 (21.8%) candidates from the upper-caste community in the upcoming assembly elections.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which was allotted 29 seats under the seat-sharing, has fielded five candidates each from the Rajput and Yadav castes, and four each from Paswan and Bhumihar communities.Meanwhile, Chirag Paswan fielded one candidate each from Brahmin, Teli, Pasi, Sudhi, Rauniyar, Kanu, Rajwar, Dhobi, Kushwaha, Ravidas, and Muslim communities.Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha has fielded six candidates in the poll fray. Out of the six candidates, the party has fielded four of Manjhi’s relatives and two Bhumihar candidates.Meanwhile, Upendra Kushwaha 's Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) fielded one Bhumihar, one Rajput, three Kushwahas, and one Vaishya candidate.Catering to its traditional vote banks of Yadavs and Muslims, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has distributed tickets to 51 Yadavs out of 143 seats. The party has also fielded candidates from upper-caste and EBC communities. With Mahagathbandhan parties contesting a total of 255 seats, several constituencies are witnessing “friendly fights” among alliance partners.In total, the RJD has fielded 18 Kurmi-Kushwaha, 51 Yadavs, 8 Vaishyas, 14 upper castes, 33 EBCs, 19 SCs, and 18 Muslims in the upcoming elections.Contesting on 61 seats, the Congress has fielded nearly one-third—21 candidates—from upper-caste communities. The party’s lineup also includes 5 Yadavs, 6 EBCs, 3 Vaishyas, and 12 SC candidates.CPM-L has put forward 3 Koeris, 2 Yadavs, 1 Rajput, 1 EBC, 6 SCs, and 1 Muslim, aiming to make inroads in key constituencies.Muskesh Sahni's VIP is contesting on 15 seats with 3 Yadav, 1 Kurmi-Kushwaha, 2 Upper caste, 1 SC and 8 EBC candidates to target specific voter groups.CPM has fielded 1 Koeri, 1 Yadav, and 1 SC candidate for the upcoming assembly elections.CPI has nominated 2 Yadavs, 1 Bhumihar, and 3 SC candidates to contest in the polls.IIP has fielded 1 Vaishya and 1 EBC candidate for the elections.Muslim representation in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections has seen a noticeable decline, particularly within the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Janata Dal (United), the only NDA constituent to field Muslim candidates — has given tickets to just four Muslim contenders this time, compared to 14 in the previous election.The move is being seen as chief minister Nitish Kumar’s acknowledgment that the community’s support has largely shifted towards the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).On the opposition side, RJD has fielded 18 Muslim candidates, staying true to its traditional Yadav-Muslim base, while the Congress has allotted tickets to 10 Muslim aspirants.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","Bihar's caste politics appears to have boiled down to the perennial theme of caste-based politics. Every party fine-tuning its manifesto and candidate list to gauge how various caste communities will vote. Chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) has fielded the most candidates from OBC, EBC, and SC communities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124767119,imgsize-795070,width-400,resizemode-4/bihar-polls.jpg"
Court junks ‘frivolous’ Ayodhya verdict plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-junks-frivolous-ayodhya-verdict-plea/articleshow/124772227.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed lawyer Mehmood Pracha’s plea seeking to declare Supreme Court ’s 2019 Ayodhya judgment “null and void”, calling it a “frivolous and luxurious” attempt to misuse the legal system. District judge Dharmender Rana not only upheld a Rs 1 lakh penalty imposed by a civil court but also added Rs 5 lakh more to “deter” similar cases.Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict had unanimously awarded the disputed site to the deity Ram Lalla Virajman for temple construction, while granting Muslims a separate five-acre plot in Ayodhya to build a mosque.Pracha had filed the suit after alleging that former CJI DY Chandrachud publicly said in Pune that the Ayodhya judgment reflected a “solution provided by Bhagwan Shri Ram Lala Virajman”. He said this amounted to fraud and sought a fresh adjudication of the case.Judge Rana rejected the claim outright, observing that “seeking guidance from the almighty cannot be berated as a fraudulent act to gain unfair advantage, either in law or in any religion”. Quoting Hindu and Islamic scriptures, he said “Aham Brahma Asmi” embodies unity with the divine, and even the Quran allows devotees to seek guidance from Allah.Calling Pracha’s petition an “abuse of the process of law”, the judge said the lawyer’s insistence on impleading the former CJI “soon after his retirement” revealed an “oblique intent”. He said Pracha had challenged the verdict “without even bothering to go through it” and had no standing since he was not a party to the Ayodhya case.“The already overburdened dockets of the court cannot afford the menace of luxurious and frivolous litigation,” Judge Rana said. He warned of a growing trend where “unscrupulous litigants” target public officials after they leave office, adding that courts must ensure a “peaceful and pleasant evening” to those who served the nation. “The situation becomes distressful when the protector himself turns predator,” the judge remarked. “In this case, the appellant, despite being a fairly senior counsel, has opted to choose the wrong colour of jersey. Instead of participating in the solution, he has opted to augment the problem.”Judge Rana said both courts and the legal fraternity must act as sentinels to “sieve out impurities at the entry gates themselves”, underscoring the need to “deal with such litigation with an iron hand”.",A Delhi court has dismissed lawyer Mehmood Pracha’s plea seeking to declare Supreme Court ’s 2019 Ayodhya judgment “null and void” Judge Dharmender Rana called it a “frivolous and luxurious’ attempt to misuse the legal system.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124772225,imgsize-744366,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

PM Modi Confirmed to Give ASEAN Summit a Miss, Avoids Trump Again: Here’s The Real Reason Why

Poll Do you think PM Modi's decision was influenced by his relationship with President Trump? Yes, he wanted to avoid confrontation. No, his decision is unrelated to Trump.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Thursday that he will not be attending the 47th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur in person, and will instead participate virtually, ruling out a possible meeting with US President Donald Trump In a post on X, PM Modi shared that he had a warm conversation with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, during which he extended his best wishes for the success of the upcoming summits.""Had a warm conversation with my dear friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia. Congratulated him on Malaysia’s ASEAN Chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming Summits. Look forward to joining the ASEAN-India Summit virtually, and to further deepening of the ASEAN-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,"" PM Modi stated on X.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, in a statement, emphasized the ongoing efforts to enhance the bilateral relationship between Malaysia and India. ""Last night, I received a phone call from a colleague of the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Narendra Modi, to discuss efforts to strengthen Malaysia-India bilateral relations to a more strategic and comprehensive level. India remains an important partner for Malaysia in the fields of trade and investment, in addition to close cooperation in the sectors of technology, education, and regional security,"" Anwar said.He also mentioned the upcoming 47th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, noting that PM Modi will attend virtually due to the Deepavali celebrations in India. ""I respect his decision and extended my greetings for a happy Deepavali to him and the entire people of India,"" Anwar added.Meanwhile, the Congress party suggested that PM Modi's decision was influenced by a desire to avoid confrontation with Trump. ""For days the speculation has been - will He or won't He? Will Mr. Modi go to Kuala Lumpur for the Summit or not?"" Congress leader Ramesh commented on X.""Now it appears certain that the PM will not go. It means the loss of so many opportunities to hug and get photo ops with world leaders or to flaunt himself as the self-styled Vishwaguru,"" Ramesh added.""The reason why Mr. Modi is not going is simple. He just doesn't want to be cornered by President Trump who will also be there. He refused an invitation to attend the Gaza peace summit in Egypt a few weeks back, precisely for this reason,"" Ramesh claimed.The India-US relationship has been under scrutiny due to trade differences and Trump's overtures to Pakistan, which have caused unease in India. Despite this, India maintains that the ceasefire following Operation Sindoor in May was directly negotiated between the two militaries.The leaders of the Southeast Asian grouping will meet in the Malaysian capital from October 26 to October 28, with participation from all 10 members of the bloc and key trading partners such as China, Japan, and the US.","PM Modi will not be attending the 47th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur in person, and will instead participate virtually.

It is a process; you can't just stop it. But by the end of the year, they will be down to almost nothing. That's a big thing, that is almost 40 per cent of the oil. India has been great. Spoke to Prime Minister Modi yesterday and they have been absolutely great,"" Trump said during an interaction with reporters at the White House while hosting Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.The statement came after the US sanctioned two major Russian oil companies demanding an immediate ceasefire from Moscow.India, however, has consistently denied any such agreement, stressing that its energy policy prioritises stable prices and secure supplies for consumers.The comments also follow Trump’s earlier imposition of 50% tariffs on Indian goods and his calls for New Delhi to diversify its energy sources, criticising the country’s ongoing purchase of Russian oil.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor hit back at US President's repeated claims that India will sharply cut Russian oil imports by year-end.

DNA samples from the parents of the two babies — a boy and a girl born on Oct 21 — were sent to the forensic science laboratory in Jaipur Thursday to resolve the issue.The dispute arose from two deliveries made 43 minutes apart in the same operation theatre on Oct 21, where Anita Rawat from Udaipur and Rameshwari Soni from Chittorgarh gave birth to a boy and a girl.One of the families alleged that the hospital initially handed them a newborn boy and took the child back an hour later, claiming it had given them the wrong infant, and the baby born to them was a girl. “We protested and filed a complaint at Hathi Pole PS.

Until then, we will stay here with the baby girl in the hospital ward,” said Sunil, adding that if the DNA report revealed the baby boy was theirs, it would be a difficult situation for the family as they have been feeding the baby girl.","The dispute arose from two deliveries made 43 minutes apart in the same operation theatre on Oct 21.

One of the criteria in the alternative system would be that students must qualify for the JEE Advanced exam, either on the common rank list or category-wise list.“The Senate, in principle, approved that from the next academic session, we will be admitting students through alternate routes without disturbing the primary channel of admission through JEE Advanced. The institute is exploring different possibilities — like Sports Excellence Admission (SEA) and Science Olympiad Excellence Admissions (SCOPE) — as a benchmark of acceptance. But the final modalities are yet to be finalised,” said director Suman Chakraborty. “One of the criteria will be that students must qualify for the JEE Advanced exam, but their ranks should not be a deciding factor,” he added.Chakraborty felt the main purpose of the initiative was to make the admission process inclusive and attract a diverse range of students.Several IITs — like IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Gandhinagar, and IIT Indore — offer admission through Olympiad and sports excellence pathways in addition to the standard JEE route.“A committee will be formed with representatives from each department to fix the modalities and oversee the implementation of this pathway of admission.

Getting an opportunity to attend the training camp of an Olympiad is itself an impressive achievement and reflects on the academic preparation of the students.

Opposition gathbandhan an unruly alliance of netas out on bail: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-gathbandhan-an-unruly-alliance-of-netas-out-on-bail-pm-modi/articleshow/124771949.cms,"PATNA/NEW DELHI: Hours after the Mahagathbandhan named Tejashwi Yadav as its CM face, PM Modi on Thursday raised the pitch of ‘jungle raj’, saying people will not forget the 15-year RJD govt for 100 years and never allow its return, however hard the opposition alliance may try.‘Jungle raj’ was the constant theme in his interaction with five youths associated with BJP as he slammed the opposition’s gathbandhan as “lathbandhan” (unruly alliance), in what was seen as allusion to the lawlessness that characterised RJD’s 15 years in office under Tejashwi’s parents, Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, and the aggression that many associate with RJD. Its one specialty is that its netas, whether from Patna or Delhi — a reference to the RJD and Congress brass — are on out bail in corruption cases, he further said, in what was a dig at the legal troubles of both Tejashwi and Rahul Gandhi. The virtual interaction, Modi’s second, conducted as part of BJP’s “Mera Booth Sabse Mazboot” programme, was scheduled the morning ahead of the joint press conference of opposition politicians, amid indications they may name former deputy CM Tejashwi as their choice for CM.Modi will kick off his Bihar campaign on Friday with a visit to the late Karpoori Thakur’s village in Samastipur district. Thakur, a socialist neta, was a messiah of EBCs, and the NDA govt had conferred on him the Bharat Ratna last year.Lauding CM Nitish Kumar-headed NDA govt for bringing the state out of the darkness of RJD’s alleged ‘jungle raj’ and ushering in the light of development, he said the assembly polls will write a new chapter of state’s prosperity. “Now jan vishwas (people’s trust) and not ‘jungle raj reigns in the state.”A thief finds it difficult to steal in light, so he sneaks in with a lantern, Modi said, in reference to RJD’s poll symbol and the power shortages the state used to suffer under its govt. “People are not going to forget jungle raj for the next 100 years,” he said, asking BJP’s young members to invite older voters, who lived under RJD govt during 1990-2005, to share their experiences with others. Future of young generations was destroyed in that period, Modi said. “Bihar is waiting with renewed expectation for NDA govt to return to office with a bigger majority.” The state’s young population is saying that “raftaar pakar chuka Bihar, phir se NDA sarkar”.Reaching out to women, Modi said they were confined to their homes during the RJD’s long stint in office. But under the present govt’s self-employment scheme, Rs 10,000 each had been given to over 1.21 crore women and those left out will be included after Nov 14, the day of poll result, when a new era of women empowerment will begin, he added.The PM said stable govts in Bihar and the Centre have ensured implementation of development work in the state and stressed that all-round infra projects and a host of development schemes have led to the emergence of new opportunities for the youth. With Tejashwi making a string of populist announcements, including a govt job for every household, Modi asked voters not to fall for the false promises and said Bihar will be developed as a tech hub in the years ahead. “The coming years are of unprecedented opportunities for youngsters. They won’t have to leave Bihar (for jobs),” he said. “Development not fear, progress not migration are part of conversations in Bihar now.”Saying that Naxalism had wreaked havoc in Bihar, Modi suggested that RJD had received help from Maoists.",PM Modi says people will not forget the 15-year RJD govt for 100 years. ‘Jungle raj’ was the constant theme in his interaction with five youths associated with BJP.

MEERUT: Roshni (name changed) was 15 when her life was ruined by a man who threw acid on her for breaking off their engagement. She lost an eye and her face was disfigured. It was 1997. What followed were years of pain and trauma, along with a series of corrective surgeries amid huge financial distress. Now, after 28 years of wait, Roshni, 43, received Rs 5 lakh in “compensation” — Rs 1 lakh from PM’s National Relief Fund and Rs 4 lakh from UP govt, reports Sandeep Rai.“That the interim compensation was released after 28 years shows the fragile state of affairs. Her monthly expenses on medicines and psychological therapy is close to Rs 10,000...” said Shaheen Malik, herself an acid attack survivor who had been fighting Roshni’s case since last year. She plans to move HC to seek “adequate compensation”.On Oct 28, 1997, Roshni was attacked at her Shahjahanpur home. She suffered extensive burns to her face, head and neck, resulting in almost 45% permanent physical disability. Thereafter, costly medicines and surgeries took a heavy financial toll on her family.“My father was a tailor and mother a housewife. My family was totally shattered; I was bedridden for two years. They exhausted all their savings and had to depend on community donations for my treatment. .. The surgeries cost over Rs 10 lakh,” Roshni said.Her trauma wasn’t just about the scars, anxiety and depression. In the next few years, she lost her parents, while her siblings moved on with their lives, leaving her all by herself.“My father passed away a few years later and my mother had to do odd jobs to keep me alive. The cost of medicines was enormous. Sadly, my mother died about eight years ago. I’m currently jobless and my frailty refuses to go away,” added Roshni, who also did odd jobs at various houses and later resorted to work on sarees, largely patchwork, from home.It was only last year that she found active support from Malik’s Delhi-based NGO Brave Souls Foundation. “Unfortunately, back in the 90s, the survivor’s family had little awareness about compensation. The prolonged delay in granting financial support reflects authorities’ lack of responsibility and accountability. Despite having knowledge of the gruesome attack, they left the victim unaware of available schemes and procedures,” Malik said. Roshni currently stays at a women’s shelter run by the NGO.“After 28 years of spending lakhs on her treatment, she got Rs 5 lakh. We are in the process of filing a suit to get her at least Rs 50 lakh,” Malik said.

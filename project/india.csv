SIR row: Amartya Sen raises concern over revision; claims it risks 'disenfranchising' poor people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sir-row-amartya-sen-raises-concern-over-revision-claims-it-risks-disenfranchising-poor-people/articleshow/123465728.cms,"Amartya Sen

NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raised concerns over the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, cautioning that without sensitivity, the exercise could “disenfranchise” large sections of the poor and marginalised.He questioned the fairness of a bureaucratic process that requires strict documentation from citizens who may not have easy access to such papers.While acknowledging the need for administrative checks and periodic revisions, Sen stressed these must not come at the expense of fundamental rights.""Yes, it's true that from time to time various procedural tasks need to be carried out. However, in doing so, one cannot create a 'better system' by trampling on the rights of the poor,"" Sen told news agency PTI.He emphasised the importance of a just and inclusive approach, pointing out that many individuals still lack proper documentation and, as a result, are often excluded from the electoral process.""Many people don't have documents. Many cannot vote. If, in the name of trying to improve things a little, harm is caused to many, then that becomes a serious mistake,"" Sen said, adding, ""You cannot justify seven new mistakes just to correct one"".Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Friday expressed surprise at the lack of political parties' involvement in correcting names of voters deleted during the SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar.The top court also said that claim forms can be submitted along with Aadhaar card or any other 11 acceptable documents.""We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR,"" the bench said, as quoted by PTI.""All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters,"" the bench added. The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8.During the hearing, the Election Commission informed the court that while 85,000 new voters had been added in the ongoing revision, only two objections had been filed by booth-level agents of political parties. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR exercise.The petitions were filed by RJD MP Manoj Jha, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), PUCL, activist Yogendra Yadav, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and former Bihar MLA Mujahid Alam.The petitioners have sought to quash the ECI’s June 24 directive, which requires large numbers of voters in Bihar to submit proof of citizenship to stay on the rolls.",Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raises concerns over the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar.

Who is Sergio Gor? Trump nominates close aide as US Ambassador to India; replaces Eric Garcetti,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-is-sergio-gor-trump-nominates-close-aide-as-us-ambassador-to-india-replaces-eric-garcetti/articleshow/123464829.cms,"Picture source: X/ Sergio Gor

Who is Sergio Gor?

Gor was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, when it was part of the Soviet Union. His family moved to the US in 1999 when he was about 12. His father, Yuri Gorokhovsky , was an aviation engineer involved in designing Soviet aircraft including the IL-76, used by the Indian Air Force. His mother is said to be of Israeli origin.

Active in young conservative circles, he worked as spokesman for Republican lawmakers Steve King and Michele Bachmann, both known for their far-right views. Gor later became deputy chief of staff to senator Rand Paul.

and Michele Bachmann, both known for their far-right views. Gor later became deputy chief of staff to senator Rand Paul. Gor joined Trump’s orbit during the 2020 elections, rose quickly in the MAGA movement, and was appointed director of presidential personnel after Trump’s 2024 victory. Trump credits him with placing nearly 4,000 loyalists in government roles.

Gor is known for his loyalty to Trump but has also been criticised by others as unpredictable in his decisions. He clashed with Elon Musk, Trump’s billionaire adviser.

He also played a role in derailing Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead Nasa after pointing out Isaacman’s past donations to Democrats.

US president Donald Trump has nominated Sergio Gor as the next American ambassador to India. If confirmed by the Senate, Gor will also serve as special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs, a region that includes Pakistan and Bangladesh where the US currently has no ambassadors.Trump announced the move on social media, calling Gor a “great friend” and someone he could fully trust to deliver on his agenda. “For the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible ambassador,” Trump wrote.Gor will replace Eric Garcetti, a Democratic appointee, who returned to California after the end of the Biden presidency.","Sergio Gor was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, when it was part of the Soviet Union.

The quiet strength of accepting a mistake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-quiet-strength-of-accepting-a-mistake/articleshow/123456325.cms,"AI-generated audio summary; not verified by the edit team.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. The Chairman of L&T’s casual comment, “How long can you stare at your wife?” in connection with working on Sundays was recorded—without permission— and circulated online, which soon exploded into a nationwide debate on productivity and work-life balance. The backlash was swift and merciless. I had quoted a verse from the Thirukkural on love, which reminds us that for those truly bound together, even a lifetime is not enough to gaze at one another. Months later, I came across an interview given by the same chairman, where he reflected with humility: “In hindsight, I could have answered differently. But what happened, happened and I cannot withdraw it now. If the same question comes again, I would answer differently now.” In a digital age where a single phrase can erase decades of hard work, this acceptance was refreshing. Cancel culture has become a defining feature of our times. A sentence pulled out of context or a misplaced gesture can ignite fury and can define a person’s entire being. You wake up in the morning with a faint hope that the storm has passed, only to feel your heart sink when notifications pour in: outrage, ridicule, anger. You scroll through, and it feels as if the entire world is pointing fingers at you. Colleagues avert their eyes. Friends grow silent. Even familiar spaces feel strange. The house you return to is the same, yet somehow it feels emptier, because the noise outside has entered your heart. And yet, this is where dignity must be preserved—not by denial or defiance, but by quiet acceptance. To whisper, “yes, I stumbled” and stand up again is courage in its purest form. It is the kind of courage that cleanses, the kind that turns defeat into resurgence. Very recently, there was a contentious statement made about Kamaraj. Here was a man of unimpeachable integrity, the very embodiment of selflessness in public life. He gave up power, lived without wealth or privilege, and left behind nothing but his honesty. And yet, he too faced defeat—not at the hands of a giant, but a little-known newcomer in an election. For a leader of his stature, it was not just loss, but heartbreak. Cho Ramaswamy, in his book I Met Kamaraj, recalls a poignant meeting with the leader soon after. Kamaraj lay quietly in his bed in his humble home. When asked how his followers could be expected to stand by him after such an electoral set-back, he replied with dignity: “I have fallen in a manner that I cannot fall any lower. I can only get up. If true followers still wait at my gate in this hour of defeat, why would they leave when I rise again?” Defeat had not diminished him; it had only deepened his greatness. The true test of courage is not in how one wins, but in how one handles defeat. To reflect, to recognize one’s fault, to apologize when needed—and then, to rise again. Thiruvalluvar called this the acid test of greatness: Saalbirkku Kattalai Yaadhenil Tholvi Thulayallaar Kannum Kolal. “What is perfection’s test? To accept defeat Even at the hands of those less worthy.” The world often glorifies victory, putting it on pedestals and writing songs in its name. But the truest measure of character is revealed when defeat comes from someone far less in stature or merit. To bear such a fall without anger, to bow to the outcome without bitterness, and to rise again without scorn — that is dignity in its highest form.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123456304,imgsize-46214,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/123456304.jpg"

That was 11 years before Trump's tariff vendetta and six years before realisation of the need for diversification of supply chains.He consistently stressed the need to become self-reliant in every field with the announcement of govt's focus on ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' after Covid-19 pandemic, reducing sourcing of products from other nations & putting more thrust on 'Vocal for Local'.In his latest address, the PM emphasised the need to reach new heights in manufacturing by adopting the ""daam kam, dum jyada"" mantra.The first speech saw Modi identifying himself as an ""outsider in Delhi"" who was not part of the ""elite"", and announcing schemes such as Jan Dhan Yojna, Make in India , Skill India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat and transformation of the erstwhile Planning Commission which, among other things, will define his legacy.The 2016 speech saw Modi celebrating the progress of his signature achievements: construction of toilets, bringing large numbers of the poor to the banking net. He followed that up next year by focusing on his theme of New India - a secure, prosperous and strong nation, and expeditious completion of works, since the poor suffer the most because of delays.Two years later, he spoke about how international experts used to refer to the Indian economy as being ""risky"" prior to 2014.Since 2020, the PM's I-Day speeches have focused on national unity and a long-term vision of building a strong nation. While in his 2020 address, the PM spoke about ""Make in India, Make for the World"" as a strategy, the address in 2021 focused on a roadmap for 'Viksit Bharat by 2047'.The PM's address in 2022, marking 75 years of Independence, introduced Panch Pran (five vows), urging citizens to commit to unity, development, and the removal of colonial mindsets.By 2024, the PM's speech had a strong reformist thrust.

This annual state-level entrance test is a gateway for admission to undergraduate engineering, pharmacy, and architecture courses in West Bengal. Thousands of students who appeared for the exam across the state have been eagerly awaiting their results.The delay in declaration, originally scheduled for early August, was due to court directives regarding OBC reservation in the merit list.

""The aggressive sterilisation would definitely put a curb on the rapid growth of the stray dog population, ultimately leading to its reduction. However, this is possible only in an idealistic situation, which seems unlikely in the present scenario,"" the court said.

The court said, ""It was argued by some of the counsels appearing for the animal lovers that the process of sterilisation and inoculation has worked wonders in many towns across the country and has significantly brought down the population of stray dogs. To be specific, it was pointed out that towns like Dehradun and Lucknow, which have taken aggressive measures for sterilisation, etc., as per the ABC Rules, have seen a steady decline in the population of stray dogs. A suggestion has also been received that chemical castration is a safe, painless, and effective mode of sterilisation.""

""A blanket direction to pick up all the strays and place them in dog shelters/pounds without evaluating the existing infrastructure may lead to a catch-22 situation because such directions may be impossible to comply with. We, therefore, feel that a holistic approach requires mollification of the directions issued vide order dated 11th August, 2025,"" the court said.

Municipal authorities must continue complying with previous directions, but the bar on releasing picked-up strays has been kept in abeyance. Stray dogs are to be sterilised, dewormed, vaccinated, and then released in the same area, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behaviour. Such dogs must be kept in shelters after treatment.





Each municipal ward must establish designated feeding zones for stray dogs. Feeding on streets is prohibited, with violators facing legal action. Helplines are to be set up for reporting violations.





No individual or organisation may obstruct officials implementing these directions; obstruction will invite prosecution.





NGOs involved in the case must deposit Rs 2 lakh each, while individual dog lovers must deposit Rs 25,000 each, within seven days. These funds will be used for stray-dog infrastructure.





Citizens may formally adopt stray dogs through municipal bodies, ensuring adopted dogs do not return to the streets.





Municipalities must file compliance affidavits, detailing available facilities such as dog pounds, vets, capture staff, and vehicles.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday reversed the August 11 order on the relocation of stray dogs in Delhi-NCR, saying that the animals that are not rabid or aggressive will not be shifted to shelters but instead sterilised, immunised, and released back to their original locations.The court said that the ""direction given in the order dated 11th August, 2025, prohibiting the release of the treated and vaccinated dogs seems to be too harsh.""It referenced Rule 11(9) of the ABC Rules, which mandates that once stray dogs have been sterilised, inoculated, and dewormed, they must be released back into the same locality from which they were picked up.A three-judge bench comprising Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Sandeep Mehta, and Justice NV Anjaria clarified that stray dogs must be released to their original areas after sterilisation, deworming, and immunisation, except for those infected with rabies, suspected of rabies infection, or exhibiting aggressive behaviour.Here are top quotes:The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the establishment of dedicated feeding spaces. The Bench reiterated the August 11 order that no individual or organisation should obstruct municipal authorities from picking up dogs in accordance with the ABC Rules.The scope of the matter was extended beyond Delhi-NCR to a pan-India level, involving all States and Union Territories, Secretaries of Animal Husbandry departments, Secretaries of local bodies, and Municipal corporations for compliance with ABC Rules. The court also stated that it would transfer similar petitions pending in high courts to itself to formulate a national policy on the issue.The Supreme Court has supplemented and modified earlier directions on stray dog management, laying down fresh guidelines for municipal bodies:","The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the establishment of dedicated feeding spaces. Stray dogs are to be sterilised, dewormed, vaccinated, and then released in the same area, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behaviour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123452612,imgsize-1718985,width-400,resizemode-4/123452612.jpg"

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, as reported by ANI.The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20) The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,imgsize-58496,width-400,resizemode-4/123458210.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Isro unveiled a model of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) module, on the occassion of the national Space Day celebrations held at Bharat Mandapam on Friday.The BAS, which will be India’s first home-built space station, is set to have its first module launched by 2028. This will place India among a select group of countries operating orbital laboratories.At present, there are only two such stations in service, the International Space Station, run jointly by five space agencies, and China’s Tiangong space station.Under its long-term plan, India aims to assemble five modules of the BAS by 2035 as part of its ambitious space programme, PTI reported.The first unit, BAS-01, is expected to weigh 10 tonnes and will orbit at an altitude of 450 km above Earth. Standing 3.8 metres in diameter and 8 metres in length, the model of BAS-01 was the star attraction at the National Space Day event.The BAS will come with several key features. These include an indigenously developed Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), a Bharat Docking System, Bharat Berthing Mechanism, automated hatch systems, platforms for microgravity research and technology demonstration, as well as viewports designed for scientific imaging and crew recreation.It will also provide refuelling capabilities for propulsion and ECLSS fluids, alongside radiation, thermal and Micro Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) protection. Other features include space suits, airlocks to support extra-vehicular activities, and plug-and-play integrated avionics.The BAS will serve as a research platform for studying space, life sciences, medicine and interplanetary exploration. It will enable scientists to observe the effects of microgravity on human health while testing technologies vital for long-term human presence in space.The station will also open doors to space tourism, with India planning to tap into the commercial space sector by leveraging the resources of its orbital lab.In addition to fostering international collaboration, the BAS is expected to inspire future generations to take up careers in space science and technology.India’s space sector is stepping into a new era of growth and innovation, with reforms giving private players a greater role while freeing Isro to push the boundaries of advanced research and deep space exploration, senior government official P K Mishra said on Friday.Mishra, who is the principal secretary to the prime minister, highlighted how the government’s reforms have changed the outlook for the industry.""Space sector reforms have made the future of the sector scalable, innovative and resilient,"" he said.He explained that technology transfers from Isro, creation of a venture capital fund and a technology adoption fund are driving transformation in the sector.""Isro is now free to focus on frontier technologies and deep space, much of the application will be done by the private sector which is developing,"" Mishra said.Highlighting the need to integrate cutting-edge tools into space missions, he urged scientists to embrace artificial intelligence, quantum computing and big data analytics for future satellites and ground systems.Mishra also called for deeper international cooperation, pointing to recent collaborations such as the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite launch and the proposed G-20 climate satellite.""India should be seen as a hub of affordable, inclusive and innovative space solutions for the world,"" he said, as cited by PTI.He concluded by stressing that the country’s space journey is not only about science and technology but also about national progress. India’s space efforts, he said, are aimed at empowering citizens, reducing inequalities, and building a confident, self-reliant nation.","Isro unveiled a model of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) module on Friday.

It comprised largely tribal youth armed with basic training and firearms.The militia was later disbanded. His ruling, rooted in the protection of fundamental rights, underscored that state-sponsored vigilantism could not replace constitutional policing.

We have given approvals to many companies... wherever we find that the industry, technology or supply in question aligns with vision of India, we have been regularly giving approvals. Same process will continue. When times change, situations change, decisions can be made to suit the times,"" he said, while responding to a question on a possible review of norms after the recent easing of visa and flight curbs with China.He, however, insisted that the shift should not be linked to recent tensions with the US.The minister also said the govt is looking to create more domestic demand for sectors hit by US tariffs, including through GST cuts in labour-intensive industries such as food processing and textiles.Asked about relief for exporters impacted by US tariffs, Goyal said he had spoken to some players to pick up stock, while ministries were working on arrangements to boost trade.Stressing that US remained an important partner, he said: ""Among many works in hand, it is one issue that we're addressing with an open mind, positive outlook and the confidence that India-US relationship is very consequential, very important for both countries. I have been engaged with industry in India, I have been engaged with companies from US working in India. Everybody believes that it is an important relationship."" He added that businesses were also exploring alternatives and had supported the govt's stand.Goyal further pointed to several trade agreements that have been concluded, noting that like Australia, UK and EFTA nations, European Union too had recognised India's sensitivities in certain sectors. He said there had been good progress on proposed free trade agreement with the EU, while assuring that India's interests would always be safeguarded.""Geopolitical considerations, or wanting to look good, will never drive India's trade decisions. Trade will stand on its own legs, geopolitics stands on its own legs, we don't hyphenate the two. Our effort is to build good relations across the world; we are multilateral in every dimension. But when it comes to opening India's market and expanding India's trade, our stakeholders, their views and their best interests are paramount,"" he stressed."," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said a review of checks on Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) can be considered if the situation so demands.

NEW DELHI: Jammu & Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Friday sacked two more govt employees over terror links after an investigation revealed how they had been helping Pakistani terrorists infiltrate via the LoC in Kupwara and also transporting arms, ammunition and narcotics sent by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba handlers, to terrorists based in J&K.Both the employees - Khurshid Ahmad Rather, a teacher in Karnah, Kupwara and Siyad Ahmed Khan, assistant stockman in J&K sheep husbandry - dismissed under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution - were arrested earlier in separate terror cases and are currently lodged in the Kupwara jail.""Incriminating evidence collected against Khurshid and Siyad during a painstaking investigation by the law enforcement and intelligence agencies, clearly established that they were working for banned terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba, while drawing salaries from J&K govt,"" a govt source told TOI. Around 77 govt employees have been sacked by the J&K LG so far under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution, underlining a zero tolerance approach for both terrorism and the terror eco-system active in the UT.As per the secret dossier on Khurshid, he was appointed as a teacher in 2003 but was working as an overground worker for LeT. He was tasked by LeT handlers to procure arms, ammunition and narcotics for further distribution among active terrorists operating in the valley.Khurshid was in touch with Pakistan-based terrorists Manzoor Ahmed Sheikh alias Shakoor and Javid Ahmed. The investigators found Khurshid had received several consignments containing weapons and narcotics sent across the LoC into Karnah, Kupwara.""Khurshid's role was exposed after the law enforcement agencies received an input on Jan 25, 2024 that two Pakistani terrorists were involved in smuggling of arms with the help of four associates in Kupwara - Khurshid himself, Zahoor Ahmed, Ghulam Sarwar and Qazi Fazal.An FIR was registered and Zahoor Ahmed picked for interrogation. Zahoor spilled the beans on his network and his associates, leading to the arrest of Khurshid and his aides. Sustained interrogation of Khurshid and his associates led to the recovery of a huge cache of arms and ammunition. Siyad was appointed as an assistant stockman in the sheep husbandry department in 2004. He started working for LeT and was tasked to receive infiltrating groups of terrorists, shelter them and transport their arms and ammunition.According to investigators, Siyad also started smuggling narcotics to sustain terror activities. ""He was intercepted and arrested on Jan 12, 2024 at Peer Baba Shrine, Keran, Kupwara... An AK-47 was recovered from his possession,"" a J&K police source told TOI.

Gujarat's pride to remain MP's envy? Plan to bring lions to Kuno likely shelved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarats-pride-to-remain-mps-envy-plan-to-bring-lions-to-kuno-likely-shelved/articleshow/123462376.cms,"Rumble in the jungle

A three-decade wait

Cheetahs take centre stage

BHOPAL: Has the curtain finally and quietly come down on a three-decade saga - the elusive plan to bring Asiatic lions from Gujarat's Gir sanctuary to Kuno in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh? Likely. Lions may sit at the top of the food chain, but the rumble in the jungle suggests cheetahs have outmanoeuvred them in the Kuno conservation stakes.A July 30 forest department notification announcing renaming of the 'Lion Project' in MP's Kuno National Park to 'Cheetah Project', and redesignation of its director to ""field director, Cheetah Project, Shivpuri"", has led many to suspect that Asiatic lions won't roar in what was supposed to be their second home in India after Gir.However, while Kuno effectively becomes the preserve of the ambitious cheetah reintroduction programme launched by PM Narendra Modi in 2022, official word on it is that the Lion Project hasn't been scrapped.""This is procedural restructuring. No post has been abolished. Positions have been renamed for better conservation targeting,"" additional chief secretary (forest) Ashok Barnwal told TOI.Another senior official who didn't want to be named said this had been done to ""ease international communication"" since Kuno was now globally identified with Project Cheetah.The idea of creating a home for the Asiatic lion beyond Gujarat dates back to the 1980s, when wildlife scientists warned that Gir alone couldn't safeguard the species. Field studies by the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India over a decade had identified Kuno as the most suitable site for relocation of lions.The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project was then formally launched after the Supreme Court directed Gujarat in April 2013 to give away some Gir lions. The court specifically asked the Centre to establish Kuno as the endangered Asiatic lion's other home in India.Successive state govts in Gujarat refused to allow lions to be relocated from Gir, insisting that they were safe in their original habitat and alleging that Kuno's topography wasn't conducive to their survival. Officials in Gujarat described Gir lions as the state's ""pride"" and filed review and curative petitions, both of which were dismissed by the apex court.The reluctance, couched in ecological concerns, was widely seen as a mix of politics and prestige. The Centre maintained a stoic silence, and the project remained trapped in a maze of bureaucratic files, expert committee recommendations, and reports of periodic field visits.Since the first batch of African cheetahs landed in Kuno from Namibia and South Africa in Sept 2022, the only mention of the pending plan to relocate lions to Gir was in a state govt audit last year.""Cheetahs were not part of the Kuno management plan,"" states the audit report, also flagging alleged violations and incomplete documentation of Project Cheetah expenditure.According to the official management plan for the period 2020-21 to 2029-30, Kuno was to be designated a secondary habitat for Asiatic lions. ""No efforts had been made towards reintroduction of lions, as of Nov 2023,"" the audit report says.The audit also talks about missing reports from a three-member team appointed by SC on Jan 28, 2020. The team was required to submit four-monthly surveys and recommendations on sites for African cheetahs.""These reports were not found in the forest division's records, preventing verification of the facts presented to the Supreme Court,"" the report states.",The idea of creating a home for the Asiatic lion beyond Gujarat dates back to the 1980s.

""Opposition parties question the need for the bill. Then DMK ministers K Ponmudi and V Senthil Balaji remained in jail for eight months each but did not resign. Tell me, can a govt be run from jail?""

Intermittent fasting may come with risks: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intermittent-fasting-may-come-with-risks-study/articleshow/123462333.cms,"Getty images

New Delhi: Intermittent fasting may help shed some extra kilos in the short term, but such regimens may not be without their risks, a new study, published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews, has suggested.Intermittent fasting involves limiting the hours for eating to a specific number of hours each day, which may range from a 4- to 12-hour time window in 24 hours.In the study, researchers who analysed long-term health outcomes for close to 19,000 US nationals with varying daily eating durations found that participants who ate for less than eight hours per day had a 135% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (death due to heart and blood vessel diseases) compared to those with a typical 12-14-hour eating period.Further research is required to understand whether the risk of cardiovascular mortality is attributable to the short eating duration itself or residual confounding resulting from its contributing factors, the study says.Dr Anoop Misra, chairman Fortis C-doc and the editorial head of Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews journal, said people who follow intermittent fasting tend to eat whatever they want in the non-fasting period, including junk food.""Some studies have shown increased low-density cholesterol (LDL) in such cases is a known risk factor for cardiovascular mortality,"" he said.The enthusiasm for intermittent fasting must be tempered with careful risk assessment. ""Until more long-term data are available, especially on hard outcomes like cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attacks), intermittent fasting should be individualised and ideally supervised, particularly for people with pre-existing health conditions, and applied for short term only,"" the doctor said.Nutritionists say extreme dieting can lead to long-term nutritional deficiencies, including proteins, vitamins, minerals & electrolytes. ""In some cases, sudden death due to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and chronic inflammation are also possible. Magnesium deficiency can lead to serious cardiac events,"" Dr Ishi Khosla, a clinical nutritionist, said.","Intermittent fasting involves limiting the hours for eating to a specific number of hours each day.

KOLKATA: In another life, Sunali Khatun could have been a version of Manto's Toba Tek Singh, a man with no country to call his own. Pushed into Bangladesh by police in India who labelled her an illegal immigrant, police in Bangladesh have now done the same thing to her - called her an illegal immigrant and jailed her. She is eight months pregnant.Birbhum resident Sunali, expecting a child any time now, was escorted into a Bangladesh jail on Friday not knowing to which country her unborn baby would belong.The 26-year-old's Aadhaar and voter identity card hadn't saved her from being branded an ""illegal immigrant"" in Delhi, where she was working until recently. On Thursday, cops in Chapai Nawabganj arrested her based on those very identity documents.Sunali, her ragpicker husband Danish Sheikh and the couple's toddler son Sabir are now among six ""nowhere people"" with roots in West Bengal but disowned by their country and incarcerated in Bangladesh. The others are Sweety Biwi and her sons Qurban Sheikh (16) and Imam Dewan (6).The befuddled bunch had been living and working in Delhi's Rohini - earning just enough to keep afloat - when they were arrested during an ""identity verification drive"" and sent to Bangladesh through Assam on June 26.""The group of six was arrested after they were found loitering in Chapai Nawabganj. They told us they were Indians who entered Bangladesh through the Kurigram border (in Assam), roamed the streets of Dhaka for some days, and then reached here. They didn't have a lawyer during Friday's court hearing,"" Chapai Nawabganj police superintendent Md Rezaul Karim told TOI on Friday.Unless someone takes up cudgels for them, Sunali, her family and the rest of the group will remain in prison till the next hearing scheduled in September. Karim said all six had been charged under the Control of Entry Act, 1952.Sunali's father Bhodu Sk, who has filed a habeas corpus in Calcutta high court, said it was shocking to even think that his heavily pregnant daughter might give birth in jail. ""We are poor. We have moved the high court, what else can be done?"" he said.Arif Sk, a neighbour of the family in Bengal's Birbhum, said everyone has pooled in to try and arrange a lawyer in Bangladesh to bail out the group from their village.Bhodu and co-petitioner Amir Khan, who is Sweety Khatun's cousin, said in their petition that what happened was a ""betrayal of law"". The high court is scheduled to hear the case on Sept 10.A PIL has been filed in Supreme Court on the alleged harassment of Bengali-speaking migrants in India, including Sunali's ""illegal deportation"". The PIL has been listed for hearing on Aug 29.Bengal migrant welfare board chairperson and Rajya Sabha MP Samirul Islam said, ""We are making every effort to bring back Sunali and the others. We are also providing the family legal help.""Meanwhile, on Aug 13, 22-year-old Malda migrant labourer Amir Sheikh, who was pushed into Bangladesh on June 25, returned to India, his reappearance as mysterious as his disappearance from the country of his birth. Amir had been stuck in Bangladesh since June 25, prompting his father - Jiyem Sheikh - to file a habeas corpus in the HC. He said Rajasthan Police had arrested him for being a ""Bangladeshi living in India illegally"".BSF told the court a couple of hours after Amir's return through the Basirhat border that he had crossed over to Bangladesh ""inadvertently"".","Sunali Khatun, 26, was arrested in Chapai Nawabganj, Bangladesh, on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel on fertiliser, in its report on disinvestment of fertiliser PSUs, has found the finance ministry's decision to classify the sector as “non-strategic” as “incongruent” with the government’s agenda to be self-reliance (Atma Nirbhar).The panel headed by Congress MP Kirti Azad in its report submitted to Parliament this week has mentioned that despite multiple submissions by the fertiliser department to the finance ministry to classify the sector as strategic considering its critical role in ensuring food security, sustaining rural livelihoods, and advancing national self-reliance, the latter did not accept this.The report mentioned that disinvestment department (DIPAM) turned down these requests, arguing that Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) contribute only 25% and 11% of the country’s urea and non-urea fertiliser production respectively; that many operate at a loss; and that their continued existence is inconsistent with fiscal prudence and the criteria for strategic classification, as approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) under the New PSE Policy.“The committee finds this reasoning incongruent with the govt’s Atmanirbhar Bharat agenda. Contrary to DIPAM’s claim, several fertiliser PSUs have shown remarkable turnaround, notably FACT, which has transitioned from a loss-making entity to a consistently profitable enterprise,” the report said. It also highlighted that the revival of closed units at Gorakhpur, Sindri, Barauni and Ramagundam through CPSE-led joint ventures, has added over 76.2 lakh tonnes to India’s annual urea production capacity.The panel said that this clearly demonstrates the strategic value of leveraging PSU assets to meet national goals. “In light of rising global fertiliser prices and India’s continued reliance on imports for over 90% of its potash and phosphate needs (procured under the Open General License), the sustained operation and strengthening of fertilizer PSUs is crucial not only for domestic production but also for price stabilisation, disaster resilience, and long term food sovereignty,” it said.Under the framework of the new public sector enterprise policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat in 2021, fertiliser sector was categorised as a non-strategic sector, making it eligible for privatisation or closure. But there has been no progress so far as disinvestments of seven PSUs manufacturing fertilisers is concerned.As per fertiliser department, in FY25, out of the total 38.8 million tonne (MT) of urea consumption, 5.6 MT was met through imports. In case of non-urea fertilisers such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and muriate of potash (MOP DAP), imports were 10.4 MT against the consumption of 21.1 MT.According to the committee, the country's dependency on import at present is to the extent of 25% of the requirement of urea, 90% in case of phosphates - as raw material or finished fertilizers and 100% in case of potash.It has recommended that there is a strong need to ensure that the existing fertiliser manufacturing units function profitably. It has also stressed on the need to revive the closed units so as to bridge the gap between the demand and availability of fertilisers in the country.","A parliamentary panel on fertiliser has found the finance ministry's decision to classify the sector as ‘non-strategic’ as “incongruent’ with the government’s agenda to be self-reliance (Atma Nirbhar) The panel headed by Congress MP Kirti Azad in its report submitted to Parliament this week has mentioned that despite multiple submissions by the fertiliser department, the ministry did not accept this.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123462296,imgsize-1303592,width-400,resizemode-4/123462296.jpg"
NHAI terminates contract of toll agency whose staff assaulted jawan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-terminates-contract-of-toll-agency-whose-staff-assaulted-jawan/articleshow/123462280.cms,"Photo/ANI

New Delhi: The NHAI has terminated the contract of the toll collection agency for Bhumi toll plaza in Meerut where an Army jawan was beaten up by its employees. The highways authority has also blacklisted the contractor and barred it from participating in future bids for one year.Earlier, the NHAI had slapped a Rs 20-lakh interim penalty on M/s Dharam Singh, the toll collecting agency for the Bhuni Toll Plaza on Meerut-Karnal section of NH-709A, a day after a verbal altercation between the army jawan and toll staff led to the former being assaulted. The authority had also issued it a show cause notice.In its reply, the firm admitted that at around 8 pm on Aug 17 a verbal altercation occurred between an army jawan and its toll staff, which “escalated into a physical confrontation”. It claimed, “This initial skirmish was not initiated by our staff, who were adhering to standard protocols for fee collection as per Clause 23(a) of the contract, which mandates efficient user fee collection without undue harassment.""The NHAI said that since the toll collecting agency had admitted to the incident and an FIR had been filed, it did not find the response satisfactory.Amid instances of such altercation between toll plaza employees and commuters, the NHAI is pushing for the rollout of Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF), which will eliminate the need for physical toll barriers.Earlier, the highways authority had issued a Standard Operating Procedure for toll operators and user fee collecting agencies, outlining the dos and don’ts.","The NHAI has terminated the contract of the toll collection agency for Bhumi toll plaza in Meerut.

Opposition afraid for its netas... we have seen files being signed from jail: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oppn-afraid-for-its-netas-we-have-seen-files-being-signed-from-jail-modi/articleshow/123462210.cms,"PM Modi

PATNA: In his first remarks on the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill proposing removal of PM, CMs and minister if they are jailed on serious charges, PM Narendra Modi said opposition parties, such as RJD and Congress, were against it as many of their politicians were either in jail or out on bail. ""They fear if they go to jail, all their dreams will be shattered,"" he said.""If a government employee is imprisoned for 50 hours, then he loses his job automatically, be it a driver, a clerk or a peon. But a CM, a minister, or even a PM, can enjoy staying in govt even from jail... Some time ago, we saw how files were being signed from jail and govt orders were given from jail,"" Modi said at a rally in Magadh University, Bodh Gaya.""If leaders have such an attitude, how can we fight corruption? Some of these RJD and Congress members are out on bail, while some are entangled in court cases related to scams. And those roaming free on bail are opposing this law today. They fear that if they go to jail, all their dreams will be shattered,” PM Narendra Modi said at a public rally at Magadh University in Bodh Gaya. Once the bill becomes law, Modi said, any PM, CM, or minister who is arrested will be required to secure bail within 30 days.After inaugurating projects worth over a cumulative Rs 13,000 crore, Modi said RJD politicians always indulged in corrupt practices. “Our Rajendra Babu or Babasaheb Ambedkar could never have imagined that power-hungry people would engage in corruption and cling to their positions even after being sent to jail. But now the corrupt will go to jail and they will lose their positions. The resolve to free India from corruption is shared by millions across the country,” Modi added.He also raised concerns over rapidly changing demographic profiles of Bihar’s border districts, saying a demography mission, announced on Aug 15, would begin operations very soon.The PM said his govt had decided not to let infiltrators decide the future of the nation and they would not be allowed to snatch employment opportunities from Bihar’s youth. He urged the people of Bihar to remain vigilant against those within the country who support infiltrators.Referring to the Pahalgam attack, Modi recalled that it was from the land of Bihar that he had vowed to eliminate terrorism. “Today, the world is witnessing the fulfilment of that resolve taken on Bihar’s soil,” he said. “Bihar is the land of Chandragupta Maurya and Chanakya. Whenever India has faced challenges from its enemies, Bihar has stood as a shield for the nation.”Bihar CM Nitish Kumar lauded Modi for extending assistance to Bihar. “Previous state govts did not do any work in Bihar. When NDA govt came on Nov 24, 2005, development work began,” he said.","PM Narendra Modi said opposition parties, such as RJD and Congress, were against it as many of their politicians were either in jail or out on bail.

"Excluded Bihar voters can file claims with Aadhaar, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/excluded-bihar-voters-can-file-claims-with-aadhaar-says-sc/articleshow/123462201.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday expressed surprise over 1.6 lakh booth-level agents (BLAs), appointed by 12 political parties in Bihar, filing just two claims for inclusion in the electoral roll, which was prepared after a special intensive revision of the voter list and excluded 65 lakh voters for three reasons - dead, duplicate or migrated.It also suggested to the Election Commission to consider Aadhaar as a standalone identification document for inclusion in the electoral list for excluded voters.It also refused to extend the Sept 1 deadline for submission of claims and objections, while saying that they could reconsider the decision if the numbers seeking inclusion and protesting exclusion swell.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi emphasised the importance of the participation of political parties in the preparation of the voter list, saying it is vital for the elections and crucial for democracy. It impleaded 12 parties - Congress, BJP, BSP, AAP, CPM and NPP (national parties) and RJD, JD(U), LJP (Ram Vilas), CPI-ML(L), RLJP and RLSP (state parties) in the present proceedings and directed their BLAs to facilitate the eligible to get their names included in the electoral roll.Issuing notice to the state presidents, working presidents and general secretaries of these 12 political parties, the bench asked the Bihar chief electoral officer to inform the top functionaries of the state units of the parties to remain present in SC with their status report on SIR on Sept 8, the next date of hearing.The court, however, recorded claims by politician-petitioners that EC was not permitting BLAs to file claims/objections.SC's observation about 1.6 lakh BLAs finding only two cases of unjustified deletions from the voter rolls led EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi to repeatedly highlighted the contrast between protests by political parties against SIR and the lack of any effort to ensure the inclusion of voters who, according to them, have been left out.",Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi emphasised the importance of the participation of political parties in the preparation of the voter list.

AAP MLAs protest at hospital over BJP MLA’s assault on doctor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-mlas-protest-at-hospital-over-bjp-mlas-assault-on-doctor/articleshow/123459136.cms,"NEW DELHI: AAP MLAs staged a sit-in outside Acharya Bhikshu Hospital on Friday, accusing BJP MLA Harish Khurana of assaulting an intern doctor and alleging that the hospital administration is suppressing the case under political pressure. Led by Delhi State President Saurabh Bharadwaj, the MLAs met Medical Superintendent (MS) Uma, who reportedly said she had “resolved” the matter and would not file an FIR.Bharadwaj alleged the intern doctor was being threatened to withdraw her complaint. “They are being told their career will be ruined if they refuse. Despite a four-page complaint signed by 42 doctors, the MS has not forwarded it to police,” he said. He added that assault on a doctor is a non-bailable offense, and the MS has no authority to “settle” such a crime.AAP Vice President Sanjeev Jha called the MS’s stance “highly condemnable,” accusing her of colluding with BJP to shield the MLA. AAP’s Doctor Cell head Dr. Nimmi Rastogi said: “BJP promised a law against violence on doctors, but now its own leaders are attacking them, and the system is covering it up.”Under law, any attack on a doctor inside a hospital is a cognizable offense, and the MS must ensure an FIR within six hours. AAP warned that failure to act could trigger widespread protests among medical professionals.","AAP MLAs staged a sit-in outside Acharya Bhikshu Hospital on Friday.

'I am not Christian': When Sonia's reaction surprised Aiyar



NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar reflected on his long-standing yet limited interactions with Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi , and expressed the irony of his political journey, saying his career was both made and unmade by the Gandhis.During an exclusive interview with PTI, he mentioned that aside from one occasion, he had limited meaningful interactions with Rahul Gandhi , and he had only spent time with Priyanka Gandhi on two occasions.“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions. She comes on the phone to me, so I’m in touch with them. So, the irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" he told PTI.Aiyar recounted the time when Congress ""had two disasters taking place"" in 2012, with Sonia Gandhi falling ill and Manmohan Singh going through six bypass surgeries.He said that the party had chosen Pranab Mukherjee as the prime minister instead of Manmohan Singh, and latter as the President, Congress wouldn't have lost in 2014 Lok Sabha polls ""by this massive humiliating defeat that we actually had.""“You see, in 2012, we had two disasters taking place: one was that Sonia Gandhi fell very ill, and Dr Manmohan Singh had six bypasses. So, we were crippled at the head of the government and at the head of the party,"" he said.""...if Dr Manmohan Singh had become the President and Pranab had become the PM, I still think we would have lost in 2014 (Lok Sabha polls), but not by this massive humiliating defeat that we actually had, where we fell to 44 seats...,” he added.Aiyar recalled how Sonia Gandhi reacted when he wished her ""Merry Christmas"" once.""And she says, ‘I’m not a Christian.’ Naturally, I was completely taken aback. But I think she does not see herself as a Christian,"" he said.""Like I don’t see myself as belonging to any particular religion. I am a non-believer, and I’m quite ready to say that. But, being a non-believer doesn’t mean I disrespect religions. What it means is that I respect all religions equally,” he added.Mani Shankar Aiyar is a former diplomat, having served in the Indian Foreign Service. He represented the Mayiladuthurai constituency of Tamil Nadu in the 10th, 13th, and 14th Lok Sabha, and was also a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha.","Mani Shankar Aiyar reflected on his long-standing yet limited interactions with Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.

To help readers cope with their anxieties in these stressful times, TOI has launched Talk it Out, a series in which expert counsellors answer your mental health queries. This week’s advice is from counselling psychologist Sugandha Dewan

I am a 24-year-old corporate employee working from home for an MNC. I recently completed my B.Tech. I am in a committed relationship and want to marry my partner, but my parents are strictly against it due to it being an inter-caste relationship, despite us both being financially stable. The situation is overwhelming, and I feel quite anxious about what might happen next. What strategies would you recommend for dealing with the emotional turmoil caused by parental opposition?

My 16-year-old daughter is our only child and has been well-pampered and provided with everything she needs. However, she struggles with anxiety, becoming easily upset and overwhelmed by small things. She seeks attention and often tries to please people. She finds it difficult to handle others receiving praise and sees it as a challenge to herself. She longs to make friends but struggles to make one and has time management issues. She also lacks logical decision-making skills. How can I support her in managing her anxiety and developing better social, emotional, and cognitive skills?

I am a 13-year-old living separately from my father since 2022. My father has extramarital affairs, and when we confront him, he tortures and blackmails us, threatening to commit suicide if we say anything further. He exerts complete control over our lives. My mother is not very educated, and my brother and I are still in school. Despite urging my mother to consider divorce, she feels she has no option but to stay silent. Please help. Where can we seek support?

It is very natural to feel anxious in this situation, where you value both your relationship and the belief systems of your family. The conflict between the two can cause turbulence. While this is challenging, you can always consider some strategies to ground yourself better.Begin by acknowledging your emotions without judgment. Consider journalling as a way to process these feelings—a “thought dump” can be cathartic. Alternatively, sharing your thoughts with a trusted friend or confidant may offer relief and perspective. Given the emotionally taxing nature of the situation, prioritize self-compassion by dedicating time each day to self-care. This could include mindfulness practices, listening to calming music or engaging in creative outlets to express your emotions.If you decide to engage in a conversation with your parents, approach it with empathy and patience. Strive to understand their fears and concerns while also presenting your perspective. Highlight the shared values that strengthen your bond and the vision you have for a future together. Additionally, you can always reach out to a mental health professional.As a teenager, the journey of self-discovery can be challenging. Balancing the desire to fit in with the need for a space where one feels confident and understood often creates inner conflict. Anxiety is a completely valid emotion, regardless of age or the resources available. What may seem trivial to one person might carry significant emotional weight for another. She may benefit greatly from having a safe, non-judgmental space to share her feelings. During conversations about how she feels around others, she might simply need to be heard rather than offered immediate solutions. Validate her emotions by reassuring her that it’s okay to feel anxious. This approach can help build her confidence while fostering a deeper understanding of her experiences.Gently remind her that her worth isn’t defined by external validation or comparisons. Celebrate both her small and significant efforts, emphasizing her growth. As for cognitive and time-management skills, ask if she needs support. That would encourage and help her prioritize tasks or break larger goals into manageable steps. This structured approach can help her develop independence and resilience over time.Living with the awareness of your father’s extramarital relationship and enduring his unfair treatment toward your family can be deeply suffocating and emotionally overwhelming. It’s completely valid to feel helpless, especially when your mother is unable to seek support. Your feelings matter, and prioritizing the safety and well-being of you and your family is of utmost importance. I encourage you to reach out to a school counsellor or a trusted teacher who can help connect you with child protection services or directly call the Child Helpline at 1098. Additionally, staying in touch with the school counsellor can offer you a safe space to share your emotions and develop strategies to navigate daily challenges.Encouraging your mother to connect with local women’s support groups can also help her feel less isolated and provide access to resources that empower. Additionally, if you trust another adult in the family who can support your mother, she can evaluate sharing it with them. You might also consider reaching out to the National Commission for Women where they have access to legal aid and support for women in distress.","To help readers cope with their anxieties in these stressful times, TOI has launched Talk it Out, a series in which expert counsellors answer your mental health queries.

7 armed ultras of Valley groupfired at

police commandos

GUWAHATI: Unidentified gunmen killed two migrant labourers from Bihar, while police shot an 18-year-old militant dead following a brief exchange of fire in violence-hit Manipur Saturday.Police said the labourers - identified as Sunalal Kumar, 18, and Dasharat Kumar, 17 - were travelling on bicycles when they were shot in the evening at Keirak in Kakching district. Both were residents of Rajwahi village in Gopalganj district of Bihar.The killings marked the second fatal attack on migrant workers since ethnic violence erupted in Manipur on May 3 last year. In May this year, unidentified assailants shot a 41-year-old migrant labourer dead and wounded two fellow workers in Imphal. They were from Godda district in Jharkhand. The gunfight in Thoubal district occurred near Salungpham High School at Salungpham Maning Leikai.Seven armed militants of the banned Imphal valley-based group PREPAK fired at a team of police commandos. Police overpowered the group and rounded up the seven, one of whom was found with a bullet wound. Laishram Prem died in a hospital in Imphal.The youth was missing since Aug 13 and his family had lodged a police report. He had joined PREPAK and was staying in Kakching Khunou, police said. Two Insas rifles, an Amogh rifle, a .303 rifle, an SLR rifle, 135 assorted bullets, and five mobile phones were seized from the militants. Police suspect the seized weapons were part of those stolen from their armouries during the initial stages of the ethnic unrest.More than 250 lives have been lost since the strife broke out, nearly 60,000 people displaced, and deep divisions have emerged between the Kuki-Zo tribal communities in the hill districts and the Meitei population in Imphal valley.",Unidentified gunmen killed two migrant labourers from Bihar.

‘We scoured country for art talent that will shine at upcoming AOI festival’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-scoured-country-for-art-talent-that-will-shine-at-upcoming-aoi-festival/articleshow/116322555.cms,"Alka Pande. (Photo/BCCL)

In the country’s busy art calendar, The Art of India has managed to carve a special niche for itself. In an interview, Delhi-based art historian and author Alka Pande, who has curated the forthcoming editions of the event in Delhi and Mumbai, talks about her attempt to capture the spirit of Indian art

The Indian art market is booming. According to the 2024 Hurun India Art List, sales by the top 50 artists reached a record-breaking Rs 301 crore, a 19% increase from 2023. So, this is a great time to host an art event but how does it stand apart from other art fairs in the country?



You have introduced a new section called Hidden Gems. Can you tell us about that?



There are several artists from Kerala who have made it big nationally, thanks to some great fine arts colleges and the Kochi Biennale. You attempt to shine a new spotlight on artists from Tamil Nadu. Can you elaborate?



In the last edition of The Art of India, the section on indigenous art drew much appreciation. How have you improved on it this time?



In this time of war and conflict, how important of a role does art play?



When the economy is booming, the art market always sees an upsurge, and this is what is happening in India right now. In my opinion, it is always a good time to host an art event. I would like to make a clear distinction between other fairs and initiatives like The Art of India (AOI). Those are more like trade fairs where the organisers either cobble together or select successful, well-known art galleries from India and abroad, and provide commercial spaces for selling. However, AOI is very different from such commercial art fairs in the country. For one, it is a completely curated arts initiative telling the story of Indian art, including traditional, sacred, modern, contemporary and indigenous. It showcases both the tangible and intangible heritage of the country, informing and bringing in a thoughtful, reflexive display of art practices.While showing the masters, it is also showcasing tomorrow’s blue chip, in addition to the cultural diversity and the plural culture of India. The Art of India is more about informing the general public about the history of Indian art and the cultural signifiers of Indian artistic practice.I have used ‘Hidden Gems’ as a deliberate title. In this country of 1.4 billion, there are thousands of art graduates not only from well-known art institutions but also those working outside the more structured art space. There are also numerous self-taught artists, as well as folk and tribal artists, who have been trained in the traditional ‘guru-shishya’ parampara. These artists are important culture bearers and carry within themselves vast knowledge systems and Indic traditions through their artworks. I have travelled the length and breadth of the country, seeking out artists who work quietly and consistently. These artists often live in the margins, and change often begins there, taking a while to reach the center. It is these artists — some of whom have been overlooked, such as master printmaker Haren Das — that I aim to make more visible.Kerala enjoys a unique status, and I may compare it to Bengal. Artists from Kerala not only possess skill but also benefit from a rich legacy of mural traditions, temple architecture, and cultural dance forms.Establishment of the first-ever Indian biennale, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in 2011, also gave a huge boost and a fillip to artists from the region. I feel, however, that Tamil Nadu, despite its rich artistic legacy from the Government College of Arts and Crafts and its architectural heritage in places like Thanjavur, has somewhat fallen into the shadows. It was consciously decided to include artists from Tamil Nadu who have their own distinct artistic language but have somehow been overlooked.Folk and tribal artists provide a deep cultural connection to the essence of Indian tradition, philosophy, and myths. Indigenous artists are great storytellers; they are also guardians of ecology. Indian indigenous art, to some extent, is the most significant reflection of the spirit of India. This year’s AOI will introduce some tribal art that has not previously been seen on art platforms or in galleries.War, conflict, migration, political unrest and climate change have made it an increasingly challenging world. I believe art uplifts, informs, builds cross-cultural bridges, and unites people through the heart. It erases man-made borders and serves as a panacea for much of the conflict.",Art historian and author Alka Pande has curated the forthcoming editions of The Art of India in Delhi and Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: In a seamless coordinated effort, the fourth and last National Lok Adalat for this year, organised by National Legal Services Authority ( NALSA ), settled 1.45 crore cases, and importantly, prevented 1.22 crore fresh cases entering the system, which is already groaning under a monstrous pendency of 4.65 crore cases.Working with the motto 'Resolving Disputes, Restoring Harmony', Lok Adalats held on Saturday in all states, except Rajasthan, settled a total of 1.45 crore cases, including 1.22 crore pre-litigation cases and 23.7 lakh pending cases in trial courts. This is the first national Lok Adalat held under the guidance of NALSA patron-in-chief and CJI Sanjiv Khanna and NALSA executive chairman Justice B R Gavai.Lok Adalats in Rajasthan would be held on Dec 21 and Dec 22, following the completion of election process to district bar associations.NALSA's member secretary Bharat Parashar said the increasing success of Lok Adalats with every passing year reflected the public trust in the mechanism that is affordable.According to officer on special duty at NALSA, Shreya Arora Mehta, total settlement amount for these cases is approximately Rs 7,462 crore, which is likely to see a northward trend as final figures of settled amounts are yet to come in from many state legal services authorities till late evening.","Lok Adalats held on Saturday in all states, except Rajasthan, settled a total of 1.45 crore cases.

Three and half months after the national medical register portal was launched, less than 6,500 doctors have registered and only 284 of these have been approved. At the current pace of registration, it would take 40 years to register the estimated 12 lakh doctors currently practicing in India to complete the approval process of those registered.Union health minister J P Nadda inaugurated National Medical Register (NMR) Portal of National Medical Commission (NMC) for registration of all MBBS doctors eligible for registration in India. ""The uniqueness of NMR is that it is linked with Aadhaar ID of the doctors which ensures the individual's authenticity,"" said a statement issued by health ministry. It added that NMR portal, a combined effort of National Health Authority (NHA) and NMC, will ensure dynamic, authentic, and consolidated data on doctors.Though govt claimed that ""the speedy and easy registration process on the portal will facilitate the timely updation of the data"", in reality, doctors have been facing several problems with registration.""I registered on the portal on Aug 24, the day after it was opened. The Kerala State medical council approved and confirmed my registration to NMC. Yet during the last 110 days, my application has been returned with irrelevant queries four times, which include queries on the change in the names of the University and the state medical council. They have asked me to file an affidavit regarding the name in Aadhaar card not matching the existing registration, which predates Aadhaar. Even today, my registration is not done,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and an RTI activist whose RTI application revealed how slowly the registration process is happening.The NMR is mandated under Section 31 of the NMC Act, 2019. ""If they cannot put together a digital database for just 12 lakh doctors who come through a highly regulated education system, can you imagine them being able to create databases for other categories in healthcare who would be well over 50 lakh and whose training is very poorly regulated?"" asked a senior doctor who retired from a government college.","Three and half months after the national medical register portal was launched, less than 6,500 doctors have registered.

Newly crowned chess world champion D Gukesh responded to critiques regarding the quality of his World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren .He emphasised that victory in high-stakes matches isn't solely determined by gameplay. He believes willpower and character are equally crucial, qualities he feels he amply demonstrated.At 18, Gukesh defeated Liren in the 14-game world championship match, scoring 7.5-6.5. This victory makes him the youngest world champion in chess history.Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the championship match, which concluded on Thursday.Carlsen remarked that the match resembled ""a second round or third round match of an open tournament.""Kramnik's assessment was even more critical, stating that the match represented the ""end of chess as we know it.""Asked if he was hurt by Carlsen's comments, Gukesh told BBC World, ""Not really"".Gukesh acknowledged the validity of some of the criticisms regarding the quality of play. However, he underscored the importance of non-chess factors in determining the outcome of a world championship match.""I get that maybe in some of the games, the quality was not high but I think the world championship matches are decided not purely by chess but by who has the better character and who has the better willpower. And I think those qualities, I did show quite well.""While acknowledging the pressure of the world championship, Gukesh admitted he aspired to a higher level of play. He recognised the unique demands of such a high-profile competition.""And the pure chess part, it was not at a very high level as I would have liked it to be because it's a new experience for me. So the workload was different, the pressure was different.""It's understandable that I was a bit off but I managed to strike at the critical moments, which I am happy about,"" said Gukesh.Ding Liren's critical error, which ultimately cost him the championship title, also drew criticism.FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich offered a different perspective on the error. He suggested that such mistakes add to the excitement of the sport.Indian chess legend Viswanathan Anand offered his congratulations to Gukesh. He advised the young champion to disregard the criticism.""I feel very happy. I was literally watching history being made yesterday. It (criticism) comes with every match. To be honest, I think it just comes with the territory. You ignore it and that's all,"" said Anand.",D Gukesh is the youngest chess world champion in history. The 18-year-old defeated Ding Liren in the 14-game world championship match. Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the match.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116295294,imgsize-204360,width-400,resizemode-4/116295294.jpg"

'Has to be earned': Omar Abdullah on Congress leading INDIA bloc charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/has-to-be-earned-omar-abdullah-to-congress-on-india-bloc-leadership-debate/articleshow/116317428.cms,"'Has to be earned': Omar Abdullah to Congress on INDIA bloc leadership debate

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has called on the Congress party to actively demonstrate its leadership within the INDIA opposition alliance .Abdullah, speaking in his first interview since returning to the chief minister's office in October, acknowledged the Congress party's national presence and its status as the largest opposition party in Parliament. He stated that these factors make the party a ""natural"" leader of the opposition. However, he also highlighted growing concerns among alliance partners.Abdullah, while recognizing the Congress' significant position as a pan-India party and the largest opposition in Parliament, emphasized that leadership ""has to be earned"" and cannot be taken for granted.“By virtue of being the single largest party in Parliament, and also having the leader of opposition in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the fact that they have a pan-India footprint, which no other party can lay claim to, they are natural sort of leaders of an opposition movement,” Abdullah told PTI.Abdullah noted some allies feel the Congress isn't working hard enough to maintain its leadership position. He said, “Yet there is a sense of disquiet among some of the allies because they feel the Congress is ‘not doing enough to justify it or to earn it or to keep it. That’s something the Congress might wish to consider.’”He praised Sonia Gandhi's role within the alliance but declined to comment directly on statements by other leaders suggesting alternative leadership.The chief minister also criticized the INDIA bloc 's infrequent meetings and lack of a consistent engagement strategy. He believes the alliance's current sporadic approach is ineffective. “Our existence can’t just be about six months before Parliament elections. Our existence has to be something more than that,"" he stated.He added that a regular schedule of interactions is necessary for the alliance to function effectively. “You need to have a programme of regular interactions,” he explained, adding “not that you just come alive once Lok Sabha elections are announced and suddenly start talking and trying to work things out”.Abdullah expressed dissatisfaction with the Congress party's performance during the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections , where the National Conference and Congress formed an alliance. He also highlighted the Congress party's need to analyze its performance in recent elections and improve its seat distribution strategies. He noted recurring tensions within alliances in several states.Regarding the Congress party’s potential participation in the Jammu and Kashmir government, Abdullah explained that ministerial positions are limited and currently allocated based on the number of legislators.He stated that the Congress party's participation is contingent upon the restoration of statehood for Jammu and Kashmir. “So for the time being, they’ve made it very clear that so long as J&K remains a union territory, they’ll stay out. Once statehood is restored, then that will change. So we hope that when they’re done fighting in Parliament for other things, they will also talk about statehood for J&K.” he said.","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has called on the Congress party to actively demonstrate its leadership within the INDIA opposition alliance.

Indian students in Canada in panic after Ottawa seeks documents afresh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-students-in-canada-in-panic-after-ottawa-seeks-docus-afresh/articleshow/116300386.cms,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab. Some were even asked to visit IRCC offices in person to verify their credentials. ""Many students are confused and worried,"" said Avinash Dasari, a student from Hyderabad studying in Ontario.Also read: Canada stops SDS, fast-track popular student permit scheme for international students In recent years, Canada has experienced a significant surge in international student enrolment, with Indian students making up a substantial part of this group. According to the ministry of external affairs, Canada hosts the largest number of Indian students, with 4.2 lakh enrolled, followed by the US with 3.3 lakh Indian students.The sudden cascade of emails left students feeling uncertain about their future. ""We chose Canada for its welcoming environment, but this feels unfair,"" said Manisha Patel, a business management student from Adilabad now in British Columbia.Also read: Why Canada suspended its popular student visa programme and its effects on Indian applicants Many students are urging IRCC to provide clearer communication and address their concerns. In the meantime, experts have advised students to act promptly on document submissions to avoid potential issues. ""This move appears to be part of Canada's broader strategy to control the number of international students,"" said Mehbub Rajwani, an immigration consultant in Toronto. ""Caps and financial requirements being introduced are a clear signal. This move could also be to filter out genuine students as many change their designated learning institution and shift to one where there is no restriction on attendance so they can work in Canada,"" he added.""If students don't comply with these requests on time, it could lead to visa cancellations or future complications. We recommend students to follow the instructions in the emails carefully,"" he said.","Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents.

HYDERABAD: Telugu superstar Allu Arjun was released from Chanchalguda prison in Hyderabad early Saturday after spending a tense night behind bars, despite being granted interim bail by Telangana high court in connection with a stampede at Sandhya Theatre during the premiere of his film Pushpa 2 on Dec 4.The movie hall drew a massive crowd to see the actor, leading to chaos and the death of 37-year-old Revathi and critical injuries to her son. The stampede sparked widespread public outrage and raised questions about safety protocols at large public events. Arjun was arrested Friday along with three others in connection with the overcrowding at the theatre and the subsequent stampede. Two other accused were also granted interim bail.While HC granted interim bail for four weeks late Friday night, jail authorities delayed his release, citing procedural norms. ""The court's order reached the prison almost at midnight. However, it is the established practice in all state jails to release prisoners the same day only if the bail order is received before 8pm. Any order received after 8pm is processed the next morning at 5am,"" said a prison official. His lawyer said: ""We will pursue legal action against this illegal detention."" Prison officials said they would provide an explanation if the court sought one. Arjun exited the jail through the rear gate to avoid the crowds of fans gathered at the main entrance. Jail sources said Arjun was treated like any other inmate during his detention. He shared accommodation with two other accused, ate regular prison food, and made no special demands.Arjun said: ""It is unfortunate that a woman lost her life. I will personally support the family."" Telangana Congress chief Mahesh Kumar Goud defended the police action and dismissed claims of favouritism, despite Arjun's family connection to CM Revanth Reddy. ""Everyone is equal before the law,"" he said.","Allu Arjun was released from Chanchalguda prison in Hyderabad early Saturday.

NEW DELHI: BJP and its ally Shiv Sena Saturday countered Rahul Gandhi 's criticism of VD Savarkar , reminding the Congress neta that his grandmother and former PM Indira Gandhi had hailed the Hindutva ideologue as a ""remarkable son of India"" and issued a postage stamp in his honour.Launching a scathing attack on Congress, Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde wondered whether Indira Gandhi was also anti-Constitution as she had praised Savarkar as a ""remarkable son of India"". He read out a letter written by Indira to Pandit Bakhle of the Swatantryaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak on the occasion of the freedom fighter 's birth centenary celebrations. ""Was your grandmother also anti-Constitution? You have the habit of speaking nonsense about Savarkarji... But we revere Savarkarji, we are proud of him,"" Shinde said.The House witnessed tumultuous scenes when the Leader of Opposition sought to respond to Shinde's remarks, but was disallowed by the Chair.Shinde wondered whether Sena (UBT) agreed with Congress' views on Savarkar.Earlier, Rahul referred to Savarkar's criticism of the Constitution that there was ""nothing Indian about it"" to mount an attack on BJP. He said BJP is defaming and ridiculing its own ""supreme leader"" when it talks about protecting the Constitution.Hitting back, BJP's Nishikant Dubey said Rahul cannot be Savarkar in his entire lifetime. ""Indira Gandhi had issued a postage stamp in the honour of Veer Savarkar. In 1979, Indira made a donation of Rs 11,000 from her personal account to the Savarkar Trust. In 1983, Indira got a documentary made on Savarkar by the I&B ministry,"" Dubey said. He added that in 1980, Indira said a worthy son like Savarkar is born once in an era. ""Rahul Gandhi can never be Savarkar and he should apologise to his grandmother,"" he said.BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad suggested Rahul visit the Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands to understand the sufferings Savarkar underwent as a prisoner there. ""He has issues with Savarkar. He should visit the Cellular Jail where Savarkar was incarcerated for 11 years,"" Prasad said. ""One can speak anything to further one's politics, but one should not say such things for a person who made great sacrifices for the nation,"" he added.",Shrikant Shinde wondered whether Indira Gandhi was also anti-Constitution. He read out a letter written by Indira to Pandit Bakhle of the Swatantryaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak on the occasion of the freedom fighter's birth centenary celebrations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116325904,imgsize-972263,width-400,resizemode-4/116325904.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In the proposed bills on ' one nation one election ', to be tabled in Lok Sabha Monday, the government has argued that there is an imperative need for holding simultaneous elections for various reasons as polls have become expensive and time-consuming.In the Constitution (129th) Amendment Bill, 2024, the government has stated that imposition of a Model Code of Conduct in several parts of the country that are poll-bound puts on hold entire development programmes and causes disruption of normal public life.The bill proposes to insert a new Article 82A - simultaneous elections to the House of the People (Lok Sabha) and all legislative assemblies - and to amend Article 83 (Duration of Houses of Parliament), Article 172 (Duration of State Legislatures) and Article 327 (power of Parliament to make provision with respect to elections to Legislatures).It also provides that after its enactment, a notification is to be issued by the president on the date of the first sitting of Lok Sabha after a general election, and that date of the notification will be called the appointed date. The tenure of Lok Sabha will be five years from that appointed date. The tenure of all state assemblies, constituted by elections to assemblies after the appointed date and before the expiry of the full-term of Lok Sabha, shall come to an end on the expiry of the full term of the House.""Thereafter, all general elections to the House of the People and all legislative assemblies shall be held together simultaneously. In case of dissolution of the House of the People or a legislative assembly, sooner than the full term of the House of the People or the legislative assembly, the term of the House or assembly constituted pursuant to elections shall be for the unexpired term of the House or the assembly,"" the bill stated. The bill pointed out that the general elections to Lok Sabha and all state assemblies were held simultaneously in the years 1951-52, 1957, 1962 and 1967. ""However, due to premature dissolution of some legislative assemblies in 1968 and 1969, the cycle of holding polls simultaneously with the House of the People got disrupted,"" it stated.The govt has also listed another bill, which needs a simple majority for passage in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, proposes to make ""consequential amendments"" to the Govt of Union Territories Act, 1963, (related to Puducherry), the Govt of National Capital-Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, to ""align the holding of simultaneous elections"" along with Lok Sabha and state assemblies.",Proposed bills on 'one nation one election' to be tabled in Lok Sabha Monday.

Nehru amended statute even before first poll was held: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Saturday slammed the Nehru-Gandhi family, calling them habitual violators of the Constitution, as he said his government's decisions in the past 10 years were aimed at boosting India's strength and unity in line with the Constitution's vision .""There is one family which has caused maximum damage to the Constitution. They spared no effort to undermine it. It started with the first PM Pandit Nehru and has since been running in the family,"" said Modi. ""They developed a taste for blood and turned the Constitution into a prey...""The attack came during his valedictory address to the two-day special session in Lok Sabha to mark the 75th anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution. Modi used the occasion for a vigorous espousal of Uniform Civil Code , to highlight his decisions, and aggressively justify steps like Citizenship Amendment Act , and scrapping of Article 370.Modi turned the occasion into an opportunity to repulse the criticisms opposition had subjected him to through the LS campaign and afterwards. Some opposition MPs protested the PM's remarks but had to endure the assault perhaps because, with the Constitution being the subject, the option of staging a walk out was not available.In what was perhaps his first statement on CAA, the PM asserted that the law had been inspired by the concern of Mahatma Gandhi and other stalwarts for minorities in neighbouring countries. Modi also said that although Dr Ambedkar and other veterans, after intense deliberations, ruled out religion-based quota, Congress has tried to introduce it and has not given up even after being rebuffed by courts.The Nehru-Gandhi family, however, bore the maximum brunt. Though it looked like a riposte to leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi 's consistent attack on him for an alleged plot to scrap the caste quotas subverting the Constitution, Modi explained that he could not help mentioning the family which had been at the helm for 55 of the first 70 years since Independence. ""I am focused on the Constitution and have not strayed from the subject,"" said the PM repeatedly as he listed the amendments carried out by govts under Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.""In fact, it started in 1951 when the first election had not even taken place. Nehruji was heading only an interim govt but that did not stop him from amending the Constitution through an ordinance to put curbs on freedom of press provided for by the stalwarts in the Constituent Assembly after due deliberation,"" the PM said. Modi said Nehru was convinced the Constitution could not be a restraint on him and even put this across to chief ministers, saying, ""Constitution cannot be allowed to be an impediment and should be cast aside if it comes in our way"".He said that the extra-constitutional tendency remained entrenched in the succeeding generations of the family. Modi listed the amendments carried out by Indira Gandhi during Emergency and the law enacted by Rajiv Gandhi to nullify the Supreme Court verdict in the Shah Bano case. ""This was a blow to attempt to do justice with a poor old lady and marked the capitulation to the hardliners because of vote bank considerations.""Recalling Emergency as the darkest chapter in the country's history, the PM said, ""Democracy was suspended and thousands were thrown into jail. It was imposed because Indira Gandhi wanted to stay in power despite having been unseated as an MP by the court. It is a blot that Congress will never be able to erase.""He gave the example of Rahul Gandhi tearing up the decision of the cabinet while also referring to former PM Manmohan Singh's reported admission about the Congress chief being the centre of power. ""It is sheer misfortune that Union Cabinet which is the supreme decision-making body accountable only to Parliament was forced to reverse itself because of an arrogant person,"" the PM said recalling UPA's dumping of the legislation it moved to protect convicted netas from being disqualified.Modi said it is because of the Constitution that he, despite his humble background, got to serve thrice as PM and said the entire range of his policies - from healthcare for all, construction of toilets and provision of free gas connection to one nation-one ration, creation of public digital infrastructure and expansion of physical infrastructure across the country - were all moulded by the vision that underpins the Constitution.",The attack came during his valedictory address to the two-day special session in Lok Sabha to mark the 75th anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a debate on the Constitution in Lok Sabha, tore into the Congress, saying the party ""will not be able to wash away the sin of Emergency"".In a reference to the national Emergency that was imposed by PM Indira Gandhi in 1975, PM Modi on Saturday said the Constitution was torn apart when it was completing 25 years as the rights of the citizens were snatched.""The Constitution was torn apart when it was completing 25 years; the Emergency was imposed (in 1975), all constitutional rights were snatched and the country was turned into a jail. All the rights of the citizens were snatched and there was a clampdown on media. Congress will never be able to clear this stain,"" PM Modi said.""I expected a good debate on the Constitution, but some decided to grieve their losses,"" PM Modi said in an attack on the Congress party.Narrowing his attack on the Gandhi family, the PM said: ""One family of Congress left no stone unturned in hurting the Constitution"".The family, having ""tasted blood"", repeatedly undermined the Constitution, he said, citing several decisions of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi when they held the office of prime minister.Their next generation is also into the same game, he said in a swipe at the leader of opposition in the House Rahul Gandhi and his MP sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.""One Congress family changed the Constitution to attack freedom of expression, it insulted the founders of the Constitution. Nehru wrote to chief ministers that if the Constitution comes in the way it should be changed,"" PM Modi claimed in the Lower House.PM Modi said the Congress government under the Gandhi family over the years advocated to ""committed judiciary"" and even ""punished"" Justice HR Khanna , who ruled against Indira Gandhi's decision during the period of Emergency.""Seeds sown by first PM Nehru in changing the Constitution were followed up by Indira Gandhi who even overturned the SC decision. Indira Gandhi clipped the wings of courts through Constitutional amendments to capture judiciary,"" PM Modi asserted.PM Modi also hailed India's journey since the adoption of the Constitution in 1949 as ""extraordinary"", asserting that the country's ancient democratic roots have long been an inspiration for the world.India is not only a big democracy but it is the mother of democracy, he said in the Lok Sabha replying to a two-day debate on the 75 years of the adoption of the Constitution.""Our Constitution is the basis of our unity,"" he said.The PM said the biggest 'jumla' in the history of India was 'Garibi Hatao', a slogan given by former prime minister Indira Gandhi.""Our friends in the Congress use this term day and night. But this country knows, the biggest 'jumla' in India, which has been used by four generations, is 'garibi hatao',"" the PM Modi said, referring to the popular slogan given by Indira Gandhi.""It was a 'jumla' which helped them politically, but did not help the poor,"" Modi said.Garibi Hatao Desh Bachao (remove poverty, save the country) was the theme and slogan of Indira Gandhi's 1971 election campaign.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi tore into the Congress during a debate on the Constitution in Lok Sabha.

""I feel it is more important to raise issues relating to farmers, youth and the common people, & to see that these issues are resolved,"" Kolhe said.The MP from Shirur added that they want debate and discussions on basic issues instead of political sloganeering. ""This should be ensured by both governing party and the opposition,"" Kolhe added.Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule, MP from Baramati, was sitting next to Kolhe and nodded in support all through his speech Friday.Trinamool and SP have already voiced their concerns about Congress's stubbornness over raising Adani issue, saying it is stopping them from raising other important issues like Sambhal riots and those related to Bangladesh.Congress had initiated protests inside and outside Parliament on the Adani issue at the beginning of the winter session. But, following misgivings of its allies, it corrected course, and has since been holding protests only outside Parliament.Also, the issue found scant mention during the debate on Constitution, though Rahul Gandhi, LoP in Lok Sabha, made a brief remark during his speech: ""When you give Dharavi to Adani, you chop off the thumb of the small and medium businesses there...You have fired tear gas shells on farmers outside Delhi, the farmers are asking for fair prices...You are cutting the thumb of that farmer.""",Nationalist Congress Party distanced itself from Congress's efforts to attack the govt over its alleged links to the conglomerate.

DEHRADUN: The Indian Military Academy 's Passing Out Parade was alive with the crackle of marching boots and the murmur of proud families. Among the newly commissioned officers, one story seemed to weigh heavier in the air: Lt Kabilan V, a 23-year-old from a small village near Madurai stood with quiet dignity as his father, Vetriselvam P, looked on from a wheelchair. The older man's hands, worn from years as a daily wage labourer , rested idly on his lap, his body semi-paralysed by a stroke he suffered three months ago after hauling an unforgiving load. Beside them was a framed photograph of Panmaiyammal, Kabilan's late mother, whose death three years ago from cancer and Covid-19 marked a profound absence in the family's small circle of triumph.For Kabilan, the path to this moment had been steep and unyielding. ""I failed so many times,"" he said, the weight of those years softened by his hard-won smile. ""But I had to get into the defence forces , and I did it. This is not just my personal success; it belongs to everyone who aspires to join the Indian Army. If someone like me, the son of a daily wage labourer who earned Rs 100 a day, can make it, then anyone can.""Growing up in the dusty lanes of Melur village in Tamil Nadu, Kabilan attended a govt school before earning a degree in civil engineering from Anna University. He chased a dream many deemed too far-fetched for him. Year after year, he applied to the Army, exploring every entry category - from NCC to Graduate entries - and faced rejection at every turn. Still, he persisted. ""Courage inspires me,"" Kabilan said, distilling his journey into a phrase as unassuming as the man himself.But courage was not all he had. After losing his mother, Kabilan took on the duty of supporting his family. His younger brother was preparing for the civil services, and their father's health was failing. Kabilan balanced his studies with a demanding job as a waterboat supervisor under Delta Squad, a voluntary rescue squad under the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).""He had to sustain his family while chasing his dream,"" said Sub Lt (Retd) Sugal Esan , Kabilan's mentor, who attended the ceremony to witness the moment. ""During the Chennai and Kanyakumari floods, he was part of our rescue team. Along with other volunteers, he saved almost 200 lives.""The dual responsibilities of work and study would have crushed many, but he held firm. ""I would go for work from 10 am to 4 pm, and after returning home, from 6 to 10 pm, I would do my studies with a group of students aspiring to crack this prestigious exam to join the forces,"" he said. That effort and sacrifice eventually bore fruit. His uniform now bears the insignia of the Para regiment-a mark of his next chapter in the Army. ""Learn things, fail better, and you will get success. Your determination and perseverance are the keys to your entry door to success,"" he said.","Lt Kabilan V, a 23-year-old from a small village near Madurai, is an officer in the Indian Army.

Watch: Rahul Gandhi's Lok Sabha gaffe leaves NDA MPs in splits

LIVE: Shri Rahul Gandhi | 75th anniversary | Adoption of the Constitution.

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, made a faux pas while addressing the House during the debate on the Constitution on Saturday.The Congress leader, while narrating an incident from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, addressed a 7-year-old ""young man"" instead of a kid, in reference to Eklavya, leaving the NDA MPs in splits.""Thousands of years ago in a dense forest, a 'yuva' (youth) ... a 'yuva' of 6-7 years of age ... "" Rahul Gandhi said while narrating the story of Dronacharya and Eklavya.Before he could finish the sentence, the NDA MPs started speaking, asking him about the use of the word 'yuva'.Rahul Gandhi, in a split second, corrected himself and said 'child' as the NDA MPs, including Union minister Kiren Rijiju and Ashwini Vaishnaw, laughed.Continuing with his statement, Gandhi scion said like Eklayva, who was asked to cut his thumb, the government has been cutting the thumbs of youth, who prepare for exams only to realize that paper gets leaked.""The manner in which Dronacharya cut off the thumb of Eklavya, you are busy cutting off the thumb of the entire nation...When you handover Dharavi to Adani, you cut off the thumb of entrepreneurs, small and medium businesses. When you handover India's ports, airports and defence industry to Adani, you cut off the thumbs of all fair play business of India who work honestly,"" Rahul Gandhi said.The BJP's I-T cell chief Amit Malviya took a dig at Rahul Gandhi over the gaffe, calling him the ""undisputed king of bloopers"".The Congress leader also quoted VD Savarkar to attack the BJP, saying the Hindutva ideologue ""did not find anything"" Indian about India's Constitution and that he was more inclined towards Hindu scripture Manusmriti than the Constitution that the constituent assembly prepared.Rahul Gandhi, including in his recent speeches, has been invoking Gods, Hindu scriptures and symbols to make political attacks on the BJP.In his last speech in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi invoked the ""Chakravyuha"" of Mahabharata to accuse the Narendra Modi government of spreading fear and alleged that power was centred around only 6 people.""Thousands of years ago, in Kurukshetra, six people trapped Abhimanyu in a 'Chakravyuh' and killed him. I did a little research and found out that 'Chakravyuha' is also known as 'Padmavuyh' - which means 'Lotus formation'. Chakravyuh' is in the shape of a Lotus. In the 21st century, a new 'Chakravyuh' has been formed - that too in the form of a Lotus,"" Rahul had said.""The Prime Minister wears its symbol on his chest. What was done with Abhimanyu, is being down with India - the youth, farmers, women, small and medium businesses. Abhimanyu was killed by six people.

MUMBAI: Central Railway (CR) on Saturday stayed demolition of five unauthorised temples outside Dadar station amid escalating opposition from Sena UBT, later leading to protests from BJP members as well.Sena UBT criticised the demolition notices soon after they were issued on December 4. On Friday, party chief Uddhav Thackeray raised the pitch by accusing BJP of ""electoral Hindutva"" and saying it failed to protect Hindu temples, including a 80-year-old Hanuman temple on CR premises. He announced a 'maha-aarti' at the temple Saturday.However, Saturday afternoon, BJP MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha announced a stay on the demolition. As party workers gathered outside the Hanuman temple, BJP functionaries, including Lodha and Kirit Somaiya, offered prayers. In the evening, a maha-aarti was conducted by Sena UBT's Aaditya Thackeray, who was accompanied by senior party members, including Sanjay Raut.With BMC polls approaching and Hindutva issue on electoral agenda, both parties tried to take credit for the stay. ""Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar and I spoke to railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. Members of Bajrang Dal and VHP also spoke to him. A stay has been issued, and prayers can continue at the temple,"" said Lodha. Taking a dig at Sena UBT, he said, ""What is the need for a maha-aarti when a stay has already been issued? This is nothing but politics.""After emerging from maha-aarti, Aaditya said, ""The demolition was stayed because Uddhav Thackeray made it an issue. You can see what happens when our party puts its strength behind something. We have exposed the double-face of BJP, which uses Hindutva on a use-and-throw basis. They are responsible for demolition of many ancient temples."" He said builders bought land at profitable rates around Ayodhya temple. He added that the demolition order cannot only be stayed, but has to be withdrawn.The demolition notices, dated Dec 4, were issued by CR's assistant divisional engineer (Mumbai division), directing removal of the five temples within seven days for obstructing commuter movement and delaying redevelopment of Dadar station.","Sena UBT criticised the demolition notices soon after they were issued on December 4.

Rahul cites Sambhal row, says BJP spreads hate everywhere

NEW DELHI: Seeking to corner BJP during a discussion on Constitution in Parliament, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the saffron party's ""supreme leader"" - V D Savarkar - had called ' Manusmriti ' better than the Constitution and asked if BJP wasn't mocking him by praising Ambedkar and the Constitution.Rahul invoked the legend of Eklavya being forced to chop off his thumb. Likening Eklavya's thumb to his craft, and aspiration, Rahul said BJP ""is out to cut the thumb of the entire country"" - youth, entrepreneurs, SC, ST, OBCs, farmers and minorities.In his just under half-an-hour speech on the 75-year journey of the Constitution, Rahul Gandhi said the Constitution is a modern document, but it has the voice of ancient India comprising wisdom of philosophers like Basavanna, Mahavir, Phule, Ambedkar and Kabir.But, quoting the Hindutva icon, he said, ""Your supreme leader Savarkar says, 'The worst thing about the Constitution of India is that there is nothing Indian about it. Manusmriti is the scripture that is most worshippable after the Vedas, and which, from ancient times, has been the basis of our culture, customs, thought, and practice. This book for centuries has codified the spiritual and divine march of our nation. Today, Manusmriti is law'.""Rahul asked, ""Do you (BJP) support your leader's words? But when you speak about defending the Constitution, you are ridiculing Savarkar, you are abusing Savarkar, you are defaming Savarkar.""As he framed the Mahabharat battle in Kurushektra in these days as ""Constitution vs Manusmriti"", Rahul said INDIA bloc represents defenders of the Constitution.""You (BJP-RSS) praise these people (Ambedkar, etc) hesitatingly because you have to. But the truth is that you want India to be run the way it used to be run,"" he said.Elaborating on the Eklavya metaphor , Rahul said the ""thumb of youth is cut through paper leaks and Agniveer scheme; the thumb of fair businessmen is chopped off by giving Dharavi, ports, airports, defence industry to Adani and Ambani"". He said backward classes are being hurt through lateral entry in govt jobs, which have no provision of reservation, while farmers' demand for support price is rejected. He demanded caste census and removal of 50% cap on reservation ""to show the country whose thumb you have cut"".Having met the family of deceased victim of Hathras gangrape that took place four years ago, Rahul said the family is confined to their house while the accused are roaming freely and threatening the girl's kin. ""Where in the Constitution is it written that rapists can roam freely while the victim would be shut in their house? It may be in Manusmriti, but not in the Constitution,"" he said.On Sambhal police firing on Muslims, he asked where was it written in the Constitution that innocents can be shot dead. ""Wherever you go, you pit one religion against the other. You spread hatred. Where is it written in the Constitution that it can be done?"" he added.Rahul said Ambedkar's three concepts of political, social and economic equality do not exist now.","Rahul invoked the legend of Eklavya being forced to chop off his thumb.

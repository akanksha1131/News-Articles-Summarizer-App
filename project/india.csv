"'Bedsheets unchanged, toilets inaccessible': Tejashwi Yadav flags crisis at Bihar govt hospital; calls it 'double jungle raj'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bedsheets-unchanged-toilets-inaccessible-tejashwi-flags-crisis-at-bihar-govt-hospital-calls-it-double-jungle-raj/articleshow/123878070.cms,"Photo/screengrab

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday accused the NDA government in Bihar of presiding over a collapse in public healthcare after inspecting Purnea’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).He pointed to patients sharing beds, toilets unfit for use, and bedsheets not changed for weeks, calling the situation a sign of ""double jungle raj"" under the ruling alliance. His remarks came a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to the state.Tejashwi visited GMCH on Saturday night and shared visuals of his inspection on X. He wrote, ""Last night, a surprise inspection was conducted at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Purnea. Watch a glimpse of the deplorable state of the healthcare system under 20 years of NDA in the video.""He highlighted the absence of an ICU, non-functional trauma and cardiology departments, and unclean toilets. He also said multiple patients were being made to share single beds. ""This is a medical college and hospital, but there is no ICU here. The trauma centre is not operational. There is no cardiology department, i.e.,no heart disease department. Three patients are made to lie on a single bed. Bedsheets of patients are not changed even after 15-20 days. The toilets for patients with orthopaedic issues and those requiring disability-related surgeries are two feet high. There is absolutely no cleanliness,"" he wrote.The RJD leader claimed that only 55 nurses were working at the hospital in three shifts, against a sanctioned strength of 255. He alleged that 80% of doctors’ posts were vacant, with just four OT assistants for the entire hospital. He added that several departments were closed, professors existed ""only in name,"" and medical interns had not been paid for six months.""GMCH is a Medical College Hospital, but out of the sanctioned 255 nurse posts, only 55 nurses are working, and that too in three shifts. This means only 18 nurses are on duty at a time. If some are on leave, the number is even lower. 80 per cent of the doctor posts at GMCH are vacant. There is not a single permanent dresser at GMCH. The entire college and hospital have only four OT assistants. Many of the 23 departments are closed. Professors and assistant professors are present only in name. Medical interns have not received their salaries for 6 months,"" he stated.Yadav also alleged corruption in the construction of hospital buildings and the purchase of medical equipment. He said poor staffing and lack of facilities were forcing around 10,000 patients in Purnea to seek private treatment daily. ""The corrupt ministers and officials of the NDA government spend thousands of crores of rupees just to build structures, eating commissions in corruption, but they do not appoint doctors, healthcare workers, lab technicians, dressers, assistants, etc. They purchase medical equipment worth thousands of crores for commissions but do not hire technicians to operate them,"" he said.Ahead of PM Modi’s visit, Tejashwi took a dig at the Centre and the state government, referring to them as “double jungle raj.” He said, ""Tomorrow, Prime Minister Modi ji is coming to Purnea in Seemanchal to shower rhetoric. Despite occupying such a high position, will he not see the massive shortcomings of his 20 years of governance in Bihar and 11 years at the centre under the double-engine government before indulging in petty and small talk?""He added, ""Prime Minister Modi ji will surely give a sermon on the corruption, unemployment, poverty, failures of the NDA government, looting of the poor in the name of treatment, and the deplorable state of education and healthcare systems, as well as the double jungle raj of the double-engine government in Bihar over the past 20 years.""Calling on the PM to visit GMCH with CM Nitish Kumar, he said, “Prime Minister ji, please do visit this medical college in Purnea tomorrow and make sure to bring along the Chief Minister from 2005 onwards; otherwise, he will say, was there anything before 2005?”The Prime Minister is scheduled to inaugurate the Purnea Airport on September 15 and address a public rally at Shishabari village, where people from Purnia, Katihar, Araria, and Kishanganj districts are expected to attend.","Tejashwi Yadav visited Purnea’s Government Medical College and Hospital.

"Projects, not politics: PM Modi resets Manipur pitch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/projects-not-politics-pm-modi-resets-manipur-pitch/articleshow/123878116.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Modi's visit to Manipur Saturday - his first since the 2023 outbreak of ethnic violence - was always expected to be a high-visbility affair with high stakes. It lived up to the billing, with Modi reaching out to Meiteis and Kukis by emphasising well being of both the communities - parties to the dispute that shattered the peace and derailed development in the state.Modi promised to be partner and amplified the intent by laying foundation stones for projects totalling Rs 7,000-7,300 crore and announced targeted health, connectivity and education investments. The moves deliberately designed to reach ""the last mile"" and create economic anchors for social order. His speech in Churachandpur mixed soft appeals for peace with a sales pitch for growth - salute to local resilience, pledges on roads, rail and health, and promises to resettle displaced families.The PM's absence during the peak of the violence had drawn repeated attacks from the opposition, who accused him of ""turning his back on Manipur"" while lives were lost and thousands displaced. Modi, sources say, had a different calculus in mind. He asked authorities to fix law and order in a state with a porous border and awash with firearms, and prepare the ground for his message of development.Saluting Manipur as the ""land of courage and fortitude,"" Modi framed development as the antidote to despair.The PM also underlined that peace is a prerequisite for growth. ""Dialogue, respect and mutual understanding are key,"" he said, noting that earlier accords in the North-East had ended long standing disputes. By tying Manipur's healing to India's broader economic rise, Modi sought to recast the state as a frontier of opportunity rather than conflict.The opposition is not going to relent on criticism, but Modi govt seems to have reckoned that funds for development and presence of large number of central boots would help it prevail in battle of narratives.",Modi reaches out to Meiteis and Kukis by emphasising well being of both the communities.

The tile-high club: How mahjong became the hottest social currency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-tile-high-club-how-mahjong-became-the-hottest-social-currency/articleshow/123877909.cms,"Unexpected but true: Mumbai's elite have a new passion, and it's called mahjong! Living rooms and club lounges from Chembur to Churchgate echo with the clack-clack-clack of 144 tiles shuffling - a sound that has decisively dethroned the genteel clinking of silver tea services and the buzz of kitty parties. Forget idle gossip or the thrill of a Prada bag, the new badge of honour is slamming a tile declaring mahjong with the drama of a Bollywood climax.What began as a curious pastime, a let's-try-this diversion brought back from holidays in Singapore or Hong Kong a couple of years ago, has morphed into a full-blown, designer-clad, avocado-toast-fuelled obsession among women. Age and profession don't matter; an entire gamut of elite, be it the ladies that lunch, Bollywood actors, young mothers and even a multitude of working professionals have been drawn into its orbit. The weapons? Hand-crafted tiles of bone or even jade and gold. The armour? Statement Cartier bangles that risk damage with every aggressive move. The battlefield? An impeccably polished mahogany table where social capital is won and lost.The origins of mahjong are shrouded in mystery. Most historians agree the game was codified during China's Qing dynasty in the 19th century. But the romantic legends are far more entertaining.Some say Confucius himself developed the game, its three main suits - Bamboos, Characters, and Circles - symbolised the virtues he admired. Others insist it was a clever invention of a bored concubine trying to win an emperor's favour.By the 1920s, it had become a roaring craze in America. Articles from the time fretted over 'Mahjong Madness' as a dangerous addiction, a seductive Oriental diversion that was causing women to ignore other obligations. A headline from a 1923 edition of The New York Times might as well have been written about today's Mumbai: 'Society Women Abandon Bridge for Mahjong; Fear New Game Will Cause Neglect of Homes'.In India, it led a quieter life - in Kolkata's Chinatown where it was played in smoky, neon-lit clubs over steaming bowls of hakka noodles and chilli pork; in army cantonments where wives wielded strategy with the same precision as their officer husbands; and among the well-heeled and internationally travelled Indian upper classes.But like all fads, it faded till its dazzling revival in the last year when the contagion spread through Mumbai's drawing rooms with a velocity of a viral meme. One season, it was the quirky thing your cousin from Singapore did. The next, it was 'the' thing to do. From its South Mumbai epicentre, the tremor is radiating outward. Pune's leafy clubs have begun hosting mahjong tournaments alongside golf championships. Bengaluru's tech-world wives are swapping startup talk for tile strategies. And this has even spread to the guarded farmhouses of Delhi.In this new order, your status isn't your last name. It's your mahjong set. Starter sets made of lightweight plastic or bamboo tiles are treated with the same disdain as a fake Birkin. The intermediate player graduates to a weighty set of bone, the tiles clicking with a satisfying, authoritative tone. A lucky few have an ivory or a jade set in their collection. But the grand masters of this social game play on a different plane entirely. We are talking bespoke luxury sets crafted from malachite, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and housed in leather cases that cost more than a family sedan. The latest additions are automatic, self-shuffling tables imported from China that whirr and hum, dealing perfect walls of tiles at the push of a button, effectively eliminating the one bit of manual labour of the afternoon.The refreshments match the sophistication of the game. In Mumbai, it's a parade of exotic hummus, truffle-infused arancini, sushi rolls crafted to look like miniature works of art, and gluten-free, sugar-free desserts that are photographed intensely before being nibbled. The peak of this foodie one-upmanship was a party where the cheese platter was meticulously carved into the shapes of the green and red dragon tiles. In Delhi, the approach is more robust: mini kebabs served on silver skewers, delicate kathi rolls, and paneer tikka. The conversation that flows around the game is fairly spicy -whose marriage is shaky, which builder is going bankrupt, which art gallery has the next big thing, and which doctor does the best non-surgical facelift.Clearly, a social sport would not be complete without fashion. Mahjong afternoons are as much about Louis Vuitton bags, Patek Philippe watches, Hermes scarves and chic co-ords (coordinated sets for the uninitiated) as they are about tiles. Food, fashion and fortune now sit comfortably at the same table.Even the hallowed, tradition-steeped halls of the Willingdon Club, a bastion of bridge, badminton, and complex membership rules echoing with the sound of clattering tiles. One can almost hear past presidents muttering into their favourite drink, ""We survived the British Raj, the permit era, and the new money, but by God, we couldn't survive the mahjong mania!""As it happens with any obsession, demand rapidly outpaces supply. So, mahjong instructors are more in demand than Bollywood fitness trainers and celebrity chefs, with wait lists stretching for months. These senseis of the tiles impart not just rules of the game but also its secret rhythms and advanced psychological warfare techniques. Their students form WhatsApp hives, buzzing at midnight with scoring queries and images of complex hands. The real bragging rights, however, belong to the circle that pools their resources to fly in a 'Master' from Macau or Hong Kong for a weekend retreat.For some, the game itself is secondary. This provides them the oldest currency of all: access. An invitation to the 'right' mahjong table is the new-age equivalent of making the cut for a private yacht party in Monaco or an exclusive pre-wedding sangeet in Udaipur. The mahjong table is a sealed universe of four. To be one of those four is a tacit announcement that you are 'in'. As one Mumbai hostess, a queen bee of the mahjong scene, confided with a wave of her bejewelled hand, ""It's not about the money, dahling. If you're not at my table on a Thursday, frankly, you don't exist."" Another Delhi socialite was even blunter: ""Mahjong is the new membership committee. It tells you who's rising, who's falling, and who's desperately trying to buy a set to get in.""This has not gone unnoticed by astute brands. The opening of a high-end jewellery store in the city recently featured not a champagne fountain, but four mahjong tables. The lure was simple: ""Play a hand, win a discount.""Curiously, men remain at the periphery of this revolution, retreating to their golf courses, poker games, and the new fad of padel. Perhaps the potent combination of intense strategy, endless gossip, and the requirement to sit still for three hours is a biological impossibility for the male species.So why has this particular game, above all others, captured the collective imagination so completely? The answer is simple: it combines skill, luck and endless conversation. It offers the thrill of competition without the brute force of sports. It's sophisticated enough to feel exclusive, yet social enough to make new friends. Above all, it fits beautifully into the rhythm of modern social life: it takes time, attention, and provides the perfect excuse to meet three times a week without guilt. What's there not to love?And in many ways, it mirrors our own journeys - from the ambition to build a winning hand, to the lessons of failures and missed chances, to the wisdom of patience and strategy, the exhilaration of seizing the right moment - and when all else fails, the quiet art of bluffing with confidence.The writer is chairman, RPG Enterprises","Mahjong began as a curious pastime, a let's-try-this diversion. Now it's a full- blown, designer-clad, avocado-toast-fuelled obsession. The weapons? Hand-crafted tiles of bone or even jade and gold. The armour?

Saving the tiniest lives: The story behind Kerala's surprising infant mortality feat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saving-the-tiniest-lives-the-story-behind-keralas-surprising-infant-mortality-feat/articleshow/123877904.cms,"The latest Sample Registration System (SRS) report has highlighted a striking milestone for Kerala - the state had achieved an infant mortality rate (IMR) of 5, a figure lower than even the US (5.6). This achievement is all the more remarkable because for over two decades, between 1995 and 2015, Kerala's IMR stubbornly refused to fall below 12-15. Breaking free of that stagnation took persistence, innovation, and a rare partnership between the state govt and the paediatrician community.Infant mortality rate refers to the number of infant deaths under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Even at an IMR of 12, Kerala was well ahead of the rest of the country. However, while India's IMR fell from roughly 75 to 37 in the same two decades, showing remarkable progress, Kerala's IMR barely budged. This made the state govt take a hard look at what was holding Kerala back.The contrast became sharper because maternal mortality had steadily declined. Kerala's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) fell from 150 in the mid-1990s to 61 in 2011-13. In the latest report, its MMR is 30. Rajeev Sadanandan, who was then with the department of health and family welfare in Kerala, credits this success to a confidential review of maternal deaths started by Kerala Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (KFOG) in 2002.""They used to publish a fabulous report every three years called 'Why Our Mothers Die'. Every maternal death review was seen as a learning exercise and not a fault-finding exercise. This provided a very clear evidence-based template to reduce maternal deaths,"" explains Sadanandan.Like mother, like childWhen Sadanandan returned to the health department in 2011, he urged the Kerala branch of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) to adopt a similar approach for infant mortality. According to the then president of IAP's Kerala branch, Dr Sachidananda Kamath, the association decided to take up the challenge of bringing down Kerala's IMR to single digits.""With the help of the National Rural Health Mission and Kerala govt, IAP reviewed infant deaths in four districts,"" says Dr Kamath. ""We found that prematurity and congenital anomalies together accounted for more than 60% of infant deaths. We suggested interventions such as increasing the level of care and tackling deaths from heart diseases. Boosting neonatal care improved the survival of 28-week-old babies and even newborns weighing 900 gm were able to live. ""However, congenital anomalies, which accounted for almost 30% of infant deaths, were more challenging to tackle as they required access to highly skilled surgeons, medical infrastructure and financial resources. ""We decided to focus on congenital heart diseases, which is a significant proportion of congenital anomalies in infants,"" says Sadanandan, who served as the health secretary for 11 years.With leadership provided by paediatric cardiologist Dr Raman Krishna Kumar and foetal cardiologist Dr Balu Vaidyanathan in Amritha Hospital, Kochi, the govt launched Hridyam, the first ever population-level programme to address congenital heart diseases in a low-middle-income country. Its web-based application launched in 2017 serves as a registry where any physician in Kerala could add the name of a suspected case of congenital heart disease. Once listed, a paediatric cardiologist would review the online record within 24 hours and classify the case according to urgency. In case there was insufficient information, the cardiologist could direct the District Early Intervention Center at the local level to get further tests done. Patient registrations have risen steadily since launch.""A lot of deaths happen even before the child reaches the hospital or gets a diagnosis. Hridyam sought to minimise this attrition by ensuring timely screening and referral. Since this involved screening babies, the collateral benefit of screening was that other conditions such as respiratory conditions got picked up. Pulse oximeter screening within 24-48 hours of birth could identify babies who were sick or who could die. This way, we were able to save a lot of babies,"" says Dr Krishna Kumar. For this to work, hundreds of paediatricians, obstetricians and sonographers had to be trained to enhance their diagnostic skills. Private and public paediatric cardiac programmes that could be referral centres were identified and empanelled, even as the public sector capacity in three institutions was expanded.Neonatal transport networks were also strengthened, but risks during transit remained. This is where foetal echocardiography came in. ""Kerala's newborn registry study showed that many babies died before reaching a centre to get surgery. A mother's womb is the safest transport for a baby. So, the answer was to do foetal echo diagnosis during the mid-trimester scan, which is mandatory for all pregnancies. If a critical heart defect is suspected, the mother is referred to a person trained in foetal echocardiography. If that confirms a critical defect, the mother can be referred to a high-end centre for delivery so that the baby can be taken for emergency surgery soon after birth. It significantly improves the chances of survival,"" explains Dr Vaidyanathan. These measures, combined with Kerala's robust primary healthcare and female literacy, helped cut IMR to 5.Audit modelDeath audits also played a pivotal role. But since neither doctors nor hospitals like to do them, how did the medical community adopt it? Dr VP Paily, one of the founders of KFOG, says confidentiality was key, with neither the identity of the patient nor that of the doctor or hospital revealed to assessors. ""We only studied the circumstances of the death, the treatment given and whether it was preventable. There were some doubts initially, but once we gained the trust of the obstetricians, it was fine. This was important because 70% of births in Kerala happen in the private sector,"" said Dr Paily. The govt, meanwhile, was happy to get robust data without spending any money. This model is now seen as a cornerstone of Kerala's health gains.Still, experts warn of challenges ahead. Former IAP national president Dr Kamath notes that while Kerala is ahead of the US, there are several developed countries that have done better. Italy, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Slovenia, Estonia and the Czech Republic have the lowest IMR of 2. ""Within Kerala, there are pockets where the IMR is much higher than 5. We need special strategies for tribal and vulnerable populations. We need to find out why prematurity is high in Kerala. We must take care of adolescent girls - our future mothers - and focus on their nutrition, exercise and the rise of non-communicable diseases among them. We need a good strategy to bring it down further.""Others caution against over-celebration. ""All this about Kerala's IMR being lower than the US is a bit misleading,"" says Sadanandan. ""SRS is at best an estimate, unlike the US which has an excellent statistical system. What matters is that we've managed to sustain single-digit IMR.""","Infant mortality rate refers to the number of infant deaths under one year of age per 1,000 live births. For over two decades, between 1995 and 2015, Kerala's IMR stubbornly refused to fall below 12-15. Kerala's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) fell from 150 in the mid-1990s to 61 in 2011-13.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123878007,imgsize-55218,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
"Mohalla to Madison Square, meet the new wave of Muslim comics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mohalla-to-madison-square-meet-the-new-wave-of-muslim-comics/articleshow/123877900.cms,"Mohalla to Madison Square, meet the new wave of Muslim comics

They say Muslims are the most unemployed. Others claim Muslims are the most backward. Still others insist Muslims are the most uneducated. But judging by the sheer number of mushrooming eateries in Muslim areas, it seems that Muslims are simply the most hungry. ""That is a joke by Rehman Khan, born and raised in ""Mumbai's most too much place"" Kurla. His ""tandoori-roasted, biryani-laced, full-spice"" set 'Miyan Bhai Khana and Kurla' has racked up nearly three lakh views on YouTube. Fluent in street swagger and Bambaiya-laced slang, the now-Powai-based comic recalls the casual confidence of local boys who once approached him for a selfie saying: ""Chal Rehman bhai ko famous karke aate hain (let's make Rehman bhai famous). "" Legendary late comic Raju Srivastav too praised Rehman's grasp of language: ""How did you get the nuanceso right?""Indore-bred comedian Zakir Khan may have capped his blockbuster career with a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden in New York, but there is also a new wave of Muslim comics finding laughs in gullies and mohallas. From biryani to backstreet banter, they mine food obsessions and neighbourhood stereotypes while walking the tightrope of identityand scrutiny.Do not ask Haseeb Khan where he is from. Once, an uncle made that mistake. When Haseeb said ""MP"", the man's eyes lit up. ""Where in MP?"" he pressed. ""Bhopal,"" Haseeb replied. The uncle hugged him. ""Where in Bhopal,"" he asked. Haseeb stopped short of saying Jahangirabad - afraid the man might kiss him next.""Why can't people believe two people can hail from the same city?"" he wonders in his set 'Mein Karachi Se Hoon', which has earned him over one crore views on YouTube, apart from fans on both sides of the border. With over 4 lakh followers on Instagram spanning Lucknow to London, the Bhopal-born engineering dropout aka @a_sad_comic - who is sometimes mistaken for standup comic Zakir Khan's brother - has become a face of a small yet significant wave.Yet behind that laughter lies a quiet tension. ""There was a time when I used to perform and watch political comedy,"" says Rehman. ""Now I've stopped watching the news,"" he says, half-joking. A year ago, he found two of his corporate shows in a state that he does not name cancelled suddenly because of his political jokes. ""I have toned down my material a lot. It is suffocating and a bit sad,"" admits Rehman, who envies the freedom comics abroad enjoy.In India, political satire remains a minefield. Junagadh-born Munawar Faruqui's brushes with FIRs and controversy have underscored how fragile a minority comic's voice can be. ""There is always a fear of being targeted, especially in North India,"" says Adel Rehman, who hails from Arrah near Patna. His viral video 'Bihar' (2.8 lakh views) skewers stereotypes: ""Comedians smoke and drink after shows. In Bihar, they go home and study for UPSC"". Adel -who faced hecklers in Gurugram on two occasions - has now shifted base to Bengaluru, partly to be able to speak his mind.""I have been denied homes here too because of my identity but I find the city more open,"" says Adel, who runs comedy venues in Bengaluru. ""Jokes are jokes. They are not meant to offend. For instance, I do a lot of jokes on my dead father, both onstage and off it. It's not disrespect, it's how you cope with grief.""While A-listers can afford lawyers, many comics - who hail from tier 2 and 3 towns - cannot, he says. ""Going to jail is the last thing but there are other personal costs - threats, family members getting hassled, venues being ransacked, brands stepping away, and boycott culture,"" says Adel, who thinks twice before posting his sets online. ""I have also stopped reading the comments,"" he says.Ask him about the ratio of Muslim voices in standup and Adel quips: ""Just like in the Parliament, the representation is low."" It's rarer still to find Muslim women comics within this minority. Apart from established Mumbai comics such as Sumaira Shaikh (""I love gangsters. You are like, you are from Dongri. Of course, you don't like poets"") and Urooj Ashfaq, emerging voices include Delhi's Daahab Chishti, who grew up in a mohalla in Uttam Nagar, observing the ""nau sebarah shows""of gossiping aunties, a kirana store owner named Pappu uncle with capacious khatas (credit accounts) and his grandma who'd sit on a chatai, serving as the ""CCTV"" of the street. ""A mohalla,"" Chishti says in 'Ladke', which has nearly six lakh views, ""is an L-shaped gully which collects funds from residents to erect gates at both ends and calls itself a society.""In 2021, a severe bout of Covid landed her in an ICU for four months.'Alive' - her first special - was mostly about surviving, about what happens when yourlungs fight to remember breath. ""People are not comfortable with the ideaof joking about death,"" says Chishti, who cut out many bits from the show though she aches for a poignant special in the vein of Zakir Khan's 'Tathastu', an ode to his late grandfather.Daahab also feels the weight of identity in every joke she considers posting. ""Hundred percent, there is censorship,"" she says. ""I am a woman. I am a Muslim. I am a comedian - enough fodder for a news channel for a month,"" laughs Daahab, who has a set about Muslim identity that she will never post. If she does, she says it will either go viral or get her family into intense trouble or both. ""I have been given a new lease of life. I want to value it,"" deadpans Daahab.Recently, at an event in Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai, Rehman noticed the audience gravitate toward the buffet counter as soon as he began his set. ""I said, Assalam Walekum, mere bhooke musalmanon (greetings, my hungry brethren). They didn't like it,"" he says. On another occasion, when he joked about Muslims who were not getting vaccinated, members of the community said: ""Why are you spoiling our reputation?""While Rehman finds solace in a friend's refrain, ""Yeh gaali nahin, dua hai"" (these aren't abuses but blessings), he too, like Daahab, has learned to wrap political jokes in ""malmal"": not naming parties, using allegory, using subtext. In one of his sets, he gives his girlfriend a lotus on Valentine's Day.As for Daahab, she takes a friend - who has suddenly lost his voice - to a doctor in one of her routines. The doctor diagnoses him with Stage 2 Apolitical Syndrome: ""First, it takes away your spine, then your voice, then your mind and then the nation gets screwed over.""","There is a new wave of Muslim comics finding laughs in gullies and mohallas.

Mystery of Agatha Christie's India story finally solved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-of-agatha-christies-india-story-finally-solved/articleshow/123877784.cms,"Agatha Christie autographs copies of her books

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

Mathew Prichard (also in photo right), who’s settled the India question once and for all, with his grandmother Agatha Christie

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Jan 11, 1960 |

Jan 20, 1960 |

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

Feb 16, 1960 |

Oct 30, 1961 |

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

’s book has quietly sparked a revolution in water conservation across villages — one pond at a time

Chasing Indigenous Wisdom

Deep Impact

Why It Still Matters

What do you call a book that was first published without the author’s name on the cover, which has no copyright and encourages the reader to use it for free in any form, inspires common people to spend money from their own pockets and translate it, can be read in at least nine languages, including Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, and also in Braille, has been broadcast by at least 20 radio stations with over two lakh copies published, has almost become a holy book for water warriors and, yet, remains largely unknown to the educated public.Anupam Mishra’s ‘Aaj Bhi Khare Hain Talab (The Ponds Are Still Relevant)’ wasn’t launched in a farmhouse or nominated for major literary awards. But the book has become a movement. Spread over a frugal 119 pages, it reveals how ponds and lakes were fundamental to life and livelihoods across the country, and how their construction, preservation, and regeneration was embedded in community fabric — guided both by science and deeper philosophical values.First published by the Gandhi Peace Foundation in Hindi in 1993, the book continues to find fresh readers in new languages and forms. This year, it has been made accessible online in a disabled-friendly e-text, says Kailash Pande of Delhi Blind School.Ramon Magsaysay award recipient Rajendra Singh says that at a time when headlines rapidly shift from drought to flood, the book remains as relevant as ever. “The change in weather patterns is an outcome of climate change and global warming.The book shows how to adapt to and mitigate the current crisis,” says Singh, whose NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh also shaped Mishra’s early ideas.Aaj Bhi… was born out of Mishra’s extensive travels as a seeker and surveyor of India’s interiors in the 1980s. Mishra spoke less, listened more. A Gandhian by belief and environmentalist in action, he discovered a tradition of water-saving techniques in arid Rajasthan. In areas he couldn’t visit, Mishra sought the aid of friends and fellow travellers, naming each of them in the book. “The book harnessed indigenous water wisdom scattered across the country,” says social activist and old-time colleague Rakesh Dewan.At the turn of the 20th century, India had 11-12 lakh ponds, the book says. Mishra referenced the 1907 gazetteer to show that the princely state of Rewa in north-eastern Madhya Pradesh had 5,000 ponds. Early 20th century Madras Presidency was home to 53,000 ponds. Who would believe that in the early 20th century, Delhi had 350 ponds, as a 1930 map illustrates. Dewan says that officers posted to Jabalpur during the British Raj were advised not to bring fans because the ponds there ensured a cool weather.The book also details the craft of building ponds and devotes a chapter to their anonymous creators. Mishra illustrates how, for centuries, communities such as the Odhs, the Gonds, and the Ramnamis had dedicatedly constructed ponds. Such acts often cut across the caste spectrum. Building ponds was also part of the financial system. “Those who built ponds in the kingdom of Gond rajas got a tax break. This tradition was strong in Sambalpur region,” he writes.Digging ponds was among the punishments meted out by the caste panchayats of Bundelkhand. Ponds permeate every sinew of life.Many found the book addictive. Some finished it in one go and keep revisiting it. “People were mesmerised,” says Bhopal-based journalist Shabbir Qadri, who translated the book into Urdu and distributed it for free at madrasas and panchayats.Mishra, who passed away in 2016, would build a personal relationship with his readers. “I correspond with about 3,000-odd readers. The idea is to create awareness and build a movement through the book. You cannot do that without forming a long-standing relationship with them,” he told this reporter in 2004.One such reader was Surendra Bansal, then a freelance graphic designer in Punjab’s Malerkotla. He learnt about the book from a piece by journalist Prabhas Joshi in ‘Jansatta’ newspaper. “I read that article four times and wrote to Anupam-ji,” he says. “I didn’t have the address, so I just wrote, Anupam Mishra, Delhi”. Miraculously, the letter reached its destination. Mishra sent him two of his books with a hand-written note in his signature style.Bansal read the book and, then, translated it into Gurmukhi. He published it by selling off his prized cacti collection for Rs 11,000. “When Anupam-ji came to know about it, he first scolded me. Then he wept,” remembers Bansal, who now works for Haryana govt’s PR department. He has published five editions of the book in Gurmukhi. And he hasn’t stopped. Bansal regularly scans Punjabi magazines and sends free copies of the book to those he believes might be interested in water conservation. “I also distribute it to youth clubs and village libraries,” he says. Bansal has given away 6,200 copies so far.The book has also been used to groom community leaders. Aaj Bhi… was introduced as part of the syllabus in Chitrakoot’s Mahatma Gandhi Gramin Vishwavidyalaya. “It was taught to graduate students in 313 centres in a leadership course,” says retired civil servant B Rajagopal Naidu. The book was also part of the Hindi syllabus for graduates in Mumbai University between 2017 and 2019.Rajendra Singh, known as the ‘Waterman of India’, says Aaj Bhi… made a deep impact in MP and Rajasthan. Naidu, whose tenure as DM of Sagar in MP during 2002-04 was marked by a host of water management initiatives, says the book helped mobilise people and build awareness around check dams, and small drinking water ponds.He also remembers how the clean-up of Sagar’s sprawling Lakha Banjara lake got stuck due to a funds crunch. Help came in an unusual way. Film lyricist and Congress politician Vithalbhai Patel, who had penned the 1973 hit Bobby’s famous song, ‘Jhooth Bole Kawwa Kate’, went around every morning to the town’s different wards, asking people to donate Re 1 for the talab. The amount raised helped restore a huge portion of the lake.Such examples abound. Singh of Tarun Bharat Sangh, which constructed at least 7,500 ponds, says that dozens of initiatives were undertaken in Jodhpur and Barmer districts. “A sarpanch from Bikaner’s Nakhoda village called me after reading the book seeking help to build ponds,” he recalls.Chhatar Singh, a master of desert water conservation in Jaisalmer district, restored about 500 ponds, beris , and wells. A beri is a shallow well that harvests rainwater.“Reading the book I felt my forefathers were talking to me. It was written in a way that inspired action,” says Chhatar, who was also impressed by Mishra’s book, ‘Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein (The Silver Drops Of Rajasthan)’. He explains Mishra’s approach: “If you had any doubts about building ponds, Anupamji would organise a gathering. He knew the answer, but would let the answer emerge from us.”Eastern Rajasthan’s Lapodia village is a famous conservation success story. Its head Laxman Singh read Aaj bhi… and encouraged fellow villagers to do so too. Impressed by its message of reviving traditional methods, they undertook a textbook application of rainwater harvesting and water management techniques to transform a sun-dried area into a village of three fecund ponds — Dev Sagar, Phool Sagar, and Anna Sagar, with a 300 bigha meadow.Laxman Singh says Mishra visited Lapodia twice every year for 30 years. “He was our guide and guru. Pehle woh insaan taiyar karte thhey, phir dharti (First, he readied people, then the land),” Laxman told this reporter in 2016. When the book’s Braille edition came out around 2009, Mishra visited Delhi Blind School, inspiring students to perform shramdan, or voluntary labour, recalls Pande.Academic Annie Montaut, who has translated ‘Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein’ into French, writes how even prisoners of a French jail could relate to Mishra’s lecture on water conservation. Some recalled their own childhood in Morocco. “I was surprised by the reaction, he wasn’t. Anupam-ji told me that he had learnt a lot from the uneducated,” she wrote in Hindi to Mishra’s wife, Manjushree, for an upcoming book in tribute to her husband.It is almost a cliché that a book can change your world. Mishra’s slim volume certainly reaffirms that adage. With global water shortage now an impending reality, the book’s significance has magnified in recent years. Today Aaj Bhi… is to water conservationists what Das Capital is to Marxists. A ratna of Bharat, Mishra never received even a Padmashri. But his book continues to usher in a silent revolution, one pond at a time.","Anupam Mishra’s ‘Aaj Bhi Khare Hain Talab (The Ponds Are Still Relevant) has become a movement.

Past disruptions and student protests

About the Commission

The first day of the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Examination 2025 Tier-I, scheduled for September 12, was disrupted after tests were cancelled at multiple centres due to technical and administrative reasons.The Commission has clarified that fresh dates have been assigned to the affected candidates to ensure they do not lose their attempt. This disruption is particularly significant as the SSC CGL is one of the largest recruitment examinations in the country, attracting lakhs of aspirants every year.At M M Public School in Sector 4, Gurugram, chaos broke out on Friday morning when candidates arrived only to learn that their exam had been cancelled. According to officials, frustrated aspirants damaged the school gate, prompting the police to intervene. A police team reached the spot and managed to pacify the agitated crowd, which had been raising slogans against the alleged mismanagement of the examination process.Centre head Manoj Gupta said, “The exam has been cancelled due to technical problems in the SSC server. While the server began functioning again after the first shift, candidates from that shift caused a disturbance and prevented the second shift examinees from entering the venue. The police were called to restore order,” according toA senior police officer stated that no formal complaints had been filed by the school management regarding the incident.Apart from Gurugram, official notices confirmed that examinations at Bharti Vidya Niketan Public School in Delhi were cancelled due to administrative issues. Candidates from these centres have been rescheduled to appear on September 24, 25, and 26, 2025.In Jammu, the examination at Digital Computer Education was disrupted by technical glitches. The rescheduled date for these candidates has been fixed for September 26, 2025.Speaking to a prominent media house, SSC Chairman S. Gopalkrishnan clarified that the examination was successfully conducted across 227 centres, but issues were reported at 12 locations, including one major disruption in Gurugram. He explained that outdated devices and technical failures at the last moment had forced the Commission to drop that centre, and assured that new centres in Delhi-NCR would be allotted within 10 days, with particular reference to the MM centre in Gurugram.The Chairman further mentioned that in Jammu, only minor technical problems were observed. He indicated that the addition of new features in the examination process sometimes resulted in such errors. However, since the majority of centres functioned smoothly, he suggested that the responsibility for disruptions lay with local managements that relied on outdated networks, switches, and systems.On the subject of cancellation notices, he clarified that only the Staff Selection Commission has the authority to announce cancellations, not individual centres. He emphasised that the Commission remained committed to ensuring the fair conduct of examinations and addressing lapses caused by mismanagement at the local level.This year’s cancellation adds to concerns already raised over the Commission’s examination management. During the Selection Post Phase 13 recruitment test held between July 24 and August 1, 2025, candidates had faced abrupt cancellations, software crashes, biometric verification failures, and incorrect exam centre allotments. Thousands of students and educators had staged protests at Jantar Mantar and the CGO Complex in Delhi, demanding accountability, vendor reviews, and independent inquiry into repeated lapses.SSC is a central government recruitment body functioning under the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT). It conducts nationwide competitive examinations to recruit for Group B (non-gazetted) and Group C (non-technical) posts across ministries, departments, and government organisations. Each year, millions of aspirants appear for SSC examinations, with the CGL being one of the most competitive and sought-after routes to government service in India.(with inputs from PTI)","The Staff Selection Commission (SSC) Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Examination 2025 Tier-I, scheduled for September 12, was disrupted.

Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of US President Donald Trump, was fatally shot Thursday while speaking at Utah Valley University.As law enforcement continues its manhunt for the suspect, an odd development has added to the confusion: Screenshots circulating online show a book titled “The Shooting of Charlie Kirk: A Comprehensive Account of the Utah Valley University Attack, the Aftermath, and America’s Response,” credited to an author named Anastasia J Casey.According to the screenshots, the listed publication date was September 9—one day before the shooting.

As India prepare to face Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 match at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 14, controversy surrounds the fixture. While some oppose India playing against Pakistan due to terrorism concerns, IPL team Punjab Kings took a unique stance by not mentioning Pakistan in their match announcement on social media. A plea for urgent hearing into cancellation of the match was also denied by the Supreme Court.The Punjab Kings' social media post about India's upcoming match deliberately avoided naming Pakistan as the opponent. This move sparked such intense reactions that the franchise had to disable comments on their X social media channel.The Supreme Court petition highlighted serious concerns about India-Pakistan cricket relations. The petitioners argued that playing cricket with Pakistan sends the wrong message, especially after recent terror attacks like Phalangam and Operation Sindoor where Indian soldiers lost their lives.The plea specifically stated: ""Cricket between nations is meant to show harmony and friendship. But after the Phalagam terror attack and Operation Sindoor, when our people died and our soldiers risked everything, playing with Pakistan sent the opposite message that while our soldiers sacrificed their lives, we are celebrating sports with the same country sheltering terrorists.""The petitioners expressed worry about hurting the sentiments of terror victims' families.They emphasised that national dignity and citizen security should take priority over entertainment. The petition claimed that such cricket matches could negatively impact the morale of armed forces and the nation.India-Pakistan cricket matches traditionally generate massive interest, not just for the sporting rivalry but also due to the complex political relationship between the two nations. The upcoming Dubai clash continues to spark debate about sports and politics in the sub-continent.India and Pakistan have both started their Asia Cup campaigns with wins. Both the sub-continent giants registered commanding wins, against UAE and Oman, respectively.

Shiv Sena (UBT) condemns the match, plans protest



BJP defends India’s participation



Political jabs between Maharashtra leaders



Congress terms the match a business, questions government morality



BJP, state leaders support team India



NEW DELHI: The upcoming India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 is sparking political fireworks almost as fiercely as it promises to on the cricket field. Ahead of the high-stakes match, Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress leaders have raised strong objections, labelling the fixture “shameless” and profit-driven, while BJP and allied state leaders have thrown their weight behind the Indian team, calling it a matter of national pride and ""compulsion to multilateral matches.""The criticism stems from India’s recent anti-terror operations against terrorists in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor, which the government said has been put on pause.The already-strained India-Pakistan relations dropped several notches lower after the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam's Baisaran meadow that claimed 26 civilian lives. In retaliation, India launched cross-border strikes deep inside Pakistan and PoJK, targeting terror hotbeds in Pakistan's Bahawalpur and Muridke.Shiv Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray questioned the morality of holding the match, saying, ""... Our Prime Minister said blood and water cannot flow together, then how can blood and cricket flow together. How can war and cricket be at the same time?... They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match...Tomorrow, Shiv Sena (UBT) women workers will come out on the streets in Maharashtra and they are going to send sindoor from every house to PM Modi. ..""Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut also criticised the decision, stating, ""...We will protest against this India-Pakistan cricket match. Women will come on the streets and our campaign is 'Sindoor Raksha Abhiyan'...You said that water and blood will not flow together. If water and blood will not flow together, then how will blood and cricket work together?...This is treason, shamelessness.""Raut further referred to ongoing grievances from past events, saying, ""Operation Sindoor has not ended yet, it is still going on. The sindoor of our 26 women was wiped off in Pahalgam. Their pain, grief, and anger have not ended. Even today, they are in shock. And you people are going to play cricket with Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. This is shamelessness, this is treason. My question is to the BJP, not to the government. My question is to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, RSS, Bajrang Dal. Do you have any role in this or not?...""BJP MP and former BCCI president Anurag Thakur explained, “In a multilateral tournament organised by the ACC or ICC, we have to play as it is compulsory for all countries. If we do not take part, we will be eliminated from the tournament as the opposition will get the points. But we do not play bilateral tournaments with Pakistan, and we will not play with them until they stop hurting us with the terrorism that flourishes there. ”Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane took a dig at Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray, mocking him for planning to attend the match, saying, ""Aaditya Thackeray will go silently to attend the match (upcoming India vs Pakistan match in Asia Cup 2025), wearing a burqa. His voice will also help him in this. After wearing a burqa, if he speaks in a woman's voice, people will believe him... No one would recognise that he is Aaditya Thackeray. ..""Rane also criticised Uddhav Thackeray, asking, ""Does Saamana or Uddhav Thackeray have the moral right to comment on the India-Pakistan match? During a rally of one of Uddhav Thackeray's MPs, slogans of 'Pakistan Zindabad' were raised, green flags were waved, green gulal was thrown, and slogans like 'sar tan se juda' were chanted. So, why didn't they express anger towards Pakistan then?""Congress MP Imraan Masood joined the criticism, framing the match as profit-driven: ""This is a business... The rights to broadcast it are sold at very high prices... They don't care about the fact that it's only been a few days since our sisters' 'sindoor' has been wiped off... This is not the first time; earlier, we did not send our hockey team either. They should not try to tell the rules... Those who wiped the 'sindoor' of our sisters, and you are going to play a match with them. You should be ashamed, and the government should also be ashamed that they do not have enough morality left in them that earlier they were saying that blood and water will not flow together, and now you are making them play cricket together.""In contrast, Haryana Sports minister Gaurav Gautam wished the Indian team success, saying, ""India has given a befitting reply to Pakistan on every front. I think India will emerge victorious here as well. Best wishes to our Indian players.""","The upcoming India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 is sparking political fireworks almost as fiercely as it promises to on the cricket field.

Envoy Drops Bombshell | Watch

NEW DELHI: Chinese Embassy officials of interfering directly in the local affairs of South Asian countries, particularly in Nepal, former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay claimed, and also warned India to be vigilant about its dealings with Beijing.In an conversation at ANI podcast, Sangay voiced concern over China’s “expansionist” policies and its efforts to “checkmate” India’s influence in the region.Asked whether India, like some Southeast Asian nations, avoids the Tibet issue to preserve ties with Beijing, Sangay replied that he did not believe India followed that approach, but stressed that “China is systematically working” to curb New Delhi’s reach.""India has a bigger stake with China,"" Sangay said. ""Just look at not just Tibet, not just the border area. Look at all the neighbouring countries. In Southeast Asia or Central Asia, wherever India wants to have its influence or relationship, China is always there to checkmate.""Using Nepal as an example, he alleged that Chinese officials had become “the most powerful” players in Kathmandu, “perhaps more powerful than the Indian or American embassies.”He said similar patterns of interference were visible in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. “They come and interfere and influence. I don’t want to say they control you, but they come inside your own house,” he said.""And the larger point that you raised about, you know, in Asia, how many people will take up the issue of Tibet because they don't want to have conflict with China, which is a fact on the one hand. On the other hand, what we say is that what happened to Tibet will happen to you. So if you don't understand and study Tibet, it will happen to you,"" he added.He pointed to Nepal as a clear example of Chinese political overreach. ""Let's say Nepal -- they didn't believe so, right? Now, yes, the Chinese embassy and the officials are interfering in local issues,"" he said. ""The Chinese Embassy, perhaps, some of my friends say, is the most powerful in Kathmandu -- more powerful than the Indian Embassy or American Embassy. Some say that.""He highlighted China's full physical control over Tibet and its current approach in other countries. ""The difference is the physical control of Tibet,"" Sangay said. ""Other than that, political influence of the Chinese government -- and through the embassies -- in all these neighbouring countries and all these Asian countries is a fact.""He also framed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Tibet as strategic signals aimed at India, noting the region’s shared border and China’s large military deployment there. While transcripts of Xi’s latest speech to troops were not released—coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Beijing—Sangay said he was “sure” it echoed previous calls to “prepare for war or incursion” against India.Reflecting on his own experience, Sangay described how Tibetans had found a temporary home in India after fleeing their homeland. “As a Buddhist, we believe in impermanence. Once you lose your country, you’re nomadic,” he said, adding that India became “our home” after Tibetans fled. Although he now lives in the United States, he said he feels an enduring cultural bond with India: “As soon as I come out of Indira Gandhi Airport, when you smell the Delhi air… for your mind, it’s just calming. ”He stressed that ties between Tibetans and Indians remain strong. “Whenever I meet Indians, I immediately say Namaskar… immediately, you become friends.”Sangay also recalled how, during his tenure from 2011 to 2021, Chinese pressure often accompanied periods of India–China rapprochement. He cited the 2018 “Thank You India” event planned by the Tibetan administration, which was scaled back after India reportedly advised officials to avoid participation in the midst of efforts to ease tensions with Beijing.Despite such episodes, Sangay emphasised India’s consistent support. ""No matter which party or which person becomes Prime Minister, India has always treated Tibetans well. We cannot think of any better host for Tibetans,"" he said, adding that the preservation of Tibetan identity, education, and religious institutions has been possible due to India's support.","Former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay spoke to ANI podcast.

PM Modi Appeals For Peace And Unity In His Speech During First Visit To Manipur Since 2023 Violence

What is the ‘PM Neem corridor’



NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on Sunday, a special 2.6-km corridor lined with Neem saplings has been prepared in Numaligarh, Assam’s Golaghat district.PM Modi will pass through the ‘PM Neem Corridor’ on his way to the Numaligarh Refinery , where he is scheduled to inaugurate a bamboo-based ethanol plant worth over Rs 5,000 crore.“On September 14, as the Hon'ble Prime Minister makes his way to the venue in Golaghat, he will be welcomed through the PM Neem Corridor - a 2.6km corridor planted with neem saplings,” Assam’s chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, said through a post on X.“A Green Tribute to India's biggest green warrior - Adarniya @narendramodi ji,” he added.During his visit, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for the Petro Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit, which is designed to produce 360 KTPA of propylene.Later on Sunday, he is scheduled to address a public rally at the Numaligarh Tanker Stand, marking the second day of his two-day visit to Assam.A “Neem Corridor” has been created by planting around 700 neem trees along both sides of a newly constructed 2-km road stretching from Letekujan, where a helipad has been built for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to the event venue near Numaligarh Refinery Limited in Golaghat district.The initiative, led by Khumtai MLA Mrinal Saikia, saw the chief minister also plant a seed during his visit last week to review preparations for the PM’s visit.Saikia, who has taken personal responsibility for nurturing the plants until they mature, said neem was chosen for its natural air-purifying properties and environmental benefits. “Neem improves air quality by removing toxins and offers a host of health, agricultural, and ecological advantages,” he said.“To honour the PM, who deeply values nature and greenery, I decided to plant neem trees along the entire 2-km stretch from the helipad to the venue,” Saikia added. He also mentioned that neem trees help stabilise soil and act as mosquito repellents, reducing disease risks. “Neem is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine, often referred to as nature’s pharmacy. Every part of the tree — leaves, bark, seeds, roots — is used in home remedies and contributes to overall health and hygiene,” he said.Modi’s visit to the state, originally planned for September 8, was rescheduled to September 13 due to the vice-presidential elections.PM Modi arrived in Guwahati on Saturday for a two-day visit to Assam, during which he will attend a special tribute to legendary singer Bhupen Hazarika, officials said, as cited by PTI.On Sunday, he is scheduled to inaugurate and lay the foundation stones for projects totaling over Rs 19,000 crore.","PM Modi will pass through the ‘PM Neem Corridor’ on his way to the Numaligarh Refinery.

Thus, it is directed that this judgment shall be made part 15 of the resume of respondent no.1, compliance of which shall be strictly ensured by him personally,"" the court also said in a ruling.","The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the sexual harassment complaint filed by a faculty member of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) against the Vice-Chancellor.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area.

Stanford Meets India: Notes from a Country in Motion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stanford-meets-india-notes-from-a-country-in-motion/articleshow/123822979.cms,"The trip's postcard moment

daulat ki chaat

India 1: the top 100 million, global in outlook, on Netflix and credit cards.

India 2: the aspiring middle, mobile-first, leapfrogging basic infrastructure.

India 3: rural, cash-driven, still outside the formal economy.

.

On the first morning in Delhi, the jet lag sat heavy in the lobby of Shangri-La. Stanford MBAs were trying their best to be awake, sipping tea beneath chandeliers, eyes still foggy from the 16-hour flight. There were seventeen first-years (or “MBA1s”), four second-years (MBA2s), plus their professor, Yossi Feinberg, and staff advisor Ming Chu. All came to India for the Global Study Trip, a Stanford Business School tradition in which students visit countries and immerse themselves in its business fabric.The objective this time was growth and innovation in India, something that sounded clean on paper, the sort of thing you’d write on a syllabus. In reality, though, India is a place that resists syllabi. The country offers you contradictions in every direction: QR codes on street-side coconut stalls, ministers talking about Mars missions, Bollywood stars who double as entrepreneurs, investors who cite the Ramayana to define leadership. For the students, the week would be less about learning what India “is” and more about getting comfortable with the fact that it can be many things at once.The first to meet them was Gaurav Dalmia, investor, essayist, philosopher. He greeted the group in his home and reached backward in time. India, he said, had been prosperous for most of history, before the West discovered more efficient ways to organize capital and trade. Its resurgence now would not look like China’s rocket-fuel sprint. “India compounds,” he told them. “Six to seven percent a year. It feels slow, boring even. But compounding has its own magic.”The students were inspired, though still recovering from the jet lag. They had read about India’s GDP figures before, but Dalmia’s framing was different. Not hockey sticks but patience. And then he opened a copy of the Ramayana and read aloud the qualities of an ideal leader: grateful, truthful, versatile, patient, slow to anger, free of envy, yet terrifying when provoked. A few students looked up, surprised. Was this an epic poem or a CEO job description? Dalmia smiled. “Indian philosophy is not abstract,” he said. “It is applied leadership.”The group left buzzing, trying to reconcile what they’d heard with the India outside the windows, with horns blaring, construction cranes looming, roadside tea vendors serving to crowds that never seemed to thin.The evening brought Puneet Dalmia of Dalmia Bharat, whose cement plants have built many of the highways the students drove on. He spoke of India’s four “I’s”: Intent, Ideas, Independence, Individuals. Intent is what the state must set; ideas are the spark of entrepreneurs; independence is the freedom to act without capture; and individuals (the people) are the multiplier.But he also quoted from ancient texts and Harvard research, toggling between scriptures and slides. Happiness, he said, cannot be measured only in stock prices or steel output. “We are building not just an economy,” he said, “but a society. Growth must be judged by its impact on human dignity.”It was early in the trip, but already the students noticed a pattern: Indian business leaders often spoke in two registers, one of GDP, capital markets, and tech; another of values, philosophy, and family. In Silicon Valley, that combination might sound like posturing. Here, it felt woven into the operating system.The evening was unlike anything the students had experienced. Thanks to Dalmia, Indian Accent, normally tucked away in a sleek Delhi hotel, had been transported inside the Red Fort. Servers carried outunder Mughal arches, blue cheese naan in the shadow of ramparts where emperors once surveyed their kingdom. It was haute cuisine against a backdrop of empire. When the plates were cleared, the courtyard darkened, and the sandstone walls came alive with the sound-and-light show: Shah Jahan commissioning the fort, the British seizing it, Nehru’s voice declaring independence in 1947.The next day, Sanjeev Bikhchandani sat down with the delegation and told his story about building Naukri. During MBA placement season, Bikhchandani noticed: “Talent is scarce, and markets don’t lie.” He began photographing public placement records and selling the data as a survey. That instinct (observe behavior, package insight) became Naukri.com, India’s first big internet success.His lessons amazed the delegation with unusual force: ‘Clunky but dense’ beats ‘slick but sparse’. Customer insight beats capital. In downturns, when others cut, spend more. “Be frugal in bubbles, bold in busts,” he told them.Agra was the trip’s postcard moment. The buses pulled up at 10AM, and suddenly the Taj Mahal was no longer a photograph in a textbook but a living presence. Students wandered its marble terraces in awe, tracing inlay work with their fingers, staring at the perfect symmetry that somehow still felt human. Some tried to capture it on their phones, only to realize no lens could hold the shimmer of white stone against a pale morning sky.Later, the group regrouped for lunch at the Oberoi Amarvilas, where every dining-room window frames the monument like a painting. Between courses, heads kept drifting toward the view, as if the Taj were a third guest at the table. By afternoon, India reminded them of its unpredictability: a sudden downpour sent the delegation running into a makeshift roadside restaurant, plastic chairs and steaming chai serving as impromptu refuge. When the rain eased, they climbed back into their buses, damp but elated. It was the kind of day that felt both choreographed and accidental: iconic grandeur, sudden chaos, and the luck of experiencing both in a single sweep.In Mumbai, they met Manish Kejriwal, private equity veteran at Kedaara. Unlike the spreadsheets they were used to at Stanford, Kejriwal described investing as anthropology. Triangulate character, not just numbers. Build dissent into your firm so the junior analyst feels safe disagreeing with the partner. “We have an obligation to dissent,” he said.He spoke of India not as one market but as a mosaic of states, families, informal networks. His preference was for shovels over gold mines: workflow software and data services.At The Times of India offices, Sivakumar Sundaram and his colleagues put together an insightful session using interactive polls and a live thinking session. “There isn’t one India,” Sundaram said. “There are three.”The categories weren’t neat, but he explained the country better than a GDP figure.Later, Cyril Shroff, India’s most famous corporate lawyer, met the students in his Peninsula Towers office. His firm, once boutique, now has sixty percent women. He spoke of India’s legal system as both bottleneck and backbone: slow courts, yes, but a structure that undergirds growth.More striking was his framing of India’s independence. The country, he said, had moved from importing regulation to exporting it: Aadhaar as a model for digital identity, UPI for payments. “A lawyer won’t be replaced by AI, but by an AI-enabled lawyer.” In Silicon Valley, AI was usually pitched as disruption. Here, it was augmentation.Kunal Shah’s talk moved the group. The founder of CRED spoke less like a startup CEO and more like a philosopher. “India is a low-trust market,” he said. “That’s why super-apps make sense here. That’s why if you don’t buy a billboard, you don’t exist.”He shared some specific, unique facts: 37 GB of mobile data per Indian per month, but only 20M consumers drive 80% of online GMV. YouTube earns just $3 per Indian user annually. “India is the world’s largest MAU farm,” he said, “but not the world’s best ARPU market.”He spoke of status as the true currency: uniforms over paychecks, weddings as theater, caste layered into speech. “You can underpay people if you give them status,” he joked. He warned that subsidies dull ambition, that ambition comes from hunger, and that AI risks making people mentally lazy. “The tool that makes you atrophy is also the gym,” he said, cryptically. Many loved his candor but no one forgot it.An interesting setting came with Piyush Goyal, India’s Minister of Commerce. In a wood-paneled room, he began by congratulating Stanford, after which he pivoted to geopolitics.India, he said, has a habit of turning crises into opportunities. Buying discounted Russian oil when the West sanctioned it. Launching a Mars mission for $50M. Remaining “multi-aligned” instead of non-aligned: friends with Washington, Moscow, and Tel Aviv all at once.On AI, he said that “the human mind will remain supreme.” On trade, he was clear that every country makes its choices. On culture, he urged students to witness Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai. “Religion here binds people, creates mass fervor, unites the country,” he said.Not all sessions were with businessfolk and ministers. At a nonprofit panel hosted by Melody Mortazavi and Sanjiv Kaura, the students heard from Melody, Sanjiv, the alumni of Teach India, and more changemakers. One of the alumni had gone from Domino’s store manager to retail executive. Another described education as emancipation.For many in the delegation, these stories carried as much weight as the macroeconomics. They put faces to the abstractions of “India 2” and “India 3.”Through it all, Yossi played the role of quiet provocateur. On buses and over breakfasts, he asked questions that unsettled neat conclusions. If India has the cheapest data in the world, why does it have one of the lowest female labor participation rates? If it can build UPI for street vendors, why are courts so slow? If it can send a probe to Mars, why do so few Indians have access to credit?By the end, the trip felt less like a syllabus and more like a kaleidoscope. From Dalmia’s compounding to Bikhchandani’s salary surveys, from Shroff’s AI lawyers to Shah’s philosophy of status, from Goyal’s geopolitics to Teach India’s alumni, the delegation had been shown many Indias.On the final evening, standing on the balcony in Malabar Hill, the students looked out over the city as drums from Ganesh processions echoed through the streets. Someone remarked, “We came looking for lessons in growth. What we found were lessons in resilience, trust, and contradictions.”The reflections were about how the trip itself felt. “We’ve been treated like family everywhere we’ve gone,” said David Pantera, marveling at the warmth of the hospitality. Katy Dolan wrote to the student leaders that the week had “vastly exceeded expectations,” plus a reminder that a trip that had looked seamless to participants had in fact been an intense labor of love from the four MBA2s who led with grace and humor. And for Cayla Davis, the experience “exceeded her wildest imagination,” not just for the meetings and sights but for the thoughtfulness and care woven into the group dynamic.India, folks realized, is not a case study. It is a billion-person startup, a civilization in beta, a place where compounding is destiny and paradox the default mode.And for Stanford’s delegation, that was the real education.","The Global Study Trip is a Stanford Business School tradition in which students visit countries and immerse themselves in its business fabric. The objective this time was growth and innovation in India. The country offers you contradictions in every direction: QR codes on street-side coconut stalls, ministers talking about Mars missions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123866247,imgsize-94132,width-400,resizemode-4/the-trip39s-postcard-moment.jpg"

New Delhi: Haven't you noticed the many long-route luxury buses with AR and NL registration numbers? Private bus operators often register them in smaller states like Arunachal Pradesh (AR) and Nagaland (NL) under the All India Tourist Permit (AITP) scheme, where taxes are lower.To curb this practice, gov plans to make it mandatory for all AITP buses to make at least one trip every 45 days to the state where they are registered.In a draft notification introducing major reforms to AITP Rules, the road transport ministry has proposed stricter registration norms and a requirement for operators to clear pending highway tolls within 30 days for permit renewal.State transport authorities must verify operators' documents to ensure such operators have a residence or place of business in the state where the tourist vehicle is registered,"" according to the draft.The proposal also specifies that each tourist vehicle must either begin or end its journey in its home state and cannot remain outside for more than 45 days. All such vehicles must have active Vehicle Location Tracking devices, with movements monitored by respective states. ""This is essential to ensure they visit their home state as per norms,"" an official said.The scale of the issue is evident. In Arunachal Pradesh, nearly 5,100 of its 10,200 registered buses have AITP.Nagaland counts about 3,100 AITP buses among its total 6,700.Industry insiders say high concentration of AITP buses in these smaller states highlights the loophole. ""Such operators create unfair competition for those registering in bigger states where taxes are higher. They strain infrastructure in states where they operate without contributing proportionate taxes,"" said one.","Private bus operators often register them in smaller states like Arunachal Pradesh (AR) and Nagaland (NL) under the All India Tourist Permit (AITP) scheme.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM supremo and MP Asaduddin Owaisi launched a sharp attack on the BJP over India’s upcoming Asia Cup cricket clash with Pakistan, questioning why the government allowed the match despite the recent Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack . He demanded clarity on whether the monetary gains from the game outweighed the loss of human lives.""My question to the chief minister of Assam, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, and all of them is that you don't have the power to refuse to play a cricket match against Pakistan, which asked for the religion of our 26 citizens in Pahalgam and shot them..."" Owaisi said, speaking to the media.The AIMIM leader also asked whether the BJP considered the revenue from the match more valuable than the lives lost in the attack.""We ask the Prime Minister, when you said that blood and water cannot flow together, dialogue and terrorism cannot happen together, then how much money will the BCCI get from one cricket match, Rs 2000 crore, Rs 3000 crore? Is the value of money more than the lives of our 26 citizens? This is what the BJP should tell... We stood with those 26 citizens yesterday as well, we stand with them today, and we will stand with them tomorrow as well..."" he said.Owaisi, who was part of the delegation formed for Operation Sindoor ’s global outreach despite being a prominent opposition figure, said the government’s stand was inconsistent.The anger over India facing Pakistan in the tournament has been fuelled by the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 tourists were killed by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. Calls have grown for boycotting the match against Pakistan.Earlier, Congress leader Abhishek Dutt had also criticised the decision to go ahead with the game, saying it contradicted the government’s stated policy of “no talks with terror.”""On one hand, you talk about Operation Sindoor, you say no talks with terror, no trade with terror.

'She sold her TV to make a film': How a Purulia girl became Venice winner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/she-sold-her-tv-to-make-a-film-how-a-purulia-girl-became-venice-winner/articleshow/123877149.cms,"When filmmaker Anuparna Roy was a child, she listened wide-eyed as her grandmother spoke dreamily of a river. Her maternal grandmother, married at nine to a man in his 30s in Purulia district of West Bengal, often told her stories about the river's pure, beautiful water. ""I always thought she must have seen this river, but after she died, I came to know that she actually never did. Only her dead body was taken to a riverbank,"" says Roy, 31, on a Zoom call from Mumbai, two days after she returned - triumphant and tired - from the 82nd Venice Film Festival. There, she became the first Indian to win the Best Director Award in the Orizzonti (Horizons) section, joining a prestigious list of acclaimed auteurs.Those stories shaped Roy's 2023 debut short film 'Run to the River', which is based on her grandmother's life in British-era Bengal. ""The protagonist is a Dalit girl married to a revolutionary freedom fighter. But even though he was fighting for his country's freedom, he failed to provide freedom to his wife,"" she says. This weaving of family memory with larger social and political contradictions defines Roy's cinema.Her Venice win came with her debut feature 'Songs of Forgotten Trees' (SOFT), which follows two migrant women in Mumbai - a part-time sex worker and a call-center employee - who begin as strangers sharing a room, but slowly forge a quiet kinship.Born to a coal-sector worker and a homemaker, Roy is now celebrated as a grassroots-to-grandeur story, rising from a Purulia village to an internationally recognised filmmaker. Without film school training, she juggled IT and call centre jobs to fund her films. Yet she is wary of the ""struggle"" narrative. ""I was doing jobs to support myself and my family. To talk about liberation in my films, I first had to liberate myself economically,"" she says. Her remote IT job even helped during the shoot of SOFT: ""It was work from home. I would log in and then go off to shoot. I even received a message from my ex-manager saying he was proud of me. It was generous of him not to mention the kind of activities I used to do while 'working.' I was pathetic at that job!"" she laughs.Roy's work is driven by memories of survival and discrimination in rural India. Her latest film references a childhood friend, Jhuma Nath, whom her father forbade her to meet because she was Dalit. Married at 13, Jhuma left a deep impression on Roy. Other moments of gender bias also stayed with her - from girls being given rice in school when boys got books, to being told to cover her nose while passing a tribal village. Her grandmother's story also inspired the female kinship angle in SOFT. ""My grandmother, when she entered her marital home at nine, had a stepdaughter of the same age. The two bonded well, and after my grandfather died, these two women ran the family together. One earned, the other cooked and cared for four daughters. I began to imagine why they couldn't also fall in love with each other. That idea became the foundation of the film,"" Roy explains.Literature was her early training ground: James Joyce and Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay influenced her while she studied English (Hons) in Asansol. Her 21-year-old cousin Adrija, who took up the same subject because of her 'dear didi' recalls, ""She struggled so much, sold her belongings, exhausted all her energy and money. She even sold her TV while making her short film."" Producer Bibhanshu Rai describes her as ""stubborn and persistent,"" crediting her resourcefulness in bringing SOFT to completion.Roy is part of the new wave of Indian cinema centering women's agency and sisterhood, alongside names like Payal Kapadia. ""My next project will return to my grandmother's story, where the freedom struggle plays out alongside the bond between my grandmother and her stepdaughter,"" she says.As for advice to young, independent filmmakers from small towns, she offers a note of encouragement: ""Those who are writing a script and are not able to finish it, or not able to find a producer, they are already filmmakers for me. They're trying to make something, and I know they will because they'll always find a way.""",Anuparna Roy is the first Indian to win the Best Director Award at the Venice Film Festival.

NEW DELHI: Delhi govt is preparing to move National Green Tribunal seeking permission to dredge the Yamuna riverbed in the city. The decision has been taken as Delhi has faced urban flooding repeatedly and the Yamuna's water-carrying capacity has shrunk here.Minister Parvesh Verma said the proposal was aimed at reviving the river's natural flow, easing pressure on regulator drains and enhancing flood resilience of low-lying neighbourhoods along its banks.Dredging involves excavation of accumulated silt, sludge and solid waste from a waterbody. This is usually avoided in a river for concerns related to damaging the ecosystem and disturbing its banks.""Currently, the dredging of the Yamuna is prohibited. We are planning to approach NGT for approval. We are building our case with documentation regarding the need and commitment to follow all environmental norms. Once permission is granted, a detailed project report will be prepared. This will directly increase the carrying capacity of the river,"" said Verma.The urgency of the proposal comes against the backdrop of this year's flooding that pushed up the water level and triggered backflow into the city's drainage channels.Several residential colonies near the floodplain, including those adjoining regulator drains, bore the brunt. Experts have often linked the crisis to the Yamuna's reduced depth, aggravated by unchecked siltation and untreated sewage inflows.The river's Delhi stretch is about 22km between Wazirabad and Okhla. Officials acknowledge that the ecological degradation of this critical stretch has complicated not just flood management but also the city's drinking water supply.Parallel to the dredging proposal, Delhi Jal Board has been working on desilting projects to augment the raw water storage capacity. A plan to clean up the Wazirabad pond, which supplies water to one of the city's largest treatment plants, had to be deferred due to the monsoon. The Wazirabad water treatment plant produces 138MGD, making it a crucial lifeline for the city.Officials believe that clearing the pond and dredging the Yamuna can together double the river's current water-holding capacity. This could help mitigate flooding, improve raw water availability and ease stress on downstream regulators, they added.","Dredging involves excavation of accumulated silt, sludge and solid waste from a waterbody.

This court has time and again emphasised that liberal condonation of delay on behalf of the state, merely on the ground that refusal might cause the dismissal of a potentially meritorious matter, is a misplaced proposition.Public interest is not synonymous with the cause of the govt; it is, instead, synonymous with the enforcement of rule of law, certainty in legal rights, and an administrative machinery that functions with diligence and accountability"".""It must, therefore, be underscored that the guiding principle is not the protection of governmental indifference but the promotion of responsible governance. The state is under a higher duty to act in time, for in every matter it litigates, it does so not in its private capacity but as the trustee of the people's interest. Hence, repeated indulgence in condoning delays on grounds of bureaucratic inefficiency would amount to eroding the very object of limitation statutes, which are enacted in every civilised jurisdiction for the sake of finality, certainty, and public order,"" the bench said.The litigation in the case between the board and a private person over a piece of land started 36 years ago in 1989.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over ""planned"" deadlocks in the House, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Saturday underscored the need for comprehensive dialogue among all political parties and elected representatives.The Speaker also urged the media to give prominence to viewpoints of elected representatives engaged in ""factual and substantive"" discussions, so that there can be ""healthy competition for constructive dialogue"" among members.Birla was speaking at the Valedictory Session of the 11th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) India Region Conference, hosted by Karnataka Legislature in Bengaluru. He said the aim of such conferences is to ensure legislatures can function without ""planned deadlocks"" in future.Mooting setting up of a National Legislative Index to rank state assemblies and councils on their performance, Birla told reporters on the sidelines of the event, ""We will take a view on National Legislative Index at the meeting of presiding officers at Lucknow in Jan next year.""He said performance of state assemblies could be assessed on the basis of parameters such as number of sittings held every year, productivity of the House, quality of debates, adoption of technology, and efficacy of various committees.The three-day conference concluded with the valedictory speech by Karnataka governor Thawarchand Gehlot. As president of CPA India Region, Birla stressed that rather than halting proceedings based on ideological or political differences, legislators must resolve to keep the House functioning.He described India's democracy and its Constitution as a ""guiding light"" for the world in the current global context. ""India's ancient democratic traditions continue to inspire and guide the legislative system in the country,"" he noted.Reaffirming Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to building 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, he called on the presiding officers of all state legislatures to ensure the goal came to fruition through positive and people-centric discussions. He emphasised the need to increase duration of debates and number of sittings during legislative sessions.During the conference, four resolutions were adopted - to eliminate deadlocks and disruptions inside the Houses to increase public trust in democratic institutions, strengthen research and reference branches of state legislative institutions with collaboration of Parliament, ensure greater use of digital technologies in legislative institutions, and increase participation of youth and women in democratic institutions.","Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla underscored the need for comprehensive dialogue among all political parties and elected representatives.

Anti-terror techs set to be Quad priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-terror-techs-set-to-be-quad-priority/articleshow/123874937.cms,"NEW DELHI: Unfazed by uncertainty hanging over the proposed summit in November, Quad cooperation at ground level remains intact with the focus this month on counterterrorism workshops.These will include a technical exchange on misuse of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) drones by terrorists and a seminar on preventing terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technologies, including for terror-financing. India has taken note of US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor's remarks during his confirmation hearing that President Donald Trump remains committed to a meeting of Quad leaders and to strengthen the strategic grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US that acts as a bulwark against threats to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Trump's efforts to mend ties with China, including through a landmark trade deal under discussion, have been seen as possible impediments in Quad's progress even though the foreign ministers have met twice since Trump returned to the White House.The technical exchange on misuse of drones will be conducted by the National Security Guard (NSG) on Sept 23-24 at the NSG Garrison in Manesar. ""The exercise will focus on identification of evolving UAS, framework for international cooperation by sharing best practices, subject matter expert exchange and refined national level policies for countering terrorist use of UAS or drones,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.It's important for India that counterterrorism remains a priority for Quad, as evident from its strong condemnation of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack in the foreign ministers' meeting in Washington in July. While India would have liked a swifter response in the days that followed the attack but the fact that the condemnation eventually came in the strongest possible terms and called for the ""perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay"" was significant for India.The Quad seminar on terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technology will be hosted by the NIA on Sept 26. It will address, according to official sources, emerging threat from terrorists by exploitation of new emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, deepfake technologies, encrypted chat platform and metaverse. ""It aims to strengthen countermeasures against these threats, collaboration among Quad members through intelligence sharing, capacity building and engaging institutions and research organisations to develop safeguard against misuse by terrorists,"" the source said.Looking to boost India-Pacific security and prosperity, Quad will also formally launch its Ports of the Future Partnership next month with India hosting a transportation and logistics conference in Mumbai. According to a White House factsheet, the initiative will complement the work Quad partners have done to boost infrastructure expertise across the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships Program. While basic Quad cooperation continues, bilateral defence collaboration with the US seems to have escaped unscathed from the downturn in India-US ties.","Unfazed by uncertainty hanging over the proposed summit in November, Quad cooperation at ground level remains intact.

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah has expressed concern over the vanishing hangul, a critically endangered subspecies of Central Asian red deer, also known as the Kashmir stag, which is endemic to the Kashmir region. He fears they may go extinct.“I don’t want a situation tomorrow where our children and grandchildren know these species only through photographs in books, like the dodo or woolly mammoth,” the CM said at the 2nd International Conference on Hangul at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture and Science here on Friday. “That would be a tragedy we must not allow,” he said.Omar said that despite living close to Dachigam National Park, he had never seen a hangul. “But at least in my lifetime I know they are there,” he said. The hangul is now largely confined to Dachigam National Park in Srinagar’s Harwan area. Their population had shrunk to just 127 in 2008. However, the hangul census of 2023 showed their population rising to 289. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the species as critically endangered.The CM said his government would act promptly on the recommendations of the Second International Conference on Hangul protection.“My hope is that when we meet here next time, the population of hangul and markhor (a wild goat species) will have grown significantly,” Omar said.The three-day event at the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture and Science was attended by more than 200 delegates, including eminent wildlife experts, conservationists, and biologists from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia, who shared research and strategies for conserving the hangul, markhor and other threatened ungulates of the Himalayan region.","The hangul is a subspecies of Central Asian red deer, also known as the Kashmir stag.

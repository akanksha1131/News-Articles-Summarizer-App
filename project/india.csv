NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday recalled its response to Pakistan’s pre-emptive air strikes of December 3, 1971 — attacks that triggered a 14-day war ending in a decisive Indian victory and the creation of Bangladesh.""Following Pakistan's pre-emptive strike on 03 Dec 1971, the IAF responded with precision and fury,"" the IAF posted on X.“Through the night, Canberra crews flew 23 deep-strike missions, hitting enemy airfields at Murid, Mianwali, Sargodha, Chander, Risalewala, Shorkot and Masrur (Karachi).

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday paid tribute to Dr Rajendra Prasad, country's first President, on his 141st birth anniversary. Recalling his central role in the freedom struggle, PM Modi said Dr Prasad’s legacy “continues to inspire generations.”“From being an active participant in India’s freedom struggle, presiding over the Constituent Assembly to becoming our first President, he served our nation with unmatched dignity, dedication and clarity of purpose. His long years in public life were marked by simplicity, courage and devotion to national unity,” PM Modi wrote in his X post, alongside photographs of the former President.Born on December 3, 1884, in Bihar’s Siwan district, Dr Rajendra Prasad was elected India’s first President on January 24, 1950, at a special session of the Constituent Assembly. He was also the President of the Constituent Assembly.A distinguished lawyer who held a Doctorate in Law, he left his legal career in 1921 after being influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and joined the national movement. He played key roles in the Non-Cooperation Movement and Salt Satyagraha.After Independence, Dr Prasad served as President for 12 years until 1962, the longest tenure for any occupant of the office. He was later awarded the Bharat Ratna.He spent his final years at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna before passing away on February 28, 1963.His writings include his autobiography Atmakatha (1946) and works such as Satyagraha at Champaran (1922), India Divided (1946), Mahatma Gandhi and Bihar, Some Reminiscences (1949), and Bapu ke Kadmon Mein (1954), as noted by the government of Bihar.(With inputs from ANI)","PM Narendra Modi paid tribute to Dr Rajendra Prasad on his 141st birth anniversary.

Here's what Rajnath said





NEW DELHI: Congress has rejected Rajnath Singh's claim that ""Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to build Babri Masjid using public funds, and it was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who opposed it"". The grand old party accused the defence minister of propagating a ""lie"", and said they would not let ""the legacy of Nehru or Patel to be distorted by Godse’s followers.""""There is zero archival or documentary evidence to support it. Nehruji explicitly opposed using government money for religious places — including the reconstruction of Temple. He insisted it should be funded through public contributions, not the state,"" Congress MP Manickam Tagore said.Invoking the first prime minister's opposition to the use of public funds for rebuilding the Somnath Temple, Tagore said, ""If Nehruji refused public funds even for Somnath — a symbol revered by millions — why would he propose spending taxpayer money on Babri? The claim collapses under basic logic and historical record.""""Rajnath ji ‘s statements aren’t about history. They’re about politics — rewriting the past to divide the present.The BJP’s strategy is simple: insult our founders, invent stories, fuel polarisation.

Nehru ji raised the question of reconstruction of the Somnath Temple... Sardar clarified that the Somnath Temple case was different; the public had donated Rs. 30 lakh there, a trust had been formed, and not even a single penny of government money was used.""""The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has not been funded by government money. The entire cost has been borne by the people of this country,"" he added.","Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claims Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to build Babri Masjid using public funds.

Defence deals likely to dominate talks



Possible nuclear energy agreement



Discussions on additional S-400 units

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin said that that Moscow aims to ""elevate cooperation"" with India taking its partnership to a ""qualitatively new level,"" establishing substantive dialogue on economic issues.The Russian President's remarks come ahead of his two-day India visit from December 4-5 for the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Speaking at an investment forum in Moscow on Tuesday, Putin said the goal of multiple joint projects across energy, industry, space, agriculture and other sectors, is to elevate ties with India.""We aim to elevate cooperation with the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India to a qualitatively new level by strengthening its technological component. This is the objective of numerous joint projects in energy, industry, space, agriculture, and other sectors,"" Putin said.The Russian President said that Moscow has a ""substantive dialogue"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping on economic issues and hopes to continue the same with PM Modi during his upcoming visit.""We have established a substantive dialogue on economic issues with the President of the People's Republic of China, Mr.Xi Jinping. We will also discuss these topics in detail during the upcoming visit to India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including increasing imports of Indian goods to our market,"" he added.Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said that discussions could include the sale of additional S-400 long-range air defence missiles.""Highly on the agenda and this could be discussed. Our military industry is working pretty well. Russian arms 36 % in Indian armed forces and hopefully will continue,"" Peskov said.He said that Russia also hopes to take forward talks on India potentially acquiring the Su-57 fifth-generation stealth fighter. ""SU-57 is the best plane in the world. SU57 will be on the agenda,"" he added.Peskov highlighted the depth of defence cooperation, including the BrahMos programme. ""As far as our cooperation in the defence industry goes, let's remember famous Brahmos missiles. It's not only just production or it's not only acts of buying or selling, it's exchange of high technologies, and it really paves the way for a bright future in this field of cooperation,"" he said.""We're developing quite, quite a variety of very complicated systems. And in this sense, of course, we have capabilities. We are ready to share this with our Indian friends, our experience,"" he added.Russian Sukhoi-30 jets form the bulk of India’s fighter fleet, and the Su-57 offer is expected to come up in this week’s talks, two officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. However, India has not yet taken a decision on the aircraft, the official added.Peskov further confirmed that there was the possibility of an agreement on Nuclear energy between India and Russia during the visit.""There will be an offer for a small reactor. Russia possesses important tech, small and flexible reactors. Russia has real experience in producing small reactors. We're exchanging mutual investments, joint investments and it makes this kind of cooperation even more valuable for our countries, in terms for securing future of this country,"" Peskov said.""We were deeply involved in creating a sector of peaceful nuclear energy in India, in Kudankulam, and so we were hoping for the continuation of this project,"" he added.India has no plans to scale back defence ties with Russia, even as its crude oil purchases fluctuate. Discussions on additional S-400 units are also likely, defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh indicated last week, according to Reuters.Analysts say recent US–Russia talks on the Ukraine conflict could make it easier for India to deepen engagement with Moscow, though the broader relationship faces strain.""A large part of the trading relationship was based on energy, which is now losing traction under the threat of sanctions from the United States,"" Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation told Reuters. ""And at the end of the day, only defence remains, which continues to bind the two together,"" he added.","Vladimir Putin says Moscow aims to elevate cooperation with India.

NEW DELHI: The Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), which provides healthcare services to lakhs of government employees, pensioners and their families, is operating with a significant shortage of staff across its allopathic and AYUSH dispensaries, the Union Health Ministry informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.In a written reply, the government revealed that more than 2,000 posts in allopathic dispensaries and over 100 posts in AYUSH units remain vacant, raising concerns over service delivery in one of the country’s largest healthcare networks.According to the ministry, CGHS allopathic dispensaries have a sanctioned strength of 6,630 posts, but only 4,590 are currently filled, leaving 2,040 posts vacant. The situation is similar in AYUSH facilities, where 107 of the 425 sanctioned posts remain unfilled. The data shows gaps across all levels of staffing.In the crucial Group A category, which includes doctors, 402 allopathy posts and 33 AYUSH posts are lying vacant. Group B non-gazetted positions also show shortages, with 276 allopathic posts vacant. The most acute gaps are in Group C—the largest workforce segment comprising paramedical and support staff—where 1,362 allopathic posts and 74 AYUSH posts are unfilled.The government said that recruitment of doctors is carried out through the Union Public Service Commission’s Combined Medical Services Examination based on vacancies reported by CGHS. Recruitment for Group B and Group C positions is handled by the Staff Selection Commission. However, the reply did not indicate the timeframe within which the pending vacancies would be filled or whether special measures are being planned to speed up hiring.The disclosure comes at a time when CGHS dispensaries in major cities frequently struggle with long queues, limited manpower and rising patient load. The persistent vacancies, especially in frontline and paramedical roles, are expected to intensify pressure on the system unless addressed promptly. For thousands of beneficiaries dependent on CGHS for essential outpatient care and medicines, staffing shortages continue to translate into longer waits and uneven access to services.","Central Government Health Scheme operating with a significant shortage of staff.

CrPC cover for women can’t be invoked in Fema case: Delhi HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crpc-cover-for-women-cant-be-invoked-in-fema-case-delhi-hc/articleshow/125730860.cms,"Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: The protection enjoyed by a woman under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available in proceedings related to Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema), which is governed by civil law, Delhi high court has ruled.Justice Neena Bansal Krishna dismissed a writ petition filed by a 53-year-old Canadian citizen challenging ED summons issued under Fema Section 37 for recording of her statement, rejecting the contention that safeguards guaranteed to women under CrPC applied to such summons.The petitioner argued that she could not be compelled to appear at the ED office and her statement must be recorded at her residence. She cited CrPC Section 160(1), which prevents women from being required to appear at places other than their residence for investigation. However, the HC highlighted that Fema investigations were civil-administrative proceedings, not criminal inquiries, and therefore, the gender-based protection available under CrPC could not be invoked.“The PMLA and the Fema have distinct statutory frameworks and nature of proceedings. Section 50 PMLA confers criminal investigative powers on ED involving summons for inquiries related to money laundering, which is a scheduled offence under PMLA and involves criminal prosecution.In contrast, Section 37 Fema is primarily concerned with civil-administrative investigations of foreign exchange contraventions governed by a regulatory framework distinct from criminal law. Secondly, there is a difference in the scope of summons and procedural safeguards,” the court said.“Civil code contains no provision like Section 160 CrPC mandating the recording of the statement of a woman at her residence. The insistence of the petitioner for not appearing before the authority is, therefore, without any basis,” Justice Krishna observed.“Powers regarding discovery and production of evidence under Section 37 Fema are analogous to those under Section 131 Income Tax Act, which is governed by civil code and therefore, Section 160 CrPC would not be applicable,” HC added.","The protection enjoyed by a woman under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available in proceedings related to Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema), says Delhi high court.

Why December still feels special for students

December has finally arrived, bringing with it the stretch students across the country look forward to all year, winter breaks, Christmas celebrations and the gentle slowing down that marks the end of the academic calendar. After a busy November filled with examinations in many states, schools are now shifting into a lighter schedule as temperatures begin to drop and year-end activities take over.Unlike summer holidays, December breaks don’t follow a uniform pattern across India. Each state, and often each school, sets its own calendar depending on the weather and institutional policies. But there is one common trend: the second half of December typically offers the longest cluster of holidays for schoolchildren before the new year begins.Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24, with most reopening only in the first week of January. This period usually covers Christmas, New Year’s Eve and the coldest days of the season.Even in states without long winter breaks, certain days will be observed as holidays across most schools:Some schools also club these festive holidays with year-end events, annual functions or cultural programmes, adding to the excitement of the month.December is more than just a month of holidays, it marks a much-needed pause in the school year. The weather encourages a slower pace, families plan outings and reunions, and students get a short but meaningful break before the academic race picks up again in January.Even for schools, this period is valuable: campuses use the downtime for repairs, planning sessions and preparations for final-term activities.","Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24.

CHENNAI: Cyclone Ditwah, which weakened into a deep depression over Bay of Bengal on a breezy Sunday evening, surprised residents on Monday by unleashing one of the wettest mornings of the season.The cyclone, stripped of much of its cloud cover on Sunday, moved northward through the Bay of Bengal. It staged a resurgence overnight, amassing moisture. Drifting slowly northward at 5km/h and edging closer to the coast, the weather system thickened cloud cover over city and suburbs, setting off steady prolonged showers from 5am. It dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts Low-lying areas were flooded, children walked to school drenched, and traffic came to a crawl in most parts of the city. Around 10am, when most people were dodging potholes in traffic bottlenecks, India Meteorological Department reinstated an orange (very heavy rain) alert for the city and a red (extremely heavy rain) alert for Tiruvallur.Between 8.30am and 7.30pm, the city recorded “moderate” rainfall of 10cm, though it was heavy in some parts of North Chennai. Nungambakkam recorded 9.45cm, and Meenambakkam recorded 6.2cm. Ennore topped GCC records with 13cm of rain from 8:30am to 2pm, while Parry’s Corner, Ice House, Madhavaram, Saligramam, and Vadapalani each surpassed 10cm.On Sunday evening, when the cyclone weakened and the city was relatively dry, IMD withdrew the alert for Chennai to yellow (heavy rain) and Tiruvallur to orange. On Monday, weathermen said the system was likely to linger 30km-40km offshore along the coast and forecast heavy rain on Tuesday in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpet.Cyclone Ditwah’s path, however, continued to be a topic of debate. While IMD said the system would fade into a depression and cross land near Nellore early on Tuesday, independent forecasters said there would be scattered bursts in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpet, and Kancheepuram. Blogger Pradeep John said he expected the clouds to regain as long as it was close to city coast. “The depression is going to stay for the next 36 hours near Chennai itself,” he said. Ditwah is neither able to move west nor east, he said. If this westerly trough influence moves away on Wednesday, then the cyclone will move west into TN or south AP coast into the land as a weakened cyclone, he said.","Cyclone Ditwah dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts.

In the predatory world of American artificial intelligence, where top engineers command salaries in the millions and signing bonuses rival small fortunes, Apple Inc has taken a big bite out of Microsoft and Google The iPhone giant on Monday announced the hiring of Amar Subramanya, a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft, as its new vice president of artificial intelligence, in an effort to catch up with rivals who have sped ahead. Subramanya steps into a role vacated by the retiring John Giannandrea, inheriting oversight of Apple's foundation models, machine learning research, and AI safety teams amid a high-stakes push to salvage its lagging AI ambitions.Subramanya's whirlwind journey—from Alphabet's Mountain View labs, where he helmed engineering for the Gemini AI assistant, to Microsoft's Redmond headquarters for a five-month co-piloting stint as corporate vice president of AI, and now to sickly Siri at Apple's Cupertino campus—epitomizes the escalating talent war gripping Silicon Valley and beyond.With Microsoft poaching over 20 researchers from Google's DeepMind unit earlier this year, including Subramanya in July, and now Apple counter-recruiting from its rivals, the US AI ecosystem has become a revolving door of elite minds, many of them immigrants like Subramanya.The migration isn't just about prestige; it's a battle for the intellectual capital needed to build the next generation of intelligent machines, as companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic lure defectors with million dollar windfalls, even as MAGA myopics mope about “slave labor” and “code coolies” from India and wallow in toxic gibes on X.At 46, Subramanya arrives with impeccable credentials tailored to Apple's pain points. After earning a BE in electrical, electronics, and communications engineering from Bangalore University in 2001, he completed his PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle in 2009 with a dissertation on semi-supervised learning and graphical models, innovative techniques for training AI systems with limited labeled data — now a boon for privacy-obsessed Apple, which shuns vast user-data troves in favor of synthetic and licensed datasets.Subramanya's graduate work also extended to practical applications in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and human activity analysis. As a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, he tackled multi-sensory fusion for robust speech systems and speaker verification, earning a prestigious Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship in 2007. This early exposure to Big Tech's labs foreshadowed his career, blending theory with deployment. His scholarly output includes the influential book Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning (co-authored with Partha Pratim Talukdar), a staple in machine learning curricula. His academic papers span entity resolution, multilingual Natural Language Processing, cross-document coreference, and audio-visual speech enhancement, underscoring his focus on scalable, multimodal systems.These foundations propelled Subramanya's 16-year Google tenure, starting around 2009 in research roles that evolved into engineering leadership. By 2023, he was head of engineering for Gemini, Google's multimodal powerhouse boasting up to 1.2 trillion parameters. Under his watch, teams of over 100 bridged experimental prototypes to production, integrating text, image, and video processing into Search, YouTube, and Android.Subramanya's pivot to Microsoft in July 2025 – along with a score of gearheads including engineering lead Sonal Gupta – was a cultural reset.

The company's Apple Intelligence suite, unveiled in October 2024, has faltered: notification summaries spawned fabricated headlines, from false reports of a suspect's suicide to premature sports victories to Netanyahu’s arrest, drawing ire and lawsuits. Siri's promised overhaul—touted for contextual awareness and app control—languished after internal tests flopped, delaying rollout to spring 2026.Giannandrea, like Subramanya a Google import who once led Machine Intelligence, is said to have fostered research but struggled with product delivery. His 2024 paper on ""large-reasoning models"" critiqued AI's simulated cognition, yet Apple's outputs lagged. Now, with Giannandrea advising until spring, Subramanya will report to software SVP Craig Federighi, tasked with accelerating a 1-trillion-parameter in-house model while leaning on Apple’s upcoming $1 billion licensing deal with Gemini to revive Siri – delicious irony in the Apple-Google feud spanning maps to mobile.","Amar Subramanya is a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.

Sanchar Saathi App Optional Says Centre Amid Fierce Pegasus-Like Snooping Charges and Privacy Debate

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday hit back at the Congress after the opposition accused the government of infringing on citizens’ privacy by directing smartphone makers to preload the Sanchar Saathi app on new devices.Taking a jibe at the Congress, BJP MP and national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “I know who will delete it… 'Chor ki daadhi mein tinka' (a guilty conscience needs no accuser)""He also made a veiled reference to the National Herald case, in which Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are accused. “You know very well who they are. An FIR has also been filed against them. They have swindled Rs 5,000 crore. At present, they are out on bail,” he told reporters at the BJP headquarters, as reported by PTI.Defending the app, Patra said it is designed to protect users from fraud and crime, not to monitor them, and emphasised that people are free to remove it from their phones if they do not wish to use it.“The app cannot read your messages. It cannot listen to your calls, incoming or outgoing. Sanchar Saathi cannot reach or breach your personal data.” He added that the app helps provide security, check fraud, track stolen mobile phones, and return them to their owners.Minister of communications Jyotiraditya Scindia also,clarified that the app will remain dormant unless users register on it, and can be deleted at any time.Congress has alleged that the directive reflects a “dictatorial” approach, calling Sanchar Saathi a “snooping app” and demanding that the move be withdrawn. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of trying to “strangulate the voice of the people”.Responding sharply, Patra said, ""Mr Kharge, it is not meant to strangulate people's voice but to secure their voice, and their mobile phones, without which life is difficult today. We need to secure the device. That is why the government has brought this app.”“You keep on spreading misinformation.

NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi on Tuesday said that India’s third indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine will be commissioned soon. Speaking ahead of Navy Day, he also explained how the Navy’s strong action during counterterror Operation Sindoor forced Pakistan’s naval forces to stay close to their coastline.Admiral Tripathi said, ""The aggressive posturing and immediate action during Operation Sindoor… forced Pakistan Navy to remain close to their ports or near the Makran coast."" He added that the operation is still ongoing.He also described how busy the Navy has been over the past year, completing 11,000 ship days and 50,000 flying hours since the last Navy Day. One Indian ship has been continuously deployed in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 for anti-piracy duties, and 138 ships have taken part so far, escorting more than 3,700 merchant vessels from different countries.Admiral Tripathi said the Navy has received international recognition, noting that one naval ship was praised by the International Maritime Organisation for rescuing nine crew members from an Omani vessel last year. He added, ""I also got a thank-you letter from the chief of the Oman Navy.""Vice Admiral K Swaminathan, head of the Western Naval Command, also highlighted the impact of Operation Sindoor, launched after the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.The operation destroyed nine major terror hubs in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and damaged key airbases.He said Operation Sindoor saw an unprecedented mobilisation of more than 30 ships and submarines in a short period. ""Our frontline ships were poised for combat off the Makran coast, under the umbrella of Vikrant Carrier Battle Group,"" he said.Swaminathan added that the Navy’s strong posture played a major role in Pakistan seeking a ceasefire, saying, ""The threat of offensive action by the Indian Navy could be considered one of the important factors in Pakistan requesting for a ceasefire.""",Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India's third indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine will be commissioned soon. He also explained how the Navy’s strong action during counterterror Operation Sindoor forced Pakistan's naval forces to stay close to their coastline.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125715216,imgsize-1748058,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
IITs bar from placement drive 20+ companies that rescinded offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iits-bar-from-placement-drive-20-companies-that-rescinded-offers/articleshow/125706903.cms,"An IIT professor said the institutes have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by Centre under Viksit Bharat scheme

MUMBAI: Even as the placement season began across the premier IITs on Monday, more than 20 companies were banned from participating this year. These firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year, some even as late as June or July this year, at the time of joining. Since many IITs do not allow students with existing offers to sit for further interviews, such late withdrawals not only jeopardised career prospects but also affected students’ mental well-being, said officials. IITs, therefore, unanimously decided to ban these companies from the current placement cycle. IITs tried helping the concerned students despite the time lapse.The list of banned companies was finalised after these firms revoked offers at more than one IIT. Some of them are data analytics and software-based firms. They, however, are allowed to place students through off-campus process.An IIT professor involved in the placement process said the names of the companies were cross-verified by placement coordinators at 15 IITs recently. “We looked at their past records too. Some of these companies had a history of revoking offers and six to seven IITs had already banned them from participation.Offers have been revoked by some companies where some alumni are working. There were also a few companies that reduced salary packages offered in the letter. The placement cells are trying to speak to higher authorities in these companies,” said the professor.Speaking about such cancellations, a computer science graduate from IIT-Bombay’s batch of 2025, said he was hired by a trading platform last December and his joining date was June 1, 2025. “My offer was revoked on May 29. The company made me an offer of nearly Rs 30 lakh and I was more than happy to join. They revoked my offer just two days before I was supposed to join, but fortunately, I got a better offer through an alumnus in some time. Though IIT-Bombay extended help, I did not need it at that time,” said the graduate. He said some of his friends’ offers were revoked too, but a few of them landed other offers. “By June and July it becomes difficult for the institutes too to help with placements as phase-II of the process concludes by the end of the academic year,” he said.The professor added that the IITs this year have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by the Centre under the Viksit Bharat programme. “The job market is slow, but we are trying to reach out to many more companies and encourage start-ups incubated on prominent campuses to reach the best targets,” he said, adding that so far the placement season looks good.","Firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year.

On a crisp winter morning, when the sun struggles to cut through a grey, smoky haze, many of us glance at the air-quality index like a daily horoscope, the number that decides whether we mask up, skip a walk, or brace for another day of breathing toxic air. But what do those figures actually mean for our lungs? Why does 200 feel unbearable while 500 feels apocalyptic? And as smoke from stubble burning mixes with vehicular and industrial pollution , what is all that particulate matter really doing inside the body?Here is a look at the mechanics of the AQI, and what a pulmonologist wants you to know before the next toxic plume rolls in.For years, India’s air-quality data was buried in technical charts and numbers, leaving most people unsure of what the readings meant for the air they breathed. Without a clear, accessible system, public engagement with pollution remained limited.To change this, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) set out to create a national Air Quality Index (AQI) that could translate complicated measurements into simple, accessible categories. An expert group, bringing together doctors, air-quality scientists, academics, NGOs, state pollution boards, and technical inputs from IIT Kanpur, developed what eventually became India’s AQI.A draft was released in October 2014 for public and institutional feedback, and after detailed review, the national framework was finalised.The AQI is designed to tell people, at a glance, not just how polluted the air is, but what that level of pollution could mean for their health. It classifies air quality into six categories:. The index accounts for eight major pollutants with 24-hour standards and calculates individual sub-indices for each as long as there is data for at least three pollutants, one of them necessarily PM2.5 or PM10, an AQI can be computed. The highest (or “worst”) sub-index becomes the overall AQI number for that location.The AQI measures key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Among them, PM2.5 is considered the most harmful because its tiny particles can travel deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, leading to serious health risks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises keeping PM2.5 levels below 5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) annually, and under 15 µg/m³ for 24 hours.The US AQI, like India’s, runs on a 0–500 scale, but with one key difference. Its highest category, “hazardous,” begins at 301 with no upper cap, so readings can go well beyond 500. The two countries also use different formulas to calculate their scores, which means the same pollution data can produce different AQI values. In short, the Indian and US scales don’t line up exactly and can’t be directly compared.Every winter, vast stretches of northern India, from Punjab and Haryana to neighbouring states, witness the burning of leftover crop stubble as farmers clear their fields for the next sowing season. This practice, known as crop residue burning (CRB), remains a persistent environmental challenge in India and many agricultural regions around the world.CRB is a major driver of fine particulate pollution, especially PM2.5, that engulfs Delhi and the wider NCR region each winter. These microscopic particles pose a heightened health threat, not only to residents but also to farmers living in and around the burn sites. Because PM2.5 particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the respiratory system, they can lodge along the delicate lining of the alveoli in the lungs.A growing body of scientific evidence links PM2.5 exposure to significant health risks. Short-term exposure can impair lung function and worsen conditions like asthma and heart disease. Over the long term, the dangers intensify; prolonged inhalation has been associated with chronic bronchitis, reduced lung capacity, and increased mortality linked to lung cancer and cardiovascular illnesses.Delhi has once again topped the charts as India’s most polluted city, according to a decade-long AQI assessment by Climate Trends covering 2015 to November 2025. The analysis shows that no major Indian city has reached safe air-quality levels at any point in the past ten years, underscoring the severity of the national pollution crisis.Delhi remains the worst-hit, followed by Noida, which recorded an alarming AQI of 515. Other heavily polluted regions include Cooch Behar (362), Kishanganj (351), and Kultali (332), reflecting how toxic air has spread far beyond the metros and deep into smaller districts. The data points to a nationwide public-health emergency, with the capital continuing to sit at the centre of India’s pollution burden.Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital in Gurugram, says the body reacts almost immediately when pollution levels rise. Fine particles irritate and inflame the airways, leading to coughing, excess mucus, and reduced lung function, while the heart and blood vessels come under added strain due to oxidative stress, constricted vessels, and a heightened tendency for clotting.""The cardiovascular system also responds to pollution by inducing oxidative stress, blood vessel constriction, and an increased tendency toward blood clotting.""At an AQI of around 200, the body experiences noticeable but manageable stress; symptoms like throat irritation, headaches, and breathlessness are common, especially for vulnerable groups. But when levels reach 500, the exposure becomes overwhelming. Inflammation intensifies, asthma can worsen quickly, blood pressure may rise, and even healthy people may struggle with oxygen exchange. Sustained exposure at this severity can lead to acute respiratory or cardiac complications, Dr Grover adds.Surface pollution from stubble burning and urban sources exposes people to PM2.5, PM10 and carbon monoxide, the dominant winter pollutants. The tiniest of these, PM2.5, can slip past the body’s natural defences, lodge deep in the lungs, and even enter the bloodstream. Carrying toxic metals and reactive chemicals, these particles spark chronic inflammation and gradual tissue damage. Over time, doctors see faster loss of lung function, recurring bronchitis, worsening asthma, and higher risks of heart and vascular disease.""Long-term exposure also increases risks of lung cancer, preterm birth, and impaired cognitive development in children. The cumulative effect of this pollution is almost akin to the long-term effects of smoking in some highly polluted regions,"" Dr Grover said.Children, pregnant women, and older adults face greater risks as AQI levels climb because their bodies are more vulnerable to pollution-induced stress. Children breathe faster and have developing lungs, making AQI levels above 150 likely to trigger coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.Pregnant women, who already have reduced oxygen reserves, may experience breathlessness when pollution rises above 200, and prolonged exposure has been linked to complications such as ""low birth weight and preterm labour."" Older adults, especially those with heart or lung conditions, can develop chest tightness, irregular heartbeat, or worsening COPD even at AQI 150–200, said Dr Grover.On the other hand, for people with asthma or chronic bronchitis, polluted air intensifies existing inflammation.Irritants like PM2.5 and ozone narrow the airways, increase mucus, and heighten sensitivity to triggers, leading to more frequent wheezing, coughing, breathlessness, and greater reliance on rescue inhalers. High pollution days also increase the risk of asthma attacks, respiratory infections, and a faster decline in lung function.""Patients should follow their treatment plans closely, avoid outdoor activity at times of peak pollution, and use preventive medication as recommended by their clinician,"" Dr Grover said.On days when air quality plunges into the “very poor” or “severe” range, the most important strategy is reducing total exposure, said Dr Grover.Indoors, keeping windows shut, avoiding smoke or incense, and using a certified HEPA purifier can significantly lower pollutant levels. Outside, it's best to limit activity, especially exercise, which draws particles deeper into the lungs. Only well-fitted N95 or FFP2 masks offer real protection; cloth and surgical masks do little to block PM2.5.Supporting measures like staying hydrated, using nasal saline rinses, and closely monitoring symptoms help reduce irritation. People with chronic lung or heart conditions should keep medications handy and follow their action plans carefully. Avoiding peak pollution hours, typically early mornings and evenings, remains one of the simplest ways to cut exposure.As winter smog thickens and AQI levels swing from unhealthy to severe, the message from experts is clear: pollution is not just an environmental issue but a direct, measurable threat to health.From choosing the right mask to avoiding peak smog hours and protecting vulnerable groups, even small, consistent steps can significantly cut exposure. And while individual action offers only partial defence, experts say awareness is the first line of protection until long-term, systemic solutions begin to clear the air for good.","The AQI measures key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Its highest category, “hazardous,” begins at 301 with no upper cap, so readings can go well beyond 500.

As India plans a long-term presence in low-Earth orbit, what design or mission principles from the ISS would you keep, revise, or discard?

Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ’s (Shux) 20-day mission to the International Space Station earlier this year gave India a rare, first-hand view into how the world’s most complex engineering project functions on an ordinary day—and how it copes when things are not ordinary at all. As India prepares for a sustained human presence in low-Earth orbit through the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, Shukla’s reflections offer a grounded account of what the ISS achieved, where it stumbled, and how India should shape its own long-term strategy.In this exclusive interview to TOI, Shux speaks about the moments that defined his time on the station, the value of international collaboration, and the design philosophy that India could adopt for missions in the coming decades.The International Space Station remains one of humanity’s most dazzling examples of what happens when engineering ambition meets international cooperation, and miraculously, everyone agrees on the same orbit. Conceived in an era when floppy disks were still in fashion and the internet sounded like a dial-up flute, the ISS was built to push the boundaries of science in microgravity, test systems essential for future deep-space missions, and serve as a beacon of peaceful collaboration between nations that otherwise rarely agree on anything terrestrial.Construction of this orbital leviathan began in 1998 and reached completion in 2011. To assemble it, humanity performed a kind of celestial Lego project that required more than 1,000 hours of spacewalks and more than 40 Space Shuttle flights. The result? The largest continuously inhabited laboratory off the planet, a structure the size of a football field hurtling around Earth at 28,000 km/h, completing a lap every 90 minutes.During my own mission aboard the ISS, the station felt exactly like the global village it was designed to be. We had 11 crew members representing six nationalities, a small floating model of the United Nations , minus the speeches and with better views. Over the course of our 20-day stay, we conducted more than 60 scientific experiments spanning biology, materials science, human physiology, and space technology. We also carried out STEM demonstrations that connected us with students across the world, sparking curiosity, answering wide-eyed questions, and hopefully inspiring the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers.Looking back, those 20 days perfectly captured the essence of what the ISS set out to achieve. For a machine conceived with 1990s technology, when the most futuristic thing on Earth was a Nokia phone, to not only remain relevant but to continue fulfilling and expanding its mission objectives is extraordinary. The station does not just orbit Earth; it orbits the idea that cooperation, curiosity, and courage can build something remarkable, even 400 kilometres above our heads.Working with crew members from different nationalities reaffirmed something fundamental about space exploration: at its core, it is a profoundly collaborative human endeavour. Space does not care about passports, accents, or geopolitical boundaries. Up there, the only border you notice is the thin blue line of Earth’s atmosphere.During my training for this mission, I found myself hopping across continents more frequently than airline safety videos. From the meticulous engineers in Japan, to the precision-driven teams in Europe, to the seasoned experts in the United States, and the ever-innovative minds in India, each group brought its own culture, expertise, and philosophy to the table. It was like assembling a global orchestra where every instrument mattered, and the symphony was a successful human spaceflight.Before this mission, I knew conceptually that space operations required international coordination. But seeing it firsthand—the late-night calls across time zones, the joint simulations, the integrated training programmes, and the sheer number of people quietly working behind the scenes—made me appreciate the astonishing complexity of sending even one human to space. A single crewed mission represents thousands of hours of planning, countless technical discussions, and the collective will of teams who might never meet but still trust one another implicitly.Beyond accomplishing scientific and operational goals, this collaboration builds something equally important: relationships and trust among people from vastly different cultures and backgrounds. In space, camaraderie is not optional; it is oxygen for the mission. You quickly learn that no matter where someone comes from, if they work in human spaceflight, they speak a common language: space.As we continue advancing on our journey in human space exploration, it is vital that we hold on to this foundational principle. The power of collaboration is not just a sentiment; it is the engine that drives progress. Space has always transcended boundaries, and the work we do should honour that spirit. The only way humanity will reach farther into the cosmos is by going there together.The first module of the International Space Station, the Russian-built Zarya, appropriately named “Dawn”, launched in 1998, marking the beginning of humanity’s most ambitious construction project not on Earth. Over the next 13 years, we assembled this orbital behemoth piece by piece, like a cosmic IKEA kit, except the manual was 10,000 pages long and required spacewalks instead of Allen keys.One of the ISS’s greatest design triumphs was its modular architecture. This was not just clever; it was visionary. The modular approach meant components, scientific racks, power systems, and entire habitable modules could be added, upgraded, or even replaced long after launch. Several of the station’s capabilities today, from advanced biology labs to new solar arrays, were not on the drawing board in the 1990s. Yet the structure welcomed them gracefully, proving its resilience.Another stroke of genius was the strict standardisation of interfaces and protocols. Despite contributions from different space agencies—Nasa, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA—each with its own engineering philosophy, the requirement was simple: any module joining the ISS had to integrate seamlessly with the command-and-control backbone. This ensured that a Japanese experiment rack, a European robotic arm, and an American airlock could all operate in harmony.Equally important was the flexibility for on-orbit maintenance and upgrades. Astronauts often replaced hardware, rerouted cables, installed new instruments, and even deployed new solar arrays. When you build for decades of use, you cannot predict every challenge, so the ISS needed enough adaptability to absorb surprises.That said, the ISS was not designed to be fully future-proof. Technology has moved fast in the last two decades, and modern ISS interiors sometimes look like an enthusiastic octopus let loose with a box of cables. It is high-functioning chaos.As we look ahead, this is the lesson we must carry forward: whatever we design today must be able to absorb the technology of tomorrow.As the ISS approaches its well-earned retirement after more than two decades in orbit, it leaves behind a legacy and a treasure trove of lessons. My time aboard crystallised one truth: before building a space station, you must begin with a sharply defined question—what is it for?Is it a research laboratory? A technology testbed? A stepping stone to the Moon? A commercial outpost? A training ground? The purpose shapes everything that follows.The ISS has also shown the power of collaboration. At a time when nations often disagree on Earth, the station has remained a counterexample, an engineering handshake orbiting above geopolitics. It is still the only structure where multiple countries can send astronauts, run experiments, and access an environment otherwise out of reach. India has been a proud beneficiary of this openness.But the ISS also teaches caution: mismatched priorities, slow adaptation to emerging technologies, and design decisions frozen in the 1990s reveal pitfalls to avoid.Going forward, the challenge is to distil the ISS story into a blueprint for the next chapter of human presence in space. Embedded in its cables and maintenance logs are lessons on what must be done, what must never be done again, and what must be done better. The ISS is not merely retiring; it is passing the torch.The philosophy of modularity has been one of the ISS’s greatest gifts to space engineering. In microgravity, “weight” loses its meaning, and you can launch components separately, even years apart, and assemble them like an orbital jigsaw. But modularity works only if you treat construction as a long-term strategy, a roadmap spanning decades.Flexibility is the other key lesson. Space teaches you quickly that no plan survives first contact with reality. The ISS construction phase was a masterclass in adapting to hardware mismatches, alignment quirks, and surprises delivered by orbital mechanics. The design must have elasticity to absorb new insights and evolving technologies.A station is not just modules; it is an ecosystem. The Earth-based infrastructure—mission control, simulators, life-support testbeds, logistics chains—matters as much as the hardware in orbit. Astronauts need operational flexibility too. They become builders, plumbers, electricians, scientists, and troubleshooters.Design follows objectives. Before drawing the first bolt pattern or finalising an airlock diameter, the mission’s purpose must be clear.As India prepares for the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, we are at a pivotal moment. The insights from decades of ISS operations—its triumphs, surprises, and even its cluttered cable aesthetics—are guiding our approach. We now have the opportunity to design a next-generation station informed by a quarter-century of real orbital experience.","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla’s 20-day mission to the International Space Station earlier this year gave India a rare, first-hand view into how the world's most complex engineering project functions.

DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has grounded an Air India aircraft and launched a detailed investigation after the airline reported that the aircraft had operated eight revenue sectors on an expired Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC).According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, quoted in the press note shared by ANI, ""Air India informed the regulator on 26 November 2025 that one of its aircraft had been inadvertently deployed for commercial flights despite the ARC having lapsed. The ARC is a mandatory annual certification that validates an aircraft’s continued compliance with airworthiness standards and its main Certificate of Airworthiness. ""In the press note, the ministry explained that the lapse occurred in the context of the ongoing merger of Vistara into Air India. As part of the transition, all 70 Vistara aircraft required renewed ARCs in 2024, with the DGCA assuming responsibility for issuing the certificates post-merger. While 69 aircraft received renewed ARCs after satisfactory checks, the 70th aircraft was grounded for an engine change after the operator filed its renewal application.During this period, its ARC expired, but the aircraft was subsequently released for service.Once the lapse was detected, the DGCA instructed Air India to immediately ground the aircraft and began an inquiry into how it was allowed to operate without a valid ARC. The certification process for the aircraft is now under way.The ministry said the personnel involved have been de-rostered with immediate effect pending the outcome of the probe. Air India, acting on DGCA’s directions, has initiated an internal investigation to identify system gaps, accountability failures, and corrective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.",The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has grounded an Air India aircraft.

NEW DELHI: New complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will be called ‘Seva Teerth’, officials said on Tuesday.Earlier known as the ‘Executive Enclave’, the complex is now in its final stages of completion, marking a significant step in the Central Vista redevelopment.Officials described Seva Teerth as a workplace designed to reflect the spirit of service, a space “where national priorities take shape”. They said India’s public institutions were undergoing a “quiet but profound shift”, with governance moving from “satta (power) to seva (service)” and from authority to responsibility.“The change was not just administrative, but cultural and moral,” they added, as quoted by PTI.The enclave will house the PMO along with the offices of the Cabinet Secretariat, the National Security Council Secretariat and India House, which will serve as a venue for high-level talks with visiting dignitaries.As part of this broader shift in governance philosophy, Raj Bhawans—the official residences of state governors—are being renamed ‘Lok Bhawans’.The Central Secretariat, too, is now known as Kartavya Bhavan.Officials said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , spaces of governance have been reshaped to reflect ‘kartavya’ (duty) and transparency. “Every name, every building and every symbol now points to a simple idea. Government exists to serve,” they said.Several landmarks have already been renamed in recent years. Rajpath became Kartavya Path, while the prime minister’s official residence was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016, a name intended to convey welfare rather than exclusivity.“These changes mark a deeper ideological transition. Indian democracy is choosing responsibility over power and service over status,” officials said. “A shift in names is also a shift in mindset. Today, they speak the language of seva, kartavya and citizen-first governance,” they added.","New complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will be called ‘Seva Teerth’, officials said on Tuesday.

The bottom line

Global arms revenues surged to an all-time high of $679 billion in 2024, up 5.9% in real terms, according to the latest SIPRI Top 100 ranking. While Europe and the US drove most of the increase, Asia and Oceania stood out as the only region to post a decline—largely due to a dramatic drop in Chinese arms company revenues, the SIPRI report said.India, though still far from being a global arms giant, posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies. In sharp contrast, Chinese arms revenues fell 10%, a setback tied to a wave of high-profile corruption scandals and major contract delays that rattled Beijing's defense establishment.India’s three Top 100 firms-Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders-together pulled in $7.5 billion in arms revenue in 2024, up from $6.9 billion in 2023.BEL led the growth with a 24% revenue jump, hitting $2.47 billion. The boost came from domestic orders, particularly in radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, both prioritized in India’s military modernization drive.HAL, India’s top-ranked defense firm at rank 44 globally, earned $3.81 billion, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the previous year. The company faced delivery lags, but remained a cornerstone supplier to the Indian Air Force and Navy.Mazagon Dock, focused on naval shipbuilding, recorded $1.23 billion in arms revenue, with a 9.8% year-on-year increase, thanks to continued submarine and destroyer production.India is pressing ahead with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) campaign in defense production. While not grabbing global headlines, its incremental gains highlight an emerging industrial base that could challenge traditional suppliers over time.“The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased by 8.2 per cent to $7.5 billion on the back of domestic orders,” the SIPRI report said.The picture in China couldn’t be more different. For the first time in years, China’s eight arms producers in the SIPRI Top 100-previously hailed as key enablers of President Xi Jinping’s military modernization push-lost major ground.The steepest fall came from NORINCO, China’s primary land systems manufacturer, which saw its revenue plunge 31% due to corruption scandals and leadership upheaval.CASC, China’s aerospace and missile systems leader, dropped 16% following delays in military satellite programs and the removal of its president amid graft allegations.Even AVIC, the country’s biggest defense company, slipped 1.3%, hampered by delays in aircraft deliveries.“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI military expenditure and arms production programme.China’s top-down, state-controlled defense sector may be big-but its opacity leaves it vulnerable to internal shocks. Political purges tied to Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign disrupted procurement and leadership pipelines across several top defense firms.Only two of China’s eight arms producers recorded revenue growth-CSSC, the shipbuilding powerhouse, was one, rising 8.7%, aligned with China’s naval buildup in the South China Sea.India’s slow, state-driven growth might lack flash, but it also avoids the internal disarray seen in Beijing. Its procurement is transparent, aligned to strategic plans, and largely free of major political scandal.China, meanwhile, is still far ahead in sheer scale but vulnerable to top-level instability.While China dragged down the region’s total, other Asian powers picked up slack:South Korean arms producers rose 31% to $14.1 billion, driven by booming exports.Japan posted the largest jump in Asia: a 40% increase in arms revenues across five firms, reaching $13.3 billion, reflecting Tokyo’s shift toward proactive defense spending amid regional tensions.US firms remain the backbone of the global arms industry. The 39 American companies in the Top 100 generated $334 billion in arms revenues in 2024, a 3.8 per cent increase that leaves them with just under half of global Top 100 sales. Lockheed Martin alone booked $64.7 billion, while RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each sat comfortably above $30 billion.Yet the American giant is struggling to turn money into timely capability. Programmes such as the F-35 fighter, the Columbia-class nuclear submarine and the Sentinel ICBM are all running late and over budget. Lockheed’s F-35 deliveries in 2024 were delayed by an average of 238 days per aircraft, and the programme’s projected sustainment costs have ballooned towards $1.6 trillion over its life. Northrop’s Sentinel programme has breached US cost-growth thresholds by around 80 per cent versus its original estimate.SIPRI’s Xiao Liang warns that “The delays and rising costs will inevitably impact US military planning and military spending… This could have knock-on effects on the US government’s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.” In plain terms, even as the US spends more, it risks getting less capability per dollar.European producers surged by 13%, reaching $151 billion, as countries rearm in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Russia’s corporate footprint in the SIPRI Top 100 remains surprisingly small—just two entities, Rostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation—but their combined arms revenues jumped 23 per cent in 2024 to an estimated $31.2 billion. Domestic demand linked to the Ukraine war more than offset shrinking exports. Russian plants have ramped up output of artillery shells, missiles and armoured vehicles; SIPRI cites reports of 1.3 million 152-mm shells produced in 2024, a more than fivefold increase over 2022.Where Russia is constrained, the Middle East is expanding. For the first time, nine companies from the region appear in the Top 100, with combined arms revenues of $31.0 billion, up 14 per cent where comparable data exist. Israeli firms alone generated $16.2 billion, a 16 per cent increase, fuelled both by the Gaza war and strong demand for uncrewed systems and missile defence worldwide.For India:Expect a continued push for domestic procurement and local manufacturing under the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP).India may look to expand exports, especially to Africa and Southeast Asia, but lacks the global competitiveness of Korean or Israeli systems.For China:Beijing still accounts for around 13 per cent of total Top 100 arms revenues, and its shipyards and missile producers have been central to the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and rocket forces over the past decade.But the 2024 rankings hint at a temporary pause or re-ordering in its modernisation drive just as tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea remain high.Recovery will depend on restoring procurement integrity, managing talent loss, and containing political fallout.For Asia:The regional arms race is far from over.The pivot from importing to building continues—but success will depend on supply chain resilience, governance, and geopolitical alignment.India is climbing slowly, but surely-fueled by trust in institutions, steady demand, and political will.China, long considered an unstoppable defense juggernaut, now faces turbulence not from outside threats, but from within.In the evolving landscape of Asian defense, discipline may matter more than dominance. And for now, India is playing the long game.","India posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies.

KOLKATA: Even if a candidate under the reserved category scored higher than the cut-off marks and was upgraded to general category, s/he would continue to enjoy benefits of the former category, Calcutta high court held Tuesday.The directive came after an SSC candidate, who made it to the first list of the 2025 SLST exam, moved high court to restore her SC status even if she was upgraded to general category.SSC senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay sought HC’s permission to upgrade the candidate to the general category contending that another SC candidate with lower marks would miss the opportunity of being considered if the petitioner wanted to restore her status. Bandyopadhyay argued that the idea of reservation was meant for the welfare of a community and not for an individual.Justice Amrita Sinha, however, noted that the petitioner had marked herself as a reserved category candidate while filling the form and had submitted Rs 200, a fee meant for that category. The judge referred to her Nov 27 order, in which the court had held that once a candidate’s category was final, authorities could not “change it suo motu”.","SSC senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay sought HC’s permission to upgrade the candidate to the general category.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has directed the Uttar Pradesh govt to ensure that anyone who converts to Christianity automatically forfeits all Scheduled Caste benefits, failing which it would be construed as a “fraud on the Constitution and contrary to the ethos of reservation policies”.Justice Praveen Kumar Giri’s Nov 21 order cites Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, specifying that nobody other than a Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist can be deemed a member of an Scheduled Caste community.The court directed the principal secretary of the minorities welfare department to take appropriate steps to ensure that the distinction between minority and SC status was strictly enforced.The court said retention of SC status after conversion would amount to fraudulently claiming benefits since there is no caste system in Christianity.It fixed a timeline of four months for all district magistrates to act in accordance with the law to identify and prevent such occurrences.Justice Giri passed the order while dismissing a plea filed by a man accused of “mocking Hindu deities” and promoting enmity.The appellant, Jitendra Sahani, had petitioned the court to quash the charge sheet in the case on the ground that he had sought permission from the authorities to “preach the words of Jesus Christ on my land”.Justice Giri noted that Sahani mentioned his religion as “Hindu” in his affidavit, although he had converted to Christianity.It transpired that the appellant was from the SC community before his conversion.A witness in the case alleged that Sahani ridiculed the Hindu faith by claiming it offered no respect due to caste hierarchies, whereas embracing Christianity would lead to “jobs, business growth and financial benefits from the missionaries”.The court mentioned a recent Supreme Court judgment – C Selvarani Vs special secretary-cum-district collector 2024 – in which the bench held that a person ceases to belong to a particular caste after converting to Christianity.",Allahabad high court orders that anyone who converts to Christianity automatically forfeits all Scheduled Caste benefits.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: What India’s metros are breathing may have a link with rising acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases hospitals are logging. There were 2 lakh ARI cases in Delhi during 2022-24, with thousands needing hospitalisation — a surge the health ministry Tuesday linked to rising air pollution, while noting that the causal pathways remain complex.Responding to a question by Dr Vikramjit Singh Sahney in RS, junior health minister Prataprao Jadhav said polluted air is a “triggering factor” for respiratory diseases, and worsening air quality in urban centres is being closely monitored through an expanding national surveillance system.India’s metro hospitals have recorded over 2 lakh acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases in Delhi alone between 2022 and 2024, with thousands requiring admission each year — a surge the Ministry of Health on Tuesday linked to rising air pollution, while noting that the causal pathways remain complex. Responding to a question by Dr Vikramjit Singh Sahney in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for health Prataprao Jadhav said polluted air is a “triggering factor” for respiratory diseases, and worsening air quality in urban centres is being closely monitored through an expanding national surveillance system.Govt data shows that Delhi’s six central hospitals together reported 67,054 ARI emergency cases in 2022, 69,293 in 2023, and 68,411 in 2024, with admissions rising from 9,878 to 10,819 over the same period.Similar spikes were seen in Chennai and Mumbai, where thousands sought emergency care for breathing difficulties during severe pollution episodes. According to the Health Ministry, the impact of polluted air is shaped by multiple factors — including food habits, occupation, socio-economic conditions, immunity and medical history — making some people far more vulnerable than others.To capture these patterns in real time, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) now operates over 230 sentinel surveillance sites across 30 States and UTs. Digital ARI surveillance was also launched in August 2023 through the Integrated Health Information Portal.Adding to the evidence, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently completed a multi-site study across five hospitals involving 33,213 ER patients with respiratory symptoms. The study found that as pollution levels rose, emergency visits for respiratory distress increased. However, the Ministry stressed that the study cannot formally prove causation, even though the association is strong and consistent with global findings.","India’s metro hospitals have recorded over 2 lakh acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases in Delhi alone between 2022 and 2024.

The toll during SIR duty in Uttar Pradesh has now risen to nine in the past 11 days, including three suicides. Despite the rising toll, the chief electoral office of UP has not issued any formal response.Kamal Kant was an assistant teacher at a govt primary school in Nawali Lalpur under Sikandrao police station limits. He lost consciousness before leaving home and was declared dead at a hospital. His wife, Neelam Sharma, who was at her parents’ home, said, “My husband on the phone said to me that they are giving me tension and bothering me. I told him not to take tension.” DM Atu Vats and SP Chiranjeeb Nath Sinha visited the family.Vats said the body had been sent for post-mortem and the cause of death would be confirmed only after the report.“We received information at around 11am that a BLO, who was unwell, died on the way to the hospital. The entire team reached here. It appears that he had a previous medical condition.”Officials said Kant’s SIR performance was satisfactory and that he had already achieved over 50% of his assigned target. He had reportedly taken medication for low blood pressure earlier that morning before collapsing.

Since the two sets of personnel have been assigned different kinds of work and there is no overlap, neither SIR nor local bodies elections would get impacted, he said.Kerala SEC, which is conducting the local bodies elections, also informed the bench that there had been no hiccups in the ongoing process and that on conclusion of elections on Dec 13, the personnel assigned for the purpose will be free to resume their official duties.Singh said since EC and SEC are experiencing no problem in conducting SIR and local bodies polls simultaneously, Kerala govt should not have any problem either.

Arrogance finally bows to the unity of 240 & 100 MPs...” But beneath the claim of victory was a feeling of ease as opposition MPs were worried that a prolonged deadlock, even if forced by “govt intransigence”, would cost them floor time to take up the cause of their constituents.The meeting of opposition representatives on Monday saw some of these concerns being raised by smaller parties, while at least one big party made ambivalent remarks over blockade of proceedings — a reason why opposition decided to protest for two days and take stock of the situation again on Wednesday.RSP MP NK Premachandran said it was good that the deadlock had been resolved but added that govt could have done this much earlier. “Better late than never,” he remarked.The two-day discussion will now see regional parties like Samajwadi Party, DMK, Trinamool Congress, apart from Congress, lead the charge against SIR and, it is asserted, expose govt and Election Commission over the revision of poll rolls that they allege is “exclusionary”.The difference among regional parties is that while DMK, CPM & TMC govern their states, SP is in opposition in UP, though it did well in Lok Sabha polls, besting the governing BJP, and is now worried that deletion of voters would target its support base. That means attention would be more on Akhilesh Yadav, who leads a large contingent of 37 MPs and is expected to mount the offensive.Sparks are set to fly as BJP and allies would use their recent Bihar election sweep to debunk opposition’s allegations against SIR, focussing on “Vote Adhikar Yatra” taken out by Rahul Gandhi along with RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. In that sense, it would be interesting to see if RJD is able to make a case against SIR post-polls.","Congress whip Manickam Tagore sounded a triumphant note, saying, “INDIA wins.

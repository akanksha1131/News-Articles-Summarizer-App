Hindu Sena once did havan for Donald Trump's victory; now says he's lost 'good sense' — What sparked tensions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-sena-once-did-havan-for-donald-trumps-victory-now-says-hes-lost-good-sense-what-sparked-tensions/articleshow/124023861.cms,"Photo credit: X/@VishnuGupta_HS

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump took office in January this year for a second term as US president, amid high hopes for a stronger India-US relations. However, many of those hopefuls, who have been left disappointed thereafter, saw several of his policy decisions run contrary to expectations in both India and the United States.Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta best represents these disappointed hopefuls and sections of people who misjudged Donald Trump by projecting their own ideological lens onto him, while overlooking his transactional, self-interested approach.Gupta, who once called Trump a ""hero"", now thinks the US president has ""lost his good sense"".Donald Trump sounded the death knell on the ""American dream"" of many Indians, to ""Make America Great Again"", as he signed a proclamation on Friday that will raise the fee for new H1-B visa applicants to a staggering USD 100,000, in line with what the Congress MP Manish Tewari described as ""turning on the screws"" on India.This comes after the US imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods last month, and earlier this week dealt a blow to India’s trade and strategic ambitions by removing sanctions waivers from Chabahar port.Gupta, who had organised prayers and havans for Trump’s victory in US presidential elections and even cut a cake on his birthday, once believed the US president shared Hindu Sena’s worldview.Talking to, Gupta said, ""We prayed for Donald Trump's victory as he had pledged to eradicate 'Islamic terrorism'. We (Hindu Sena) also wish for the end of terrorism, Islamic terrorism, from the world, that is why we supported him in the US elections.""The Hindu Sena chief also thinks that in his first term (2016-20), Donald Trump did the job well as he ""stopped the help that was given by the US to Pakistan, and on many other fronts worked shoulder-to-shoulder along with PM Modi.""However, Gupta is now ""heartbroken"" by the fact that Trump has increased closeness with Pakistan. ""Donald Trump rose to power on the promise of fighting Islamic terrorism, yet today he has embraced Pakistan, a state long associated with it. This is deeply disappointing.""He now even suggests that the Indians, on a personal level, should not buy American products and ""boycott America"". Taking aim at the iPhone craze, Gupta said, ""Just yesterday, people were in queues to buy the iPhone; they should be ashamed of it. What's the need for an iPhone? We should boycott American products, if they do not stay within their limits.""The Hindu Sena chief, however, is optimistic about the future and thinks that the situation with the United States may become better in the future. ""The dispute with America are temporary, which can be resolved. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing regarding trade-related issues. I believe this matter will be sorted out soon.""When asked by the Timesofindia.com on what his group Hindu Sena will do on Donald Trump's next birthday, Gupta said, ""We will pray to God for Trump's long life and a return of his good sense that he should again stand up against radical Islam and terrorism.""And what about cake? Gupta said that once Donald Trump returns to his ""good sense"" of fighting radical Islam, the Hindu Sena will ""cut the cake again.""Until then, it remains a reminder of how easily hopes can be built, and dashed, on personal admiration for a leader whose politics are ultimately transactional and unpredictable.","Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta best represents disappointed hopefuls and sections of people who misjudged Donald Trump.

'Own wedding trip cancelled'



'Travel ban'



'Who's next?'



Indian H-1B visa holders in US described the ""crazy sense of panic"" that ensued the community after Donald Trump-administration approved $1,00,000 fee on the work visas on Saturday.The sudden move, coming just weeks before Diwali and the year-end holiday season, has left families in turmoil, many cancelling flights at the last minute, including one individual who called off their own wedding trip to India. With the new rule linked to restrictions on re-entry, even those holding valid visas fear being stranded abroad.US admin, however, tried to bring order to chaos saying that those leaving the country or visiting India ""don't need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee"", adding that the fee was ""only for new and not current existing holders.""An individual revealed how a person cancelled their own wedding trip last minute ""because they don't know what to do.”“People who are standing in boarding lines at airports, people who are leaving for their own wedding tomorrow, things like that. They are cancelling because they don't know what to do,” PTI quoted them saying.Moreover, one said how people have cancelled Diwali plans and December holiday plans because of the move.“People had plans to travel to India for Diwali. They're all in a flux and not sure what to do. Families book tickets for Diwali, for the December holiday season well in advance. This is the time when most people travel,"" they said.“This is the time when people actually want to leave and be with family during the holiday season. Now this has happened. Does that mean that I cannot travel this year? That’s another sense of ‘oh my god’,” they added.Terming it a ""travel ban"", one person questioned the administration over lack of clarity over procedure regarding the move.“This is a travel ban! Even if a person has a valid H-1B visa stamped on their passport, if they are travelling, or are on vacation, you cannot enter the US unless they have proof of the USD 1,00,000 payment. No one knows what the process is, what the fine print is. There’s absolute panic,” PTI quoted the person saying.Citing internal memos by major tech companies, one said, “The biggest question that has come out is that you cannot leave the country.”The memos advised employees against travelling abroad and urged those already outside the US to return before the September 21 deadline, when Trump’s proclamation is set to take effect.“The number one thing that all of the employers are just saying is that if you are inside the country right now, do not leave,” PTI quoted one saying.Raising doubts over who could be the new target of Trump's tightening of immigration rules, one asked, “Will students on F-1 visas or those on L-1 work visas be next.”“What happens to my spouse who's on a H4 visa, can they travel? None of these things are super clear. Another thing that has caused panic for a lot of people is that when such news comes out, nobody talks about the specifics. Nobody's able to help,” PTI quoted them saying.","Indian H-1B visa holders in US described the ""crazy sense of panic"" that ensued the community after Donald Trump-administration approved $1,00,000 fee on the work visas on Saturday.

BENGALURU: Congress government in Karnataka Saturday constituted an SIT to probe allegations of large-scale deletion of voter names from the electoral rolls in Kalaburagi district's Aland assembly constituency during the 2023 state election.The SIT was formed after Aland Congress MLA B R Patil lodged a police complaint alleging that the names of 6,670 voters across 256 polling stations were unlawfully deleted. Verification by election officers revealed that applications were filed for deletion of 6,018 voters, but only 24 were genuine. The remaining 5,994 were allegedly filed using fake mobile numbers and without the knowledge of the voters concerned.The SIT will be headed by ADGP (CID) B K Singh and will include SPs Saidulu Adavath and Shubhanwita.The team has been given the power to probe all related cases across Karnataka, with assistance from the CID and local police.

'Retired judges not keen on heading tribunals': Union minister Jitendra Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retired-judges-not-keen-on-heading-tribunals-union-minister-jitendra-singh/articleshow/124022859.cms,"Union minister Jitendra Singh (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Union minister Jitendra Singh said Saturday that administrative members had to be allowed to head Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) benches as not many retired judges and senior judicial officers were keen to accept post-retirement assignments in the tribunal. Addressing the 10th All India Conference of CAT, Singh said the job offer was not attractive or they had more lucrative avenues at hand.""We can't talk much about this because if we do then judges will get angry. If a common man gets angry, then the judge can reprimand him. But if a judge gets angry, no one can reprimand him,"" he said.CJI BR Gavai said govt must improve the service condition of judicial and administrative members of CAT to attract more retired judges and judicial officers to take up the assignments.CAT comprises a chairman and members who can be drawn from the judicial field or administrative side, the latter usually being experienced public administrators.Ahead of his remarks on CAT administrative members being averse to ruling against govt, the CJI said, ""nowadays one does not know how his statement would be portrayed in social media"". He was reflecting on his recent brush with the untamed communication medium's portrayal of his remarks while dismissing a PIL seeking restoration of the decapitated idol of Lord Vishnu at Khajuraho.The CJI's remark appeared to be a riposte to Singh who said though late Arun Jaitley was against making administrative members head the bench on the ground that they would not know how to write judgments, he was convinced by 2-3 senior bureaucrats that senior civil servants, after a service of 30-35 years, are well acquainted with service laws and can write judgments. ""We brought an amendment allowing administrative members to head CAT benches,"" the minister said.The CJI also said judges must exercise their powers with humility and responsibility. Referring to a two month-old incident of a young lawyer fainting in the courtroom after being rebuked by a Bombay HC judge, Justice Gavai said, ""Due to conduct of some judges, there is discontent among lawyers. A young lawyer lost consciousness after being browbeaten by a HC judge. Lawyers and judges are equal partners in the justice delivery system and both need to collaborate for efficient functioning of the justice delivery mechanism. ""CJI Gavai, law minister Arun Ram Meghwal, Singh and attorney general R Venkataramani were on the same page on rising litigation in CAT despite its 95% disposal rate. All three agreed that bureaucrats need not authorise appeal against every CAT judgment. The CJI suggested a screening mechanism through a nodal officer to eliminate unnecessary filing of appeals, to which both Meghwal and Singh agreed.Singh said the govt had fixed 40 indices for categorisation as 'aspirational districts', a concept which he said is being replicated in other countries.",Union minister Jitendra Singh said administrative members had to be allowed to head Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) benches.

BENGALURU: Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission has removed 57 Christian sub-castes from the socio-educational survey beginning Monday, following objections from ministers, protests by SC/ST and OBC groups, and a suggestion by governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot.The decision means the survey questionnaire will not list sub-castes. Enumerators using a mobile app between Sept 22 and Oct 7 will record such responses under ""others"". Officials said respondents may still disclose their original caste before conversion, but those entries will also be filed under ""others"".CM Siddaramaiah asked the commission to exclude the names after the governor warned the list could deepen divides. Opposition BJP had objected, alleging the exercise could dilute the anti-conversion law and extend reservations to converted Christians.""The new nomenclature will normalise conversion and encourage the gullible to convert without fear of losing caste identity,"" Karnataka BJP Minorities Morcha president Anil Thomas said Saturday.Samajika Nyaya Jagriti Vedike president S Harish accused Congress govt of plotting ""to integrate Christians into Hindu OBC communities"" and of ""labelling Hindu communities as Christians"".Backward classes welfare minister Shiavaraj Tangadagi countered that govt had not assigned labels: ""During Kantharaju Commission survey, participants voluntarily identified themselves as such. The confusion was sorted out.""Siddaramaiah sought to cool tensions: ""This survey is to capture social and educational backwardness of people and to find out their religion.

Early roots in Bahadurgarh

Graduation at Hansraj College

Pursuing postgraduate studies at Delhi University

Beyond classrooms: Sports and student activism

Campaign promises and vision as President

The student politician as a product of DU’s ecosystem

Aryan Maan has secured a major win in Delhi University politics by being elected President of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) 2025. Representing the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ABVP ), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Maan’s victory reflects both his grassroots connect and the organisational strength of ABVP on campus. His journey from Bahadurgarh, Haryana, to the capital’s premier university system underscores the diverse social and academic backgrounds that shape Delhi University’s leadership.Born and raised in Bahadurgarh, Haryana, Aryan Maan’s student leadership stems from a background shaped by regional aspirations and a keen interest in youth mobilisation. His roots outside Delhi resonate with the significant number of students in the university who migrate from across India for higher education. This has also influenced his campaign themes of accessibility, affordability, and infrastructure reforms.Also See: Aryan Maan wins DUSU 2025 presidency as ABVP dominates Delhi University student elections Maan’s academic journey within Delhi University began at Hansraj College, where he pursued his undergraduate studies. He completed his B.Com degree in 2025, building a reputation not only as a diligent student but also as an active voice in campus debates. Hansraj, known for producing leaders in academia, politics, and business, gave him both the platform and networks to step into active student politics.Currently, Aryan Maan is enrolled in a Master’s programme in Library Science at Delhi University. This choice of discipline sets him apart from the conventional law, commerce, or political science tracks pursued by many student leaders. It also reflects his long-term academic interest in research, knowledge systems, and access to learning resources.Maan is also known as a football player, adding a sporting dimension to his personality. His active participation in athletics has contributed to his appeal among students who look for well-rounded leaders. Parallel to sports, his involvement in ABVP-led campaigns—ranging from protests against fee hikes to initiatives for improved campus infrastructure—strengthened his reputation as a hands-on organiser rather than a symbolic candidate.Also See: Who is Rahul Jhansla? The SBSC grad and law student who became DUSU Vice President 2025 For the 2025 DUSU elections, Aryan Maan outlined a set of promises centred on enhancing the student experience. These include subsidised metro passes, free Wi-Fi across campus, accessibility audits to support students with disabilities, upgraded sports facilities, and financial assistance for final-year research scholars. Now, with his election as DUSU President, the challenge will be in translating these commitments into concrete outcomes.Aryan Maan’s trajectory underlines how Delhi University continues to serve as a breeding ground for India’s next generation of leaders. With his blend of academic pursuit, athletic involvement, and grassroots activism, he represents a modern model of the student politician: one grounded in local roots, shaped by the university’s plural environment, and aspiring for a larger role in shaping youth-centric policy debates.","Aryan Maan has secured a major win in Delhi University politics by being elected President of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) 2025.

Kept inside airport for five days, taken to emergency room

'We are lost,' says Paramjit's brother





Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now. Paramjit is a green card holder and has been doing business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the last three decades. He was detained at Chicago O'Hare Airport on July 30 as he was returning from a trip to India, as he makes trips to India several times a year.Singh's attorney Luis Angeles toldthat his detention was absolutely illegal and that the government is increasing his health risks as Singh has a brain tumor and heart issues.But why was Singh arrested in the first place? His attorney and family members said that the government cited an incident from the past when Singh used a pay phone without paying. It was a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society,"" Angeles said.Also read: EB-5 investment visa cap reached for 2025, green card route paused till September 30 Narrating the harrowing details of what happened since Singh was detained, his family members revealed that he was kept inside the airport for five days.

Bihar polls announcement likely in first week of October,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-announcement-likely-in-first-week-of-october/articleshow/124021032.cms,"Caste data may fuel demand for sub-categories within OBCs

NEW DELHI: Election Commission is likely to announce the dates for the Bihar polls, which may be conducted in two phases, in the first week of October.The high-stakes showdown will test the governing NDA, led by CM Nitish Kumar , against a charged opposition, which is already in battle mode with Rahul Gandhi conducting a state-wide yatra against alleged vote theft, and RJD neta Tejashwi now leading another focused on unemployment and alleged corruption.This is Bihar's first state poll since Nitish government's landmark caste count in 2023, which has ignited fierce debates on social justice, reservations and power-sharing.For NDA, the elections are a chance to defy voter fatigue with a CM who has been at the helm for two decades now.Bihar’s elections have largely been fought along the fault lines of caste and the forthcoming round is unlikely to buck the pattern. The caste survey may have only sharpened the battle lines.Conducted under Nitish’s watch, it revealed that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) comprise 63% of the population, with Yadavs at 14%, EBCs at 36%, and others, such as Kushwahas and Kurmis, accounting for the rest. SCs comprise 19%, while the upper castes account for 15%.Many groups among Muslims, who have a share of 17% in the population, are categorised as OBCs, but they mostly vote along community lines.Armed with this data, govt hiked reservations from 50% to 65% for jobs and education, plus 10% for economically weaker sections.The move, supposed to win over the numerically dominant “backwards”, was stayed by Patna HC but helped Nitish further fortify his credentials as a champion of OBCs. Centre’s surprise nod to a national caste census in April 2025, announced by BJP-led government, has added fresh fuel to the fire. Once wary of the demand, the Modi govt embraced it after concluding that doing so would defang what had become the chief plank of the opposition and prevent it from reversing the momentum for Hindu consolidation.The data could fuel demand for sub-categorisation within OBCs. Barring a sharp deviation from the historical pattern, the elections are likely to be shaped by the caste factor, and in this regard the NDA does not appear to be especially disadvantaged vis-àvis the rival combination if it manages to prevent the newcomer Jan Suraj from eating into its upper-caste votes.","Bihar's elections have largely been fought along the fault lines of caste.

"Rs 70,000 crore schemes to regain India's maritime power",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-70000-crore-schemes-to-regain-indias-maritime-power/articleshow/124020212.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

NEW DELHI: In a move to build India’s maritime power, reduce dependence on foreign ships and be future-ready to face any supply chain disruption, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced three schemes entailing govt investment of over Rs 70,000 crore to boost the shipbuilding sector. These are a part of the govt’s agenda to propel India into the top 10 countries globally for both shipbuilding and ship ownership, and increase three-fold the share of global port cargo at Indian ports.At present, India ranks 16th globally in both shipbuilding and ship ownership, and only 7% of Indian-owned ships are built in India. Data also shows that the share of export-import (EXIM) cargo carried on Indian ships has declined sharply from 41% in FY1988 to just 5% in FY2023.In his address at Bhavnagar on Saturday, PM Modi said this has resulted in India paying approximately Rs 6 lakh crore annually to foreign shipping companies for their services—an amount nearly equivalent to the country’s defence budget.While the government will provide financial aid to shipbuilders under the Rs 25,000-crore Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme, the Rs 25,000-crore Maritime Development Fund will enable players to get long-term and low-cost financing.The third scheme — Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SDS), worth Rs 20,000 crore — will focus on providing capital assistance for greenfield shipbuilding mega clusters, through infrastructure support for common maritime facilities and land connectivity; capital aid to existing shipyards for capacity expansion; and establishment of an apex body for capability development.Sources said the programme has been finalised after drawing from the experience of major maritime nations such as China and South Korea, which have become top players in shipbuilding on account of govt-led financial support and cluster-based development. The schemes, having the potential to create nearly two crore direct and indirect jobs, are set to get Cabinet approval in the next two weeks.Officials said the SDS is crucial as it seeks to support the Indian shipbuilding industry in capacity and capability creation, and provide credit risk covers, something available in other countries. At present, only eight out of 61 shipyards in India are large or very large.On May 14, TOI had reported that the government has identified four land parcels of 2,000-3,000 acres each in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for developing greenfield shipbuilding and repair hubs.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced three schemes to boost the shipbuilding sector.

Two Men Accused Of Firing At Disha Patani's House Killed In Encounter

NEW DELHI: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday compared a shooter arrested in connection with the firing at actor Disha Patani’s Bareilly house to “Maareech”, a demon from Ramayan.Speaking at a function in Lok Bhawan, Adityanath said, “A criminal involved in crimes against women came from outside the state. He possibly entered like Maareech, but when the UP police’s bullet hit him, he admitted he entered wrongly and said he would never show such audacity again.” The CM added that this approach should be applied to every criminal who threatens women’s safety.Police said one of the five shooters involved in the Bareilly incident, Ramanivas, was arrested along with his associate Anil after an encounter on Friday.A video circulating on social media shows him lying on the ground with folded hands, saying, “Baba ke Uttar Pradesh mein kabhi nahi aayenge sir” (I will never come to Baba’s Uttar Pradesh again). He appeared to be referring to Adityanath.Senior superintendent of police Anurag Arya said Ramanivas sustained a bullet injury in his leg during the encounter.Police recovered a 32-bore pistol, four live cartridges, and four spent shells from the accused.During questioning, Ramanivas confessed to his role in the firing, police said.On 12 September, two men on a motorcycle reportedly fired nine shots at the Patani family’s house in the Civil Lines area in Bareilly. Disha's father Jagdish Patani, his wife Padma, and their children Khushboo and Suryansh were at home.

‘Don’t let Rambo die alone like Shankar’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-let-rambo-die-alone-like-shankar/articleshow/124017909.cms,"When 20-year-old Nikita Dhawan heard of Shankar’s death on Wednesday, it felt as if she had lost a close family member. For years, she had fought for the rescue of Delhi’s only African elephant, kept in solitary confinement at the city zoo. Now, she hopes Shankar’s passing will prevent a similar fate for Rambo, the only remaining African elephant in captivity at Mysuru Zoo.Dhawan first saw Shankar four years ago on a trip to Delhi Zoo with her parents, and felt something shift inside her. The elephant, one of two brought to India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe, stood alone, his feet bound with metallic chains. His companion had died in 2001, and since then, the elephant named after former Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma lived in isolation — a cruel fate for a species known for their social nature and desire for companionship.“At that time, he was chained for 17 hours a day. He was also in the proximity of trains, which was very harmful to his ears. He was showing a lot of stressful behaviour,” she says.Dhawan, whose love for wildlife stemmed from the many trips she made with her parents to sanctuaries, decided to channel her heartbreak into action. She started a non-profit called Youth for Animals to mobilise support and help Shankar get out of the zoo.Soon, other young volunteers joined, filed RTIs and sent letters to the Delhi Zoo and the Prime Minister. They also gathered video evidence of his physical and mental state. In 2022, they officially filed a public interest litigation in Delhi high court. “An inspection report for Shankar was ordered, but it was not done by an independent third-party. So, we didn’t feel like the results accurately reflected his condition,” Dhawan says. It was decided that Shankar would be kept at the zoo. Then, in March 2023, the Supreme Court increased the jurisdiction and powers of a high-powered committee led by Justice (retd) Deepak Verma, to conduct necessary checks and fact-finding exercises concerning wild animals, including those in captivity, across India. That brought hope to Dhawan, and she focused on getting transfer options ready for Shankar. “We knew something had to be done urgently. Elephants are very social animals, and you can’t just rip them out of the wild and make them live on their own. For nearly 13 years, Shankar had no visual or oral communication, even with the other Asian elephants at the zoo,” says Dhawan.UK-based Aspinall Foundation, which runs multiple sanctuaries across Africa, agreed to shift the lonely elephant, and take care of the expenses too. However, the domestic authorities wanted to keep Shankar in India, Dhawan says. Hence, the search for a domestic alternative began. Last summer, she visited Vantara, the animal rescue arm of Reliance Foundation in Jamnagar, which expressed interest in housing Shankar alongside other African elephants. “We sent that option to the high-powered committee, but received no response,” she says.Meanwhile, pressure began to mount on the Delhi zoo authorities. In Oct 2024, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended its license over concerns about Shankar’s living conditions. The body asked the authorities to either improve the conditions or relocate him. However, before that could happen, Shankar passed away at the age of 29, years before the species’ average life expectancy of 70. An inquiry has been ordered into the cause of the death, while zoo officials claim that Shankar showed no signs of illness and the collapse was sudden. “I feel that the zoo had the option and the funding to make a better life for Shankar, but they chose not to take it. I do believe his death was preventable,” Dhawan emphasises.Currently studying at Stanford University, she hopes that the death will urge more Indian youngsters to speak up against the exploitation of animals for public entertainment. Her focus is now Rambo, the African elephant in Mysuru who has been alone since 2016 following the death of his father. “I really hope that Shankar’s death highlights the need to save Rambo before it’s too late.”","Shankar, Delhi's only African elephant, died on Wednesday at the age of 29.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the appreciable jump in states’ debt highlighted by the CAG, Congress said the public debt of states has tripled in the last decade, rising from Rs 17.57 lakh crore in 2013 to Rs 59.60 lakh crore in 2022. The party said the states are victims of “coercive federalism” being followed by the Modi government which is not sharing revenues with them as desired, accusing the centre of playing “cess politics”.AICC spokesman and Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Surjewala said the public debt of states now amounts to 23% of the combined GSDP of 28 states, but the states are being stripped of their fiscal independence through the Modi government’s handling of the GST Compensation Cess and arbitrary central levies. He said this has resulted in “double jeopardy” for states of mounting debt and shrinking revenues.“Rs 1,70,000 crore is collected every year from ‘cesses and surcharges’, but the centre keeps it without sharing anything with states. ‘Compensation Cess’ was created to pay the states for GST losses, which ended in June 2022. Now, the same cess is only used to repay Central loans. Beyond Oct 2025, there is no constitutional mandate to continue with it, yet the Centre wants to hold it exclusively,” he said, demanding that the Centre share the cess with the states for the coming ten years.Surjewala said there appears to be a deliberate attempt to cripple the states and hollow out their functionality, to unionise power in the hands of the Centre. “This is ‘coercive federalism’ that seeks to convert the states into ‘glorified municipal committees’,” he added.The Congress MP warned that post rate cuts, GST collections will dip steeply in the future, with the shortfall likely to be Rs 40,000 crore as per the Centre and Rs 80,000 crore as per the SBI, while other estimates peg it at Rs 1.5-2.5 lakh crore. “The states will lose half or more of this, but neither GST nor Cess will flow to them,” he said.",The public debt of states has tripled in the last decade.

Of these, 1,808 are categorised as special-needs children.Of the 4,515 adoptions, 4,155 children found families within the country while 360 were international/inter-country adoptions. Maharashtra, where the domestic adoption count was 790, was followed by Tamil Nadu (438) and West Bengal (297). In international adoptions, Maharashtra led with a tally of 59, followed by Punjab (41) and Bengal (31).The average waiting time for PAPs is three-and-a-half years. Most PAPs seek girls and those aged 0-2 years, leaving older children and those with special needs under-placed. As many as 2,554 children adopted in FY 2024-25 were girls, accounting for 56% of all adoptions in India.""One reason is, more girls are given up than boys, making them available for adoption,"" said Vinita Bhargava, formerly with Cara as its founder member.A senior women and child development (WCD) dept official said, ""Some parents believe girls are more caring and affectionate, and are more likely to look after their parents in old age. Some feel girls adapt more easily to family life. Social awareness and single women often preferring to adopt girls are other reasons.""Many PAPs believe it is easier to build emotional connections with infants and younger children. The official said, ""For some, adopting younger children provides greater scope to shape their values, personality and upbringing. Others want to experience the entire parenting journey - from infancy to adulthood.""For older children, adoptions become trickier. ""Children above seven are harder to place, though many older children are legally free and waiting,"" said social worker Jayprakash Jadhav from Arun Ashray Charitable Trust, a specialised adoption agency registered with Cara. For children with special needs, challenges increase. According to a WCD ministry report, only 364 kids with special needs were reserved for adoption in 2024. The WCD official said, ""Adopting older children and those with special needs may involve challenges like attachment issues, behavioural concerns or certain medical requirements.""","Over 36,000 prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) are on the waiting list at present.

Some stargazers took it as a meteor shower, while others speculated it to be part of debris of an old satellite falling on Earth. However, there is no official confirmation about it.The dazzling streak of light was visible across several cities, including Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and even in Aligarh. Videos of the lit-up skyline surfaced on social media platforms, showing a fiery trail shooting across the night sky before fragmenting into smaller pieces. Eyewitnesses reported the bright object over Delhi and Noida around 1.20 am on Saturday. When contacted by TOI, Isro remained silent on Saturday’s mysterious skyline event.Shresth Gautam, an influencer, shared a video and wrote, “Can you believe this happened last night over Delhi at 1:20 AM? It started as a usual Friday but ended unlike any other. I have never seen anything like it. Most probably it’s meteor debris, but no words can do justice to the view.”Another X user Ujjwal Yadav said, “Just witnessed this incredible fire streak in the night sky...Looks like a meteor or maybe part of a rocket burning up in the atmosphere-nature's own light show from my rooftop. Did anyone else spot it too?"" Yet another post from Gurgaon described it as a meteor shower: “Meteor Showers over Sector 77, Gurgaon at 1:25 AM. It was a bright streak of light... Extremely beautiful and fortunate to watch. ""A Grok comment on X suggested the lights were likely space debris from a Chinese CZ-3B rocket body reentering Earth's atmosphere. The claim was based on video analysis and predictions, pointing to the object's slower speed and visible fragmentation.Earlier, space experts had predicted that two newly-discovered comets would brighten the heavens in mid-October. A newly discovered comet, C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and another comet, C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), could become visible to naked eyes. The predictions said that stargazers may witness the rare sight of two comets and a meteor shower peaking together in the same week.However, there is no confirmation yet that Saturday’s mysterious skyline event was linked to these comets.","The dazzling streak of light was visible across several cities, including Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and even in Aligarh.

NEW DELHI: Counting sports facilities as community resources, Supreme Court has said these cannot be concentrated in the hands of the rich and elite in urban areas even though many youngsters from poor rural backgrounds have stormed into the national sporting arena by the dint of their talent and resolve.While finalising the constitution of All India Football Federation on Friday, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said, ""It is also necessary to ensure that sporting facilities and opportunities are not concentrated in the hands of the urban economic elite, and that the revenues from sporting events, intellectual property and media rights are so distributed to subserve and encourage accessible and affordable sport in our country. ""Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha said the time is ripe to recognise that sporting ""facilities and opportunities"" are ""material resources of the community"", and the regulating bodies of different sports as ""the institutions of national life"".""As 'places of public resort', sporting institutions and bodies must remain accessible, not just for pursuing sport, but also for its administration.

However, it said through a judicial fiat it cannot create fraternity, an avowed objective of the Constitution apart from justice (social, economic, political), liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship), and equality (of status and opportunity). ""Unlike rights that can be enforced through law, fraternity is not amenable to judicial command; it must be nurtured through lived experiences of unity, trust, and shared endeavour.

NEW DELHI: Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma on Saturday said govt was willing to positively consider the CPI(Maoist) offer to lay down arms and start peace negotiations, but the outfit must immediately stop civilian killings and remove IEDs it had planted across its areas of influence, reports Bharti Jain .“The CPI(Maoist) letter issued by its spokesperson Abhay was written on Aug 15 but issued a month later. But even after Aug 15, there have been killings of two shikshadoots (temporary, visiting teachers), on Aug 27 in Bijapur and on Aug 29 in Sukma. On Sept 2, two more civilians were killed by Maoists in Sukma,” he said.The CPI(Maoist) offer to suspend armed ‘struggle’ and the wanton killing of civilians and IED ambushes cannot go together. The leadership must first instruct its cadres on the ground to end civilian killings and de-mine the network of IEDs they have planted,” Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma told TOI .Inspector general, Bastar range, P Sunderraj added that it would take Maoists no more than a week to deactivate the IEDs — laid across ‘core areas’ in the Dandakaranya region and on Bihar-Jharkhand border —if such a directive was issued by the top leadership.The Chhattisgarh deputy CM said the final call on CPI(Maoist)’s peace offer will be taken by the top political leadership, comprising the prime minister and home minister, after careful consideration and due consultation with all the stakeholders.“We are ready to welcome Maoists with open arms if they choose to come forward, including starting with a video call, and lay down arms; we will ensure their rehabilitation and reintegration into the mainstream,” said the Chattisgarh deputy CM.For the time being, he underlined, there is no directive to the counterNaxal forces to scale down operations.As per intelligence reports, a secret meeting had purportedly taken place in Aug among a few top CPI (Maoist) leaders, including Mallojula Venugopal Rao, alias ‘Abhay’. Thippiri Tirupathi, alias Devji, the new general secretary after the neutralisation of Basavaraju in May, had attended the meeting, a source claimed. The discussions were focused on the crackdown by the forces in their old pocket boroughs and the way forward. “We are still evaluating if Devji is on the same page as Abhay on laying down arms, even though the Aug 15 statement was issued by the latter as the CPI(Maoist) spokesperson,” a senior intelligence officer said but added that even if a section of leadership favours peace talks, it should be followed through.The confusion within the CPI(Maoist) on the peace move has arisen thanks to a statement issued by its Telangana state committee on Friday, disagreeing with the unconditional peace offer of ‘Abhay’ alias Sonu and insisting that it was not “authorized” by the party.""Had Devji and Abhay, two of CPI(Maoist) seniormost leaders, been in agreement, the Telangana state committee would not have dared to issue such a statement,"" said an officer.The Telangana committee, in the statement dated Sept 19, opined that it was immature ""to say in public that there were no internal consultations on laying down arms, and asking for a month for the same"".""When a leader/cadre wants to give up the path of violence and join the mainstream, he discusses it within the party forum and gets approval. By not consulting the party formations, a state of confusion has arisen between the party and its military formations,” the Telangana committee noted and asked all extremist and political formations to disregard the unconditional peace offer made through Abhay. “The struggle against fascist BJP and its anti-people policies must be intensified,” it stated.","Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma said govt was willing to positively consider the CPI(Maoist) offer to lay down arms and start peace negotiations.

NEW DELHI: Government said Friday it had taken note of the US state department statement announcing revocation of sanctions waiver for Chabahar Port , adding that it is examining its implications for India.India has been actively working with Tehran since 2015 to develop Chabahar Port in Iran, as it provides India an alternative and reliable maritime access route into Afghanistan, and to Central Asia utilising the Zaranj-Delaram road it built in Afghanistan.Looking to isolate Iran, the US earlier this week revoked the sanctions exception issued in 2018 under Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA) for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance and economic development, effective Sept 29, 2025.“Once the revocation is effective, persons who operate the Chabahar Port or engage in other activities described in IFCA may expose themselves to sanctions under IFCA,” said the state department, leading to concerns in India about how the decision might impact India’s involvement in developing the port that is also important to counter China’s expanding presence in the region. India has committed to providing a Line of Credit worth $250 million in rupee equivalent for the development of Chabahar Port.","India has been actively working with Tehran since 2015 to develop Chabahar Port in Iran.

Kapoor directed Yes Bank to invest in ADA Group companies despite warnings, and funds were allegedly siphoned out.

MUMBAI: The CBI Thursday filed a chargesheet against Anil Ambani, chairman of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, along with Rana Kapoor, co-founder of Yes Bank, and the latter's wife, Bindu, and daughters, Radha Kapoor & Roshni, for fraudulent loan transactions that resulted in a loss of Rs 2,797 crore to the bank.The chargesheet says the bank under Kapoor's directions invested in debentures and commercial debt paper issued by ADA's commercial finance (RCFL) and home finance (RHFL) companies despite a credit ratings agency placing them ""under watch"" for poor performance. It says the funds were subsequently siphoned out and, in a ""quid pro quo"", the Yes Bank promoter's family-run firms received massive loans from ADA companies.CBI has previously investigated several others for defrauding Yes Bank, including DHFL's erstwhile promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan.In a press release issued on Thursday, the CBI said it had filed a chargesheet pertaining to two cases related to fraudulent transactions between Anil Ambani's group companies, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Limited (RHFL), and Rana Kapoor, his wife Bindu Kapoor, and their daughters Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor and companies owned by them.The chargesheet named Anil Ambani, Rana Kapoor, Bindu Kapoor, Radha Kapoor, Roshni Kapoor, RCFL, RHFL (now Authum Investment & Infrastructure Ltd), RAB Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Imagine Estate Pvt Ltd, Bliss House Pvt Ltd, Imagine Habitat Pvt Ltd, Imagine Residence Pvt Ltd, and Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd.

These investments were made with the approval of Kapoor, despite Care Ratings placing ADA Group's financial companies ""under watch"" due to deteriorating financial standing and adverse market assessment. The CBI said Anil Ambani was the chairman of ADA Group and also served as a director of Reliance Capital Ltd, the holding company of RCFL and RHFL.The CBI stated that ""funds invested in RCFL and RHFL by Yes Bank were subsequently siphoned through multiple layers, demonstrating a systematic diversion of public money."" The investigation revealed a ""conspiracy between Rana Kapoor and Anil Ambani"" and that ""as quid pro quo, Anil Ambani, the then Chairman of ADA Group, obtained credit facilities from RCFL and RHFL at concessional rates for Rana Kapoor's loss-making family entities, i.e. , companies owned by Bindu Kapoor, Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor.""The CBI further stated that the ""fraudulent arrangement resulted in a massive wrongful loss to Yes Bank amounting to Rs 2,797 crore and corresponding unlawful gain to RCFL, RHFL and other companies of ADA Group, as well as companies owned by Rana Kapoor's family members.""Additionally, Reliance Nippon Mutual Funds (RNMF), another subsidiary of Reliance Capital Ltd, on instructions from Anil Ambani, invested Rs 1,160 crore during 2017-18 in non-convertible debentures of Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd, an entity owned by Rana Kapoor's family.","CBI files chargesheet against Anil Ambani, Rana Kapoor, and Kapoor's family for fraudulent loan transactions.

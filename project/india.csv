‘Slavery Destroys Heritage’: PM Modi’s Big Message After Unveiling Sacred Buddha Piprahwa Relics

NEW DELHI: Calling India not only the custodian of Lord Buddha’s sacred relics but also the living carrier of his tradition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated a first-of-itskind international exposition of the Buddha’s Piprahwa relics, reliquaries and gem relics that were recently repatriated to India.Noting that the the departure from India and eventual return of the sacred relics of Buddha are both significant lessons in themselves, PM Modi stressed “slavery is not only political and economic, but it also destroys our heritage”. He remarked that the same happened with the sacred relics of Lord Buddha, which were taken away during colonial rule.He asserted that “for India, the sacred relics are not merely artefacts; they are a part of our revered heritage and an inseparable part of our civilisation”.PM also reflected on India’s role in spreading the message of Buddha around the world with the sacred relics having travelled from India to different countries with significant Buddhist populations, including Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia and Russia, “where waves of faith and devotion arose” with people turning up to pay homage in large numbers.Speaking at the function organised at Qila Rai Pithora Cultural Complex where he inaugurated the exposition ‘Light and the Lotus: Relics of the Awakened One’, PM underlined that this “shared heritage of Lord Buddha is proof that India is not connected merely through politics, diplomacy and economy, but through deeper bonds.We are connected through mind and emotions, through faith and spirituality.”On the site of the exhibition which will be open to public from Sunday, PM said the space reflected India’s glorious history, where nearly a thousand years ago former rulers established a city surrounded by strong and secure walls.He recalled that the sacred relics returned to India after more than 125 years at the intervention of govt and the Godrej Group.Highlighting that Buddha’s Abhidhamma, his words, and his teachings were originally in Pali, PM Modi said, “We are striving to make Pali accessible to the common people. For this reason, Pali has been accorded the status of a classical language, which will make it easier to understand and explain the Dhamma in its original essence.”Striking a personal note, Modi said his birthplace, Vadnagar in Gujarat, was a major centre of Buddhist studies and Sarnath near Varanasi, where Lord Buddha delivered his first sermon, was his karmabhoomi . Modi is MP from Varanasi. He also shared that during his travels to China, Japan, Korea, and Mongolia, he carried saplings of the Bodhi tree.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated a first-of-itskind international exposition of the Buddha’s Piprahwa relics, reliquaries and gem relics that were recently repatriated to India.

From tents to towers: Mumbai pilgrims are opting for highrise-Haj in Mina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-tents-to-towers-mumbai-pilgrims-are-opting-for-highrise-haj-in-mina/articleshow/126330464.cms,"Former actor Sana Khan, who stepped away from the entertainment industry in 2020 and married cleric-businessman Mufti Anas the same year, is preparing for Haj later this year. It will be her fourth pilgrimage, but this one comes with a different experience.For the first time, Khan will not be staying in Mina’s famed tent city. Instead, she and her husband will spend five days in a multi-storey tower in the Mina valley, close to Mecca. The shift that reflects a transformation in how some pilgrims now experience Haj.Sana is among the first wave of Indians opting to stay at a tower in Mina during the Haj. Staying for five days at Mina, traditionally known as the ‘tent city’, is a mandatory ritual of Haj. For centuries, pilgrims from across the world who visited Mecca for the annual pilgrimage stayed in these temporary ‘khemas’ or tents.However, in the last couple of years, Saudi authorities built several towers in the Mina valley and offered pilgrims accommodation in these multi-storey towers with enhanced amenities like air-conditioned, spacious rooms, clean toilets, bigger kitchens and wider prayer areas.The Haj division of the ministry of minority affairs in India asked private Haj pilgrims to book their seats by January 15.“Timely booking will help avoid lastminute difficulties and ensure smooth, well-organised arrangements for this sacred journey,” said minority affairs minister Kiran Rijiju in an X post. Out of 1,75,000 Indian Haj quota, 52,000 will travel through Haj group organisations and private tour operators, while the rest will use services of the Haj Committee of India.Several organisers and tour operators are reaching out to affluent pilgrims with packages for an ‘upgraded Haj experience’ and the lure of ‘classic and premium packages that now include a shift from tents to Mina Towers’, reads an online ad of Al Khalid Tours and Travels. “Shift from tents to towers is being done in phases. Stay at the towers is hassle-free and suited to change in weather,” says Khalid Kherada of Al Khalid Tours and Travels.The orthodox do not approve of the transition from tents to towers at Mina.“Tents have a primitive feel, even though they’re also air-conditioned. However, Shariat, or Islamic laws, do not prescribe that the stay at Mina mandatorily be in tents,” says a senior cleric requesting anonymity.","Sana Khan is among the first wave of Indians opting to stay at a tower in Mina during the Haj.

"In a 1st in world, Army set to deploy ramjet-powered shells for 155mm artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-world-army-set-to-deploy-ramjet-powered-shells-for-155mm-artillery-guns/articleshow/126330397.cms,"From Missiles To Torpedoes, DRDO Outlines India’s Big Defence Push For Near-Term Battlefield Edge

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: In a unique initiative, the J&K govt on Saturday brought together more than 100 mosque imams to spread awareness about heroin addiction as cases of drug abuse continue to rise across the region.The imams were assembled for a workshop at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS) in Srinagar. Senior officials and doctors briefed the religious leaders about their role in removing stigma from such patients in the community and encouraging them to seek medical help. They also asked them to spread awareness about harmful impacts of substance abuse in society.Divisional commissioner (Kashmir), Anshul Garg, said the active cooperation of religious scholars was crucial in sensitising people, particularly the youth, about the harmful and dangerous effects of drug abuse.“Through Friday sermons and other religious gatherings, scholars can send a strong message that drug consumption is prohibited in all religions and that it destroys individuals, families and society,” Garg said.He said the government would follow a three-stage strategy to deal with the menace, focusing on awareness campaigns, identification of drug users, and counselling and rehabilitation.Srinagar deputy commissioner Akshay Labroo said the administration is taking strong measures to curb drug abuse.Dr Arshad Hussain, head of the department of psychiatry, IMHANS-Kashmir, highlighted the growing burden of substance use disorders in the region and stressed the importance of early intervention and community participation in prevention efforts.Earlier, mental health experts in their detailed presentations on the subject.In the early years, drug addiction was rare in the Valley, they said, adding that between 1980 and 1990, only seven opium users were treated at the then psychiatric hospital, now called IMHANS-Kashmir. In 1992, the total number of substance-use patients had risen to 198. During the 1990s, doctors mostly saw patients who had become dependent on medicinal opioids prescribed or advised by chemists for sleep, anxiety and stress.By 2000, the Drug De-addiction Centre Srinagar run by IMHANS-Kashmir started seeing increasing misuse of drugs like Spasmoproxyvon, codeine and pentazocine, which were abused for their sedative effects. Then cannabis use became widespread but after 2018 a large number of users shifted to heroin. In 2020, the centre recorded 7,403 patients. In 2021, the number of new and follow-up patients rose to 23,403, and in 2022 it reached 41,110.According to the survey, “Prevalence and Pattern of Substance Use Disorders in Ten Districts of Kashmir” carried out by the IMHANS Kashmir in 2023, the Valley has estimated 67468 substance-dependent individuals. The survey said heroin is the most widely used opioid.",The imams were assembled for a workshop at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Srinagar.

From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: India’s installed energy capacity has risen by nearly 36% overpast five years, increasing from 375 GW in Dec 2020 to almost 510 GW in the corresponding month of 2025.The growth has been driven largely by new and renewable energy — wind, solar, bioenergy and small hydro — which expanded by 122% during the period, from 91.1 GW to 203.6 GW, an addition of 112 GW. Including hydro and nuclear power, non-fossil sources now account for 263 GW, or 51.6%, of the country’s total installed capacity. In comparison, the share of fossil fuelbased capacity — coal, lignite, gas and diesel — has increased by 5.6% since Dec 2020.The new and renewable energy ministry said India recorded its highest-ever annual green capacity addition in 2025, with 44.5 GW added till Nov 30, largely due to a surge in solar installations. Solar capacity alone rose by 35 GW during the year to 132.9 GW, while wind power added 5.8 GW, taking total capacity to 54 GW.Large hydro capacity increased from 45.8 GW to 50.4 GW over five years, while nuclear power capacity saw a marginal rise from 6.8 GW in 2020 to 8.8 GW in 2025. Officials said all installed capacity was grid-connected and generation-ready, with transmission systems planned and implemented in line with phased capacity additions.The passage of the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill, 2025, which allows the entry of private players into the previously restricted nuclear sector, is expected to boost nuclear capacity.","India’s installed energy capacity has risen by nearly 36% overpast five years.

EU carbon tax to hurt developing countries with extra costs: CSE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-carbon-tax-to-hurt-developing-countries-with-extra-costs-cse/articleshow/126330313.cms,"From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: As the European Union’s carbon border tax comes into effect from January 1, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a New Delhi-based think tank, Saturday warned that the move would shift the decarbonisation costs on to developing countries including India. It said decarbonisation is critically important, but should not be pushed through unilateral measures like Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which is expected to generate 1.5 billion euros annually for EU nations by 2028 at the cost of the Global South.CBAM — carbon border tax — is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive goods (emission generated during production), like iron & steel, aluminium, cement and fertilisers, that are entering the 27 EU nations. It will put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries and impact their trade.Noting its implication for India, the CSE’s analysis shows that CBAM could impose substantial cost pressures on steel and aluminium exports to the EU and it could face a price burden of around 25% — a shock that exporters are likely to absorb through price compression in order to remain competitive. This is the reason India and many other countries, including China and South Africa, have been resisting it for long.“By putting a carbon price at the border, CBAM changes how competitiveness is defined in global trade. But what it also does is shift the decarbonisation costs to developing countries, thus extending a familiar dynamic where developing countries adapt to rules set elsewhere, under conditions that structurally disadvantage them,” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.“Decarbonisation in industry is both necessary and unavoidable. Developing countries will need to pursue decarbonisation to remain competitive. However, this transition can’t be driven through unilateral steps alone,” she said.Since the entire amount collected as carbon border tax would go to the EU nations (75% to EU budget and 25% to national budget) without actually helping out other countries’ decarbonisation efforts, the CSE has recommended that developed countries like India should collect a carbon tax domestically at point of exports, so that the funds can be directed towards decarbonisation of domestic industry, whilst also meeting the CBAM’s carbon pricing criteria.“This can help reduce the carbon intensity of manufacturing. It will also ensure a level playing field and also provide funds for countries of the Global South to invest in low carbon growth,” said Avantika Goswami, programme manager (climate change), CSE.A CSE’s product-wise analysis of CBAM-covered sectors and their corresponding exports from India shows that the country’s CBAM-covered goods’ exports to the EU comprised nearly 10% of its total goods exports to the EU in the year 2022-23. By value, this was about 0.2% of India’s GDP in that financial year.These exports comprise about one-fourth (25.7%) of India’s total goods exports to the world for the CBAM-covered sectors, which is not insignificant for the industries operating in these sectors. These are iron and steel, aluminium,fertilizers and cement. Currently, hydrogen and electricity are not exported from India to the EU.Flagging adverse impact of the carbon border tax, developing countries, including India, China and South Africa, have highlighted at several multilateral fora that the climate-linked trade measures such as CBAM risk increasing the overall cost of climate action, fragmenting multilateral cooperation, and shifting mitigation burdens onto countries with lower historical emissions and weaker capacities. The developing countries have also questioned the compatibility of CBAM with WTO rules. The issue was also flagged big time at the UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil in Nov last year.",Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to generate 1.5 billion euros annually for EU nations by 2028.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry. Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126234204,imgsize-648989,width-400,resizemode-4/bahrain-golden-residency.jpg"

‘Avoid All Non-Essential Travel To Venezuela’: India Issues Advisory For Citizens After US Strikes

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Saturday ""strongly advised"" Indians to avoid all non-essential travel to Venezuela, which was hit by multiple strikes by the United States.The MEA also said an email id (cons.caracas@mea.gov.in) and the emergency phone number (+58-412-9584288 / also for WhatsApp calls) to assist Indians amid the uncertain development in the South American nation.Earlier today, the US Persident Donald Trump announced that the US had captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a military operation early on Saturday, following weeks of escalating pressure from the Trump administration.Speaking on Fox News, Trump said the US would play a central role in shaping Venezuela’s future. “We'll be involved in it very much,” he said, adding: “We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left.”Hours after the confirmation, Trump addressed the media, saying: “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.”The 47th POTUS described the raid as “one of the most stunning attacks and effective and powerful displays of American military might and competence in American history”.He claimed that no other country could have carried out such an operation, particularly within such a short timeframe. “No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday,” Trump said, adding that Venezuelan military capabilities had been completely neutralised.","The ministry of external affairs on Saturday ""strongly advised"" Indians to avoid all non-essential travel to Venezuela.

Underwater tunnel across Brahmaputra gets govt nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/underwater-tunnel-across-brahmaputra-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/126315989.cms,"The tunnel would be of great strategic significance due to its proximity to Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China. (AI image for representative purpose)

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Saturday released Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad following a directive from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).KKR had picked Mustafizur Rahman for Rs 9.20 crore at the IPL auction held in December. However, his selection triggered a political backlash in India after reports emerged of recent mob violence and lynching incidents involving Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.Following the BCCI’s directive, Mustafizur Rahman will not be part of the IPL 2026 season, and the franchise has been permitted to name a replacement player in accordance with league rules.In a media advisory, KKR said, “Kolkata Knight Riders confirms that BCCI/IPL as the regulator of IPL has instructed it to release Mustafizur Rahman from the squad ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season.” The franchise added that the release was carried out after due process and consultations, and that the BCCI would allow a replacement player as per IPL regulations.The controversy drew reactions from political leaders, with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor coming forward in Mustafizur Rahman’s support, while the BJP strongly opposed his selection and targeted KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan , calling him a “traitor.”Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said sports should be separated from political tensions. “Cricket should not be made to bear the burden for attacks on minorities in Bangladesh,” he told reporters, adding that Mustafizur Rahman had no role in the violence.“Mustafizur Rahman is a cricketer and has nothing to do with any of these things. He has not been personally accused of any hate speech or condoning or defending any attacks. Mixing these two things is simply not fair,” Tharoor said.He also cautioned against isolating neighbouring countries. “If we become a country that isolates all of our neighbours, and say nobody is playing with any of them, how does it do any good? It is purely a sporting decision, and we should not let politics come into this,” he added.Congress leader and Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge criticised the BJP for targeting the IPL franchise, saying overseas players participate in the league as per BCCI and IPL rules.In a post on X, Kharge said, “The BJP and their 'Vichar Parivaar' are outraged over the inclusion of a Bangladeshi player in the IPL. If an overseas player is in IPL, it is because BCCI or the IPL rules allow him. Instead of blaming the franchise, shouldn't the BJP leaders ask why BCCI is allowing Bangladesh players to participate in IPL, when they should be banning it.”He further cited past instances to criticise BJP leaders. “The same BJP leaders have no problem when: India played with Pakistan soon after the Pahalgam attack. IPL shifted matches to Islamic countries during COVID. IPL auctions are held in Islamic countries… For BJP, 'nationalism' appears only when it suits their politics,” Kharge added.Congress MP Tariq Anwar defended KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan, calling it inappropriate to target the actor. He said foreign players can only be included after due permission from cricketing authorities and under international norms.Reacting to the controversy, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said the focus should be on who permitted Bangladeshi players to be included in the IPL auction in the first place.Speaking to ANI, she said, ""First of all, I want to ask who put the Bangladeshi players in that pool. This question is for the BCCI and the ICC. Home Minister's son, Jay Shah, should answer who put the Bangladeshi players in the pool where IPL players are bought and sold, the pool where the players' auction takes place... he is the ICC's chief and the main decision-maker in cricket all around the world.""BJP leader Sangeet Som welcomed the BCCI’s decision and launched a sharp attack on Shah Rukh Khan, calling him a “traitor.” He cited repeated violence against religious minorities in Bangladesh and claimed Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.“Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan… invest it in players from a country that is working against India,” Som told ANI, adding that the cricketer would not be able to play in the tournament.Uttar Pradesh Minister Narendra Kashyap also praised the BCCI’s move, saying it respected national sentiment. “We welcome the decision of the BCCI that they understood the sentiments of the nation and removed the Bangladeshi player,” he said.Former India cricketer Madan Lal and World Cup winner supported Shah Rukh Khan, saying the actor had no role in team selection.“This is the decision of the BCCI and the Central government must have taken this decision, given the atrocities are being committed against Hindus in Bangladesh,” he told ANI.He added, “There is no fault of Shah Rukh Khan as they have the team who picks the team.”National President of the All India Muslim Jamaat, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, said there was no act of betrayal in Shah Rukh Khan selecting a Bangladeshi player.Meanwhile, Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi of the All India Imam Organisation said Shah Rukh Khan should apologise to the nation over the selection.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam had urged Shah Rukh Khan to remove the Bangladeshi player, saying it would protect India’s interests and prevent the actor from becoming a target.Hindus in Bangladesh have been victims of mob violence and lynching in the aftermath of protests and the killing of student leader Osman Hadi. On December 18, 2025, Dipu Chandra Das was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy charges in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. In another incident, a Hindu youth, Amrit Mondal, was lynched in Rajbari district, triggering protests and strong reactions in India.","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad following a directive from the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

Judge Gautam Baruah ordered notices to Sharma and Dhirasaria to explain why the unit should not be attached by Jan 17.In his order, the judge noted SIT submission that the amount invested by Sharma arose from money misappropriated from Zubeen and was among the prime motives to premeditate the murder.

INDORE: The Madhya Pradesh govt removed Indore municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav and suspended additional commissioner Rohit Sisoniya on Friday, its first major action in the contaminated water tragedy in Indore's Bhagirathpura, since people began falling ill on Dec 29 in a city ranked on multiple occasions as India's cleanest. The action came on a day the death toll in the tragedy rose to 10 with the death of a 68-year-old woman.Pradeep Nigam, in-charge superintendent engineer of Indore Municipal Corporation's (IMC) water distribution department, was also removed from his post. Three additional commissioners - Akash Prakhar Singh and Ashish Kumar Pathak - were posted to the IMC after a meeting chaired by additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey, who has been camping in Indore.Submitting a status report, the state govt, however, told the MP high court Friday that only four deaths had been recorded. Indore mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava said Friday he had information of 10 deaths due to the diarrhoea outbreak in Bhagirathpura.According to health department data, four people have died due to the diarrhoea outbreak in Bhagirathpura. However, I have received information about 10 deaths due to this outbreak,” the mayor said.“A total of 294 patients have been admitted, of which 93 have been discharged. Around 201 patients are still admitted and 32 patients are in ICUs,” the status report submitted to HC said.Hours before the IMC shake-up, CM Mohan Yadav wrote on X: “I reviewed action being taken by state govt in the Indore contaminated drinking water case with the chief secretary and other senior officials and issued necessary directions. I also discussed the report presented by the additional chief secretary in charge of the urban development department.”“We have taken the contaminated water case with utmost seriousness. We have taken action against those found guilty of negligence. There will be no compromise when it comes to health of the people. We will fix responsibility and ensure strict action,” the CM wrote on X.As the administrative changes unfolded, a flurry of activity was noticed in Bhagirathpura, where IMC workers cleaned streets and supplied water in tankers, health workers checked patients and distributed medicines, and ASHA workers conducted door-to-door surveys, checking on children. On Friday, gloom pervaded the residence of Geetabai Dhruvkar, 68. “She was admitted with diarrhoea and vomiting... Her kidneys gave way. She died Friday morning,” said her brother-in-law, Chandrashekhar Dhruvkar.Indore Municipal Corporation vehicles made announcements in Bhagirathpura asking people to avoid using tap water, which was being flushed after plugging all leakages and tested for contamination, and use tanker water. Residents were told to boil their drinking water.","The Madhya Pradesh govt removed Indore municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav and suspended additional commissioner Rohit Sisoniya on Friday.

The year 2026 is finally here and we know it will not be a routine stop on the electoral calendar. This year's calendar is filled with elections, starting with the long-overdue Mumbai-Pune civic polls. Later, with high-stakes assembly elections due in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry , it will place some of the most influential politicians under rare and sustained scrutiny. For many leaders, the results will define not just the fate of their governments and party, but also their relevance heading into the 2029 Lok Sabha elections.Across these five states and a Union Territory, regional parties are strong and national parties are testing the outer limits of their expansion. What unfolds in 2026 will reshape the party's existence, recalibrate the opposition's cohesion and test the BJP ’s claim of being a truly pan-Indian force. At the centre of it all are a dozen leaders whose careers may pivot decisively over the year.West Bengal remains one of the most politically charged battlegrounds of 2026. The pre-campaign has already started with high-voltage remarks amid the Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise.For Mamata Banerjee, this election comes after a decade in uninterrupted power. Having crushed the Left and successfully repelled the BJP’s surge in the 2021 assembly elections, she now faces her toughest test yet.BJP's momentum stalled in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after it managed to win only 12 out of 40 seats. In the 2021 assembly election, it won 77 seats while TMC won the election by winning 213 seats.A fourth consecutive term would cement Mamata's status as Bengal’s long-term chief minister and one of the last regional leaders capable of stopping the BJP’s advance. But the margins matter. A slip below 200 seats from the 213 she won in 2021, or a BJP surge past the 100-seat mark, would signal vulnerability and weaken her leverage in national opposition politics ahead of 2029.Meanwhile, on the last day of 2025, Union home minister Amit Shah outlined an action plan for the party's West Bengal unit while reviewing its preparedness for the assembly polls due early next year. Addressing the party's public representatives, both past and present, Shah sought to project a unified front, while indicating former state president Dilip Ghosh as one of the main faces of the saffron camp for the elections.For Ghosh, the stakes are existential. The BJP firebrand and a former TMC heavyweight, he was central to the party’s rise to 77 seats in 2021. If the BJP crosses 120 seats in 2026, Ghosh emerges as Mamata’s undisputed challenger and Bengal’s principal alternative. Failure to capitalise on anti-incumbency, however, would raise uncomfortable questions about his influence and the BJP’s long-term strategy in the state.Tamil Nadu’s contest is shaping up as a three-cornered test of endurance, revival and disruption.Chief minister MK Stalin is seeking a second term after the DMK’s comfortable victory in 2021. Retaining a tally above 130–140 seats would keep the DMK firmly dominant and reinforce Tamil Nadu’s role as a firewall against the BJP’s national narrative. But anti-incumbency pressures, over floods, employment, law and order, and urban governance, could open space for a revival of the opposition.That revival hinges on Edappadi K Palaniswami, the former AIADMK chief minister and leader of the main opposition. A strong showing of 100-plus seats would restore the AIADMK as the DMK’s equal and slow the BJP’s attempt to subsume it. Another weak performance, however, could accelerate AIADMK’s marginalisation and strengthen the BJP’s influence within opposition politics in the state.Hovering over both is Joseph Vijay, the actor-turned-politician whose Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam is eyeing its electoral debut. Even a victory in 10–20 seats could make him a kingmaker. A failure to break through, however, would mean another failed debut and would reinforce the DMK–AIADMK duopoly.In the 2021 assembly election, DMK won 133 seats, AIADMK got 66 seats and BJP got 4 seats.Kerala’s 2026 election carries unusually high stakes for both the Left and the Congress For Pinarayi Vijayan, the CPI(M) stalwart and chief minister, the contest is about legacy. He is aiming for a historic third consecutive term—something rarely achieved in Kerala’s alternating political culture. Retaining a clear majority would keep the LDF dominant in the state and cement Vijayan’s stature as the Left’s most powerful surviving leader. But dipping below the 70-seat mark would likely end his era, especially amid criticism over governance, SFI-linked violence, and fatigue after two terms.On the other side stands VD Satheesan, the Congress-led UDF’s leader of opposition. A crossing of the 80-seat mark would flip the House and revive Congress’s credibility in the South. Another narrow loss, however, would reinforce the perception that while Congress fights hard in Kerala, BJP’s slow creep, not the UDF, is the more consequential long-term challenger.In the 2021 assembly election, the LDF won 99 seats and the UDF got 41 seats, while the NDA was unable to open its tally.Assam will test the durability of strongman politics versus generational transition.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is targeting a third straight NDA victory, with ambitious claims of winning over 104 of the state’s 126 seats.In 2021, Sarma delivered a decisive mandate as the BJP-led alliance won 75 seats in the 126-member assembly.Success would burnish his national ambitions and strengthen his standing as the BJP’s most assertive regional leader. But even a significant drop from the BJP’s 60 seats in 2021 would expose cracks beneath his muscular governance style, particularly amid CAA and NRC.Facing him is Gaurav Gogoi, Congress leader and son of former CM Tarun Gogoi. For Gogoi, 2026 is about emergence. A credible fight, around 40 seats for the INDIA bloc, would position him as Assam’s foremost Congress face and a potential future chief minister. A rout would risk pushing the Congress further into irrelevance in the state.Small in size but large in symbolism, Puducherry could deliver one of 2026’s most telling verdicts.Incumbent CM N Rangasamy is leading a fragile AINRC-BJP coalition and currently governing with a narrow majority secured in 2021. Retaining power would validate his long-standing role as a political kingmaker and reinforce the BJP’s power of managing complex coalition politics.For V Vaithilingam, the Congress stalwart, 2026 is a chance at revival. A UDF victory with 15 or more seats would mark a dramatic comeback for a party that once ruled Puducherry. Failure would further cement the BJP’s foothold and underline Congress’s shrinking influence in smaller southern units.Beyond state leaders, two national figures will shape the outcomes across all five battlegrounds.For, 2026 is less about immediate electoral survival and more about narrative control. With high-stakes assembly elections this year, the Prime Minister’s role will be that of a campaign anchor and message-setter across multiple states, particularly West Bengal, Assam and the southern battlegrounds where the BJP remains an outsider.A strong BJP showing in Bengal or incremental gains in Tamil Nadu and Kerala would reinforce PM Modi’s claim of leading a truly pan-Indian party heading into 2029. Conversely, stagnation or reverses in these regions would embolden the opposition’s argument that the BJP’s expansion has peaked outside its core Hindi belt. The margins, not just victories, will matter in shaping how invincible PM Modi appears in the run-up to his third Lok Sabha contest.While not a mass leader,will be one of the BJP’s most closely watched backroom strategists in 2026. As a key organisational figure tasked with strengthening party units beyond the Hindi heartland, the outcomes in West Bengal, Assam and the South will directly reflect on his effectiveness.If the BJP improves booth-level performance, vote share and cadre depth in traditionally resistant states, Nabin’s stature within the party will rise sharply. But failure to translate central leadership popularity into durable state-level structures would revive internal questions about the BJP’s organisational limits and succession planning within its second rung of leadership.For, 2026 is the culmination of ""Mission 2026"". As Union home minister and the BJP’s chief electoral architect, he is overseeing campaigns across Assam, Puducherry, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Clean sweeps in states the BJP already governs, combined with breakthroughs in the South, would further solidify his authority.For, 2026 is a make-or-break year. After setbacks in Bihar and Delhi, strong UDF performances in Kerala or Puducherry, or credible INDIA bloc gains elsewhere, would validate his approach to coalition politics. Continued erosion would deepen doubts about his leadership at a time when Congress’s room for error is shrinking fast.For, this year will decide if she is ready to take charge of the party, as demanded by several disgruntled party leaders in the past. As Congress’s most recognisable campaigner after Rahul Gandhi, her effectiveness will be judged by how far she can convert charisma and street connect into electoral dividends, particularly in states where the party is fighting to arrest decline rather than expand.Strong UDF performances in Kerala or a credible revival in smaller battlegrounds would bolster her standing as the party's chief mobiliser.Meanwhile, in BMC elections, the Pawar senior and junior have united for the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and thehave joined hands for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls. If these reunions frutify, it could change the dynamics of mega Maharashtra alliances (MVA and Mahayuti).In 2026, people will look atwith the 'will he, won't he' question. With his constant tug of war with his own party, it will be interesting to see if Congress finally makes him fall in line with the party lines or if he calls it quits. Tharoor’s influence will also be tested by outcomes closer to home in Kerala.A Congress-led UDF victory would strengthen Tharoor’s hand within the party, renewing speculation about a larger leadership role nationally or in the state. A loss, however, would blunt his political momentum. How Tharoor positions himself during the campaign, whether as a team player or a distinct voice, will be closely parsed by both supporters and critics.Stage is all for a year of back-to-back elections that matter. In the end, 2026 will not just choose governments, it will quietly decide who still matters when the long road to 2029 truly begins.","This year's calendar is filled with elections, starting with the long-overdue Mumbai-Pune civic polls. Later, with high-stakes assembly elections due in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry. For many leaders, the results will define not just the fate of their governments and party, but also their relevance heading into 2029 Lok Sabha elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126319928,imgsize-889496,width-400,resizemode-4/2026-top-politicians-in-focus-who-will-emerge-winner-this-year.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio continued its subscriber growth in November 2025, leading the industry in overall wireless additions and active user gains as per the latest monthly subscription data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).The TRAI data showed that Jio added 1.2 million subscribers, extending its lead over Bharti Airtel for the ninth consecutive month.The performance came during a period when the industry's total active (Visitor Location Register) subscribers fell by 3.4 million to 1,091 million. While other major operators reported net losses in active users, Jio was the only player to post positive gains.Specifically, Vodafone Idea (VIL) saw a drop of 2.2 million active users, while Bharti Airtel recorded a decline of 1.7 million.The momentum for Jio was reflected in its market share, with the operator gaining VLR share in 17 out of 22 telecom circles. The most significant gains were observed in the Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab regions.Morgan Stanley noted that ""RJio's market share rose to 43.7% (+25bps MoM), while all other operators lost market share MoM."" This trend further reduced the active subscriber share gap between Jio and Bharti Airtel to an all-time low.In the broadband segment, Jio maintained its dominance by capturing approximately 68 per cent of the total additions across mobile broadband, fixed wireless access (FWA), and unlicensed band radio (UBR). Jio remained ahead of Bharti Airtel in overall broadband rollouts primarily due to its UBR expansion, which added 0.35 million users during the month.The data also highlighted Jio's strength in the fixed wireless segment. Morgan Stanley reported that ""on FWA, Jio added almost 2.5x FWA subs (FWA 5G+ FWA UBR) vs Airtel."" Both Jio and Bharti Airtel added 0.25 million 5G FWA subscribers each, but Jio's additional UBR gains solidified its lead in the home broadband category.Despite the pullback in active subscribers during November, the sector's active additions for the 2025 calendar year to date remain at a nine-year high. Industry observers expect that the current subscriber additions and rising data penetration will support future growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) as the market construct remains favourable.","Reliance Jio continued its subscriber growth in November 2025, leading the industry in overall wireless additions and active user gains.

Pakistan Backs China’s Claim That It Mediated In Conflict With India

Pak's belated assertion on conflict pause raises brows

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.At a press briefing on Thursday, Pak Foreign Office spokesperson, Tahir Andrabi, said Chinese leaders were ""in constant touch"" with Pakistan's leadership and had also made ""certain contacts with the Indian leadership in those three, four days in May, 6th to 10th and maybe prior to that and after that""""So, I think those contacts, which were characterised by a very positive diplomatic exchanges, they did constitute in bringing down temperatures and trying to bring peace and security in the region. So, I'm sure that the Chinese characterisation of mediation is correct,"" he said.Islamabad's statement, the first-ever about Beijing's alleged role in brokering the pause in the four-day conflict with India, should raise eyebrows because of the lag and because it had so far given the credit for suspension of hostilities exclusively to US President Donald Trump.India had maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan's DGMO to its Indian counterpart, and not the result of any third-party intervention. It dismissed Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi's claim that Beijing had mediated during the crisis.Andrabi said Pakistan shared China's assessment, calling the efforts ""diplomacy for peace, for prosperity, for security"" and that ""this has been the hallmark of a number of international efforts that went into resolving that conflict in those three-four fateful days"". Pakistan, he added, ""firmly"" supported China's position as stated by its foreign minister.China's claim mimics repeated assertions by US President Trump that Washington played a decisive role in ending the confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

The psychology behind fraud: Why people fall prey despite knowing better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-psychology-behind-fraud-why-people-fall-prey-despite-knowing-better/articleshow/126298769.cms,"Representative AI image

The answer lies not in ignorance, but in psychology.

​Why even cautious people fall for scams

The psychological biases scammers exploit

Emotional manipulation, she added, is equally deliberate.

Scarcity is another powerful tool.

Emotional stress blinds people

Red flags may still be visible, but the brain temporarily ignores them because emotional safety feels more urgent than accuracy. This is why scams often target people during vulnerable moments — late at night, after a loss, or during financial uncertainty. Dr Radhika Goyal, Psychologist

Emotional stress such as fear of loss, financial pressure, or loneliness activates the limbic system, particularly the amygdala, which prioritizes emotional survival responses over careful analysis. Dr Medha, Assistant Professor, Psychology

Why victims often stay silent

Breaking the psychological grip

A human vulnerability, not a personal failure

It’s easy to judge people who fell for scams. Many times, one simply thinks, “they should have known better”, label them foolish, naive, careless, or ignorant. After all, warnings are everywhere. Banks keep issuing alerts, digital platforms run awareness campaigns and news regularly reports on the latest frauds and cybercrimes.​Yet, when one looks more closely at how scams actually work, fraud is rarely the result of low intelligence or a lack of information. People who are cautious in one context can be disarmingly vulnerable in another. Those who pride themselves on scepticism can make impulsive decisions under pressure. The question, then, is not why people fail to “know better,” but why knowing better so often fails to protect them.​Scams succeed because they are engineered to move past rational judgement rather than confront it. Understanding the psychology behind fraud requires setting aside moral judgement and confronting an uncomfortable truth: vulnerability to scams is not an exception but a human trait. Frauds happen not because people are foolish, but because scammers exploit how people think, react, and cope under emotional stress.If knowledge were a substitute for preventing fraud, scams would not be this pervasive. The fact is that some of the most articulate, tech-savvy, and financially educated individuals are duped into cash transfers, sharing credentials, or clicking links that under normal circumstances they never would have trusted.The reason is that scams do not challenge what people know; they manipulate how people feel and think.As Dr Radhika Goyal, PhD (Psychology), said, in her insights shared with TOI , “Scams work by bypassing rational thinking and triggering automatic emotional responses. Even highly educated or careful individuals rely on mental shortcuts in daily life to make quick decisions. Fraudsters design situations that feel urgent, personal, or threatening, pushing the brain into ‘survival mode’.”When this happens, the emotional brain (which reacts fast) overrides the logical brain (which analyses slowly). In that moment, intelligence offers little protection, because the scam is not engaging logic, it is exploiting trust, fear, or hope.”Dr Medha, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Patna Women’s College (Autonomous), Patna University, situated this vulnerability within a well-established psychological framework, as she talked to TOI.“Even cautious, intelligent, or well-educated individuals can fall victim to scams because fraudulent schemes exploit normal psychological processes rather than ignorance. From a psychological perspective, scams function by bypassing rational thinking and activating emotional and automatic responses"" she said.She further explained this through Kahneman’s Dual-Process Theory.Fraudsters do not rely on random manipulation. They repeatedly exploit predictable cognitive biases that guide human behaviour in legitimate social settings.These biases are not flaws, they are mental shortcuts that help people function efficiently in everyday life.By pretending to be, say, a bank representative, an authority from a government department, an important executive, and short-circuiting the time it takes to reach a decision, scammers tap into compliance ahead of skepticism and reasoning. This insight into behavior is vital, because it helps to re-understand fraud not just as trickery using clever telling, but at its root, an exploitation of psychology, using guilt, fear, and other trigger mechanisms. ​​Dr Radhika Goyal identified several of the most commonly used psychological levers.Meanwhile, Dr Medha linked these tactics to foundational psychological theories. Authority-based scams, she notes, draw directly from research on obedience.“Scammers are effective because they take advantage of fundamental psychological theories that explain how humans perceive, decide, and behave in social contexts. These theories highlight that human decision-making is often guided by automatic, emotional, and socially conditioned processes rather than deliberate reasoning,” she said.Further elaborating on individual behaviour, she added, “Individuals have a strong tendency to comply with perceived authority figures. Scammers exploit this bias by impersonating officials such as bank representatives, police officers, or government agents. The presence of authority cues—formal language, uniforms, or official symbols—reduces resistance and critical questioning, leading individuals to comply even when requests are unreasonable. -This has been supported by Milgram’s theory of obedience.”“Strong emotions such as fear, hope, guilt, or affection activate the limbic system, which can overpower rational control mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex. Scammers intentionally evoke emotional reactions to impair logical evaluation and promote impulsive decisions,"" the assistant professor added, citing Damasio's Affective Decision-Making Theory.Dr Medha explained how scammers can trigger ""scarcity bias"" to trap people. Citing Cialdini's Persuasion theory, the professor explained, ""Scarcity bias occurs when people assign greater value to opportunities perceived as limited.""Scammers exploit this by saying things such as- “Offer valid for 24 hours”, “Only a few slots left”. Another tactic that fraudsters use is ""fear of missing out (FOMO)"" which ""shifts thinking from evaluation to action”, explained the professor.One of the most troubling aspects of fraud is that victims often recognise warning signs, but only in hindsight. Emotional stress plays a key role in this temporary blindness.“Emotional stress narrows attention. When someone is anxious about money, scared of legal trouble, or feeling lonely, their brain prioritizes relief over verification,"" said Dr Goyal.Further explaining the psychological mindset of the people under stress, she added, ""Under stress, people focus on solving the immediate emotional discomfort — “How do I stop this problem right now?” — instead of asking critical questions.""Dr Medha described the same process at the neurological level:Further talking about the stress factor, the professor said, “This heightened emotional arousal weakens the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, reducing logical reasoning, impulse control, and risk evaluation. As a result, individuals rely more on fast, intuitive processing rather than deliberate, analytical thinking, even when warning signs are present. Stress also narrows attention to emotionally relevant cues, causing people to overlook inconsistencies or red flags that would normally signal fraud. Consequently, the desire to quickly relieve emotional distress overrides caution, making individuals more vulnerable to deceptive tactics.”Even after realizing that they’ve been swindled, victims often opt not to speak out. In most cases, this is not because they lack information or do not care, but due to complex factors involving psychological, social, as well as structural barriers that ultimately favor the fraudsters.Shame and self-blame are some of the deterrents. Victims often internalise responsibility, believing they were “careless” or “gullible,” despite scams being deliberately engineered to exploit normal human trust and authority cues. Admitting the fraud can feel like admitting a personal failure, particularly for educated or financially savvy individuals.Fear of judgement adds to the reluctance. Victims worry about how family members, employers, or peers will see them, especially when the loss involves large sums or repeated transactions. In a professional environment, disclosure may be seen as reputationally damaging, reinforcing the instinct to stay quiet.There is also a general feeling that nothing worthwhile will come out of reporting and that what has been lost is irretrievable. This perceived futility discourages reporting, even where formal channels exist.In this context, confusion and intimidation also prevail. Frauds involve tricks and mind games that include numerous platforms, jurisdictions, and phony identities. Victims often do not know to whom they need to report, what evidence will be required, or fear being dragged into long and stressful investigations. Some are even threatened bluntly by the scammers, further suppressing disclosure.Dr Goyal pointed to shame as a central barrier. “Shame is a major barrier. Victims often blame themselves, thinking, ‘I should have known better.’ This self-blame is intensified by social stigma that equates being scammed with being foolish.”Talking about the feeling of shame leads to isolation, she added, ""Fraudsters deliberately reinforce this shame, telling victims to keep the matter confidential or warning them they will ‘get into trouble’ if they speak up. Unfortunately, silence protects the scammer and isolates the victim further. Psychologically, it is easier to stay quiet than to confront embarrassment — even when reporting could prevent harm to others. ”Meanwhile, Dr Medha explained that self-blame is deeply tied to identity. “Victims often internalize the fraud as a personal failure, believing they should have been more careful, which leads to self-blame rather than attributing responsibility to the scammer. Shame triggers avoidance behavior, causing individuals to hide the experience to protect their self-image and social identity.”“Additionally, cognitive dissonance makes it emotionally uncomfortable to admit having been deceived, especially for educated or competent individuals. Together, shame, damaged self-esteem, and fear of stigma significantly reduce the likelihood of reporting scams, despite the importance of doing so,"" she added.As scams operate at the emotional, mental level, resisting them requires psychological interruption. In general, fraud succeeds not because the victims are uninformed, but rather because jacked-up emotions temporarily displace rational judgment.Scammers create a situation that instills urgency, fear, or excitement, forcing fast decisions, narrowing attention, and suppressing doubt. In such a state, one may even fail to notice flagrant red flags. The best counter remains pause: slowing down, stepping away from the communication, or delaying any action, which breaks the emotional momentum on which scams depend.A second opinion is equally important. Bringing in a trusted third party reintroduces perspective and exposes inconsistencies that are hard to see under pressure. In practice, the strongest defences against fraud are behavioural — time, distance, and verification — rather than just knowledge.Dr Goyal emphasised on simple but effective pauses.Meanwhile, Dr Medha framed resistance as “mind over manipulation.”""Using Mind Over Manipulation — Scams succeed when emotion outruns reasoning. Breaking a scam requires slowing down emotion, widening perspective, and re-activating rational control,"" she said.She outlined concrete steps:The main point to understand in this is that fraud thrives in the space between emotion and reason. It succeeds, not because people lack intelligence, but because they are humans; capable of fear, hope, trust, and urgency. Con artists structure their approach based on these universal characteristics, taking advantage of the instances where the responses are instinctual, meaning where a reaction exceeds the boundaries of logical processing.The susceptibility to a scam is not an anomaly but a side effect of human instincts in pressing circumstances. Recognising this distinction is critical. It shifts the narrative away from personal failure and towards systemic manipulation. When victims understand that they were targeted through deliberate psychological engineering, shame loses its power and reporting becomes more likely. This, in turn, improves visibility into how fraud networks operate and where safeguards fail.The more society moves away from blaming victims and towards understanding the psychology of manipulation, the harder it becomes for fraudsters to win. Awareness framed around human vulnerability encourages openness, earlier intervention, and collective defence; thus, weakening the conditions that allow scams to spread unchecked.","Psychologist Dr Radhika Goyal, PhD (Psychology), said, “Scams work by bypassing rational thinking and triggering automatic emotional responses” Fraudsters design situations that feel urgent, personal, or threatening, pushing the brain into ‘survival mode’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126319854,imgsize-1451180,width-400,resizemode-4/article-1.jpg"

If even a Dalit icon's portrait had been installed today, we could have struck a blow against the stigma of casteism that has existed for thousands of years. But the Delhi government missed this opportunity and instead installed portraits of two Brahmins. When it comes to installing the portrait of a Dalit icon, they face so much discomfort that they initiated a privilege breach case against MLAs, some of whom are Dalits and from the AAP.""Meanwhile, AAP MLA Kuldeep Kumar said, ""A few days ago, a meeting was held in which we placed a proposal before the Assembly committee. Our MLAs said that Mata Savitribai Phule, whose birth anniversary is today, who opened the first school for women in this country, who faced immense atrocities yet never stopped educating women, should have her portrait installed inside the Delhi Assembly. I say this with great sadness that to suppress our voice, they initiated a privilege breach motion against our members, including against me personally, but they did not install Mata Savitribai Phule's portrait there. Because she spoke about educating women. Because she came from the Dalit community and the backward community, her portrait was not installed.""Pointing to contrasting decisions, Kuldeep Kumar added, ""Inside the Assembly, the entire government, along with the central government spent lakhs of rupees to install portraits of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Madan Mohan Malaviya. We have no objection to that. But we say this clearly that if you insult Dalit heroes and show hatred towards them, then we will not tolerate a BJP that insults Mata Savitribai Phule and refuses to install her portrait on her birth anniversary while installing portraits of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Madan Mohan Malaviya. This is their anti-Dalit mentality.""","AAP Delhi unit chief Saurabh Bharadwaj and Kondli MLA Kuldeep Kumar emphasised that the government not only failed to acknowledge a dalit icon who laid the foundation of women's education in India, but also went a step further by initiating a privilege breach case against MLAs who raised the demand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126325868,imgsize-868358,width-400,resizemode-4/aap-launches-anti-dalit-attack-at-bjp.jpg"

'No change in policy'

Removing hurdles

NEW DELHI: While land acquisition, and forest and wildlife clearances are the main hurdles for delay in infrastructure projects that have been addressed by Pragati, the platform for large projects led by PM Modi, Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan made it clear Friday that development won't be at the cost of democracy.Asked about amendments to the current policy, Somanathan said: ""In a democracy we need to strike a balance... We want to implement projects with the consent of people and after public consultation.""The comment comes amid demands from a section of the business community to review the land acquisition policy to speed up the implementation of projects, with the corporate sector often citing the Chinese model of infrastructure creation.While BJP govt did seek to amend land acquisition law in its first term, it left it to the states to offer a simpler regime. Responding to a question, cabinet secretary TV Somanathan said govt has no plans to change its land acquisition policy.The data shared by Somananthan at a press conference showed 35% of 7,735 issues raised under multi-layer Pragati were related to land acquisition, followed by 20% dealing with wildlife and forest clearances.Manoj Govil, secretary coordination in the cabinet secretariat, said the average time taken for forest and wildlife clearance has come down from over 600 days to around 75 days as learnings from Pragati have been part of the administrative process.Of 382 projects reviewed by the PM in 50 meetings, almost two-thirds related to land and forest. Among the sectors, roads was on top (114 projects), followed by railways (109) and power (54). For railways and roads, at least half the issues are related to land acquisition.In a rare press conference, Somananthan said so far projects of Rs 85 lakh crore have been cleared by the PM-led panel as states and Centre have worked together to resolve the issues. Citing the example of Jammu-Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link, the country's highest-ranking civil servant said the project was approved in 1994 and by the time it reached Pragati in 2015, only 40% of the work had been done. It was finally commissioned last June after being monitored at the highest level. He said had the project not been taken up under Pragati, it would have been completed only by Jan 2038.He said by removing bottlenecks, Pragati had created a platform for higher capital expenditure by govt. ""All states, irrespective of political dispensations, want to complete their projects and all chief secretaries have been very responsive in resolving issues,"" he said.On impact of review of projects by PM under this initiative, Somanathan said on average, one issue was resolved every working day after review under Pragati.Besides projects, the platform is used to review 61 govt schemes such as One Nation, One Ration Card, PM Jan Aarogya Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, PM Swanidhi Yojna, Swachh Bharat Mission, Rera, and grievances across 36 sectors were taken up for review.",Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan says development won't be at the cost of democracy.

NEW DELHI: Flagging a “lack of equal and inclusive representation of the Buddhist community” in ongoing talks between Ladakhi outfits and the Centre on constitutional safeguards, a new Buddhist body — Voice of Buddhist Community of Ladakh (VBL) — has sought inclusion in the dialogue to articulate the community’s concerns and aspirations.VBL was formally floated on January 1, 2026, with the backing of senior Buddhist leaders, prominent citizens, youth and women representing all regions of Ladakh. The outfit said its objective is to ensure broader and more effective representation of Buddhists in discussions with the MHA.A source said the move is aimed at ensuring that “any decision emerging from the dialogue between the Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance on one hand and MHA on the other keeps in mind the voice of Buddhist community of Ladakh”.While welcoming the Centre’s initiative to engage Ladakhi leaders, VBL, in a letter to Amit Shah, expressed concern over the composition of high-powered committee, which currently comprises LAB and KDA leaders. Though LAB includes representation from Ladakh Buddhist Association, VBL said Buddhists remain under-represented in HPC, undermining community’s interests in draft proposal prepared by LAB and KDA.As per sources, the draft proposal seeks statehood and 6th Schedule status for Ladakh but is silent on the demand for special status under Article 371. VBL, which opposes the demand for statehood, fears the proposal may be skewed in favour of the Kargil region.VBL said it would submit a separate draft proposal to Centre after consultations. Its convenor Skarma Namtak recently called on Ladakh LG to present the group’s demands, stressing any dialogue on Ladakh’s future must adequately reflect Buddhist concerns.","VBL was formally floated on January 1, 2026, with the backing of senior Buddhist leaders, prominent citizens, youth and women.

NEW DELHI: A Meitei civil society organisation has written to PM Modi flagging concerns over letters sent by a Chin Kuki Zo group to foreign govts and United Nations bodies, warning that such outreach could undermine India’s sovereignty, judicial authority and national security amid the ongoing Manipur crisis. It urged Centre to review security policy, re-examine Suspension of Operations agreements and pursue a lawful, permanent resolution that protects all indigenous communities and Manipur’s territorial integrity. Copies of the memorandum were also marked to home minister Amit Shah.In a memorandum dated January 3, Meitei Heritage Society said communications issued by the Kuki Alliance for Nampi Awakening Movement (KANAM) seek to “delegitimise and internationalise” an order of NGT directing an immediate halt to construction of an allegedly illegal road in Manipur’s hill areas. The road — popularly referred to as the German Road or Tiger Road — was built without statutory approvals or mandatory environmental clearance and is “allegedly used by Chin Kuki Zo militants or armed groups for drug trafficking and weapons smuggling,” the memorandum said.The society argued that portraying a judicial order as “institutional violence” and “collective punishment,” and projecting it as grounds for foreign intervention, challenges India’s constitutional framework.“Such actions risk setting a dangerous precedent whereby internal judicial processes are selectively escalated to foreign govts and multilateral bodies,” it stated.The Meitei Heritage Society urged the PM to take note of the foreign communications, direct the ministry of home affairs to undertake a comprehensive policy and security review, re-examine SoO agreements with Chin Kuki Zo militant groups, and pursue a “permanent, just and lawful solution to the Manipur crisis that protects all indigenous communities and preserves Manipur and India’s territorial integrity.”Placing the issue in context, the memorandum said the Manipur crisis, which erupted into large-scale violence on May 3, 2023, has increasingly been framed through competing international narratives. It alleged that Chin Kuki Zo organisations and individuals have previously approached the UN, the US and other foreign actors with what it described as “fabricated, one-sided narratives,” while “masquerading as tribal bodies by using misleading tribal names. ”The memorandum said such groups have received financial and logistical support, training and backing from foreign Christian organisations and former US military personnel, raising questions over compliance with FCRA norms and calling for scrutiny by India’s security agencies.

Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!

HYDERABAD: After noticing TOI articles on digital arrest cases in Hyderabad, an 81-year-old retired businessman reported being scammed of over Rs 7 crore using the same modus operandi. Posing as Mumbai Police officers, the cyber fraudsters threatened to arrest him in a bogus drug-trafficking and fake passports case and extorted the money.According to a complaint filed by the octagenarian with Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB) on January 2, his ordeal began on October 27 last year when he received a WhatsApp call from a person claiming to be Sunil Sharma from Blue Dart customer care. Sharma told the victim that a parcel sent in his name from Mumbai to Bangkok contained a laptop, five passports and 200 gram MDMA, a narcotic drug. Minutes later, another caller, posing as a Mumbai crime branch officer, said that based on the evidence, the victim faced charges of extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism.Placing the victim under 'digital arrest', the impostors warned him against revealing case details to his family or contacting bankers or lawyers, and ordered him to provide full disclosure of his investments. Under sustained intimidation, the businessman transferred Rs 19.8 lakh on October 29 to a City Union Bank account. Further, he installed the Signal app to communicate with them. Between November 6 and December 5, he executed five more RTGS transfers to different bank accounts, bringing the total loss to over Rs 7.12 crore.On December 29, the fraudsters sought an additional Rs 1.2 cr to close the case file against him. Growing suspicious, the victim lodged a complaint on December 31.","An 81-year-old retired businessman reported being scammed of over Rs 7 crore using the same modus operandi.

Key Hindu candidate barred from contesting Bangladesh polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/key-hindu-candidate-barred-from-contesting-bangladesh-polls/articleshow/126330070.cms,"NAGPUR: Amid persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and rising concerns in India, the nomination of a key Hindu candidate, Gobindadeb Pramanik was rejected Saturday by the returning officer. Pramanik sought to contest as an Independent from Gopalganj-3 in the February 12 polls. Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina was the MP from this seat, which has over 50% Hindu voters.Pramanik is also general secretary of Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mahajote. An apolitical organisation, it is an alliance of 23 outfits and is considered a Hindutva fountainhead in the country.A provision in Bangladesh’s electoral laws, which requires an Independent candidate to submit signatures of 1% of the voters in the constituency backing the candidature, was invoked by returning officer to turn down his nomination, said Pramanik.Talking to TOI from Gopalganj, Pramanik alleged that after he had managed to secure 1% signatures, workers of Bangladesh Nationalist Party threatened those who signed in his favour with dire consequences. They were asked to turn up before returning officer and say that their signatures were not taken or were wrongly submitted. Following this, returning officer rejected the nomination on grounds of “invalid” signatures.Pramanik said he preferred to fight as an Independent because he had support. He pointed out that 51% of the around 3 lakh voters in Gopalganj are Hindus, adding BNP resorted to such tactics as it does not stand a chance. “Although the signatures of 1% of my voters were correct, the district returning officer did not accept the affidavits. The officer ruled that the signatures were not valid. I shall file an appeal before the election commission and may even move HC after that. ”Another Hindu candidate, Dulal Biswas, also saw his papers turned back. Since Biswas was fielded by a registered political party, Gono Forum, the 1% voters’ affidavit rule did not apply to him. The application was stayed for want of papers, and he got a chance to submit the documents afresh, a source said.In nearby Gopalganj 2, another Independent Hindu candidate, Utpal Biswas, is in the fray. The seat was once represented by Hasina’s cousin Sheikh Salim. “I work among the farmers and the downtrodden. I expect that they will vote for me,” Biswas said.","Gobindadeb Pramanik sought to contest as an Independent from Gopalganj-3.

One hand bag rule vital amid power bank fire fears: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-hand-bag-rule-vital-amid-power-bank-fire-fears-experts/articleshow/126329997.cms,"DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: India has barred the use of power banks to charge portable electronic devices inflight. Charging power banks by plugging them to in-seat power supply systems that airlines provide is also no longer allowed.Permitted only in hand bags, flyers are no longer supposed to keep power banks and batteries in overhead bins. This comes after instances of lithium batteries catching fire mid-flight.DGCA recently issued a ‘dangerous goods advisory circular’ to minimise risks from lithium battery-powered devices carried by passengers and crew members.The regulator has directed airlines to make inflight announcements regarding the new rules. Passengers need to “immediately inform cabin crew if any device emits heat, smoke or an unusual odour”, the rules say, adding that airlines must “promptly report all safety issues and occurrences related to lithium battery incidents to DGCA”. Some other countries and airlines, including Emirates and Singapore Airlines, had issued similar restrictions for the same reason last year.Aviation experts warn that airlines should strictly implement the one-hand-bag-per-passenger rule in wake of this new fear.The reason: While batteries and power banks are not allowed in check-in bags, airlines very often take hand bags — which have portable electronic devices (PEDs) and power banks — at boarding gates or aerobridgesfrom passengers and keep them in the belly of aircraft, as overhead bins are full.“This defeats the purpose of not allowing batteries in check-in bags. A battery catching fire in baggage hold, remaining undetected and then spreading can have serious consequences. The issue of how much cabin bags flyers carry onboard needs to be tackled either by airlines on their own. And if they can’t do so, rules need to be in place to ensure lithium batteries do not make it to baggage hold,” said a senior pilot.The new DGCA circular says: “The widespread usage of lithium batteries in various rechargeable devices has led to an increase in carriage of lithium batteries by air. Power banks, portable chargers, and similar devices containing lithium batteries can act as ignition sources and potentially initiate on-board fires. Lithium batteries placed in overhead stowage bins or within carry-on baggage may be obscured, difficult to access, or not readily monitored by passengers or crew members. This may result in delayed detection of smoke or fire and response actions, increasing the potential hazard to flight safety.”Lithium battery fires are very “energetic” and can cause PEDs to explode. “A lithium battery fire can be started by uncontrolled heating, overcharging, crushing or internal short circuit triggered by poor manufacturing quality, aged batteries or damage due to mishandling. Unlike other fires, lithium battery fires may be self-sustaining and require special methods to handle. The general preventive measures to minimise risks of lithium battery fire may include minimising possibilities of heating of devices; early detection in case of fire; and reinforcement of effectiveness of firefighting procedures,” it adds.",India has barred the use of power banks to charge portable electronic devices inflight.

But when New York mayor Zohran Mamdani danced to the track ‘Gaddi Red Challenger’ by Toronto-based artist Babbu aka Babbulicious at his inauguration, American politics met bhangra beats in a moment that instantly went viral.With Mamdani, his wife Rama Duwaji and hundreds in attendance joining in, the ceremony turned into an unexpected celebration of diasporic culture. For Babbulicious — the turbaned Sikh singer, who is also a comedian and designer, it was a powerful moment of visibility. “Zohran sang along, and the sight of (US senator) Bernie Sanders clapping and vibing to a Punjabi song was surreal,” he told TOI over email.Born Babbu Singh and raised in Toronto’s Brampton Punjabi belt, Babbulicious’s creative journey has been anything but conventional. He dropped out of art college at 19 and went on to build a career that spans influencer skits, visual art, puppet series, children’s books and charting music.“All my art, in one way or another, is about connecting with my younger self — creating things that would have made me feel seen, valued,” he says.Mamdani’s team discovered ‘Gaddi Red Challenger’ through social media. Singh later adapted lyrics to “New York vich munda renda”, reflecting the mayor’s multicultural identity.The celebratory moment also drew predictable backlash. Far-right voices criticised the use of non-Western music at a civic ceremony and misidentified the turbaned artist’s religion. Singh remains unfazed. “Sometimes it’s best not to engage. It’s hard to convince someone to change their bias, so the best thing is to smile and continue with your day,” he says.Much of Singh’s work deliberately challenges stereotypes around Sikh identity, often through humour, including his popular ‘Khalsa Uncle’ skits. Representation, he believes, is essential. He recalls the impact of seeing Indian American designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia in Wes Anderson films while growing up. “Seeing someone who looked like me meant everything. Funny enough, he was at the inauguration — we met for the first time, and I hugged him and told him how much that visibility mattered. It made me feel like we could be anything we wanted to be.”While rappers like Lil Wayne and Jay-Z have shaped his musical sensibility, Singh says artists who push creative boundaries while staying true to themselves resonate most deeply. “Outkast, the Beatles, Daft Punk, Ye have had a meaningful impact on me.”Today, Toronto’s diasporic energy is propelling Punjabi pop onto the global stage. Reflecting this shift, Toronto Metropolitan University is set to launch a course on Diljit Dosanjh this year, examining his influence on music, identity and the Punjabi diaspora. For Singh, his subway-station bhangra moment signals a wider cultural shift. “Punjabi music is ready for the mainstream,” he says.This story had continued from a page 1 story in the newspaper.

SHAMLI: Claiming an immediate threat to his life from Uttar Pradesh police, gangster Haji Firoz Khan chained himself inside his home, rigged a noose and installed CCTV cameras at multiple corners on Saturday, and posted live videos every half hour.Calling it ""mere theatrics"", police said Khan has been posting such ""updates"" on his social media account since Wednesday to affirm his well-being amid intermittent warnings that any attempt to arrest him would lead to his ""suicide"".The bizarre episode unfolded at Jhinjhana town in Shamli district after local police seized 14 properties worth Rs 30 crore belonging to Khan under section 14 (1) of the Gangsters Act on Dec 25, last year, as he was listed as absconding in police records. However, in one video clip, Khan - in his late 50s - claimed a court had stayed his arrest and no police action should be taken against him.SP (Shamli) NP Singh told TOI: ""Firoz Khan is using online videos to obstruct police and administrative work. He has been issuing criminal threats against the official proceedings by public servants and levelling false, baseless allegations against police and administrative officials while threatening suicide.""The SP Singh added Khan had earlier maintained his own social media cell, through which he was now making unsubstantiated accusations, but legal action against the gangster will continue despite his ""online stunts"". Khan has 22 cases, including rape and murder, against his name across the region, the SP said.","Gangster Haji Firoz Khan chained himself inside his home, rigged a noose and installed CCTV cameras at multiple corners.

Vague claims against in-laws insufficient for prosecution: Karnataka HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vague-claims-against-in-laws-insufficient-for-prosecution-karnataka-hc/articleshow/126329862.cms,"Heartbreak, divorce & deadly crimes | Dark Truth Of Failed Marriages | Ft. Anand Handa

BENGALURU: Karnataka high court has observed that mere assertion that in-laws “instigated” the husband or used abusive language, without any specific instance of such misdemeanour, cannot form the foundation for criminal prosecution. Quashing the proceedings against one Abeda, her husband Mohammad Runkuddin Jumna, and five others, Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted that if the court declines to exercise its inherent jurisdiction, then the petitioners “would be unnecessarily subjected to the rigmarole of criminal prosecution”.Under the circumstances, continuation of proceedings against the petitioners would amount to abuse of the process of law, Justice Magadum observed. The couple, residents of Kalaburagi city, along with their family members, had challenged FIR registered by women’s police station and pending proceedings before local court, based on a complaint filed by Tehseen Begum, their daughter-in-law.The petitioners stated Tehseen had acknowledged in her written complaint dated July 22, 2023, that she lived separately, with her husband Nooruddin Jumna. “All allegations pertaining to neglect, marital discord, & harassment are specifically directed only at Nooruddin.There are absolutely no individual or specific allegations against any of us.”Justice Magadum noted, “The complainant explicitly acknowledges there was a family partition, pursuant to which, a separate residential portion comprising three rooms was allotted. This itself indicates that the petitioners lived separately and did not share the common household with the complainant.” He added, “The complaint repeatedly refers to the prolonged stays of Nooruddin in Gulf region, which appears to be the primary reason for marital discord. The allegations against the petitioners are, therefore, unsubstantiated, lacking any particulars of date, time, place, or specific acts.”","Karnataka high court quashes proceedings against one Abeda, her husband Mohammad Runkuddin Jumna, and five others.

Karisma Kapoor’s Kids Challenge Billionaire Dad’s Will in ₹30,000 Cr Estate Feud In Delhi HC

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday allowed a fresh application filed by Priya Kapur seeking the removal of her late husband Sunjay Kapur ’s sister’s name from the court order in proceedings related to his purported will.Justice Jyoti Singh allowed Priya’s plea seeking correction of an earlier order in the ongoing multi-crore estate battle over the late industrialist’s assets.The rectification plea, moved under Sections 151 and 152 of the code of civil procedure, pointed out that the September 10 order wrongly recorded the appearance of Mandhira Kapur, Sunjay’s sister, even though she was neither a party to the suit nor sought to be heard.The HC noted the appearance of senior Geeta Luthra and others for Mandhira Kapur on the date of the hearing. However, Luthra later clarified to the bench that Mandhira was not a party to the proceedings and had not filed any plea to be heard in the matter, nor had anyone appeared for her. The application by Priya contended that her name created a misleading record. The high court passed the order in a plaint filed by Sunjay’s two children along with former wife and actor Karisma Kapoor challenging his purported will and seeking shares in the assets, worth about Rs 30,000 crore, according to media reports.Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Priya Kapur in the case, said including her name in the proceedings was “an attempt by Mandhira to gain backdoor entry into the case.”The high court had directed Priya on September 10 to disclose all movable and immovable assets belonging to him as of June 12, the day of his death. Karisma and Sunjay married in 2003 but divorced in 2016. Sunjay died on June 12 while playing a polo match in London.","Priya Kapur seeks removal of her late husband Sunjay Kapur ’s sister’s name from the court order in proceedings related to his purported will.

"Digitise manuscripts, stop intellectual piracy: PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digitise-manuscripts-stop-intellectual-piracy-pm-modi/articleshow/123862725.cms,"PM at an international conference on the Gyan Bharatam Mission on Friday

NEW DELHI:

PM Modi on Thursday highlighted that India was home to the largest collection of manuscripts, and said it was a tribute to “the dedication of our ancestors towards knowledge, science, reading and learning”.He said while lakhs of manuscripts were lost due to the “cruel blows of history”, India was able to save many which are now part of the country’s civilisational consciousness and heritage. “India’s history is not just about the rise and fall of sultanates,” he said.The PM was speaking at an international conference on the ‘Gyan Bharatam Mission’, which among other things, focuses through a portal on the digitisation and preservation of manuscripts and enhancing access to them.Modi underlined that numerous elements of India’s traditional knowledge system, which have been used for centuries, are often copied and patented by others, “Digital manuscripts will accelerate efforts to counter such misuse and help stop intellectual piracy,” he said. The PM said the mission, announced in the 2025-26 Budget, is set to become “a proclamation of India’s culture, literature, and consciousness”.He also heard presentations by eight working groups constituted under the mission on manuscript conservation, digitisation technologies, metadata standards, legal frameworks, cultural diplomacy and decipherment of ancient scripts.Stating that viewing a manuscript feels akin to travelling back in time, Modi reflected on the vast difference between present-day conditions and those of the past. “India’s history is not merely a record of dynastic victories and defeats,” he said. He noted that while the geography of princely states and kingdoms has changed over time, India has remained intact from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean.“India’s ancient manuscripts reflect the continuous flow of this civilisational journey”, Modi added while highlighting that these manuscripts that exist in nearly 80 languages are also declarations of unity in diversity.Stating that every nation presents its historical assets to the world as symbols of civilizational greatness, the PM noted that countries preserve even a single manuscript or artifact as a national treasure. Modi affirmed that these manuscripts — wherever they may be found in the world — must be documented, digitised, and celebrated as part of India’s civilisational heritage.“India has earned the trust of the world. Today, nations view India as the right place to safeguard and honour cultural heritage” Modi said while referring to how earlier, only a few stolen Indian idols were returned but now, hundreds of ancient idols are being repatriated.","PM was speaking at an international conference on the ‘Gyan Bharatam Mission’ The mission, announced in the 2025-26 Budget, is set to become ‘a proclamation of India’s culture, literature, and consciousness’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123862826,imgsize-1343790,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-at-an-international-conference-on-the-gyan-bharatam-mission-on-friday.jpg"

About the Commission

The first day of the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Examination 2025 Tier-I, scheduled for September 12, was disrupted after tests were cancelled at multiple centres due to technical and administrative reasons.The Commission has clarified that fresh dates have been assigned to the affected candidates to ensure they do not lose their attempt. This disruption is particularly significant as the SSC CGL is one of the largest recruitment examinations in the country, attracting lakhs of aspirants every year.At M M Public School in Sector 4, Gurugram, chaos broke out on Friday morning when candidates arrived only to learn that their exam had been cancelled. According to officials, frustrated aspirants damaged the school gate, prompting the police to intervene. A police team reached the spot and managed to pacify the agitated crowd, which had been raising slogans against the alleged mismanagement of the examination process.Centre head Manoj Gupta said, “The exam has been cancelled due to technical problems in the SSC server. While the server began functioning again after the first shift, candidates from that shift caused a disturbance and prevented the second shift examinees from entering the venue. The police were called to restore order,” according toA senior police officer stated that no formal complaints had been filed by the school management regarding the incident.Apart from Gurugram, official notices confirmed that examinations at Bharti Vidya Niketan Public School in Delhi were cancelled due to administrative issues. Candidates from these centres have been rescheduled to appear on September 24, 25, and 26, 2025.In Jammu, the examination at Digital Computer Education was disrupted by technical glitches. The rescheduled date for these candidates has been fixed for September 26, 2025.Speaking to a prominent media house, SSC Chairman S. Gopalkrishnan clarified that the examination was successfully conducted across 227 centres, but issues were reported at 12 locations, including one major disruption in Gurugram. He explained that outdated devices and technical failures at the last moment had forced the Commission to drop that centre, and assured that new centres in Delhi-NCR would be allotted within 10 days, with particular reference to the MM centre in Gurugram.The Chairman further mentioned that in Jammu, only minor technical problems were observed. He indicated that the addition of new features in the examination process sometimes resulted in such errors. However, since the majority of centres functioned smoothly, he suggested that the responsibility for disruptions lay with local managements that relied on outdated networks, switches, and systems.On the subject of cancellation notices, he clarified that only the Staff Selection Commission has the authority to announce cancellations, not individual centres. He emphasised that the Commission remained committed to ensuring the fair conduct of examinations and addressing lapses caused by mismanagement at the local level.This year’s cancellation adds to concerns already raised over the Commission’s examination management. During the Selection Post Phase 13 recruitment test held between July 24 and August 1, 2025, candidates had faced abrupt cancellations, software crashes, biometric verification failures, and incorrect exam centre allotments. Thousands of students and educators had staged protests at Jantar Mantar and the CGO Complex in Delhi, demanding accountability, vendor reviews, and independent inquiry into repeated lapses.SSC is a central government recruitment body functioning under the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT). It conducts nationwide competitive examinations to recruit for Group B (non-gazetted) and Group C (non-technical) posts across ministries, departments, and government organisations. Each year, millions of aspirants appear for SSC examinations, with the CGL being one of the most competitive and sought-after routes to government service in India.(with inputs from PTI)","The Staff Selection Commission (SSC) Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Examination 2025 Tier-I, scheduled for September 12, was disrupted.

2025 QV9 flyby highlights how asteroids move near Earth



Also Read |

Space enthusiasts and astronomers worldwide are keeping a close watch on the skies as NASA confirms the approach of a massive asteroid. Known as asteroid 2025 QV9, this celestial object, discovered only recently, measures roughly the size of a large passenger airplane and is set to make a remarkably close flyby of Earth on September 10. Traveling at incredible speeds through the vast emptiness of space, the asteroid’s highly anticipated passage has captured the attention of scientists, researchers, and curious space watchers alike. Despite its significant size and high velocity, experts emphasize that 2025 QV9 poses no immediate danger to our planet, remaining well outside the official threshold for potentially hazardous objects. Its upcoming flyby serves as a vivid and striking reminder of the importance of near-Earth object monitoring programs and the constant global vigilance required to track potential asteroid threats in the future.Asteroid 2025 QV9 measures approximately 100 feet (30 meters) wide and travels at a staggering speed of 10,319 miles per hour. Its closest approach will be about 1,250,000 miles from Earth—roughly five times the distance to the Moon according to NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).Although that distance might sound safe, space agencies consider it relatively close in astronomical terms. 2025 QV9 belongs to the Aten asteroid group, a category of near-Earth objects that frequently cross our planet’s orbit.These asteroids are of particular interest due to their potential to interact with Earth in the long term.NASA classifies an asteroid as hazardous if it comes within 7.4 million kilometers (4.6 million miles) and is wider than 85 meters (279 feet). While 2025 QV9 exceeds the width threshold, it remains well outside the danger zone for its upcoming flyby. Nonetheless, small orbital changes over time make continuous monitoring essential.Even asteroids that are harmless today are closely watched by scientists and space agencies worldwide. A minor deviation in an asteroid’s trajectory could transform a safe flyby into a potential threat decades down the line, posing risks to Earth, nearby satellites, and spacecraft operating in affected regions. Continuous observation allows astronomers to refine their impact prediction models, plan mitigation strategies if needed, and coordinate international response efforts with greater precision and collaboration.Asteroid monitoring also contributes to broader scientific knowledge, including the study of asteroid composition, orbital dynamics, collision probabilities, and the mechanics of solar system objects. Understanding these factors helps scientists anticipate future near-Earth object (NEO) encounters more accurately, develop protective technologies, and better prepare humanity for unexpected cosmic events.Agencies like NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) are at the forefront of asteroid tracking. India’s space program is also ramping up its efforts. ISRO Chairman S. Somanath recently shared ambitious plans to study larger asteroids, including the notable Apophis, which is set to make a close approach in 2029. India aims to collaborate on international missions, exchange technological insights, and may even send spacecraft to land on asteroids in the near future.These collaborations ensure that nations can share data, resources, advanced instrumentation, and expertise to protect Earth from potential asteroid threats while advancing planetary science.The approach of asteroid 2025 QV9 highlights the hidden dynamics of our solar system. Even seemingly calm skies can host objects moving at incredible speeds, silently passing by. For astronomers and enthusiasts alike, such events provide a rare opportunity to observe near-Earth objects and study their behavior.Tonight, stargazers will watch the silent passage of 2025 QV9, a reminder of the importance of continuous asteroid tracking.

The defence ministry has begun examining a proposal from the Indian Air Force (IAF) to procure 114 ""Made in India"" Rafale fighter jets in collaboration with French manufacturer Dassault Aviation and Indian aerospace firms.Estimated to be worth over Rs 2 lakh crore, with more than 60 percent indigenous content, the mega deal is expected to be taken up by the Defence Procurement Board, headed by the Defence Secretary, in the coming weeks, officials told ANI.Once cleared, the proposal will move to the Defence Acquisition Council for final approval.The new acquisition would take the number of Rafales in India’s arsenal to 176, adding to the 36 already inducted by the IAF and 36 ordered for the Indian Navy under separate government-to-government agreements.Officials noted that the move follows the Rafale’s strong performance during Operation Sindoor, where the aircraft reportedly outclassed Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missiles using its advanced Spectra electronic warfare suite. The Indian-built jets are expected to feature longer-range air-to-ground missiles than the Scalp used in Pakistan strikes.Dassault plans to establish a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility for Rafale’s M-88 engines in Hyderabad, complementing an existing maintenance firm in India.Indian partners such as Tata are likely to be involved in the production.The IAF sees the deal as crucial to bolstering its force structure alongside Su-30 MKIs, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark 1A, of which 180 have already been ordered, and the indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet planned for induction beyond 2035.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) wants to procure 114 ""Made in India"" Rafale fighter jets in collaboration with French manufacturer Dassault Aviation and Indian aerospace firms.

Earlier, the Ahmednagar district was renamed as Ahilyanagar district, PTI reported.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who had pursued the matter, thanked Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for granting the approval.Chief inmister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde were also involved in the efforts, a statement from Pawar’s office said.Last month, Pawar had written to Vaishnaw urging that the station be renamed to align with the city’s new name.“This long-pending demand has now been fulfilled. The renaming holds special significance as we are celebrating the 300th birth anniversary year of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar,” Pawar said.Several organisations and citizens had been demanding that the railway station’s name be changed after the city was renamed Ahilyanagar.Pawar also said efforts are underway to rename Aurangabad railway station as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station.Earlier, a similar thing was done by Karnataka government but that didn't go well with Fadnavis. The Congress government in Karnataka moved to rename Shivajinagar metro rail station in Bengaluru after St Mary.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently said his government would consider renaming Bengaluru's Shivajinagar metro station after St Mary following a request made during the annual feast at St Mary's Basilica. His deputy DK Shivakumar had claimed there is nothing unusual in responding to such community requests.Talking to reporters here, Fadnavis said, ""I condemn the Karnataka government's move to rename Shivajinagar metro station in Bengaluru after St Mary. Its an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The Congress has continued its tradition of insulting the Maratha warrior king since the time of Nehru who made comments against Shivaji Maharaj in his book Discovery of India."" Fadnavis said he was praying that the Almighty gives Siddaramaiah sense to not go ahead with such a decision that is based on religion and was against the Maratha warrior king.",The Maharashtra government on Friday issued a notification renaming Ahmednagar railway station.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31.

Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain.

But, despite scaling down on the political front, “we have been turned into beggars”, he said.“It is better to fight for our rights and be defeated than to resort to begging every day for every small thing,” he asserted.Mehdi, who was invited by the civil society of Anantnag to address people at the town hall, alleged that the district administration locked the building, forcing organisers to change the venue. “People were threatened and intimidated not to attend my meeting. If such tactics are adopted, where are we supposed to go?” he questioned.Referring to the arrest of AAP MLA Mehraj Malik under Public Safety Act, Mehdi said it was a warning to all political voices.Iftikhar Misgar, president of Anantnag Federation of Chambers of Industries Kashmir, said the MP was scheduled to address the gathering at the town hall, but the administration on Thursday declared the building unsafe and locked it, even though forest minister Javed Rana had addressed a gathering there just a day earlier.Reacting to Mehdi’s allegation, former CM and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said it was “unfortunate” that a sitting MP was not allowed to hold a meeting by his own govt. “At a time when Farooq sahib and Omar sahib are rightly voicing concern over the arrest of MLA Mehraj Malik, such restrictions on their own party’s MP raise serious questions.

Suspense Grows in Nepal PM Race: Four Names, One Decision, A Nation on Edge

NEW DELHI: Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh on Friday said that Operation Sindoor , the punitive strike targeting terror bases in Pakistan, served as a “reality check” for India’s armed forces, highlighting areas where the country can improve its defence capabilities.Speaking at the Southern Command Defence Tech Seminar (STRIDE 2025), Singh noted that the operation revealed certain capability gaps, including in electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems, low-level radars and the need for a stronger ecosystem to manufacture military-grade drones capable of operating in GPS-denied and contested environments.“It's pretty clear in the context of the geopolitical situation now that most countries are paying a lot of attention to defence and hard power again. Given our neighborhood, India is no exception, and we've just had this experience with Operation Sindoor, which was in some ways a reality check for us in terms of where we can do better, where we need to adapt to changing needs for future warfare,” Singh said.In the context of military operation, defence secretary said that it highlighted certain capability gaps in the armed forces.These gaps included areas such as electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems and the need for a stronger manufacturing ecosystem for military-grade drones that can operate effectively in GPS-denied and contested environments.He also pointed to the requirement for improvements in low-level radar systems. Singh added that these were areas where the armed forces recognized the need to strengthen and enhance capabilities.The defence secretary also emphasised India’s push for indigenous defence production, highlighting that 88 per cent of defence capital expenditure in 2024 was spent within the country.When asked about solutions to address these capability gaps, Singh said the armed forces were given flexibility through emergency procurement rules to quickly acquire equipment needed immediately.For the long term, the focus remains on developing indigenous equipment in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Singh added that while short-term purchases from global suppliers may be necessary, the ultimate goal is to achieve fully indigenous capabilities across all areas.He also reaffirmed that DRDO would continue to work on indigenous alternatives for critical systems, ensuring self-reliance in defence production.The defence secretary praised India’s multi-layered air defence system, which performed effectively during military operation. He said the system prevented major losses or casualties despite repeated attempts by drones and missiles to penetrate it.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7 in response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. It was designed as a targeted campaign to dismantle terror infrastructure along and beyond the Line of Control , reflecting precision, professionalism and strategic purpose.","Rajesh Kumar Singh: Operation Sindoor served as a ‘reality check’ for India’s armed forces.

First launched at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here in June 2022, the program had added seven more airports — covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad — in January this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at five airports through video-conference, Shah said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the program and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in as little as 30 seconds and with no long queues or manual checks.“The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji’s vision of ‘speed, scale, and scope’ into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,” he said, adding that the program introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of Modi govt — from a little over 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 — Shah said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage. Stating that everyone who has availed of the program has voiced appreciation, the home minister said “our goal should be to ensure that every Indian citizen and every OCI cardholder takes advantage of this facility”.“To achieve this, I request that when issuing passports and OCI cards, we can also conduct this registration (under FTI-TTP), so that people don’t have to come twice for fingerprinting or document verification. Whenever they travel, they can simply use their passport. I think we must further explore the technological possibilities to maximize the number of people who can take advantage of this program,” he added.",FTI-TTP enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates.

Police Form SIT To Probe Kolkata Rape Case After Victim's Father Denies Assault

LONDON: A British-born Sikh woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted, raped and beaten in a racially motivated attack on Tuesday in Oldbury, near Birmingham, by two white men.West Midlands police confirmed to TOI they are investigating the rape which the woman claims happened between 8 am and 8.30 am, and they are treating it as a racially aggravated attack.“The woman has told us that a racist remark was made to her during the attack,” a police spokesperson said.According to Sikh Federation (UK), during the attack the rapists shouted at her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.”A West Midlands Police spokesperson said they were called just before 8.30 am on Sept 9 after the woman reported being attacked in the area around Tame Road.The two attackers are described as being white. One had a shaved head, heavy build, and was wearing a dark sweatshirt and gloves. The second was wearing a grey zipped top.MP Gurinder Singh Josan, whose constituency office is just minutes away from where the rape happened, said: “This is a truly horrific attack and my thoughts are with the victim. I am reassured Sandwell police are doing everything they possibly can to find the perpetrators. The incident is being treated as a hate crime. The police are working extremely sympathetically with the victim, who has been traumatised.”Sikh Youth UK has met and is supporting the victim and her family.Chief Superintendent Kim Madill, of Sandwell police, said: “We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other enquiries well under way. We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused. Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols.”The rape follows the recent unprovoked attack on two British Sikh taxi drivers, Satnam Singh (64) and Jasbir Sangha (72), on Aug 15 outside Wolverhampton station during which Singh’s turban was ripped off. British Transport Police are treating that as a racially aggravated assault. A teenager and two men were arrested and released on bail.","A British-born Sikh woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted, raped and beaten in a racially motivated attack on Tuesday in Oldbury, near Birmingham.

However, Supreme Court on Friday ensured that the ""offence"" did not go unpunished by directing the VC to make the judgment, which recorded his alleged acts in detail, part of his resume.A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Prasanna B Varale passed the peculiar order while dismissing the plea filed by the faculty member. The court noted that the last instance of alleged sexual harassment had taken in April 2023 but the ""victim"" lodged a formal complaint in Dec 2023 with the local complaint committee which rejected the complaint as 'time barred' since it was not only beyond the prescribed period of limitation of three months but also beyond the extendable period of limitation of six months.Section 9 of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act says that any aggrieved woman may make a complaint to LCC within a period of three months from the date of incident, and in the case of series of incidents, within a period of three months from the date of the last incident. The second proviso to Section 9 provides that the LCC may for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the time of making the complaint not exceeding three months.Noting that nothing could be done in the case, the bench, however, ensured that the alleged wrong acts are not forgotten. ""It is advisable to forgive the wrongdoer, but not to forget the wrongdoing. The wrong which has been committed against the appellant (faculty member) may not be investigated on technical grounds, but it must not be forgotten. In this view of the matter, we direct that the incidents of alleged sexual harassment on part of respondent No. 1 (VC) may be forgiven but allowed to haunt the wrongdoer forever. Thus, it is directed that this judgment shall be made part of the resume of respondent No. 1, compliance of which shall be strictly ensured by him personally,"" the court said in its order.The complainant had alleged that the VC repeatedly used to call her in his office and proposed to her to go out for dinner. She had told him that she was not comfortable and wanted to keep the relationship professional only but he went on demanding ""sexual favour from her and threatened her if the offers were declined.""""A plain reading of the entire complaint would reveal that the sexual harassment, if any, of the appellant at the hands of respondent no. 1 commenced sometime in Sept 2019, and the last incident in that connection took place in April 2023. Thereafter, no incident of sexual harassment is alleged to have taken place except for the fact that on Aug 29, 2023, the appellant was removed from the post of director, Centre of Financial, Regulatory and Governance Studies (CFRGS) or that a preliminary inquiry was instituted against her by the executive council,"" the court said while holding that subsequent actions of removing her as director could not be in any way linked to sexual harassment to make her plea within the time limitation.","A sexual harassment complaint by a faculty member of West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences against its vice chancellor (VC) could not be looked into because it was not lodged within the mandatory three-month period.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday expressed concern over implementation of reservation for persons with disabilities as those PwD who perform on a par with general candidates and make it to the merit list are not treated as unreserved, like it is done in case of SC/ST reservation, and asked the Centre to rectify it.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that upward movement in reservation, which is allowed for SCs/STs and means that when reserved category students make the merit list, they be treated as unreserved, should be followed for people with disability quota also.""The direct consequence of not providing upward movement to meritorious candidate(s) applying under the category of persons with disabilities would be that even when a candidate with disability scores higher than the cut-off for unreserved category, such a candidate would invariably occupy the reserved seat, thereby denying the opportunity to a lower scoring candidate with disability to make a claim on the seat/post. In our view, this defeats the very purpose of reservation,"" Justice Mehta who penned the judgement for the bench, said.The court said a considerable segment of persons with disabilities remains historically and structurally deprived of opportunities, trapped behind layers of social, economic, and institutional barriers, and it is they who must be placed at the centre of the constitutional promise. ""The aim of state-driven welfare measures is not simply to ensure formal equality, but to dismantle barriers so that the most vulnerable and genuinely disadvantaged can fully access the support intended for them.""We consider it appropriate to require the Union of India to explain whether appropriate measures have been taken to provide the upward movement of meritorious candidates applying against the post/s reserved for persons with disabilities, in case such candidate secures more than the cut-off for the unreserved category. The same principle must also be applied to promotions. Such consideration must be guided by the overarching aim that the true and substantive benefit of reservations reaches those most in need, ensuring that no person with disability is ignored from his rightful claim to the post, merely due to the compounded barriers of poverty, stigma, and lack of access,"" the court said.",Supreme Court expresses concern over reservation for persons with disabilities.

No Trump Effect? India-EU Trade Deal Will Usher in Shared Prosperity and Balanced Growth, Says Goyal

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union Friday said that they are working intensely to finalise the trade deal by year-end, with commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal suggesting that some strategic elements may be part of the overall arrangement in the coming months.""We've been negotiating this for quite some time, but I can tell you that it never got such a momentum as we have right now, between minister Goyal and myself, and of course, having a strong political support from both leaders, Prime Minister Modi and President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen...

""I can tell you, he is a tough negotiator, very difficult to get anything past Maros... Every agreement has some give and take to make it a balanced agreement. There can never be a perfect situation and we all agree we should not make the perfect the enemy of the good.

To safeguard these growing interests, our approach to maritime information must be guided by the trinity of invention, innovation, and integration,” the Navy chief said, at the commissioning of the new base INS Aravali.INS Aravali, located at Gurugram, will support different information and communication centres of the Navy, which in turn are crucial to strengthening the country’s maritime domain awareness (MDA), command and control framework.The base will also support the Navy’s Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC) set up in 2014, which takes feeds from multiple sources ranging from coastal radars to satellites to assess threats in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), and the Information Fusion Centre–IOR located in Gurugram, which was established in 2018.“This new base will not only be a hub of technology, but also of collaboration linking our platforms and partners across the oceans, a true embodiment of our PM’s collaborative vision of `Mahasagar’ (mutual and holistic advancement for security and growth across regions).It will further strengthen India's role as the preferred security partner in the IOR,” Admiral Tripathi said.INS Aravali, with its motto `maritime security through collaboration’, will work seamlessly with naval warships and units, MDA centres and allied stakeholders. “It will help in facilitating vigilance to defend the country’s maritime interests,” an officer said.","INS Aravali, located at Gurugram, will support different information and communication centres of the Navy.

But he eventually took the MBA route earning his PhD from Louisiana State University.

In a Ted Talk, Chhokar admitted to spending three months trying to convince Sastry that professors like them shouldn't get involved in such things. But eventually he stepped in. In 1999, ADR filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on the matter. It was the beginning of his life as an activist and the formation of an enduring collaboration with Sastry.De recalls how during his public addresses Chhokar would often ask the audience, ""Who elects our political candidates?"" When people replied, ""we do,"" he would say, no, before pointing out that voters were presented a fait accompli and people only elected candidates selected by political parties. ""The parties decide the candidates, you don't,"" he would say. Chhokar's life, says De, was dedicated to creating an electoral system which was more transparent and accountable to the common people and which empowered them in every way.His passing was widely mourned.

He neither listens, nor realises what he does; such a person

Is a disease until death departs

A delayed domestic flight finally touched down in Chennai, and we were herded into a bus that crawled another 25 minutes before reaching the terminal. By the time the luggage arrived, irritation had settled like dust on my tiredness. I was eager to leave when a woman stopped me. I thought she might ask for a selfie but instead, she whispered, “In one of your speeches or columns, please share some tips for women who put up with toxic relationships.”She looked like someone in their forties, but her face carried the fatigue of many more years. The circles beneath her eyes seemed carved into her skin. Her gait was heavy, as though she carried an invisible cross.“Ma’am, I am not a counsellor,” I started, when she interjected, “But women like me cannot even dream of approaching a counsellor or a lawyer.”I decided to address the issue quickly and move away. ‘If you sit and talk it out, any issue can be resolved’, I told her. I knew it sounded hollow. She shook her head. “He will not listen. The moment I initiate a discussion, my words dissolve in his abuses and emotional storms. There is no space for a conversation.” Her eyes carried rage, not directed at me, but at the futility of hearing the same empty counsel from many.In front of me was a tortured soul. I cannot be beating around the bush. I looked at her in the eyes and said, “It is never too late to sever a relationship that has become unbearable.” She smiled, that of someone who is unable to cry. “It’s too late. The children will suffer.”Grasping at another thread, I said, “Sometimes suffering can be seen as karma cleansing. If you believe in karma, think of it as reducing your karmic debt.” She gave me a faint smile, but it did not reach her eyes. I simply held her hand. And in that silence, I understood; people in such prisons do not always seek answers. They have tried, failed, endured. What they crave is not solutions , but empathy .It is not only women who suffer. Men too fall into such traps. Wives who threaten to commit suicide, to go to the police station. The husbands won’t even be able to say a word. Dialogue is strangled before it can begin. In toxic relationships, love hardens into control, care mutates into manipulation, protection becomes possession.Thiruvalluvar noticed such people centuries ago. He doesn’t offer comforting illusions; that patience can reform them, or love can redeem them. With the sharpness of a razor, he delivers the truth:Valluvar ’s brilliance lies in what he does not say. He spares us futile remedies and, in doing so, clears the fog. Acceptance itself can be strength to endure when there is no escape, and the courage to disunite when the moment comes.Love is meant to give wings, not chains. Care is meant to bring comfort, not fear. That night at the airport, I realised that the deepest form of kindness is not advice, but a quiet hand, held in the silence of shared humanity.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123853828,imgsize-68632,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/123853828.jpg"

Jaishankar’s Big Message At BRICS Virtual Summit: Protect Global South From Tariffs & Trade Wars

Unfazed by the uncertainty hanging over the proposed summit in November, Quad cooperation at the ground level remains intact with the focus this month on counterterrorism workshops.These will include a technical exchange on misuse of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)/ drones by terrorists and a seminar on preventing terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technologies including for terror-financing.India has taken note of US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor’s remarks during his confirmation hearing that President Donald Trump remains committed to a meeting of Quad leaders and to strengthen the strategic grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US that acts as a bulwark against threats to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Trump’s efforts to mend ties with China, including through a landmark trade deal under discussion, have been seen as possible impediments in Quad’s progress even though the foreign ministers have met twice since Trump returned to the White House.The technical exchange on misuse of drones will be conducted by the National Security Guard (NSG) on September 23-24 at the NSG Garrison in Manesar. “The exercise will focus on identification of evolving UAS, framework for international cooperation by sharing best practices, subject matter expert exchange and refined national level policies for countering terrorist use of UAS or drones,” said a source, on condition of anonymity.It’s important for India that counterterrorism remains a priority for Quad, as evident from its strong condemnation of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack in the foreign ministers’ meeting in Washington in July. While India would have liked a swifter response in the days that followed the attack but the fact that the condemnation eventually came in the strongest possible terms and called for the “perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay” was significant for India.The Quad seminar on terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technology will be hosted by the NIA on September 26. It will address, according to official sources,emerging threat from terrorists by exploitation of new emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, deepfake technologies, encrypted chat platformand metaverse.“It aims to strengthen countermeasures against these threats, collaboration among Quad members through intelligence sharing, capacity building and engaging institutions and research organisations to develop safeguardsagainst misuse by terrorists,” said an official.Looking to boost India-Pacific security and prosperity, Quad will also formally launch its Ports of the Future Partnership next month with India hosting a transportation and logistics conference in Mumbai. According to a White House factsheet, the initiative will complement the work Quad partners have done to boost infrastructure expertise across the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships Program.While basic Quad cooperation continues, bilateral defence collaboration with the US seems to have escaped unscathed from the downturn in India-US ties. Three AH-64E Apache attack helicopters were delivered to the Indian Army in Julyand the US has committed to delivering 3 more in November. General Electric (GE) 404 engine delivery for India’s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme is also underway, according to sources. The US and India will carry out their bilateral Cope air exercise in November. It will be preceded by the Malabar naval exercise among the navies of India, US, Japan and Australia.",India has taken note of US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor’s remarks during his confirmation hearing that President Donald Trump remains committed to a meeting of Quad leaders.

NEW DELHI: Observing that the plight of tax-paying middle-class homebuyers presents a disheartening picture as their ""dream home"" has been reduced to an unfinished building despite paying EMIs, SC Friday said govt cannot remain a silent spectator to the woes faced by lakhs of homebuyers across the country and appealed to Centre to infuse funds in stalled housing projects and also consider taking over such projects.A bench of justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said that right to housing is not merely a contractual entitlement, but a facet of the fundamental right to life. Their protection is a constitutional obligation and govt must ensure that the dreams of India's citizens of having their own home does not turn into a lifelong nightmare, it added.The court also asked Centre to consider establishing a revival fund under NARCL or expanding the SWAMIH Fund.The State carries a constitutional obligation to create and strictly enforce a framework wherein no developer is permitted to defraud or exploit homebuyers. Ensuring timely project completion must be a cornerstone of India's urban policy. Equally, the State must proactively address the menace of a parallel cash economy and speculative practices in the real estate market, which artificially inflate housing costs and enable 'trigger-happy' investors seeking easy exits to jeopardise the interests of genuine end-users,"" the bench said.In view of increasing number of real estate housing projects across the country coming under insolvency proceedings which has left lakhs of homebuyers in the lurch with uncertainty over getting possession of these houses, SC said the Centre may consider establishing a body corporate, on the lines of National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd or otherwise, promoted by real estate/ construction-focused PSUs or through public-private partnerships, to identify, take over, and complete stalled projects under the IBC framework.It said home is not merely a roof over one's head, but a reflection of one's hopes and dreams which must be protected by govt.""The plight of tax-paying middle-class citizens paints a disheartening picture. Having invested their lifelong savings in pursuit of a home, many are compelled to shoulder a double burden - servicing EMIs on one hand, and paying rent on the other - only to find their dream home reduced to an unfinished building. In some cases, construction has not even commenced despite full or substantial payment,"" it said.""The Union govt shall consider establishing a revival fund under NARCL or expanding the SWAMIH Fund, to provide bridge financing for stressed projects undergoing CIRP, thereby preventing liquidation of viable projects and safeguarding homebuyer interests. Under SWAMIH Fund initiative, every rupee must be utilised strictly for its intended purpose of last-mile financing. To prevent misuse, we direct that a comprehensive periodic performance audit by the CAG be carried out,"" it said.","Supreme Court asks Centre to infuse funds in stalled housing projects and also consider taking over such projects.

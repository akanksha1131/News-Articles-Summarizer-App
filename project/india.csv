PM Modi to visit Cyprus in the middle of Turkiye-Pakistan solidarity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-visit-cyprus-in-the-middle-of-turkiye-pakistan-solidarity/articleshow/121742472.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: As India works to expand its footprint in Europe, PM Narendra Modi will visit Cyprus on his way to Canada for the G7 summit and Croatia while returning home.Both Cyprus and Croatia are members of the EU and the former will hold the rotating presidency of the EU Council for the first half of the next year. Modi was scheduled to travel to Croatia last month, along with the Netherlands and Norway, but the visit had to be postponed because of the military tensions between India and Pakistan.The G7 summit takes place at Kananaskis in Alberta from June 15 to 17, with Modi participating in the outreach session on the last day. The eleventh hour invitation by Canada means that PM’s programme is yet to be finalised but government sources said efforts are underway to schedule bilateral meetings.The visit to Cyprus, only the 3rd by an Indian PM after A B Vajpayee in 2002 and Indira Gandhi in 1983, will also be followed closely as it comes in the middle of tensions between India and Turkiye over the latter’s support to Pakistan - and the show of solidarity by President Recep Erdogan himself - during the India-Pakistan military clash last month.Ankara’s recognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the northern region that was seized by Turkish forces in 1974 and differences over gas exploration rights in the Eastern Mediterranean remain a constant source of tensions between Turkiye and Cyprus.India has consistently backed solution of what is known as the Cyprus problem through UNSC resolutions and international law.As Turkiye stands solidly with Pakistan, India has sought to strengthen ties with both Cyprus and Greece, focusing on defence and security cooperation. Modi became the first Indian PM to visit Greece in 40 years when he travelled to Athens in 2023.Both countries have supported India on issues concerning terrorism and also on Kashmir. According to the MEA, Cyprus has backed India on a number of significant issues like India’s election to UNSC, the India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, NSG membership and also the 1998 nuclear tests.Modi’s visit to Croatia on his way back will also be the first visit by any Indian PM to the country. S Jaishankar became the first Indian foreign minister to visit the southeast European country in 2021 as the 2 countries looked to expand bilateral ties. Two years later, India and Croatia also signed an MoU for defence cooperation.","PM Narendra Modi will visit Cyprus on his way to Canada for the G7 summit.

The nuclear engineer who chose the fields: Randip’s journey from special forces to Stanford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-nuclear-engineer-who-chose-the-fields-randips-journey-from-special-forces-to-stanford/articleshow/121741324.cms,"Randip Singh

At 19, Randip Singh stood in an Amtrak station in Albany, NY when a police officer approached him with an unusual request: “Can I see your passport?” He didn’t ask for a driver's license, but a passport. The implication was clear.Years later, Singh would find himself 300 meters away from a 250kg Russian bomb that left a crater the size of a house in the Syrian desert. The shockwave that followed lifted the entire landscape toward him, like something out of a movie.Between these two moments lies a story that eludes categorization: a nuclear engineer who abandoned a promising corporate career to spend 11 years in the Army , including multiple deployments as a Special Forces medic in Iraq and Syria. Now, sitting in Stanford's Graduate School of Business, Singh represents something increasingly rare: someone who chose the hardest possible path to find belonging.“I believe in things enough to give my life for them. That's why I liked the Army; there are people there who believe in causes,” Singh says matter-of-factly during our conversation.Singh's journey began with displacement. Born in America but raised in India after his parents divorced, he experienced what he calls “the outsider view” from an early age.This perspective shaped him through boarding school, through his nuclear engineering studies at RPI in New York, and eventually through his time at General Electric, which he ultimately chose to leave.Singh’s deeper issue was belonging. Despite being born American, Singh felt like an outsider in his own country. The Amtrak incident wasn't isolated; he endured comments like “Hey, Osama, go back to your home”.“When you’re younger, you think that's gonna solve something,” he reflects on his decision to enlist. “I thought serving would create belonging, not because I’m some patriot, but purely from my internal motivation of feeling like I belong in this country.”Singh didn't just join the Army; instead, he sought out its most demanding roles. He became a Special Forces medic, a position that required learning trauma medicine in one year – something that takes more than 5 – while maintaining the physical and mental standards of elite warfare.""They basically combine what an ER surgeon does into one year, along with some dentistry, veterinarian medicine, and internal medicine,"" he explains. ""You learn to do amputations, chest tubes, tooth extractions, and you only get two or three practice attempts. If you can't get it right in three tries, you're done. 70% of people fail.""The training philosophy was brutal but effective. As one Grizzled Green Beret instructor told Singh: “80% of what you do won't affect the outcome of the patient. 20% will build your reputation.""This lesson in accepting what you cannot control would prove crucial when Singh had to make triage decisions in treating victims of an ISIS attack. “Three people died,” Singh recalls, his voice quieting.“There's some amount of fate that you just can't control,” he says. “That was a big insight because until then I had this engineering mindset that I could control everything. Accepting that has made me much happier.”This perspective shapes how he evaluates human potential now. “Most people compare themselves too early to masters,” he observes. “They try to learn golf and immediately compare themselves to Tiger Woods . You discount your own potential because of that.”Instead, Singh values people who can “break problems down and go into insane detail.” In combat, this meant knowing exactly how many meters away a building was, even if it seemed irrelevant. “When someone's life is on the line, I want to know everything.”Perhaps most striking about Singh is his refusal to choose between his Indian and American identities. “I see myself as 100% Indian and 100% American,” he states. “I can choose the good things from both cultures.”This dual identity, forged through displacement and tested in combat, gives him a unique perspective on belonging. The teenager who felt he needed to prove his Americanness through military service now understands that belonging is “your own meditative thing and how you think about it.”At Stanford, Singh is preparing for his next chapter: returning to the energy sector, working on large infrastructure projects. But business school serves a different purpose than mere career preparation.“I lost some confidence in the Army because I was enlisted,” he admits. “I didn't know if I could make strategic decisions. Being here helps me build confidence that yes, I can do that too.”His three core values are autonomy, persistence, and integrity, which were forged through experiences most people never face. His mother’s decision to leave an unsuccessful marriage taught him autonomy. His grandfather’s success as a self-taught machinist to a successful businessman demonstrated persistence. And the Army's unforgiving standards demanded absolute integrity.As he prepares to leave Stanford and return to building infrastructure that powers society, Singh carries with him the hard-won wisdom of someone who chose the most difficult path to find himself. His story challenges comfortable assumptions about patriotism, belonging, and what it means to serve.“I wanted to see a part of human nature you can't see in corporate settings,” he reflects on his Army years. “It's a very raw form of humanity. That experience was worth everything.”In a world increasingly dominated by safe choices and calculated risks, Randip Singh stands as a reminder that sometimes the hardest path leads to the clearest understanding of who you are and what you're capable of.","Randip Singh was born in America but raised in India after his parents divorced. He felt like an outsider in his own country, so he enlisted in the Army. He spent 11 years as a Special Forces medic in Iraq and Syria.

Indian Judiciary’s commitment to justice transcends borders: Justice Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-judiciarys-commitment-to-justice-transcends-borders-justice-kant/articleshow/121740803.cms,"Justice Surya Kant

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant of Indian Supreme Court on Monday told the Indian business community in Washington that Indian judiciary understood the problems faced by the Indian diaspora and NRIs and played a crucial role in resolving unique challenges faced by them relating to property, inheritance and custody of children in soured matrimonial relations.Speaking with Indian businessmen from various states gathered under the banner of ‘Washington Telangana Association’, Justice Kant said, “With procedural adaptations and a growing recognition of cross-border complexities, the courts have made justice more accessible to those living abroad. In certain areas, the judiciary has also extended the protection of Fundamental Rights, ensuring that non-resident citizens are treated with fairness and equality under the law. ”“In doing so, it reinforces the message that India’s commitment to justice does not end at its borders, it reaches all those who continue to carry the country in their hearts,” he added.Commending the resilience of Indian diaspora to maintain their identity while continuing to participate in the technological innovations, research and community service in the countries they have made home while exploring opportunities, Justice Kant said the Indian identity thrives in our languages and festivals, but also in our collective commitment to justice, dignity, and mutual respect.These are the ideals that shape not just who we are, but who we continue to become, no matter where we live. ”Commending the role played by the Indian diaspora as ambassadors of India’s rich cultural and constitutional legacy by not only preserving it for ourselves but sharing it with the world, the next CJI said, “In doing so, we honour not only our past, but also our enduring responsibility to shape a future that is united in diversity, grounded in justice, and inspired by the very best of who we are.”“The success of the Indian diaspora is not only measured in individual achievement - though that alone is remarkable. It is also reflected in the collective identity that communities have preserved and passed on across generations. Whether through temples, cultural centres, schools, or community events, the diaspora has cultivated a sense of belonging and solidarity, making the Indian identity one that thrives far beyond national borders,” he said.","Justice Surya Kant of Indian Supreme Court told the Indian business community in Washington that Indian judiciary understood the problems faced by the Indian diaspora and NRIs.

AGRA: Days after a woman's charred body was found in a forest in Muzaffarnagar, police have arrested her father and brother for allegedly strangling her and setting her body on fire.Saraswati Maliyan, 23, who worked with an e-commerce MNC in Gurgaon, handling orders and last-mile delivery, had been in a live-in relationship with Amit, a man from her village. Police said her father, Rajveer Singh, 55, and brother, Sumit Singh, 24, a truck driver, confessed to killing her when she visited home as they were opposed to the relationship.Saraswati, police said, had been forced into marriage in 2019 but left her husband after two years. ""Another marriage was arranged by her family in 2022 but that didn't wotk out either.

Strategy: Gold and Silver Buy on dips.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have seen major fluctuations over the last few weeks, ever since the yellow metal prices hit a lifetime high. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment in times of turmoil and uncertainty. The rapidly evolving geopolitical and trade situations have kept gold investors guessing on the direction of gold prices. So, what is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Last week, Gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front, driven by a weakening dollar and escalating global uncertainty. Silver posted one the sharpest gains on daily and weekly basis, gaining 2.7% in the previous session, its strongest daily performance in over three weeks, as investors sought refuge amid concerns over the US-China trade deal.The upcoming trade discussions between US and China remains a key event for market direction. The European Commission is also urging the US to reduce tariffs, adding to the broader trade policy uncertainty.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions intensified with Russia demanding territorial concessions from Ukraine to end the war. On the macro front, weaker-than-expected US manufacturing and services PMI data, coupled with disappointing private payrolls, raised concerns about stagflation.Still, the better-than-expected non-farm payroll data signalled resilience in the labour market, keeping investor sentiment mixed.Silver, after lagging behind gold, saw renewed interest due to improved fundamentals and technical momentum, pushing it to a 13-year high. The Gold/Silver ratio also dropped sharply, signalling silver’s relative strength.ETF inflows into silver added further support, reflecting growing investor appetite for the metal amid continued global economic and political instability. Focus this week will be on US and China CPI data.","Last week, Gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers.

Defence PSUs Bharat Electronics and Bharat Dynamics will co-produce the QR-SAM systems.""The QR-SAM systems can operate on the move with search and track capability and fire at short halts.They are tailor-made to move along with tanks and infantry combat vehicles to provide them air defence in the tactical battlefield,"" an official said.The Army Air Defence (AAD), which performed exceedingly well during Operation Sindoor, in fact, requires 11 regiments of the QR-SAM, even as it progressively also inducts regiments of the indigenous Akash system, which has an interception range of about 25-km at present.The induction of the QR-SAM systems will add to the existing air defence network of the IAF and the Army, which ranges from the long-range Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380 km interception range) and Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70 km), jointly developed with Israel, to the Russian shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6 km), the upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5 km) and the indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1km-2 km).While the DRDO is also readying the very short-range air defence missile systems (VSHORADS), which have a 6 km interception range, the real game-changer will be an air defence system with a 350 km range being developed under the ambitious Project Kusha.India plans to operationally deploy this long-range system by 2028-2029, with the defence ministry in Sept 2023 approving the AoN for procurement of five of its squadrons for the IAF at a cost of Rs 21,700 crore, as was first reported by TOI.Also read: India aims to deploy indigenous long-range air defence system by 2028-2029","The defence ministry will soon take up the case for a preliminary nod to a Rs 30,000 crore proposal to procure three regiments of the new indigenous quick reaction surface to air missile (QR-SAM) systems.

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar have been summoned to Delhi for a damage-control meeting Tuesday with Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi as continued outrage over the June 4 Bengaluru stampede that killed 11 RCB fans puts Congress - accused of playing pass-the-buck - on a sticky wicket.A bureaucrat in the CMO said Siddaramaiah, who maintains that the state govt didn't put a foot wrong, received what he described as ""a sudden call"" from the Congress brass. He and Shivakumar were asked to prepare a detailed briefing of the administration's response to the stampede outside Chinnaswamy Stadium ahead of IPL-winning RCB's victory parade, the official said. Congress's urgency to firm up a strategy to counter the storm comes a day after the opposition doubled down on its demand for political accountability, including a three-day special legislative session to discuss what led to the stampede.Sources said AICC's Karnataka minder, Randeep Singh Surjewala, will be with Rahul at the scheduled 11am meeting with Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. The latter was in the national capital Monday for an official engagement, but returned to Bengaluru late evening. He will be back in Delhi in time for the meeting with the high command, the sources said. For now, the three distinct Congress camps in Karnataka led by Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar and state home minister G Parameshwar are speaking in one voice as a credibility crisis stares the party in the face. The state govt has been accused of making police the scapegoats after five senior cops, including the Bengaluru's former city police commissioner B Dayananda, were suspended the evening after the stampede.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar have been summoned to Delhi for a damage-control meeting with Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi.

This has shrunk the PB to just four active members-Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy, Mallojula Venugopal alias Abhay, Thippiri Tirupathi alias Deoji, and Misir Besra.Sources indicated that either Abhay or Deoji, both from Telangana, may have take up Basavaraju's mantle, though there is no statement yet from CPI (Maoist) on the succession. Every PB member is part of the CC but not vice versa.The CC numbers too have dwindled, with 26 non-PB members lost since 2007 to arrests, surrenders and death by illness. It now has 14 active members, including the four PB leaders. A dozen CC members are currently in jail and three dead by disease.Four CC members have surrendered in Telangana and Maharashtra and seven neutralised since 2007, including four this year.Active CC members now include Kadari Satyanaryana Reddy, Chandranna, Modem Balakrishna, Ganesh Uike, Gajarla Ravi, Anal da, Madvi Hidma, K Ramachandra Reddy, Sujata and Malla Raja Reddy.""The command structure of the Maoists is now in tatters.

Between 2008 and 2011, more PB members landed behind bars-Pramod Mishra in Ranchi in 2008 and again in 2022; Kobad Gandhy in Delhi in 2009, though he is now a free man; Amitabh Bagchi in Ranchi in 2009; and Jagdish Yadav in Gaya, Bihar, in 2011. Baccha Prasad Singh and Bansi Dhar Singh were apprehended in Kanpur in 2010. Jhantu Mukherjee and Narayan Sanyal were arrested in 2006 and 2011, respectively, but are now dead. Kattam Sudarshan died in Dandakarenya in 2023. PB members Cherkuri Rajkumar alias 'Azad' and Kishenji were killed in 2010-2011, while Arvindji succumbed to illness in Jharkhand in 2018. Prashant Bose alias Kishan da was arrested with his wife Sheela Marandi, a CC member, from Jharkhand in 2021.The biggest blow came with the elimination of CPI (Maoist) general secretary Basavaraju, a PB and CC member. The CC is now down to just 14 members, including 4 PB leaders. Among the CC members arrested are Mithilesh Mehta in 2007 and again in 2022; Vishnu in Mumbai in 2007; Moti Lal Soren in 2009 in Odisha; Pradeep Singla in 2009; Vijay Kumar Arya in 2011 and 2022 and Varanasi Subrahmanyam in Bihar in 2011.

The terms of all state assemblies constituted after this date will expire with the end of that Lok Sabha's five-year term. If Lok Sabha or a state assembly is dissolved earlier than its five-year term, an election for it will be held for a term equal to the remainder of the five-year term.This will synchronise its next election with the simultaneous elections cycle. Even in states, where polls will be due, elections for assemblies will be held only to align with the Lok Sabha polls.However, the bill states that if the Election Commission is of the opinion that election to a state assembly cannot be held along with the rest of the country, it may make a recommendation to the President in this regard. The President may issue an order to conduct an election for that assembly at a later date. The BJP MP from Pali in Rajasthan, Choudhary, said going by the JPC's working, its tenure may be extended as there was a consensus amongst panel members to visit states and UTs before making the final recommendations. So far, JPC members have visited Maharashtra and Uttarakhand. The bills had been introduced in LS in Dec last year and were referred to the Chaudhary-led panel which has been holding consultations with stakeholders for feedback.","The Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment Bill), 2024, have provisions for simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies.

For example, a senior official said, even students who obtained less than 50% marks in 10+2 (physics, chemistry, biology) -- a basic criterion -- were granted admission.A senior NMC official highlighted that while granting admission, medical colleges are required to ensure the numbers are not beyond their sanctioned intake capacity. Also, colleges must make sure that students meet eligibility requirements regarding age and qualifying marks.All students admitted to MBBS course are supposed to have cleared NEET-UG with the required percentile: 50th percentile and above for general category, 45th percentile and above for the physically challenged and 40th percentile and above for reserved (SC/ST/OBC) candidates.","The National Medical Commission (NMC) has said that students who got admission in MBBS course in 2024-25 but whose names are missing from its portal may not be eligible for registration to practise medicine.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Monday said significant milestones were achieved in economic revival, social justice, cultural pride and national security during the 11 years of Narendra Modi government, with the governance focused on farmers, women, backward classes, Dalits and the underprivileged.“In 11 years of seva, the speed and scale of the country’s development have been changed by ‘minimum govt, maximum governance’,” Shah said in a series of posts on X, adding that “the Modi government has proved that when the leadership is clear, the resolve firm and public service the intention, new records of service, security and good governance are created”.Dwelling on the positive change in the security landscape, Shah posted that not only is Naxalism on the wane and peace established in J&K and the northeast, but “India now responds to terrorist attacks by striking the terror perpetrators in their own backyard”.Data relating to incidents in J&K, Maoist violence-hit regions and the northeast, sourced by TOI, substantiates Shah’s statement.

NEW DELHI: All new non-AC local trains for the Mumbai Suburban network will have automatic closing doors, like in metro trains, and the system will be installed in existing rakes subsequently, the Railway Board said after four passengers died and six were injured as they fell from a moving overcrowded local train in Thane on Monday.The first train with the new door system will be ready by Nov, and after required tests and certification, it will be put into service by Jan next year. The design is being finalised by Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory (ICF), top railway officials said.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Railway Board officials had a detailed meeting with the ICF team “to find a practical solution” to the issue, ministry officials said. They added that a major issue with automatic door closing in non-AC trains is reduced ventilation in coaches.“Following detailed discussions, it was decided that new non-AC trains will be designed and manufactured using three design changes — first, the doors will have louvres; second, coaches will have roof-mounted ventilation units to pump in fresh air and third, coaches will have vestibules so that passengers can move from one coach to another and balance out the crowd in a natural way,” an official said.Officials said a few years back, the automatic door closing system on non-AC local trains underwent trials but it impacted operations, leading to delays on the network.Now, there is no other option left but to have the system in all non-AC coaches, they said. “It has to be implemented for the people’s safety and to prevent people travelling on a coach’s footboard,” said an official. Every day, around 80 lakh passengers use local trains for commuting.At present, local trains make around 3,216 trips on the Mumbai Suburban network. There are around 280 non-AC rakes. “In all, around 3,405 coaches have to be retrofitted with the door closing system,” said an official.Officials said 13 projects of 310 km worth Rs 17,000 crore are being executed to augment the capacity of the network, and the railway can add more services to meet the traffic demand when these get completed.","Four passengers died and six were injured as they fell from a moving overcrowded local train in Thane on Monday.

Sidney Crosby 15 years long relationship with girlfriend Kathy Leutner





NHL legend Sidney Crosby has not only guided the Pittsburgh Penguins to championship heights but has also established a quiet, solid, long-lasting relationship off the ice with long-time girlfriend American model Kathy Leutner. Though Sidney Crosby's on-ice accomplishments are well-documented, his love life has long been kept under wraps. Kathy Leutner has been his constant companion, regularly seen cheering him on at pivotal matches but never hankering for the limelight herself.The two began dating back in 2008 when they were introduced by common friends. Sidney Crosby was an NHL superstar by then, while Kathy Leutner was establishing a thriving modeling career for brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and Faviana. She was selected in 2011 to appear on Sports Illustrated's model search and was one of the very few women from her agency to receive an in-office interview with the editorial team.

Leutner is the daughter of John and Judith Leutner.She graduated from Chantilly High School in 2004 and was offered a partial athletic scholarship from James Madison University, a testament to her prowess in the sport.

Why Reaves Could Be on the Move

How This Trade Impacts the Lakers





Theare no strangers to blockbuster moves, and this offseason could bring another seismic shift. Rumors are swirling that the franchise may be eyeing a trade with the Dallas Mavericks to acquire rising star center—a dynamic big man with proven chemistry alongside Luka Dončić. In a potential multi-team deal, the Lakers could part ways with fan favorite Austin Reaves to secure the 21-year-old rim protector, signaling a bold pivot toward youth and athleticism.According to Sports Illustrated’s Jackson Caudell , the Lakers could part ways with Austin Reaves in a multi-team deal to acquire Dereck Lively II, the 21-year-old big man who thrived in Dallas.Caudell outlines a potential trade scenario involving multiple teams and players: Los Angeles Lakers receive: Dereck Lively II and Terance Mann- Mavericks receive: Austin Reaves, Dalton Knecht, Georges Niang, Shake Milton, a 2027 second-round pick, and a 2029 second-round pick- Hawks receive: Naji Marshall and P.J. Washington""Yes they lose Reaves, but they get one of the best centers in the NBA and one that has plenty of familiarity with Doncic. They keep their picks and have other expiring deals they can send out to upgrade the rest of their roster around Doncic, Lively, and (LeBron) James."" (H/t: Sporting News He also notes that Reaves’ impending contract extension could make trading him now a smarter long-term move.While not yet a superstar, Lively has proven to be an elite pick-and-roll finisher, particularly with Luka Doncic . His strengths include:- Elite screening ability – Creates space for guards- Strong rim-running – Excels in transition and half-court sets- Efficient scoring – Shot 74.7% from the field last seasonDespite injuries limiting his playing time, Lively has been highly productive when on the court.Austin Reaves had a solid season but didn’t elevate his game enough in the playoffs to cement his place as a long-term Laker.With the team looking to build around LeBron James and potentially another star, moving Reaves for a young, athletic center like Lively could be a strategic play.Caudell adds:""Reaves is going to be due a massive contract extension soon and if the Lakers are building around Doncic and James, it might be best to deal him now for a young center.""If this deal goes through, the Los Angeles Lakers would:- Upgrade at center – Lively is a defensive anchor and elite lob threat- Maintain future flexibility – Keep draft assets for further moves- Improve bench depth – Terance Mann adds another reliable rotation pieceThe Los Angeles Lakers are clearly exploring ways to maximize their roster around LeBron James. Trading Austin Reaves for Dereck Lively II could be a bold but calculated move, giving them a young, high-upside center while keeping future options open.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could sign $110 million Cleveland Cavaliers duo to bolster squad in blockbuster 3-way deal including the Miami Heat As the offseason unfolds, all eyes will be on whether this blockbuster trade materializes.","The Los Angeles Lakers could part ways with Austin Reaves in a multi-team deal to acquire Dereck Lively II.

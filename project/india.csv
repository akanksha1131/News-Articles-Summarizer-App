MUMBAI: At least 11 persons, including six cabin crew members, felt dizzy and nauseated on an Air India flight from London to Mumbai on Monday, said sources. Air India confirmed the incident but said only five passengers and two crew members took ill.The flight AI-130 was operated with a Boeing 777 aircraft. The aircraft that's under increased scrutiny following the Ahmedabad accident is Boeing 787 Dreamliner.The cause for the illness is under probe.

After landing, two passengers and two cabin crew, who continued to feel unwell, were taken to the medical room for further examination and were later discharged. We are investigating the incident and have duly notified the regulator.""A source said a cabin depressurisation problem could cause lower levels of oxygen in the passenger cabin, but then oxygen masks drop from the overhead panel, which didn't happen during this flight.""So, drop in cabin pressurisation is not likely to be the cause.""

Mira Nair’s career as a filmmaker: Documenting truth, directing change





A legacy of radical empathy



Mira Nair: A mother who taught through action

As Zohran Mamdani clinches the Democratic nomination for New York City’s mayoral race, all eyes are on the 33-year-old progressive politician. But behind his headline-making political journey lies a rich lineage shaped by two formidable intellectuals—his father, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani, and his mother, internationally acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair . Mira Nair’s journey—from a curious student in Bhubaneswar to a bold, award-winning filmmaker in New York—was never just about cinema. It was about telling stories that cut across borders, identities, and power. For Zohran Mamdani, growing up in the shadow of that fierce storytelling spirit meant more than just watching films—it meant learning how to question, challenge, and rewrite the script. Here’s a closer look at the education and career that shaped Mira Nair into the storyteller who helped shape her son’s political conscience.To understand the ideological and emotional scaffolding of Zohran Mamdani's political identity, one must return to the pioneering work of his mother, Mira Nair. A filmmaker of formidable range and unshakable conviction, Nair has long blurred the lines between art and activism. With a career spanning over four decades, she has challenged both cinematic orthodoxy and cultural stereotypes with equal fervor.Born in Rourkela, Odisha, and raised in Bhubaneswar, Nair was the daughter of a civil servant father and a mother who was a dedicated social worker.Early exposure to public service and storytelling quietly laid the foundation for her empathetic worldview. After excelling at Loreto Convent in Shimla and majoring in sociology at Delhi’s prestigious Miranda House, Nair was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University at the age of 19. There, she pursued a concentration in Visual and Environmental Studies, with a particular focus on documentary filmmaking—a decision that would launch her into international acclaim.Nair’s initial foray into filmmaking was defined by unflinching realism. Her early documentaries—Jama Masjid Street Journal, India Cabaret, So Far From India—examined lives on the margins, from strippers in Bombay to Indian immigrants living underground in New York. Her lens never flinched, even when her subjects made audiences uncomfortable. It was this documentary eye that informed her breakout feature Salaam Bombay! in 1988, a heart-wrenching narrative of street children in Mumbai. The film not only earned an Academy Award nomination but led Nair to establish the Salaam Baalak Trust to serve the very children her film depicted.This duality—of cinema as both mirror and megaphone—is what distinguishes Nair's career. With Monsoon Wedding, which won the Golden Lion at Venice, and The Namesake, which tenderly captured the cultural dislocations of Indian-American families, she crafted emotionally resonant films that also interrogated the politics of identity, gender, and migration.Nair’s contributions extend far beyond her filmography. Through the Maisha Film Lab in Uganda—founded in 2005—she has nurtured generations of East African filmmakers with the mantra: If we don’t tell our stories, no one else will. This dedication to democratizing storytelling mirrors her son's grassroots approach to politics, where the personal and the political are in constant dialogue.Her academic engagement as a professor at Columbia University, her active support of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, and her principled refusal to attend Israel’s Haifa Film Festival speak to a consistency of vision: one where artistic expression and moral courage are indivisible.It is tempting to view Zohran Mamdani’s political ascent as anomalous within the American political machine. But when viewed through the prism of Mira Nair’s life, his path seems inevitable. Nair, who defied convention at every turn—from attending Harvard in the 1970s to refusing Hollywood’s blandishments when they clashed with her integrity—has always modeled the quiet audacity of conviction.And perhaps that is her most indelible contribution to her son’s public life. She did not just raise him with stories; she raised him with a commitment to telling them truthfully, ethically, and loudly. If Zohran’s campaign is a masterclass in progressive coalition-building, it is also an homage to the woman who taught him that storytelling—on screen or in the streets—can shift consciousness.","Zohran Mamdani is running for New York City mayor.

During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu.

The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window.

Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate.

Viral: Tharoor’s Sharp Swipe At Pakistan In Moscow; After English, Fiery Takedown In French

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , widely recognised for his eloquence in English, drew widespread praise this week for speaking fluent French while strongly criticising Pakistan’s inclusion in an upcoming anti-terrorism conference organised by Russia.During a meeting in Moscow with Russian Liberal Democratic Party chairman Leonid Slutsky, Tharoor responded in French to Slutsky’s remarks regarding a proposed summit on combating terrorism.Slutsky had announced Russia’s plans to host a conference early next year involving the parliamentary heads of six countries: Turkey, Iran, Russia, India, Pakistan, and China. He emphasised the need for concrete action, not just discussion, on the issue of terrorism.In a striking moment, Tharoor replied in French, directly addressing the problem of Pakistan’s involvement. ""There is a country that unfortunately provides a safe haven for these terrorist groups,"" Tharoor said. ""They have their headquarters, they train terrorists in their country, fund them, arm them, and send them to other nations.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini.

Ineffective repairs carried out on aircraft leading torecurrence of snags and vehicles on tarmac without speed governors. The DGCA’s ongoing audit of the “Indian aviation ecosystem” is already throwing up several such findings. “This process of comprehensive surveillance will continue in future to detect hazards in the system,” said a senior official.The audit was announced on June 19 and since then two teams of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) led by joint DGs have fanned out at major airports including Delhi’s IGIA and Mumbai’s CSMIA for a “focussed assessment”.“A simulator was checked and found not matching with the aircraft configuration. Also the software was not updated to the current version,” the DGCA said in a statement.“All the findings observed during the surveillance have been communicated to the concerned operators for taking necessary corrective actions within seven days.”The critical areas under surveillance include: flight operations, airworthiness, ramp safety, air traffic control (ATC), communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems, and pre-flight medical evaluations. “Throughout the surveillance, ground activities and aircraft movements were closely monitored to check the compliance of regulatory requirements and to identify weak areas for improvement,” an official said.The action comes after the DGCA on June 19 ordered a focused assessment of the aviation ecosystem to strengthen safety measures across the sector.","The audit was announced on June 19 and since then two teams of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) led by joint DGs have fanned out at major airports. “This process of comprehensive surveillance will continue in future to detect hazards in the system,” said a senior official.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122048257,imgsize-664894,width-400,resizemode-4/122048257.jpg"

However, HC stayed operation of the order for 20 days to enable her to appeal in SC.Presenting Indira's appeal before judge Justice Iyer on June 23, Palkhivala was allowed to argue for 90 minutes, the same as Raj Narain's counsel Shanti Bhushan to counter it, and then another 30 minutes to Palkhivala for rejoinder.On June 24, Justice Iyer gave a long interim order and said Indira was entitled to participate in Lok Sabha proceedings as PM, but would not have the right to vote or draw remuneration as an MP till her petition was decided by the apex court. It said her powers as PM would remain unaffected.Much later, Justice Iyer revealed it was Palkhivala's brilliance which persuaded him to grant stay. In Justice Iyer's own words, ""Nani presented the case lucidly and luminously, pressing every point that deserved to be made but not haranguing or cringing...His courtesy to the court was winsome, his diction delectable, his precision perfect.""A day later, at 11pm, Indira went to Rashtrapati Bhavan to inform President Fakruddin Ali Ahmed that her govt had decided to impose a state of internal Emergency at once. After arguing the case, Palkhivala had left for Bombay.After imposition of Emergency, many renowned lawyers requested Palkhivala to withdraw from representing Indira. Palkhivala agreed and rang up TOI to publish a long statement about returning the brief - Indira's case file. Risking the draconian censorship powers vested with the police, TOI agreed to publish a short news item stating Palkhivala had returned the PM's brief.On June 27, 1975, Palkhivala wrote to Indira: ""While I adhere to my views regarding the legal merits of the PM's appeal against HC's judgment on the election petition against her (filed by Raj Narain), the measures taken by the govt this morning are such that, consistent with my lifelong convictions and the values I cherish, I have requested the law minister (H R Gokhale) to convey to the PM my decision to withdraw as counsel from the appeal. Unfortunately, pre-censorship did not permit even this perfectly innocuous statement to be printed.""A year later, Indira's personal envoy Mohd Yunus took a dig at Palkhivala by comparing his action with that of a doctor who abandons a patient and questioned his professional ethics. Palkhivala was not the one to be perturbed by such insinuations.","Nani Palkhivala and a team of 10 advocates had appeared for Indira before the high court. Allahabad HC found her guilty of corrupt electoral practices, set aside her election. HC stayed operation of the order for 20 days to enable her to appeal in SC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122081808,imgsize-50612,width-400,resizemode-4/122081808.jpg"
Gender equality In Indian workplaces remains uneven,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gender-equality-in-indian-workplaces-remains-uneven/articleshow/122081764.cms,"India is facing increasingly grave consequences of climate change, with approximately 5.4 million people internally displaced due to floods, droughts or erratic weather. Ranked sixth globally in terms of climate vulnerability, India must navigate the challenge of balancing development with sustainability.India accounts for 7.4% of global emissions, making it the world's sixth largest emitter. The primary sources are electricity and heat production, followed by the transport sector, which contributes 12.9% of emissions. Although renewables now contribute 47.4% of installed capacity, coal use continues to rise - production has grown 58% between FY 2013-14 and FY 2022-23, still fuelling over 70% of CO2 emissions.In response, India introduced the Panchamrit strategy at COP26, which outlines key climate goals for 2030 and 2070. These include installing 500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity, sourcing 50% of energy from renewables, reducing carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes, cutting carbon intensity by 45%, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2070.Regulatory mechanisms are being put in place to support these targets. These include a carbon market framework, GHG Emission Intensity Target Rules for high-emission sectors, and a Climate Finance Taxonomy to steer investment into sustainable projects across nine national missions.Environmental disclosures through frameworks such as Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) are now mandatory for the top 1,000 listed companies. Compliance with international standards like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is increasing.Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) has emerged as a frontrunner in corporate climate action. The company aims to be carbon neutral by 2040 and has committed to substantial reductions in Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. M\&M's efforts include using 100% renewable energy by 2030, expanding its electric vehicle fleet, and afforestation through Project Hariyali, which has planted over 1 million trees.Start-ups are also contributing to the climate movement. Takachar, for example, has developed portable technology that converts agricultural waste into bioproducts, offering alternatives to harmful stubble burning and opening new revenue streams for rural communities.Despite these advances, challenges remain. While 92% of SMEs surveyed consider ESG a priority, over half cite cost as a major barrier. Other obstacles include fragmented regulations, limited resources, and insufficient awareness. Overcoming these will require coordination among businesses, regulators, and civil society.The Times of India, over the years, has launched hugely impactful campaigns and organised summits with powerful messaging and impact on the social sector. To recognise and reward work in the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) space, The Times of India is holding a two-day Social Impact Summit on July 11 and 12, 2025, in Mumbai. The event, presented by Malabar Gold & Diamonds, has Ernst & Young as the knowledge partner.The Summit will see business leaders, NGOs, and policymakers address these issues. As Madhav Pai, CEO of WRI India, recently remarked this decade presents a crucial opportunity for India to steer its infrastructure investments toward climate resilience and low-carbon growth.","India accounts for 7.4% of global emissions, making it the world's sixth largest emitter.

Pakistan Major who 'nabbed' Abhinandan killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-major-who-nabbed-abhinandan-killed/articleshow/122081687.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

On May 20, 2025, an order to this effect was also issued by Chief Secretary Anand Bardhan.All the officers were expected to comment on the changes in their first place of appointment area.This means that how fast has the development progressed there as of today and how can the use of CSR or other resources improve the social and economic development of the village. The officers also have to prepare an action plan for 100% correct use of the funds received from the district plan, state sector and finance commission.As per the expectations of Chief Minister Dhami, senior IAS officers have started working in this direction. By preparing a plan for the development of remote villages by the officers, the villages will be developed in a planned manner.

This ensures legal clarity and enforceability of the divorce, the HC said.A division bench comprising justices Moushumi Bhattacharya and B R Madhusudhan Rao on Tuesday upheld a family court's Feb 2024 ruling in a case where a homemaker had obtained 'khula' from her husband, a businessman. The HC ruled that while 'khula' was indeed a recognised form of divorce under Muslim personal law, religious bodies such as a mufti or sharia council could not issue binding divorce certificates. Only courts, or a qazi officially appointed under the law, had the legal power to declare the end of a marriage, it said.The HC ruling comes close on the heels of a Supreme Court judgment in April this year, which reaffirmed that while a Muslim woman had the right to seek 'khula', it was ultimately the courts, specifically family courts, that had the authority to grant or validate the divorce. The apex court also clarified that while a wife could initiate the process of 'khula', the husband could challenge it in court.In the present case, the husband had challenged the 'khulanama' (divorce certificate) obtained by his wife, arguing that it was granted by a religious body, Sada-e-Haq Sharai Council, which he claimed had no legal authority. The family court, however, upheld divorce, noting proper legal procedures had been followed. The husband filed an appeal against the verdict, but the HC dismissed it.","'khula' is a form of divorce initiated by Muslim women under Islamic law.

NEW DELHI: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Defence Ministers' Meeting in China's Qingdao on Thursday, where he delivered a sharp message on terrorism , slamming Pakistan indirectly in the wake of April's Pahalgam terror attack ""Some countries use cross-border terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations,"" Singh said in a strong statement.Then directly referring to the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor launched by India in May, ""The pattern of Pahalgam terror attack matches with LeT's previous terror attacks in India. In exercising its right to defend against terrorism and pre-empt as well as deter further cross border terrorist attacks, India on 7th May 2025 successfully launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle cross border terrorist infrastructure.

SCO members must condemn this evil unequivocally,"" he added.""We reiterate the need to hold the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of reprehensible acts of terrorism, including cross-border terrorism, accountable and bring them to justice,"" he further stated.Referring to the broader geopolitical challenges, Singh called for greater unity among SCO members in facing threats to peace and stability. ""I believe that the biggest challenges that we are facing in our region are related to peace, security and trust-deficit. The root cause of these problems is increasing radicalisation, extremism and terrorism. Peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. Dealing with these challenges require decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" he said.Expressing gratitude for welcome at the SCO, Rajnath further said, ""The world we live in is undergoing a drastic transformation.

Family wakes up to surprise visitor in bedroom: A tiger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/family-wakes-up-to-surprise-visitor-in-bedroom-a-tiger/articleshow/122080630.cms,"RANCHI/SILLI/PURULIA/KOLKATA: ""Bhagwan Krishna ne aaj bacha liya (Lord Krishna has saved us today),"" said farmer Puran Chand Mahto (55) of Mardu village in Ranchi district's Silli block, still unable to believe his luck at being alive to tell the tale of how he and his family - his three daughters and a relative, who is a minor - slept peacefully while a tiger silently crouched in a corner of the same room.Around 4.30am Wednesday, Puran was getting ready for the day. As he stepped out of his three-room house into the courtyard, he asked his daughter, Savita, a Class IX student, to bring out the cattle for grazing. Moments later, her shrieks sent a chill down his spine.Savita had found a seven-foot-long tiger inside their room - which had only one door - and screamed: ""Baba, baag... (Father, tiger)!""""All hell broke loose as my two other daughters and the relative were still sleeping inside,"" Puran told TOI over the phone. His wife and son were away to attend a wedding in a nearby village in West Bengal.""Savita rushed inside briefly to wake up the others. I also went in and asked the girls to run to the other side of the room,"" Puran said.""Soon, the tiger jumped into another room through a window that had no grille and stood there. I then asked the girls to run out of the house. As soon as we escaped, we locked the iron door from outside and called for help,"" Puran added.The big cat may have sneaked into the house early in the morning when Puran had gone to the courtyard leaving the door open. Instances of leopards and other wild animals straying into houses had earlier been reported in Jharkhand, but it was the first time that a tiger had strayed into someone's house.The news sent district authorities into a tizzy, and the forest department rushed a team to control the situation. Senior forest officials arrived at the spot to oversee the operation. The house was covered with nets, and prohibitory orders were imposed to check any gathering at the site. A local police officer told TOI that they had roped in additional personnel to prevent any unwanted incident. ""There was a crowd of nearly 1,000 villagers. .. it was a big task for us to ensure their safety,"" the officer said.Around 4pm, a special team from Palamu Tiger Reserve reached the village, and aided by personnel from Ranchi forest division, managed to trap the tiger - a male aged about five years. The team placed a cage, fitted to a rescue van, in front of the door and lured the big cat out. ""Even before placing the bait, the tiger entered the cage and got trapped. It was then tranquillized so that it wouldn't get injured. We had to dart it twice. Around 6.45pm, we left for Ranchi's Bhagwan Birsa Zoo where the tiger will undergo tests,"" an official said.Jharkhand's chief wildlife warden Paritosh Upadhyay said, ""If the tiger is fit, we will release it in a nearby tiger reserve with a radio collar in consultation with the National Tiger Conservation Authority.""The village is located on the banks of the Subarnarekha river, about 60km from Ranchi city and barely 500m from Purulia in West Bengal. It is believed that the same tiger had passed through the stretch - from Palamu Tiger Reserve in Jharkhand to Purulia's Jhalda forest range - several times this year, beginning Jan.","Seven-foot-long tiger sneaked into a house in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India.

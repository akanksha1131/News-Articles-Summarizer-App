The United States on Sunday launched strikes on three key Iranian nuclear and military facilities, escalating the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.President Donald Trump called the operation “very successful,” confirming that the targets included Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, with Fordow identified as the main focus. Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency also acknowledged that all three sites were hit in the early hours.Early on Sunday, the United States conducted airstrikes on three of Iran’s most vital nuclear facilities, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, signaling the first direct U.S. involvement in Israel’s conflict with Tehran. The attack on Fordow, a deeply buried and heavily fortified site, reportedly included the deployment of six 30,000-pound “bunker buster” bombs, weapons that can only be delivered by the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 stealth bombers.

NEW DELHI: The next phase of central assistance (seed funding) for states to take up transformative projects under the Rs 1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) will focus more on revitalising core areas of cities and fixing legacy infrastructure gaps, such as bad drainage, sanitation and polluted water bodies.Officials said the focus of this funding will be on projects that have a transformative impact. Centre will provide such financial aids to 500-1,000 small cities as well to take up projects, they said.The housing and urban affairs ministry has finalised the UCF scheme and it is likely to be launched soon, sources said.TOI on Jan 13 had reported that PM Narendra Modi has directed ministry officials to focus more on creating facilities, amenities and better transportation network in those areas of cities which naturally attract people and businesses, rather than developing new cities.Following the PM's direction, more thrust is now on having a better framework for transit-oriented development (TOD) for cities to push intensive and planned growth along transportation networks, the sources said.Speaking at a CII-organised conference, additional secretary in the ministry, D Thara, said, ""In UCF, we are looking at revitalisation of cities and fixing of legacy infrastructure as a primary goal.We are not in a hurry to fund. We are clear that these projects should bring huge transformation and big impact. It can't be unfixing small things here and there. The project could be of any size but it has to be make a lot of difference to citizens. "" The focus is not about building afresh but about fixing what already exists, she added.Officials said under UCF, govt is also likely to provide seed fund for developing new greenfield areas, with good rail connectivity, as future cities.In her Budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the seting up of UCF to implement proposals for 'Cities as Growth Hubs', 'Creative Redevelopment of Cities' and 'Water and Sanitation'.","Officials said the focus of this funding will be on projects that have a transformative impact.

NEW DELHI: It has been a week since the tragic Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that claimed 274 lives. On Thursday, officials said that debris, including the aircraft’s damaged tail fin, still remains at the crash site as investigators continue to search for clues to determine the exact cause of the accident.The debris, including the tail fin, is still lying at the site. There are no orders yet to move the rubble elsewhere,” Ahmedabad's additional chief fire officer, Jayesh Khadia said.Inspector DB Basiya of Meghaninagar police station confirmed that the AAIB will decide the fate of the plane wreckage.“The police’s role is limited to securing the area. AAIB will determine what to do with the remains, which may later be moved to another location for further examination,” he said.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, is leading an investigation to understand the cause of one of the worst air disasters in recent times. AAIB officials have been making regular visits to the crash site as part of the ongoing probe.Local fire personnel are assisting forensic and aviation experts with site operations.On June 12, the London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, carrying 242 people, crashed into a hostel building of BJ Medical College in Meghaninagar just minutes after taking off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 1.39 pm.After the crash, the aircraft’s tail fin got stuck at the top of the damaged building and was brought down using cranes on June 14, two days after the incident.Days after the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was recovered, investigators also located the Cockpit Voice Recorder on June 16. Officials said this crucial discovery could help in understanding the cause of the crash.Officials confirmed the recovery of black boxes to PK Mishra, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who inspected the site on Sunday.While the AAIB has launched a detailed investigation, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting a parallel probe under international protocols, as the crashed aircraft was American-made, according to an official release.","It has been a week since the tragic Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that claimed 274 lives.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7.

A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.Also read: Iran strikes southern Israel; thick black smoke fills sky as missile hits high-rise apartment In the midst of this turmoil, US President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a large-scale overnight operation in Tehran, targeting “dozens of military industrial sites for missile production” and the Spand nuclear R&D headquarters. According to the IDF, over 60 fighter jets struck around 120 targets using “precise intelligence guidance.”“These sites were built over years and were the industrial centre of gravity of the Iranian Ministry of Defence,” the IDF said, adding that it also struck a key facility used for producing raw materials for rocket engines.The Spand headquarters, founded in 2011 by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was also hit. The IDF described it as central to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. During the same operation, four Iranian drones were intercepted.President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.” He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center. Katz said Israel’s military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Also read: Ayatollah Khamenei 'can no longer be allowed to exist,' warns Israel; seeks Iran Supreme Leader's accountability over hospital attack His statement was one of the most direct threats ever issued by an Israeli official against Iran’s top leader. While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime. Standing in front of the missilestruck Soroka hospital, he said, “Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt.”Also read: 'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran “This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancée as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”He continued: “It really reminds me of the British people during the blitz. We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: SC Probe Panel Report Says Misconduct Proved, Proposes Justice Varma’s Removal

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence. The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges.

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him. Thenext hearing is expected in September.",Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court.

Indian student's deportation sparks outrage

Over 1,000 Indians deported in recent months

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year. The recent crackdown in Los Angeles has also seen mass immigration sweeps, with Trump declaring, “They spit, we hit,” in a controversial order during unrest in the city.","The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right” The statement emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.

NEW DELHI: In a move to improve safety of two-wheeler riders, the road transport ministry has decided to make the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all new scooties, bikes and motorcycles manufactured after January next year irrespective of their engine capacity. The ministry will also soon make it mandatory for manufacturers and dealers to provide two BIS-certified helmets with two-wheelers at the time of sale.Officials said the decisions are important considering that two-wheeler occupants have nearly 44% share of all road deaths in the country and most of these are due to head injuries caused because of not wearing safety gear.The notifications for both these regulations will be out in the next few days.“At present, ABS is mandatory only in two-wheelers having engine capacity of over 125cc and so nearly 45% bikes and motorcycles don’t have this. With the new notification, this will be applicable for all new bikes and motorcycles. As almost all these vehicles can achieve 70 kmph, this feature becomes all the more important to reduce chances of crashes,” said a ministry official.ABS is a safety feature that prevents wheel lock-up during sudden braking, enhancing control and reducing stopping distances, especially on slippery roads. According to different studies and estimates, ABS can reduce road crashes by 35-45%.On the decision to provide two certified helmets at the time of sale, an official said this is aimed at inculcating a behaviour among bike riders to use safe helmets. Till now, it’s mandatory to provide one helmet.","Road transport ministry has decided to make the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all new scooties, bikes and motorcycles manufactured after January next year.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: In a significant policy shift, the Indian Railways has started issuing wait-listed tickets for a maximum of 25% of total berths/seats in each class - AC1, 2, and 3, Sleeper, and Chair Car - of a train after accounting for different quotas like for the differently abled. This is aimed at reducing the uncertainty passengers face with non-confirmed tickets, reports Dipak Dash & Manthan Mehta.Officials said the cap on issuing wait-listed tickets is being done considering that in most cases around 20%-25% of them get confirmed by the time the passenger chart is prepared. Following a circular issued by the Railway Board, zonal railways have started implementing it.The decision has been taken considering the uncertainty people face after booking tickets and also in view of that many with wait-listed tickets enter reserved coaches, crowding trains, officials said.Till now, the maximum limit for wait list ticket for AC1 was 30 berths, AC2 was 100, AC3 was 300 and Sleeper was 400, as per a Jan 2013 circular.""Different railway zones will decide capping of wait list tickets as per the booking and cancellation pattern of trains,"" a railway ministry official said. The current practice of a large number of wait-listed tickets created a mismatch between confirmed bookings and the number of passengers boarding trains, leading to chaos, a senior Western Railway official said.","Indian Railways has started issuing wait-listed tickets for a maximum of 25% of total berths/seats in each class.

NEW DELHI: India has kicked off the much-needed comprehensive review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (DAP) of 2020, with the aim to slash timelines in procurement of weapon systems and platforms as well as promote self-reliance in design, development and production with greater private sector participation.The defence ministry on Thursday said a committee headed by additional secretary and director general (acquisition) Dipti Mohil Chawla, which includes senior officers and representatives from the industry and academia, has already begun consultations with all stakeholders.Former health and I&B secretary Apurva Chandra, who had a stint as the DG (acquisition) in MoD, is the principal advisor to the committee. “The panel has invited suggestions from stakeholders on various fronts, including procedural changes to streamline the acquisition processes, by July 5,” an official said.The aim of the DAP review is to meet the operational requirements and modernisation of the armed forces “in a timely manner to ensure national security” and align acquisition procedures with govt policies to achieve “atmanirbharta” (self-reliance) by promoting technology infusion through indigenously designed and developed systems.“The ‘Make in India’ policy also needs to be enabled by promoting defence manufacturing in India through facilitation of JVs and transfer of technology for the private sector, encouraging foreign arms manufacturers via FDI alignment, and establishing a global defence manufacturing and MRO hub here,” he said.“The idea is also to promote design and development in both public and private sectors, with a focus on start-ups, innovators, and the private defence industry for indigenous technology infusion,” he added.At present, it often takes several years after a case gets the initial `acceptance of necessity’ (AoN), which is followed by the floating of the initial tender or the RFP (request for proposal), field trials, commercial evaluation and the like, before the final contract is anywhere close to being inked.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh recently said that the timelines for some of the processes in the procurement cycle have already been slashed, which would save around 69 weeks overall.“There is a need to shift away from the traditional nomination based cost-plus procurement focused mostly on the public sector to a more competitive pricing model where both the public and private sector can compete for orders. This approach is already being implemented for ship-building and recently for the AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft or the fifth-generation fighter) project,” he said.The MoD in the 2024-25 fiscal completely utilised the defence modernisation budget for the first time in the last five years. Moreover, contracts worth Rs 2 lakh crores were inked, which is the highest ever and double that of the figures in 2023-24, he added.The AMCA project, for one, certainly needs to be majorly fast-tracked after the defence ministry last month finally approved a new “programme execution model” for prototype development, with greater private sector participation. Pakistan is on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation jets from China, which is now even flaunting sixth-generation prototypes with tailless airframes like Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50, as reported by TOI earlier.The long meandering developmental history of the fourth-generation Tejas, which began way back in 1983, cannot be repeated. The IAF is still waiting to get the first Tejas Mark-1A `improved’ fighter. Similarly, indigenous development of 110 Kilonewton engines, with or without foreign collaboration, to power the AMCA is critical. The IAF is currently grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised.","India has kicked off the much-needed comprehensive review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (DAP) of 2020.

Government may slow down declaring more state highways as National Highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-may-slow-down-declaring-more-state-highways-as-national-highways/articleshow/121999997.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, the Centre is preparing a model to provide financial assistance to state govts for one-time improvement of state highways rather than declaring more of these as NHs. The road transport ministry will instead focus on building more new greenfield highways and expressways.This comes after PM Narendra Modi's direction to the ministry to come up with a model by July end for the purpose. State govts will maintain the upgraded state highways. TOI has learnt that in the last infrastructure review meeting, Modi had asked the ministry to come up with innovative models for supporting state highway projects and connecting non-major ports under state govts.This change in approach gains importance considering that in the last 11 years, govt has notified conversion of 55,000 km of state highways to NHs and now, the total length of NHs stands at 1.46 lakh km. This has been highlighted as one of the biggest achievements of govt.Sources said that after expanding the NH network, now there is a need to focus more on widening them and maintaining them. Data shows that till March, India has more than 63 lakh km of road network.","The road transport ministry will instead focus on building more new greenfield highways and expressways.

NEW DELHI: The upper castes availing the economic backwardness quota have trailed the backward classes in the Mains examinations of the Civil Services competition for the last two years. But the dynamic of competitiveness between the two reserved categories is complex, as the forwards have prevailed in the ultimate test by virtue of greater score in the 'interview' part of the competition.In the recent results for CS-2024, the cut-off for the Economically Weaker Sections category in the Civil Services (Main) exams was 696 marks as compared to 702 for the OBCs. But in the Final results after the interview, the EWS had a cut-off merit of 917 marks as against 910 for the OBCs. Under the EWS category, the non-SC/ST/OBC get 10% reservation on the basis of the poverty criteria.The cut-off marks are the minimum qualifying score for a social bloc availing the reservations, and they vary across the categories of SC, ST, OBC, and EWS. In the Mains part of the CS-2023, the OBCs scored a cut-off of 712 as compared to 706 for the EWS. But in the Final, the OBCs trailed with a cut-off of 919 to the EWS which had 923 as the minimum marks.The Mains-Interview contrast is seen as surprising. Shashank Ratnoo, a lawyer who specialises in reservation laws and issues, said, ""There is no starkly noticeable reason for OBCs to have more marks in the Mains than EWS, yet lose out in the final cut off on account of EWS scoring better interview marks. It possibly shows that the EWS group has no or lesser social disadvantages that hurt competitiveness.""Interestingly, the contrast in the merit for OBCs and EWS in the Civil Services Examinations has been a see-saw. In the wake of the fresh EWS quotas introduced in 2019, the OBCs dominated the Mains and the Final both in 2019 and 2020. While it was surprising that EWS, which has groups with lower social handicaps, trailed behind the OBCs, it was viewed as result of the fact that a new quota regime had just come into effect and the facts about its procedures and criteria had not percolated down to the wider eligible umbrella. Later, the EWS overhauled the gap with OBCs and came to score higher in the examinations.According to Ratnoo, what is surprising is that EWS has notched a quicker rise in merit than possibly any social sub-group has done after coming under the reservation system. ""It is interesting that the Centre (DoPT) recently ordered an inquiry into the income certificates of some EWS candidates who were selected in the civil services after the Final exams. Such closer scrutiny may help understand the issue better.

He noted that the extraordinary contribution of French writers opened new ways of thinking.""More than 100 years ago, in a transformative act of literary vision, Nalappat Narayana Menon translated Victor Hugo's Les Misérables into Malayalam as ‘Paavangal'. It was a cultural transplantation and the soil of Kerala received it not just out of curiosity but with gratitude and a bit of revolutionary fervour. Our famous communist leader, EMS Namboothiripad, said ‘Paavangal' was one of the sparks that led him to communism. Writers like Thagazhi and O V Vijayan have said that in the translated works of French writing, they found a new idiom of empathy, a new narrative possibility and a new lens through which to view the oppressed and the invisible.With ‘Paavangal', Malayalam found a weapon for awakening and that engagement partly contributed to the decades of remarkable visionary and social ferment in Kerala from the 1930s onwards,"" Tharoor said.He also mentioned that many other Malayalis started to translate works of French and Russian fiction and modernist works and that's how the doors to people like Guy de Maupassant, Victor Hugo and Émile Zola were opened to Malayali minds. ""That's how many Malayalis discovered the challenges of realism and introspection in a literature that mirrors society and questions it,"" he added.""The French, in many ways, have a cultural affinity to us, including in our great conversational habit. The habit of sitting around and discussing over coffee. The Bengali adda, the Malayali tea shop.

Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025

PUNE: The India Meteorological Department on Saturday issued a comprehensive rainfall warning of extremely heavy to very heavy rainfall (red and orange alerts) across several states over the next week. Heavy precipitation exceeding 200mm in 24 hours has been forecast for isolated areas in Madhya Pradesh on June 23, with Konkan, Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Gujarat expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall till June 27.According to the forecast, northwest India is set to experience significant rainfall from June 21-27. Heavy showers are expected in Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and east Rajasthan throughout the period. Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are likely to receive heavy rainfall from June 21-26, with intense precipitation likely in UP till June 24. Delhi can expect heavy rainfall on June 22-23.Specifically, very heavy rainfall warnings have been issued for east Rajasthan (June 21-23), south Haryana and Punjab (June 22), and UP (June 22-23).IMD has forecast further southwest monsoon advancement into the remaining parts of J&K, Ladakh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi over the next two days as conditions become increasingly favourable.""The monsoon is progressing towards northern states and is likely to advance to more parts, including Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, with some areas already covered. Delhi and other regions may be covered within the next two days through thunderstorms and monsoon activity,"" a senior IMD official told TOI.The weather department has also warned of the potential impact of heavy rainfall, including localised flooding, waterlogging and underpass closures in urban areas. Metropolitan cities may experience reduced visibility, traffic congestion and increased travel time because of waterlogged roads. Pune is expected to see increased rainfall activity from June 23, with light to moderate rain likely.On the specific weather systems driving this intense activity, the official said, ""There is a low-pressure area over the southwest Bihar region, which will move northwestward and gradually weaken by Sunday. But an associated cyclonic circulation is expected to move in a westward direction.""This system is expected to cause extremely heavy rainfall over Madhya Pradesh and adjoining regions on June 23, and heavy to very heavy rainfall activity at isolated places there till June 27.""Since this system is over land, areas under its influence are likely to experience significant impact.""The official said, ""Around June 25, a cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining regions.

NEW DELHI: The judges committee inquiring into the 'cash in kothi' case involving Justice Yashwant Varma spotted an ""unidentified person"" in a check shirt near the doused and half-burnt sacks of currency in the early hours of March 15 in one of the photos taken by first responders.This raises suspicion whether this man was responsible for removing the cash pile between 1am and 7am of said day in collaboration with Justice Varma's private secretary Rajinder Singh Karki and staffers Mohd Rahil, Babloo and Hanuman.The panel in its report said the photo ""shows a fireman standing at the entrance of the store with a torch and also making video, the debris as such at that point of time is stored at the back side of the store and there is also an unidentified man on the right side...""The committee comprising Punjab & Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman said at the time of the fire incident at the storeroom, Justice Varma's daughter, ailing mother (who was not questioned by the panel), Karki and the 'trusted' servants were present at the 30, Tughlaq Crescent bungalow.As per the panel, all of them attempted to give misleading statements despite unimpeachable evidence about the presence of huge amounts of illegal cash in the judge's residence and continued to make bald denials when confronted with forensic laboratory authenticated electronic evidence and videos.Justice Varma's daughter was examined as Witness-54 as she was the sole family member (apart from Justice Varma's mother) present at home during the fire incident.

When she was shown the video of the burnt cash in the storeroom, ""there was a lame explanation by her that the said room could be any other room at a different location"", the panel said.It said she even refused to identify the voice of Karki clearly audible in the video.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission officials on Saturday justified the recent amendment in Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, barring stakeholders other than itself from accessing poll-day webcasting feed from polling stations, unless an election petition was filed, saying that it was necessary to protect secrecy of voters and save them from possible intimidation.The poll-day CCTV footage or webcasting feed shall not be destroyed if an election petition (EP) is filed and shall be made available to the competent court when asked. However, where no EP is filed, such feed shall be disposed of in 45 days, it said. Slamming the move, LOP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi said EC's decision is another evidence that the ""match is fixed"" - a charge he has levelled about the Maharashtra contest.Poll-day CCTV feed shall be disposed of in 45 days, in sync with the 45-day time-bar for filing election petitions, Election Commission recently ordered in its revised instructions dated May 30, 2025. EC sources warned that sharing poll-day videography/webcasting with any person, candidate, NGO or third party, without the express consent of the electors, ran the risk of identification of electors who voted or did not vote, from the footage, and their possible harassment and intimidation by anti-social elements.The officials insisted that the CCTV/webcasting feed from polling stations was only meant as an internal management tool and not mandated by the law.""What is veiled as a very logical demand to share video or CCTV footage of webcasting done at polling stations on poll day, is actually entirely contrary to the privacy and security concerns of the voters, which is a legal requirement under Representation of the People Act, 1950/1951 and in line with directions of the Supreme Court,"" an officer underlined.""Election Commission of India is legally bound and committed to protect the privacy of the electors and secrecy of voting, so video footage from polling station cannot be given to any person, candidate or NGO or any third party without the express consent of the elector(s),"" the official said and added that the profiling of voters vs non-voters may become the basis for discrimination, denial of services, intimidation and inducement.","The poll-day CCTV footage or webcasting feed shall not be destroyed if an election petition (EP) is filed and shall be made available to the competent court when asked.

Farooq Abdullah warns of Supreme Court move if Jammu & Kashmir statehood not restored,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farooq-abdullah-warns-of-supreme-court-move-if-jammu-kashmir-statehood-not-restored/articleshow/121998312.cms,"National Conference's Farfooq Abdullah

SRINAGAR: National Conference president Farooq Abdullah blamed the ""dual power structure"" in the Union territory for the slow pace of development and warned that his party would move SC if statehood isn't restored soon. It is the first time NC has openly threatened legal action on restoration of statehood for Jammu & Kashmir.Abdullah said Saturday that people's expectations remain unmet due to the lack of full statehood despite formation of an elected govt in Oct 2024 - the first in J&K since 2018 and after region was carved into two UTs in 2019.""People hoped the new govt would address their demands, but the absence of statehood is a major obstacle,"" he said after a meeting with party delegates at Kokernag in south Kashmir's Anantnag district. ""How can we fulfil aspirations without statehood? Only with it can we have a full-fledged cabinet capable of addressing public issues effectively,"" he added.Abdullah said his party had launched an outreach campaign to make people aware of ""certain political forces ready to compromise their interests"". He added that after NC-led coalition's eight months in office, he remains hopeful about the return of statehood.""We have been waiting patiently. But if the delay continues, we will have little option but to approach Supreme Court.""The ""power struggle"" between National Conference-led elected govt and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha has grown increasingly public. This month, cabinet ministers accused Sinha of interfering in administrative decisions reserved for govt.Sinha had pushed back. ""I have no authority over development departments. Governance is elected govt's responsibility. I only control police & can deploy them where needed. Roads, water, electricity, agriculture - all are under elected govt,"" he said.Peoples Conference president Sajad Lone backed the demand for statehood but criticised NC's record in office. ""UT status certainly limits development and is a humiliating existence. But whatever powers exist, NC govt has not utilised them. Instead, they've weaponised govt transfers and discriminated against constituencies they didn't win,"" Lone said.He also questioned the concentration of power in CMO. ""CM has 32 depts. Is it humanly possible to run 32 departments?"" Lone asked.","National Conference president Farooq Abdullah blames the ""dual power structure"" in the Union territory for the slow pace of development.

Isro ex-chief-led panel to onboard HEIs in new regulatory setup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-ex-chief-led-panel-to-onboard-heis-in-new-regulatory-setup/articleshow/121998309.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a key development on the much-delayed Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), the Centre has constituted an empowered committee under the chairmanship of former Isro chief K Radhakrishnan to facilitate the onboarding of higher educational institutions (HEIs) under the proposed regulatory framework. The ministry of education notified the committee on Friday, tasking it with resolving implementation issues and harmonising existing protocols to ensure a smooth transition. The committee is expected to submit its report within three weeks.With 18 members, the committee includes directors of leading institutions such as IIT-Bombay, IIM-Ahmedabad, School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, and VCs of Delhi University, Utkal University and SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur. Also on board are chairpersons of existing statutory bodies like the UGC, AICTE and NCTE.HECI was proposed under the National Education Policy 2020 as an overarching body to replace UGC and consolidate higher education regulation. It aims to bring all institutions under a single umbrella for academic standards, accreditation, and funding, while maintaining autonomy for domain-specific decisions through subject councils.However, the legislation to establish HECI has faced delays since its draft in 2018, with various iterations seeking to address concerns.The panel's terms of reference include addressing 'specific difficulties of HEIs to be brought under HECI's purview so that appropriate clarifications may be issued,' and analysing 'regulatory protocols of different statutory bodies and recommending applicable protocols for HEIs to become multidisciplinary institutions.' It is also tasked with proposing ' mechanisms in view of HECI' for funding and technical support systems, and to 'suggest organisational structure of Standards Councils,' while ensuring that statutory bodies continue to lay down academic standards and coordinate between teaching and research.","The committee includes directors of leading institutions such as IIT-Bombay, IIM-Ahmedabad, School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi.

Bajirao, a five-year-old male tiger who gained notoriety for attacking villagers, was rescued from forests of Seoni district by Madhya Pradesh forest department staff and transferred to a secure facility Saturday, reports P Naveen.The tiger allegedly attacked and killed a tribal man, Sumit Pandare, 18, a resident of Bawanthadi village on Friday while he ventured into the forest for cattle grazing. The incident sparked protests by villagers who blocked NH-44 for several hours. A camera trap installed near the site confirmed Bajirao's presence.Forest officials confirmed this was the second incident involving Bajirao. Last Nov, another youth from Bawanthadi village was killed in a similar attack. Over the past month, forest staff reported several encounters in which the tiger charged at both villagers and patrolling personnel.","Bajirao, a five-year-old male tiger who gained notoriety for attacking villagers, was rescued from forests of Seoni district by Madhya Pradesh forest department staff.

One per 699: Probation-officer crunch leaves kids in conflict with law in the lurch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-per-699-probation-officer-crunch-leaves-kids-in-conflict-with-law-in-the-lurch/articleshow/121997952.cms,"One per 699: Probation-officer crunch leaves kids in conflict with law in the lurch

Rohit, a boy in conflict with the law, entered the observation home late one night. He remembers being left alone afterwards for over a month. ""I didn't even know if my parents knew I was here,"" he said. No one explained anything.

With no family visits or emotional support, Rohit's frustration built up. ""The lawyer was driving me crazy. I hadn't seen the sun in days."" Relief came only when hisprobation officer (PO) finally visited. ""They comforted me and told me to spend two hours a day gardening. It helped me calm down."" With their support and a positive report, Rohit moved to an aftercare hostel at 18. His parents never came, fearing arrest, but he stayed in touch with his officer online. ""They motivated me,"" said Rohit, now planning to become a teacher.

Suresh had a similar start. ""That night I cried,"" he recalled of his arrival at Dongri observation home. ""I didn't know where I was or what would happen. I wasn't sure whether to tell the truth or lie."" But the probation officer gradually gained his confidence and helped him sit for his exams.

Both boys were lucky but their stories are rare. ""These moments of care happen despite the system, not because of it,"" says Sachi Maniar, director of Ashiyana Foundation at Umerkhadi Observation and Children's Home in Dongri. ""Sometimes, there's no PO at all, and a superintendent steps in. The child meets caretakers, guards, house masters... everyone but the PO.""Earlier this month, a first-of-its-kind national consultation in Delhi - organised by the resource cell for juvenile justice (RCJJ) at TISS and department of social work, University of Delhi - put this overlooked link under the spotlight. Over two days, Juvenile Justice Board magistrates, POs, NGO workers, and social work faculty from 20 states gathered to discuss how to fix it.""This was the first time voices from across India came together to share what's really happening on the ground,"" said Asha Mukundan, who leads the RCJJ at TISS.What's happening, it turns out, is ""POs are working as social workers, counsellors, escorts, data managers all rolled into one,"" said Mukundan. ""And the case-to-officer ratio is outrageous. In some states, one officer is responsible for hundreds of children.""Most of them are expected to prepare reports, conduct home visits, maintain records, liaise with families, and coordinate rehabilitation, often with little or no support. Bharat Parashar, member secretary of the National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa), shared that the vacancy rate among correctional staff hovers around 45%. The Model Prison Manual recommends one correctional staff per 200 inmates. India currently operates at one per 699.The problem goes beyond numbers. In 2021, the govt introduced the legal-cum-probation officer (LCPO), a hybrid role under Mission Vatsalya, where one person is expected to serve as both legal aid provider and rehabilitation facilitator. In reality, it blurred lines and weakened impact. ""The role of a lawyer is to defend a client, no matter what,"" said Mukundan. ""A PO's job is to help the child understand what went wrong and work on it. If you try to be both, you risk doing justice to neither.""The overlap has also raised doubts about how much weight LCPOs carry in JJB decisions. Many admit they're barely trained to handle the job's social work demands, let alone trauma or aftercare.""Most get a three-day crash course,"" said Mukundan. ""It can't be handed to someone with an administrative background."" POs, she stressed, should hold a degree in social work. ""It's sensitive, child-facing work that needs skill and empathy.""Without trained POs, even basics like social investigation reports or care plans are skipped, forcing JJBs to issue generic orders or by default send children to custodial care. Since a bulk of children are out on bail, not in visible custody, the crisis is easy to miss. In many cases, probation orders aren't passed because there's no one to carry them out.Thus, unlike models abroad, children here are mostly left to fend for themselves. ""At most, they're told to report to a police station,"" said Maniar. In cities like Mumbai or smaller towns like Bilaspur, she's seen children cycle in and out of the system for petty offences up to ten times simply because too often, the PO's role is reduced to just securing bail. ""But rehabilitation isn't bail,"" she stresses. ""And reintegration isn't just about release but whether the child can actually survive outside. """"Without a PO checking in or a plan tailored to their situation, they reoffend or give up,"" said Mukundan.Over two days of the consultations in Delhi, the working groups have now offered practical calls to separate legal and social roles, hire more trained probation professionals, strengthen inter-state networks, and invest in follow-up beyond bail.The two schools leading the effort will send the report to the ministries of women and child development and home affairs. As Mukundan reminded the room, ""If we're serious about giving children a second chance, 'probation' has to be one of the first things we strengthen.""","India has one probation officer per 699 children.

All adults overweight in every 5th Indian household: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-adults-overweight-in-every-5th-indian-household-study/articleshow/121997926.cms,"Danny generated AI Image

A weighty issue

NEW DELHI: In nearly two out of 10 households, all adults are either overweight or obese, a new study has found.Overweight is defined as a body weight higher than what is considered healthy for a given height, commonly assessed using Body Mass Index (BMI). A person is considered overweight if his or her BMI is between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. On the other hand, obesity is defined as a BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater.Researchers from ICMR-National Institute for Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), TERI School of Advanced Studies and Symbiosis International analysed data from the fifth round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019-21) to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity in over 6 lakh households. They found nearly 20% of the households had all adult members classified as overweight while 10% of households had all adults classified as obese.In states such as Manipur, Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, over 30% of households had all adults overweight, according to the study, which was published in Public Health Journal. In Tamil Nadu and Punjab, two out of five households had all adults classified as obese.The proportion of households with all obese members was nearly twice as high in urban areas compared to rural regions.The study reveals that families are literally 'gaining weight together'. When one family member is overweight or obese, others are significantly more likely to be obese/overweight as well, said the lead researcher from ICMR-NICPR Prashant Kumar Singh. ""This clustering pattern underscores the urgent need for family-centred approaches to obesity prevention rather than individual-focused interventions.""Director ICMR-NICPR Shalini Singh, said, ""The household clustering of obesity and overweight represents a paradigm shift in how we understand obesity. This study tells us the family unit is the epicentre of this health challenge.""The study warned that individuals in these family obesity clusters face heightened risk of developing multiple non-communicable diseases. It is already known that obesity serves as a marker for poor cardio-metabolic health and is known to be a gateway to numerous chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and heart failure. It is also linked to 13 types of cancer.","In nearly two out of 10 households, all adults are either overweight or obese, a new study has found.

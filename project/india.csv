Yes – They drive accountability and productivity No – They increase pressure and reduce flexibility





BENGALURU: TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually, restricting their bench time to a maximum of 35 business days each year. The policy aims to foster a proactive approach towards associate allocation, ensuring both organisational and individual goals are met.""At any given point in time, associates must be allocated for a minimum period of 225 business days in the last 12 months,"" the document reviewed by TOI showed. ""Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,"" it said. The new policy, which came into effect on June 12, was laid out by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of The Resource Management Group (RMG).RMG at TCS oversees workforce deployment, ensuring the right talent with the right skills is assigned to projects. This team focuses on maximising organisational utilisation by making sure every associate is optimally engaged and allocated to projects at all times.""In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation,"" the policy said.All associates who are released to RMG, available for the next assignment, and reporting to RMG are unallocated resources.TCS provides opportunities through platforms like iEvolve, Fresco Play, VLS, and LinkedIn. While unallocated, associates are expected to spend 4-6 hours daily on relevant learning via iEvolve, complete all mandatory and prioritised training, attend in-person sessions as recommended by RMG, and actively upskill to stay interview-ready. They should also use the Gen AI interview coach, review and address feedback from past interviews, and complete all training programmes on time with full attendance.To facilitate swift deployment, TCS has called out that physical presence in the office is mandatory. As a result, WFO exceptions and flexible work arrangements are generally not applicable. ""However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.""TCS has stated that frequent short-term allocations to multiple projects are discouraged and may lead to HR investigations and appropriate disciplinary measures. An email sent to TCS on the policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to the press.","TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually.

Ahmedabad Plane Crash: Lucky seven who never boarded the ill-fated Air India Flight 171,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-plane-crash-gut-feeling-gridlock-a-moms-plea-how-fate-stopped-7-from-taking-ai-171/articleshow/121854778.cms,"Air India Crash Probe Focuses On Engine, Flaps And Gear As Boeing 787 Fleet Faces Safety Checks





AHMEDABAD: Sometimes, destiny doesn't announce its warnings aloud. It just intervenes through mundane ways: a mother's emotional plea, traffic that refuses to clear or just a gut feeling that something isn't quite right.For seven passengers meant to board Air India Flight 171 on June 12, these subtle interventions became the difference between life and death.Yaman Vyas had his return journey to London all planned. The warehouse worker, who holds a UK work permit, was wrapping up a visit to his family in Vadodara after two years abroad. His bags were packed, documents ready and he was not expecting to return to India for at least another year.But as he prepared to seek his parents' blessings before departure, his mother was overcome with emotion. The thought of another lengthy separation seemed unbearable. ""Thhoda divas rokai jaa ne, beta (Just stay back for a few more days, son),"" she pleaded, her voice heavy with affection.His father supported her request. Overwhelmed by his mother's plea, he simply cancelled his flight, no questions asked. ""Later that afternoon, when messages about the crash started flooding my mobile, I realised how my mother's instinct had saved my life.""For Jaimin Patel, 29, and Priya Patel, 25, from Chandlodia in Ahmedabad, the journey to London was meant to be a happy reunion. Their friend Rohit Yadav had invited them for holidays, and they arrived at the airport with visitor visas, all excited about the trip.At the check-in counter, however, their plans hit a hurdle. The Air India staff informed them that queries had been raised regarding their documentation, which required resolution before boarding passes could be issued.Jaimin and Priya Patel told the staff that it was impossible to resolve the matter at such short notice and begged to be allowed on the flight. But the staff remained firm, saying they cannot violate the protocol.After waiting at the airport for an hour in mounting frustration, Jaimin and Priya returned home disappointed. ""About an hour later, one of my friends called and just said, ‘Switch on the TV right now!' When I saw the news, I was shocked,"" Jaimin said. ""The flight had crashed. I have never been so grateful to God. I thank the Air India staff for putting their foot down and not letting us board the plane.""Sometimes the heart knows what the mind cannot comprehend. That is exactly what Savji Timbadia, a Nikol resident, experienced. Everything had been arranged for his trip to London, where his son lives and works. He had seat 1-A reserved on AI 171. But early on Thursday morning, Timbadia made an unexpected call to his son, which puzzled both.""I told my son I did not feel like flying and would postpone my departure until Monday. When he asked about the sudden change of plan, I could only describe a feeling of mental unease. It was not something I could explain.""That afternoon, a friend sent him a message asking him to watch the news on TV. ""I got the answer to what made me feel uneasy,"" he said. ""Lord Swaminarayan saved my life.""Another passenger, who had a similarly lucky escape, was Bhoomi Chauhan. She had every reason to curse Ahmedabad's notorious traffic congestion enroute to the airport. The Bharuch native was to return to her husband in London after her vacation. Taking detours and navigating through traffic jams, when she reached the airport at 12.20pm, she was told that the boarding gates had closed at 12.10pm.""I pleaded with the staff to let me board the flight, but to no avail,"" she said. Angry and disappointed, she was returning to Bharuch when she learned about the crash. ""I was shocked and also grateful to the divine for saving me,"" she said. ""I was leaving my son in India. This was nothing but Ganpati Bappa's miracle.""Jayesh Thakkar from Vadodara has business obligations to thank for saving his life. The organizer of one of the biggest garba events in Vadodara, Thakkar was scheduled to be on that ill-fated flight but got delayed in Kolkata due to work.""I was delayed in Kolkata due to work and realized I would not make it to Ahmedabad in time for the flight. That is when I decided to change my itinerary,"" Thakkar said.Similarly, Ravji Patel decided against flying that day with his son-in-law Arjun Patoliya as he had work to be completed. Arjun was going back to his daughters in London after the post-death rituals of his wife, Bharti, whom he lost to cancer in May.""He insisted that I go with him and meet my granddaughters, aged 8 and 4. But I had some work to do and told him that I will fly down after a fortnight. He agreed to book the tickets for me,"" Ravji Patel said, still reeling under the shock of losing two loved ones in 20 days.","Yaman Vyas had his return journey to London all planned.

GANDHINAGAR: A plume of smoke rose above BJ Medical College on the sunny afternoon of June 12. Flames licked the crumpled fuselage of a jumbo jet. Screams pierced the air. Raju Patel, 56, didn't stop to think. When the sky fell, he stood up.Just minutes away, the construction businessman raced to the AI 171 crash site with his crew, arriving within five minutes of impact. ""For the first 15 to 20 minutes, we could barely get close. The fire was too intense,"" Patel said. ""But once the first fire brigade and 108 ambulances arrived, we jumped in to help.""With no stretchers in sight, they used sarees and bedsheets to carry the injured. ""We did what we could,"" he said. Authorities allowed Patel's team to stay on-site until 9 pm.As emergency services took control, Patel's team turned to what came next - combing the wreckage. Burned luggage lay scattered across the charred grounds. From the debris, they retrieved 70 tolas (over 800 grams) of gold jewellery, Rs 80,000 in cash, passports, and a Bhagawad Gita. All were handed over to the police.Minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi said Sunday that all salvaged personal belongings are being documented and will be returned to the next of kin.""I'm just grateful we could do something,"" said Patel, whose volunteering history includes the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts. ""I was just 100m from the civil hospital when a bomb went off. But the destruction here... the flames...

NEW DELHI: PM Modi strongly raised the issue of terrorism in his G7 outreach session address, describing the Pahalgam attack as an assault on all humanity and slamming double standards in the fight against terror. Without naming Pakistan, he said India's neighbourhood had become a breeding ground for terrorism.Modi raised several questions about the international approach to terrorism, saying that while sanctions were being imposed based on personal preferences, nations that openly supported terrorism continued to be rewarded.""Are we truly serious about addressing terrorism? Will we understand the true meaning of terrorism only when it knocks on our own doors? Can those who spread terror and those who suffer from it be weighed on the same scale? Are our global institutions at risk of losing their credibility?"" he asked, while also talking about the impact of ongoing conflicts on the Global South.The PM said turning a blind eye towards terrorism for the sake of vested interests, or extending support to terror or terrorists, was a betrayal of all humanity.If we don't take decisive action today against this terrorism that stands against humanity, history will never forgive us,"" the PM said.Modi also said the terrorist attack that took place on April 22 was not just an assault on Pahalgam but a direct attack on the soul, identity and dignity of every Indian.It was an assault on all humanity, he said.""Terrorism is the enemy of humanity. It stands in opposition to all nations that uphold democratic values. Unity in fight against terrorism is imperative. Unfortunately, our own neighbourhood has become a breeding ground for terrorism. For the sake of global peace, our thinking and our policies must be extremely clear - any country that supports terrorism must be held accountable and made to pay the price,"" the PM said.Modi also said the countries of the Global South were having to bear the maximum impact of uncertainty and conflicts. No matter where the tension was in the world, he said, these countries were the first to be affected by food, fuel, fertiliser and financial crises.""India considers it its responsibility to bring the priorities and concerns of the Global South to the world stage.

Nilambur bypoll is Congress’s semi-final in Kerala



Kaliganj heats up amid riot shadow



Ludhiana West Bypoll a Crucial Test for AAP, Congress, SAD and BJP



Gujarat gears up for bypolls in Visavadar and Kadi



NEW DELHI: Interest around assembly byelections is mostly limited to the states, more so, if the contest does not involve heavyweights. However, the assembly bypolls today for 5 seats spread across four states will be keenly watched when the results are out on June 23 - as this will be the first electoral contest post Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor - India's military response that included air and ground strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Today's bypolls include two assembly seats in Gujarat, one each in Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab. The fact that assembly elections are due in two of these states - Kerala and West Bengal early next year - makes this mini electoral contest all the more interesting.Congress, which has huge stakes in Kerala, has already announced that the Nilambur by-election is the semi-final before the 2026 assembly polls. Kerala LoP and Congress MLA VD Satheesan has claimed that victory in the bypoll will mark the beginning of the United Democratic Front's (UDF) return to the state.""This is a political contest, a direct fight between the UDF and the LDF. It is the semi-final leading up to the 2026 Assembly elections, and we are confident of winning by a significant margin. We see this as an opportunity to hold the Pinarayi government accountable, a government that has been in power for the past nine years,"" Satheesan said.Congress got a boost with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joining the campaign to secure a win for the party.Congress, which has lost two consecutive elections in the state to the Left Democratic Front, will be keen to settle scores and return to power. However, given party's choppy relations with Shashi Tharoor, who is MP from Thiruvananthpuram, and a resurgent BJP going all out to spread its influence in the state, the road to power will not be easy for the grand old party.Moving over to West Bengal - another state where assembly elections are due early next year, the Kaliganj assembly bypoll in the state's Nadia district is shaping up to be a triangular contest among the TMC, BJP, and Congress-Left alliance.The electoral discourse here in the run up to the bypoll has been dominated by identity politics, post-Murshidabad riot anxieties and a nationalist surge after Operation Sindoor.The bypoll is also being closely watched due to the recent Murshidabad riots in which three persons were killed and several people rendered homeless, discontent over the SSC recruitment scam, and the changing electoral arithmetic since the 2024 general elections.In Kaliganj, identity and legacy remain central to the electoral battle. While the TMC has accused the BJP of communal polarisation, the Murshidabad riots and sporadic communal skirmishes in parts of the state have only added fuel to the saffron party's campaign in its bid to break the Trinamool Congress stronghold on this minority-dominated seat.The Ludhiana West by-election, set to take place on Thursday, is shaping up to be a high-stakes political showdown that could redefine the urban political narrative in Punjab. While the seat itself is just one among many, the implications of this bypoll stretch far beyond its borders.For the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the contest is a crucial opportunity to reaffirm its dominance in Punjab following the death of its sitting MLA, Gurpreet Bassi Gogi, in January. Retaining the seat would help AAP maintain its urban clout and narrative of continuity.Facing off against AAP is the Congress, looking to claw back a constituency it once firmly held—six times in the past. A win here would signal a revival of urban support for the party, which has struggled to reclaim lost ground in the state since AAP’s rise.However, the contest isn’t only a two-way battle. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also keenly watching the outcome to assess its urban appeal in Punjab, a state where it remains on the fringes post its breakup with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).For the SAD, the stakes are equally high. The bypoll is being viewed as a test of leadership for party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose party is still trying to bounce back from a string of electoral defeats. A respectable showing here could breathe some life into the party’s flagging morale.By-elections in Gujarat’s Visavadar and Kadi assembly constituencies will be held on Thursday, with the BJP, Congress, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) locked in a three-cornered battle in both seats. Voting will take place from 7 am to 8 pm, and results will be declared on June 23, according to election officials.The Visavadar seat in Junagadh, vacant since former AAP MLA Bhupendra Bhayani defected to the BJP in December 2023, has attracted high-profile candidates. The BJP has fielded Kirit Patel, Congress has nominated Nitin Ranpariya, while AAP has placed its former Gujarat president Gopal Italia, in the contest.In Kadi (Mehsana district), a seat reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates and lying vacant since BJP MLA Karsan Solanki’s death in February, the ruling party has fielded Rajendra Chavda. Congress has turned to Ramesh Chavda, a former MLA who won the seat in 2012, while AAP is banking on Jagdish Chavda.Polling will take place through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) at 294 stations in each constituency. Gujarat government has also declared a public holiday in both constituencies on polling day to encourage voter participation.","Today's bypolls include two assembly seats in Gujarat, one each in Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Kapil Sibal on Tuesday called Justice Yashwant Varma ""one of the finest judges"" and criticised the central government for initiating impeachment proceedings against Varma, in whose storeroom a huge amount of cash was found.Saibal alleged that the government's ""real motive"" behind the action against Varma is to ""dismantle"" the Collegium system and ""gain control over judicial appointments"".He also accused the government of selectively pursuing the case against Varma while ignoring similar proceedings against Justice Shekhar Yadav, who faces an impeachment notice from Opposition MPs over allegedly ""communal"" remarks made last year.""I can say with the utmost of responsibility that he (Varma) is one of the finest judges that I have argued before. You ask any lawyer in the High Court or the Supreme Court, and there is not a whiff of any wrongdoing by this judge. You ask any lawyer in Allahabad (Prayagraj)...judges know their lawyers...lawyers also know the judges,"" Sibal was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He furher said: ""It is shocking that you (the government) are targeting a judge against whom there is no evidence and you are protecting a judge against whom there is no evidence required because his statement is in the public domain and there is an impeachment motion pending before the Chairman and he has been sitting on it for verification of signatures.""Rijiju is reportedly planning to introduce a motion on the first day of the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament to make the Supreme Court's in-house inquiry report on Justice Varma public.""For what? Why are you protecting Shekhar Yadav?"" Sibal questioned.The senior advocate alleged that the opposition is failing to recognise the broader agenda to strip the Collegium of its authority and reinstate the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).""This is the whole purpose of this exercise,"" Sibal claimed.Criticising the government’s handling of the matter, Sibal said a decision was taken against a sitting high court judge without following due process.""The judge was not even heard. This is absolutely shocking...Unfortunately, the political class is brought into the act,"" he remarked.The controversy surfaced after a fire incident at Justice Varma's residence in Delhi in March, during his tenure at the Delhi high court. The blaze reportedly led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of cash in an outhouse on the property.However, contrary to Sibal's claims, a three-judge inquiry panel's damning report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna confirmed that a huge amount of cash was found in a storeroom at Justice Yashwant Varma's Tughlaq Crescent residence on March 14.The report repudiated Justice Varma's repeated statements claiming innocence about the discovery of money from a room within his official residence.","Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal called Justice Yashwant Varma ""one of the finest judges"" Sibal criticised the central government for initiating impeachment proceedings against Varma. Saibal alleged that the government's ""real motive"" behind the action was to ""dismantle"" the Collegium system and gain control over judicial appointments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121911401,imgsize-33582,width-400,resizemode-4/121911401.jpg"

Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community! I love both my sister @JeanieBuss and my business partner Mark Walter,” Johnson shared in another post.The sale, which still requires formal league approval, is expected to close within months. For Johnson, the emotion was palpable when he spoke directly to Jeanie.“I just talked to my sister Jeanie Buss to tell her congratulations, and that I’m so happy for her and family. I told her that her dad Dr. Buss would be very proud of her for getting $10B for the Lakers, the largest sports franchise sale in history!” he wrote.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers $10 Billion Sale Shatters Sports Franchise Records; Buss Family Makes NBA History The Lakers, with 17 NBA championships and a global fanbase, are entering a new era.

Jonathan Toews is expected to decide soon as negotiations begin.



Jonathan Toews is inching closer to a highly anticipated NHL comeback. Once eyed by four teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning, he has reportedly cut his list in half. Now, all eyes are on two Western Conference teams, the Winnipeg Jets and Colorado Avalanche, as Toews prepares to negotiate a deal.Toews returning to his hometown is more than just a feel-good narrative; it’s now a serious possibility. For Winnipeg, bringing in Toews would not only boost leadership and experience but also serve as a powerful symbol for the franchise. With the team looking to re-establish itself as a strong postseason contender, Toews could be the missing piece that stabilizes the locker room and adds playoff grit.While the Jets offer sentiment and hometown appeal, the Colorado Avalanche bring title ambitions. Despite earlier assumptions that the Avalanche had moved on after acquiring Brock Nelson, Dreger clarified that his Colorado sources insisted they remain very, very interested in Toews. The front office views him as a cultural fit who can strengthen their leadership group.The Avalanche are still hunting another deep playoff run, and a healthy Toews could add the veteran savvy they lacked last season.With uncertainty around their bottom six and leadership depth, Toews’ return could round out their roster.Toews’ comeback story has moved from speculation to strategy.

Why Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner needs a clean NHL break



A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner

The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey. Mitch Marner wants control over his next chapter, and that next chapter seems destined to begin far from Toronto, in the quieter lanes of the NHL’s Western frontier. Don’t be surprised if talks stretch deep into the summer. Marner’s $10.9 million cap hit means any deal will require strategic balancing from both sides.In the meantime, fan opinion remains divided. Some still believe Marner deserves more time, while others see his exit as a necessary evolution for the franchise. Mitch Marner’s future with the Maple Leafs seems increasingly uncertain as trade rumors intensify. A move to the Western Conference could offer the reset he’s reportedly seeking. With emotional fatigue setting in and pressure mounting, Marner’s next chapter may unfold far from Toronto’s spotlight.Mitch Marner’s future with the Toronto Maple Leafs is shrouded in uncertainty, as teammates believe a Western Conference move is likely. Tired of constant scrutiny and emotional weight, Marner is reportedly seeking a full reset away from Toronto’s spotlight.

Brad Marchand’s misspelled tattoo goes viral again

In the world of hockey, few celebrations are as wild or as talked about as Brad Marchand’s after the 2011 Stanley Cup win. The Boston Bruins forward did not hold back. But what’s making noise again in 2025 isn’t just the party—it’s what came with it. From a massive bar bill to a tattoo gone wrong, Marchand’s choices continue to spark laughs and surprise across social media.Brad Marchand and the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup on June 15, 2011, after beating the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7. To celebrate, they went to the Las Vegas Strip. At XS Nightclub in the MGM Grand, they partied all night. A bill from that night showed they spent $156,679.74. Most of the money went on very expensive champagne bottles and luxury drinks.Recently, in June 2025, the photos of the bill circulated social media again, causing a stir. People were surprised at how much was spent in a single night. Many hockey fans on reddit joked about how one party night could equal a year’s salary for others.Some even called it “the most expensive hangover in NHL history.” Bruins fans shared mixed reactions, with many still proud of that victory, while others found the spending “over the top.”Along with the wild party, Brad Marchand also got a tattoo to remember the win, but it had a mistake. The tattoo was meant to say “Stanley Cup Champions.” Instead, it read “Stanley Cup Champians.” The spelling error went viral in 2011 and has now returned to the spotlight in 2025 as fans post old photos again.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Brad Marchand's Departure Sparks Emotional Storm As Boston Bruins Fan Makes Shocking Weather Discovery Social media users shared the image widely, and it started trending after a new sports meme account posted it with the caption, “Still the most Boston thing ever.” Bruins fans have joked about it, but some admit the error still stings. One fan wrote, “We waited 39 years for the Cup and got ‘Champians’ forever.”Even Marchand himself once joked about it during an interview in 2016, saying, “I didn’t even notice it for days.” He has never gotten the tattoo fixed, which only adds to its fame.","Brad Marchand and the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup on June 15, 2011.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver

The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town. If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers.That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns.

Khamenei's post came following escalating threats from US President Donald Trump, who had just hours before called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.""Moments later, Khamenei posted on X: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.Khamenei’s posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle. In Farsi, he posted “the battle begins”, alongside an image of a man with a sword entering a castle gate, alluding to the historic battle of Khaybar, as per the Times of Israel.In a series of posts on his platform Truth Social Trump had claimed the United States had full control of Iranian airspace and warned that the country’s top leader was within reach. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump had wrote.“But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He later followed up with a post calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”Iran fired the latest barrage of missiles around 12.40 am which triggered sirens across of Israel and included around 15 projectiles. A second wave of about 10 rockets followed roughly 40 minutes later, prompting alerts in central parts of the country and the West Bank. Although there were no reported casualties, a fire broke out in a central Israeli parking lot, damaging several cars.Warning sirens were also activated around the Dead Sea due to what officials described as a suspected drone infiltration.Read: How Iran’s Supreme Commander Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost his top commanders Meanwhile, Israel continued its offensive inside Iranian territory. Early Wednesday morning, the Israel defense forces (IDF) called for residents of Tehran’s District 18 to evacuate, citing upcoming military action targeting strategic infrastructure. Soon after, Israeli forces confirmed a new wave of airstrikes in Tehran. Reports also emerged of explosions in the city of Karaj, previously the site of a nuclear centrifuge facility targeted by Israeli strikes.Israel launched its military campaign six days ago, calling the assault necessary to dismantle what it described as an “existential threat” posed by Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. According to Israeli officials, the ongoing operation aims to eliminate top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, missile launch sites and uranium enrichment centres.The conflict has already caused significant casualties. Iranian authorities report at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israel says over 370 missiles and hundreds of drones have been launched by Iran. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel and more than 500 wounded.Also read: Donald Trump may consider joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites; report claims growing US involvement","Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.

Durant shared a heartfelt post on Instagram, even as his future looks uncertain, he pointed out how important players like Bryant have been in his career and how he will continue the legacy they have created in basketball.Kevin Durant is in the middle of several trade rumors surrounding his next big step in the NBA. However, the star player paused for a moment, to think about his idol, Kobe Bryant. He shared a throwback photo from his rookie days with Bryant, where he wrote, “Always hackin man…wish you were here been.”The post was nostalgic and emotional, coming from a friend, who has been uncertain about his career trajectory in the middle of various trade rumors, but being able to pause and think about one of his closest teammates is preciousOnce in 2015, Durant called Kobe their Michael Jordan. He had said, “I idolized Kobe…he was our Michael Jordan.”NBA legend Kevin Durant has been amidst the ongoing trade rumors that have been leading all headlines.Speculations have been growing pretty much every day, with Phoenix Sun’s demands and expectations.As per ESPN reporter Tim Bontemps, Kevin Durant trade is not expected to involve as many picks as the Grizzlies received for Desmond Bane.

Israel-Iran war: Donald Trump may consider joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites; report claims growing US involvement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-war-donald-trump-may-consider-joining-israel-in-striking-nuclear-sites-report-claims-growing-us-involvement/articleshow/121918496.cms,"



US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early Tuesday, Trump made his stance clear. “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he said, adding that his goal is a permanent solution: “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire.”Later, on Truth Social, Trump doubled down, calling for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and stating that the US knows “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”US defence officials had made arrangements anticipating Trump's potential directive for the US Air Force to support Israeli fighter aircraft with refuelling during their operations over Iran, two sources told CNN.These sources indicated that this consideration partly explains why more than 30 aerial refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region in recent days.Refueling Israeli jets midair would be one of the least aggressive forms of support.Still, CENTCOM has presented Trump with the possibility of joint US-Israel strikes on nuclear facilities.Vice President JD Vance echoed the urgency, posting on X that Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”Trump met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday. Israeli officials, who have been urging US involvement, expressed optimism but said no formal decision from the US had been conveyed yet.While Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing, his recent statements — including “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran” — suggest a shift.“Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’ Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he wrote on Truth Social.After Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, it claimed Iran was rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons.However, a US intelligence report earlier this year said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear bomb, though mounting pressure may be pushing the regime to restart its nuclear program.The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium in recent months. Iran continues to insist its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.While President Trump has not confirmed direct US involvement, his recent posts on Truth Social have stirred speculation. Trump’s increasingly aggressive tone and use of the term “we” in reference to military actions have raised questions about the extent of American involvement.And one of the key targets being considered is Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a heavily fortified uranium enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain. According to Brett McGurk, a former US official who served under four presidents, “Fordo is the crux of this thing.” Destroying it would deal a major blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but only the US has the firepower to make that happen.Military experts agree that multiple precision strikes by American B-2 bombers would be needed in a carefully coordinated mission. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon has rehearsed this scenario, which involves dropping a series of bombs ""down the same hole"" to penetrate Fordo's deep underground structure.Fordo is located nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by heavy air defenses. It is widely believed to be Iran’s most likely site for developing nuclear weapons, as it is where Iran has enriched uranium and expanded its stockpile.","US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.

What is the controversial “ring culture” comment by LeBron James?

If you’re an NBA fan, then two legends — LeBron James and Michael Jordan are who you should be well versed with. They have been pretty excellent at creating history. But, what could possibly be admiration, may soon turn into a rivalry — only to answer one question — who is the bigger GOAT in the NBA — Is it LeBron James or Michael Jordan?Having debates over “ring culture” could be seen as an uplifting move for fans, and other NBA players, but for one of the best NBA stars, LeBron James, it is pretty frustrating, as he feels, he doesn’t understand why. LeBron James said, he doesn’t understand why ‘ring culture’ is always brought up when it comes to him. He feels such conversations always end up being taken in a different context rather that how much effort an individual player is putting in their game. LeBron insists that ""winning a title is a collective effort.“Are you seriously telling me that these guys weren't incredible just because they didn't win?"" That they're left out of conversations about other greats? It's bizarre,"" he said.Craig Carton, who hosts Breakfast Ball, feels LeBron James has been talking about NBA legend Michael Jordan, indirectly, as he brings up “championship rings” in debates. During the podcast, Carton said, ""He makes it so easy for me, He's an insufferable narcissist. Great player. For my money, a top-10 player of all-time, for sure. You can debate where you want to put him. He's not No. 1. But it's so clear to me — I can't prove this, it's just my take on it — of how Michael Jordan lives rent-free in his head.Michael Jordan has been able to secure at least six championships in his entire career. Meanwhile, LeBron James secured four championships. Carton believes, when LeBron brings up “championship rings” stating they don’t matter, is due to the particular context.In an interview with the Today Show's Willie Geist, LeBron was confident enough to pick himself out of the two. LeBron said ""Oh, I take myself. I will take myself for sure. I'm going to take myself versus anybody, They're going to have to have a few wheelchairs and a couple of ambulances there to get us off the floor.""During a promotional event in Hong Kong, NBA legend, Shaquille O'Neal was asked regarding the same LeBron and Jordan debate, he said via ESPN, ""It would be an interesting game, Young LeBron was more like Magic Johnson. He was sort of like Magic with Jordan's abilities. He liked to pass, and he liked to get it up. But Mike was Mike. He was just special—like no one else. He always did things no one else could do and things you couldn't compare to anyone else. So, he was special, and he'd win.""Also Read: “A ring is a team accomplishment”- LeBron James goes down memory lane with the ring culture in NBA on Mind the Game","NBA legend, Craig Carton criticizes LeBron James' 'ring culture' comment.

Canada's British Columbia premier David Eby said that he will request Prime Minister Mark Carney to declare the Lawrence Bishnoi gang a ""terrorist organisation"" in the country, adding that it had been linked to many crimes.On Tuesday, the premier said he will write to Carney about it ""to enable police to be able to use the necessary tools to investigate.""He alleged that the gang had been linked to extortion and other crimes against South Asian community members in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.Canada's police had earlier reported that South Asian community members are being extorted under threat of violence or death. Adding that Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been linked to some of those threats.""This is a serious step,"" Eby said. ""We don't make this recommendation lightly, but this activity strikes at public confidence in the justice system, in our democracy.""As Eby stressed his demand, Balpreet Singh from World Sikh Organisation said he supports his request.""Extortions are at an all-time high here in Canada. That members of the Sikh community and now others as well are being extorted for money, and their houses are being shot up, and there are threats against their lives,"" said Singh.Meanwhile, Elenore Sturko, B C Opposition public safety critic, opposed Eby's demand, saying that other issues need addressing.Sturko asserted that she is unaware that police ""definitively"" linked Bishnoi gang to extortion cases, further questioning the timing of Eby's comment.""The police haven't come out and told my community that this gang is responsible for these incidents,"" she said. ""This is a very dramatic and headline-grabbing thing that the premier's done today, but I hope it doesn't distract from the fact that there are other issues at play here that need addressing,"" she added.This comes amid PM Modi's visit to Canada after a period of friction between New Delhi and Ottawa. The tension between the two countries escalated after Canada alleged that Indian agents were involved in the killing of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside a gurdwara in Canada in 2023.Earlier on Tuesday, PM Modi arrived at the Pomeroy Kananaskis Mountain Lodge in Canada, where he received a warm welcome from Canadian PM Mark Carney.He later held a bilateral meeting with Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada. ""India and Canada relations are very important in many ways. Many Canadian companies have investments in India. The people of India also have a huge investment in Canadian soil. Dedicated to democratic values, Canada and India will have to strengthen democracy together, and will have to strengthen humanity,"" Prime Minister Modi said.PM Modi also congratulated Carney on his recent election victory.""This is the first time I have had the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister after his election, so I congratulate him for his grand victory in this election and in the coming period, India and Canada will progress together in many areas with him,"" he added.""It's a great honour to host you at the G7.

Connor McDavid, the Edmonton Oilers’ captain, appeared heartbroken after his team lost to the Florida Panthers in the NHL Stanley Cup Finals last night, for the second time in a row.

Evander Kane did not show up for the traditional handshake after losing Game 6 to the Panthers



Fans instantly called him out, with many calling it “classless” and “disrespectful”



“I get it, emotions are high,but hell definitely regret that if not already. Ita the single greatest tradition in playoff hockey and what separates the NHL from other sports”

When the Oilers watched the Panthers celebrate their first-ever Stanley Cup win, the pain was real. But as hockey tradition goes, you line up, shake hands, and show respect, win or lose. Except one name was missing. Evander Kane never showed up for the post-game handshake line after Edmonton’s crushing 5–1 Game 6 loss and fans instantly noticed. Cue the backlash.It’s one of the most sacred things in hockey: no matter how heated the battle, players meet at center ice after a playoff series to shake hands. But after Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final, as Florida players lined up to shake hands with the defeated Oilers, Evander Kane was nowhere to be seen.Kane was handed a 10-minute misconduct late in the third period after slashing Matthew Tkachuk. By the time the game ended and handshakes began, Kane had already left the bench and did not return.The moment didn’t go unnoticed. Viewers on social media lit up the timeline, accusing Kane of being a “sore loser” and showing “zero sportsmanship.”One comment read: “Lifetime regret added on top of never winning the cup.”Another X (Twitter) user wrote:Criticism came fast, especially since the post-game handshake is considered one of the most respectful rituals in pro sports. And with this being the Stanley Cup Final, emotions were at an all-time high.Not everyone was ready to drag Kane for it. A few fans online pointed out that a 10-minute misconduct means a player technically isn’t allowed to come back on the ice, even after the game ends.Still, others argued he could have found a way to show respect whether it was on the ice, or even a public acknowledgement after.Kane isn’t exactly a neutral figure in the hockey world. His past controversies including past suspensions and off-ice drama make moments like this one feel even more intense. For many fans, this felt like just another example of Evander Kane doing Evander Kane things.Also read - Trade watch: Penguins could trade $30M winger Bryan Rust after career season, per insider","Evander Kane did not show up for the traditional handshake after losing Game 6 to the Panthers.

Police say Shedeur Sanders was clocked at 101 mph near Strongsville, Ohio



The rookie QB now has two options: fight it in court or pay up



Fans react as Sanders' “fast start” takes on a whole new meaning



Just months after being drafted by the Cleveland Browns, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is already making headlines and not the kind the team was hoping for. Early Tuesday morning, the 22-year-old was pulled over in Ohio for allegedly speeding at 101 miles per hour on the highway. It was 12:24 a.m., and according to police records, Sanders was driving north on I-71 when he was cited for going 41 mph over the limit.According to the citation, Shedeur was pulled over by local authorities in Strongsville, about 20 minutes from downtown Cleveland. He was allegedly driving 101 mph, a clear violation of the speed limit and one that could come with steep penalties depending on how the case is handled.For now, it’s a standard traffic ticket, but driving over 100 mph can sometimes result in harsher consequences depending on local laws, past driving history, or how the court views the offense. Luckily for Shedeur, this doesn't appear to involve any DUI or reckless endangerment charges, just excessive speed.Shedeur now has a choice: he can either fight the ticket in court or pay the fine outright. That’s standard in these cases though fighting it could come with the hope of reducing points or penalties on his license.No official statement has been released by Sanders or the Browns organization, but it’s safe to assume the team is aware.And considering this is his rookie offseason, the last thing they want is more off-field drama.Naturally, fans didn’t waste time chiming in. Some joked that Sanders is just “practicing his 40-yard dash in a car,” while others questioned his decision-making just weeks before Browns training camp.It’s not uncommon for NFL players to land in hot water over speeding tickets, but driving over 100 mph? That’s never a good look, especially for a rookie QB already under the microscope thanks to his famous last name and high expectations.While no one's calling this a scandal, it’s definitely not the cleanest way to kick off your NFL career. Shedeur has time to clean it up, either by paying the fine or showing up in court. But you can bet Browns fans and coaches will be watching closely.Also read - “Fu*k KC”: Chiefs hit with racial bias lawsuit, fans stunned over pay gap and wrongful firing claims","Shedeur Sanders was pulled over early Tuesday morning in Strongsville, Ohio.

The Bigger Picture: Lakers’ Offseason Strategy

Theentered the 2025 season with high expectations after acquiring Luka Dončić to pair with LeBron James . However, their early playoff exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves exposed glaring roster flaws. Now, the front office is eyeing upgrades, and a surprising target has emerged: former Boston Celtics defensive stalwart Marcus Smart.According to Bovada, the Los Angeles Lakers hold the second-best odds (+200) to land Smart, trailing only the Sacramento Kings (+150). With Washington likely moving on from the veteran guard, Los Angeles sees an opportunity to bolster its defense and add championship experience.Despite limited playing time over the past two seasons (just 54 total games), Marcus Smart remains a proven difference-maker. His resume includes:- 2019-20 NBA All-Defensive First Team- 2021-22 Defensive Player of the Year- Key contributor to Boston’s 2022 Finals runThe Los Angeles Lakers struggled defensively last season, ranking 18th in defensive rating. Smart’s ability to guard multiple positions and disrupt opposing offenses would immediately address this weakness.As Matt John of Athlon Sports noted in the original report: ""Smart is a former Defensive Player of the Year who helped the Celtics make multiple extensive playoff runs, including a run to the NBA Finals in 2022.""While Los Angeles is a strong suitor, other teams are also in the mix:The Kings’ slightly better odds stem from their need for backcourt defense, but the Lakers’ championship pedigree could sway Smart’s decision.Washington isn’t expected to demand a hefty return for Smart, given their rebuild. The Lakers could offer:- A future second-round pick- A young prospect (e.g., Jalen Hood-Schifino)- Salary filler (e.g., Taurean Prince)This low-risk move would allow LA to retain flexibility for bigger trades while adding a proven playoff performer.Marcus Smart isn’t the only piece the Lakers need, but he fits their timeline. Here’s why:1. Defensive Upgrade – Smart’s tenacity would complement the offensive firepower of James and Dončić 2. Leadership – His experience in high-pressure games would benefit a roster with title aspirations.3. Cost-Effective – Unlike blockbuster trades, acquiring Smart wouldn’t gut the Lakers’ assets.Marcus Smart's interest from the Los Angeles Lakers suggests a practical approach to roster construction. He won't fix every issue they have, but his playoff experience and defensive prowess make him a prime target. Los Angeles' pursuit of another championship may benefit from this move if they can outmaneuver Sacramento.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Might Sign $100 Million Brooklyn Nets superstar; Backups In Store Too?

Is Gisele Bundchen over Tom Brady for good? Her recent move has fans convinced



Tom Brady has always worn his heart on his sleeve when it comes to family. This past Mother's Day, the NFL icon took a moment to publicly appreciate his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her role as a dedicated mother. His social media tribute described her as “strong,” “compassionate,” and “amazing,” praising her efforts in raising their two children, Benjamin and Vivian. For many, it was a reminder of Brady's commitment to celebrating the people who shaped his personal life, even if they are no longer together.However, when Father’s Day rolled around just weeks later, fans were taken aback by Bündchen’s silence. Not a single post or mention of Tom Brady appeared on her social media. While celebrities often choose to keep their personal expressions private, this noticeable absence sparked curiosity—and in some corners, criticism.Tom Brady’s heartfelt tribute had raised expectations of a reciprocal gesture. Instead, Bündchen’s pages remained focused on her personal life, which now includes her new family dynamic with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente. Her most recent family-centered post revolved around her daughter Vivian’s birthday, capturing her happiness in a new chapter.This, for many fans, signaled a stronger desire to close the chapter on her former life with Brady and fully embrace her new one.Meanwhile, Brady continued to show the world that family is central to who he is. On Father's Day , he honored his own father, Tom Brady Sr., with a message that read, ""It's important to appreciate the people who shape us. No one's done more for me than my dad."" The tribute underscored the NFL legend’s consistent public display of gratitude, not just as a father but also as a son.The sharp contrast between Brady’s open expression and Gisele Bündchen’s silence triggered waves of speculation online. While some believed Gisele was simply setting boundaries, others viewed it as a sign of lingering tension. Social media comment sections quickly filled with polarized takes—some defending her right to privacy, others accusing her of being dismissive despite Brady’s previous gesture.Publications like The Sun and Newsweek also weighed in, noting how fans interpreted the silence as a possible reflection of a deeper divide between the ex-couple. Still, it's worth noting that neither Brady nor Bündchen has publicly addressed the situation, allowing the speculation to grow.According to People, Gisele’s romance with Valente blossomed slowly and quietly. “They started out as great friends first. She’s very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other,” a source revealed. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce. Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.”As the former couple continues to co-parent in the public eye, the disparity in their public gestures reveals the complexities that come with navigating life post-divorce—especially when the world is always watching.Also Read: Tom Brady once choked up as he admitted he wasn’t as good a father as his own dad: ""When I think about being a dad...""",Gisele Bündchen did not post on her social media for Father's Day.

Game 6 could boost Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander into a legendary Finals pantheon

Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander has already delivered a Finals performance for the ages—but something even bigger is on the horizon. Game 6 is more than a must-win; it’s a make-history kind of night. He’s chasing something few players ever touch, and while no one knows exactly how it will unfold, one thing’s certain: the numbers, the pressure, and the moment are all aligning for something unforgettable.As the Thunder get ready to hit the court again, everyone's watching their MVP guard. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander came into this Finals with an average of 32.4 points, 5.0 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game. No player has matched that kind of stat line in Finals history over five games since the 1973–74 season. With those impressive numbers already grabbing attention, the pressure for Game 6 is immense: breaking century-old records, securing a championship, and etching his name among the greats.Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander currently holds the fifth spot in the all-time career Finals PPG list at 32.4, trailing behind Rick Barry (36.3), Allen Iverson (35.6), Giannis Antetokounmpo (35.2), and Michael Jordan (33.6).If he has a monster Game 6—think 52 points—it won’t just bring a championship to Oklahoma City; it will also make him the highest-scoring guard in Finals history. Additionally, it would break the Game 6 single-game scoring record (currently 50 by Bob Pettit and Giannis) and add another remarkable achievement to an already stunning Finals résumé.This year's MVP has been a force since Day 1. He topped the league with 32.7 PPG while shooting 51.9%, contributed 6.4 assists and 5 rebounds, and led the Thunder to an impressive 68-14 record. In the Western Conference Finals, he put up an average of 31.4 PPG, 8.2 APG, and 5.2 RPG, earning him the WCF Finals MVP title.

The liver is the largest internal organ in your body. It plays a key role in digesting food, storing energy, and eliminating toxins.Liver health implies the overall well-being and proper functioning of the liver, a vital organ responsible for over 500 essential functions in the body. These functions include filtering toxins from the blood, producing bile for digestion, storing glucose, and metabolizing nutrients. Maintaining liver health is crucial for overall well-being, as a healthy liver ensures efficient detoxification, nutrient processing, and other vital processes.now, fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver. There are two primary types: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease, also known as alcoholic steatohepatitis.Fatty liver disease, particularly Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), is a growing health concern, affecting an estimated 30.2% of the world's population. Prevalence varies by region, with rates above 40% in the Americas and Southeast Asia.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH).Often termed the ""silent epidemic,"" NAFLD can progress to more severe conditions like cirrhosis soon, if left unchecked. While many symptoms manifest during the day, certain warning signs become more pronounced at night.Recognizing these nocturnal symptoms is crucial for early detection and management.Individuals with fatty liver disease often report difficulty falling or staying asleep . The discomfort from liver inflammation or the body's struggle to process toxins can lead to restless nights. Moreover, the liver's reduced ability to store and release glycogen can cause blood sugar imbalances, further disrupting sleep patterns.A common symptom of fatty liver disease is discomfort in the upper right abdomen. This sensation can worsen at night, making it hard to get a good night's sleep. People may feel a sense of fullness or pressure, which can be quite concerning.Though not typically a symptom seen during night time, a decrease in appetite, particularly at night, may signify fatty liver disease. Individuals may find they have less interest in food, especially during dinner, which could eventually lead to weight loss and nutritional problems.As fatty liver disease progresses, the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream can affect brain function. This may lead to symptoms like confusion, poor memory, or trouble focusing on any task, commonly referred to as ""brain fog.""Fatigue is a hallmark of fatty liver disease. However, when the liver's detoxification processes are compromised, individuals may experience overwhelming tiredness during the night. This isn't just typical tiredness; it's an overpowering fatigue that can interfere with daily life.While swelling can occur at any time, it may become more noticeable at night. Fluid retention due to liver dysfunction can lead to swelling in the legs and feet, causing discomfort and affecting sleep quality.Fatty liver disease can cause itchy skin, especially if liver damage affects bile flow. When bile salts build up under the skin, it can cause irritation and itching, even if there is no visible rash.Unexplained weight loss can be an early indicator of fatty liver disease. The liver's involvement in various metabolic processes, including the regulation of body weight, can be disrupted, leading to unintended weight loss.In more advanced stages of fatty liver disease, jaundice can develop. This condition causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow due to elevated levels of bilirubin, a waste product from red blood cells. Jaundice is a serious sign and should be checked by a doctor immediately.While adopting a healthy lifestyle – which consists of a balanced diet, regular exercise, checking alcohol consumption and smoking, and having adequate sleep – can significantly elevate liver health, if you experience any of the above symptoms, especially during the night, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. Early detection through blood tests and imaging can help manage and potentially reverse the effects of fatty liver disease. Consult a doctor if you see such symptoms. It is important that you ensure a healthy well-being of your liver as it becomes one of the most vital organs of survival as the age increases, but also loses immunity without proper care.","Fatty liver disease, particularly Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), is a growing health concern, affecting an estimated 30.2% of the world's population.

A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection, and now doctors are warning others to be aware of the symptoms.William Hand, a recent 8th-grade graduate from Hughes Academy of Science and Technology, started feeling really unwell early on June 8. He woke up before 5 a.m., and according to his father, Will Hand, things went downhill fast. In a heartbreaking Facebook post, he wrote, ""Everything snowballed and God called him home."" He shared a photo of his son, remembering him with ""flowing hair, big smile and in sports attire,"" saying, ""I will see you again, son. ""Will had developed a rare blood infection called meningococcemia—also known as meningococcal septicemia. It’s caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, which enters the bloodstream and spreads quickly. Once it kicks in, it can be extremely hard to treat, and is usually fatal.Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch told Fox Carolina, how brutal the illness can be: “The infection happens so quickly, and once it starts going, sometimes it’s very hard to save the person who is infected.”The disease spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets—meaning things like kissing, sharing drinks, or using the same utensils can pass it on.Meningococcal septicemia is basically a rare—and very serious—blood infection caused by a type of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. You might’ve heard more about meningitis, which is when the same bacteria attack the lining of the brain and spinal cord. But in septicemia, instead of staying in the brain, the bacteria invade your bloodstream and start causing chaos throughout your entire body.This bacteria normally lives quietly in the back of the nose and throat of some people (called carriers) without making them sick. But every now and then, it can go rogue—especially if it finds its way into the bloodstream. Once it's in your blood, it multiplies like crazy and starts releasing toxins that damage blood vessels, mess with your circulation, and can quickly lead to organ failure.It spreads through close contact—think coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing things like drinks, straws, water bottles, lip balm, or utensils. You usually have to be in close or prolonged contact with someone who is carrying the bacteria. That’s why outbreaks can happen in places like college dorms, military barracks, or households where people are living close together.So, what actually happens? Once these bacteria enter the blood, they multiply rapidly and release toxins that can damage blood vessels. This can lead to internal bleeding, organ failure, and tissue damage—sometimes in just a matter of hours. That’s what makes it so terrifying: the speed. One minute a person might just feel a little unwell, and within a day—or sometimes even less—they’re in critical condition.Early symptoms can look like a regular flu or a bad cold. We're talking fever, chills, body aches, nausea, cold hands and feet, or a fast heart rate. In kids and teens, symptoms can include extreme tiredness, irritability, or a rash that doesn’t fade when pressed (a big red flag). That rash comes from bleeding under the skin, caused by blood vessel damage. It might start out as small red or purple spots and then spread quickly.The tricky part is how fast it moves. With many illnesses, you’ve got some time to figure out what’s going on. Not with this one. That’s why doctors and parents are always urged to trust their instincts—if someone looks seriously sick and symptoms are worsening quickly, it’s better to get them to a hospital ASAP rather than wait it out.The good news? It’s treatable—but only if caught early. Meningococcal septicemia is usually treated with strong antibiotics through an IV. Fluids, oxygen, and sometimes even medications to support blood pressure may also be needed. In severe cases, people may end up in the ICU or require surgery to remove damaged tissue. Even then, survivors might face long-term effects like hearing loss, amputations, or organ damage. That’s how serious this infection can be.Meningococcal septicemia is rare, but when it strikes, it’s aggressive. Knowing the signs, acting quickly, and staying vaccinated can make all the difference. It’s one of those “better safe than sorry” situations where awareness really can save lives.","A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection.

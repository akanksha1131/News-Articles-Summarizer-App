"Wine traders accuse Karnataka mantri of graft, BJP seeks his resignation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wine-traders-accuse-karnataka-mantri-of-graft-bjp-seeks-his-resignation/articleshow/114997206.cms,"Wine merchants should correct themselves: Excise minister

BENGALURU: The Congress government in Karnataka is facing another huge embarrassment as state excise minister RB Timmapur is accused of corruption and bribery in his department. The Karnataka Wine Merchants' Association has accused his office of demanding Rs 16 crore in bribe from officials within the excise department.The allegations have heightened calls for accountability, with BJP calling for Timmapur's resignation amid growing concerns over corruption within the state's excise administration.In a letter to governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot, the chief secretary and the Karnataka Lokayukta, the Association outlined extensive bribery and money-laundering practices allegedly orchestrated by the minister's office, particularly concerning the transfer of excise officials in Bengaluru.However, TOI couldn't independently verify the authenticity of these allegations. According to the letter, Rs 16 crore was reportedly collected in just one day from various levels of the excise department, including deputy commissioners, superintendents, and inspectors, as their tenures came to a close.Timmapur has denied the allegations, saying, ""You must ask them why they went to pay money. Why would anyone pay if everything is in order?""The letter from the Association paints a grim picture of systemic corruption, alleging that ""huge bribes and money-laundering"" are common in the excise minister's office. It suggests that these illegal activities are aimed at facilitating illicit collection of funds for electoral purposes. Notably, the document claims that substantial sums have been extracted over the past two to three and a half years, coinciding with the conclusion of various officers' tenures.It further details that one deputy commissioner allegedly took between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 40 lakh from each officer for easy transfers, leading to a total of Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 3 crore reportedly collected from deputy commissioners operating in Bengaluru alone.Amid these allegations, minister Timmapur, who was campaigning in Shiggaon, pledged to take action against officials involved in corrupt practices. ""When these people (wine merchants) do something wrong, then they (officers) harass them. The wine merchants should correct themselves,"" he said, attempting to counter the accusations and suggesting that they may be motivated by personal grievances.Timmapur further said: ""These allegations are baseless and politically motivated. While I have approved some promotions through proper channels, I did not authorise any transfers for monetary gain. Transfers were not executed, but routine promotions were processed appropriately. The licence renewal process was conducted without undue pressure or monetary demands... Instead of making such unfounded accusations, the association should identify who actually received the payments.""Opposition leader in the assembly and senior BJP MLA, R Ashoka, alleged a wider ""Rs 700-crore liquor scam"" operating within the state. He alleged that Thimmapur is implicated in ""blatant extortion and bribery,"" linking this controversy to other scandals, including those involving the alleged Maharshi Valmiki ST Development Corporation and Muda land scams.","The Karnataka Wine Merchants' Association has accused excise minister RB Timmapur of bribery and money-laundering practices.

ASI has been in charge of the monument's upkeep even now.Once described as Asia's largest fort, it was declared a protected monument in the Gazette of India on Nov 29, 1951. However, a notification issued on Aug 17, 2005, claimed the fort area as waqf property.The areas claimed include Solah Kambh or 16-pillar monument, 14 of the 15 domes in Ashtur and multiple tombs, including that of Amir Barid in Barid Shahi Park.Though the CM issued back-to-back clarifications and an order to nullify any takeover notices in the past fortnight, farmers and citizens are still a frazzled lot.Anirudh Desai, assistant surveyor with the archaeology department, claimed he has no knowledge of the govt notification that classifies ""this protected site"" as wakf property since 2005. ""The relevant department records are in the head office in Hampi,"" he said, adding the Hampi office may shed more light on the issue.Deputy commissioner Shilpa Sharma, too, claimed she is unaware of Bidar Fort being designated as Waqf Board property and said she will obtain information from the department concerned.Similarly, Dharmapur and Chatnalli villages of Bidar taluk are claimed by Waqf Board. Sources said a total of 26 acres under Survey No. 87 of Dharmapur village has been marked. The waqf ownership, which was absent from land records until 2001, was incorporated after 2013. Nearly 19 acres of land that belongs to farmer Krishnamurthy in Udabal village in Chittaguppa taluk has been assigned to Waqf Board. Some 30 years ago, Krishnamurthy, in a gesture, had agreed to the burial of a Muslim man in a corner of his farmland.In 2013, Waqf Board officially recognised 960 acres of land in Chatnalli village.

Patient representatives and treatment activists urged govt, courts, and lawmakers to take urgent action to address the abuse of patent monopolies in rare diseases by incentivising generic production.""Roche's action against Natco isn't just about a single drug or one company's right to profits, it's about our right to life.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday said that minorities have no absolute right to administer educational institutions, while upholding the validity of Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education Act, 2004 - a decision that will clear the uncertainty hanging over 13,364 madrassas in the state with over 12 lakh students since March 22 when Allahabad high court had struck down the Act terming it ""non-secular"" and hence ""unconstitutional"".An SC bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said that the high court erred in quashing the statute and ordering shifting of the students to regular schools under UP Education Board.The SC bench ruled that the right of minorities to administer educational institutions was not absolute and the board could exercise its regulatory power with approval of the state govt to ensure that religious minority institutions imparted secular education of a requisite standard without destroying their minority character.Writing the 70-page judgment, CJI Chandrachud said, ""The right of minorities to administer educational institutions is not absolute. The state has an interest in maintaining the standards of education in minority educational institutions and may impose regulation as a condition for grant of aid or recognition.""The CJI said the state has a constitutional obligation to strike a balance between two objectives - ensuring the standard of excellence of minority educational institutions and preserving the right of minorities to establish and administer its educational institutions.""State can regulate aspects of the standards of education such as the course of study, qualification and appointment of teachers, health and hygiene of students, and facilities for libraries. Regulations pertaining to standards of education or qualification of teachers do not directly interfere with the administration of the recognised madrassas. Such regulations are designed to prevent maladministration of an educational institution,"" the SC said.It said the 2004 Act did not interfere with the day-to-day administration of madrassas as its objective was regulatory in nature for improvement of academic excellence of students. ""The Madarsa Act is consistent with the positive obligation of the state to ensure that students studying in recognised madrassas attain a minimum level of competency which will allow them to effectively participate in society and earn a living,"" it said.However, the SC said the Madarsa Act, to the extent to which it sought to regulate higher education, including degrees of Fazil (postgraduate) and Kamil (undergraduate), was beyond the legislative competence of the state legislature as it conflicted with the UGC Act, which governs the standards for higher education. A state legislation cannot seek to regulate higher education in contravention of the UGC Act, it said.The SC severed conferment of Fazil and Kamil degrees from the functioning of the Madarsa Board and said it could continue to regulate madrassa education till Class 12. ""The mere fact that the education which is sought to be regulated includes some religious teachings or instruction does not automatically push the legislation (Madarsa Act) outside the legislative competence of the state,"" it said.Referring to Article 28(3) which prohibits students in state recognised and state-funded or aided educational institutions from being compelled to receive religious instructions, the CJI said, ""The corollary to this provision is that religious instruction may be imparted in an educational institution which is recognised by the state, or which receives state aid but no student can be compelled to participate in religious instruction in such an institution.""","Supreme Court upholds validity of Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education Act, 2004.

School Holiday November 24th: Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji's Martyrdom Day

November 2024 ushers in the heart of India’s festive season, as schools and colleges across the country remain in celebration mode. Following the vibrant Diwali festivities on October 31, students enjoy a series of significant religious holidays in early November.In many states, schools remain closed for Govardhan Puja and Bhai Dooj, extending the Diwali break into the first week of November. Schools in several states will reopen on November 4, but the festivities continue as holidays are observed for Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, and Karthik Purnima later in the month.While these holidays bring joy and cultural connection, they also indicate the end of the academic season. The pre-exam period for students begins in November, with the announcement of upcoming term-end tests and the first batch of dates for key entrance exams such as the JEE.The month of November marks a time for balancing celebration with academic preparation as students gradually transition from the festive season to exam season. Here’s a rundown of November’s key school holidays:Here's a closer look at the school holidays in November Govardhan Puja, celebrated the day after Diwali, marks Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. Devotees prepare traditional food offerings and worship the Govardhan Hill to express gratitude for nature’s abundance. This festival is celebrated in several regions, and schools in some states remain closed for students to participate in the rituals and celebrations.Bhai Dooj, celebrated just two days after Diwali, is a festival symbolizing the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being, and brothers offer gifts in return. This occasion fosters family unity, with schools closed for students to spend time with their families and partake in this cherished ritual.Chhat Puja, a deeply revered festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to worshipping the Sun God. The festival involves fasting and prayers for the well-being and prosperity of family members. Schools close in regions observing Chhat Puja, allowing students to participate in the early morning and evening rituals along the riverbanks.Guru Nanak Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is one of the most significant days in the Sikh calendar. Celebrated with grand processions and community services, it emphasizes values of equality, compassion, and humility. Schools in many states declare a holiday, enabling students to partake in the celebrations and observe the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Karthik Purnima, observed on the full moon day of the Karthik month, holds importance for both Hindu and Sikh communities. Celebrations often include holy baths and offerings at rivers, temples, and gurudwaras. The holiday allows students and families to engage in these spiritual practices.Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji’s Martyrdom Day honours the ninth Sikh Guru's sacrifice for the freedom of religion. His martyrdom is commemorated with solemn services, kirtans, and processions, emphasising the Guru’s courage and dedication to human rights. Schools observe a holiday in some states to let students remember and honour this legacy.","November 2024 ushers in the heart of India’s festive season, as schools and colleges across the country remain in celebration mode.

A tragic incident occurred on Tuesday evening at the construction site of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train corridor in Vasad village, leading to the death of three workers and injuring another. The mishap involved the collapse of a temporary steel and concrete structure used for well foundation work near the Mahi River.Initial reports suggested that an under-construction bridge had collapsed. However, the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) clarified that the incident involved a temporary structure for well foundation work. The structure, made of steel and concrete blocks weighing 2.5 tons each, was supported by high-tensile (HT) strands. The collapse was attributed to the snapping of these strands, causing the blocks to fall and trap four workers.Swift rescue operations were launched, involving cranes, excavators, local volunteers, and assistance from the state administration, police, and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Despite their efforts, three workers lost their lives, while one survivor is undergoing treatment.Anand Superintendent of Police Gaurav Jasani confirmed, ""Three workers died, and another is undergoing treatment at the hospital."" Fire officer Dharmesh Gor added that two workers died on the spot, and a third succumbed to injuries later at the hospital.Railway sources provided a detailed account: ""This evening, while sinking in one of the wells at Mahi River in Anand District, concrete blocks fell, trapping four laborers. Immediate rescue operations were undertaken by mobilizing cranes and excavators at the site, with assistance from locals, state administration, police, and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). All four workmen were rescued. Unfortunately, three were declared dead, and one is under treatment.""The statement continued, ""The work involved sinking 610 meters, of which 582 meters have been completed. The collapse occurred during the sinking of concrete blocks, each weighing 2.5 tons, loaded on a frame supported by high-tensile (HT) strands. Although 16 strands were provided as per the design for four, some strands snapped, causing the blocks to fall. A detailed technical inquiry is underway to ascertain the exact cause of the incident.""An ex-gratia payment of Rs 20 lakh each has been provided to the families of the deceased workers.Superintendent of Police Gaurav Jasani confirmed, ""Three workers died, and another is undergoing treatment at the hospital."" Fire officer Dharmesh Gor added, ""Two died on the spot, and the third succumbed to injuries at the hospital.""The local community played a significant role in rescue efforts, joining forces with emergency responders to clear debris and ensure no additional workers were trapped. The rescue teams continue to remove the fallen blocks to verify the safety of the site.The NHSRCL has announced a detailed technical inquiry to determine the cause of the collapse.","A temporary structure for well foundation work collapsed in Anand, India.

BATHINDA: Canada 's Khalistani-Hindu altercations, from Brampton to Malton and Surrey, have left many Indians and temporary visa holders, especially those from Punjab, fearing for their safety and their families back home worried.The conflict sparked by an attack on a Hindu Mahasabha temple in Brampton city of Canadian province Ontario's Greater Toronto Area underscores divisions around the demand for Khalistan and its impact on Canada's multicultural communities.Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups. Punjab's Rohit Kumar, who is on a work permit in Brampton, said: ""We are highly concerned. Incidents such as these only worsen the perception that we are creating unrest here, and that will cause more problems for us.""Kulwinder Singh, who has been involved in peaceful protests for extending work permits, emphasised the potential long-term consequences of the violence on community relations. Calling for unity among communities, Kulwinder said: ""While we focus on securing our future in Canada, incidents like these could affect our ability to integrate.""Back in Punjab, Amit Mittal, whose son lives in Surrey, requested the Canadian authorities to manage these recurring conflicts carefully. ""These events have ripple effects that impact the safety of our children staying abroad,"" Mittal said, also calling on the Indian govt to push for protection of Punjabis in Canada.The rising tensions highlight the delicate balance within Canada's diverse immigrant communities and the need for careful intervention to prevent further discord.These escalating tensions between pro-Khalistan supporters and opposition groups make migrants from Punjab anxious to save their reputation. For those struggling to extend their work permits, like Brampton store worker Jatinder Singh - whose permit expires next month - a dented image could be disastrous. ""These disruptive elements could fracture Canada's social harmony and create unrest back home, where longstanding regional disputes remain unresolved,"" Jatinder added.","Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups.

Failure to follow Vajpayee’s ‘road map’ led to J&K’s downgrade: Omar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/failure-to-follow-vajpayees-road-map-led-to-jks-downgrade-omar/articleshow/114990649.cms,"Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah (Pic credit: PTI)

SRINAGAR:

Jhamoriyat, Kashmiriyat aur Insaniyat

Chief minister Omar Abdullah showered fulsome praise Tuesday on “great visionary” Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the assembly while lamenting that J&K “would not have been where it is at present had the former PM’s road map” for the region been followed.Alluding to the BJP-led Centre’s 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and statehood, Omar suggested J&K wouldn’t have been downgraded if Vajpayee’s road map had been adhered to in spirit. “Unfortunately, the path shown by Vajpayee has been left mid-way and instead of connecting people, distances are being created,” National Conference (NC) vice-president and CM said on the second day of the inaugural assembly session of J&K as a Union territory (UT).Speaking during obituary references to 57 leaders who passed away in the past decade, Omar struggled to find words to eulogise the former BJP stalwart. “What should I say about the late Vajpayee. He was a towering personality who started the Lahore bus and went to Minar-e-Pakistan. He always tried to build friendly ties with Pakistan. He was the one who continuously said friends can be changed, not neighbours,” Omar said.The CM recalled Vajpayee’s slogan of “(Democracy, Kashmiri ethos and humanity)” as an example of the ex-PM’s unmatched vision. “Perhaps, he was the first and the last leader who raised this slogan,” Omar said.The CM reminisced about another instance when the J&K assembly had passed a resolution over two decades ago calling for greater autonomy, only for it to be returned by the Vajpayee-led cabinet. “But later, Vajpayee realised the decision was taken in haste. He asked the then law minister to hold talks with (then governing) NC leaders. But progress couldn’t be made further. When Vajpayee passed away, things changed drastically,” Omar said.Monday’s obituary references mentioned lawmakers from Ladakh and Kargil. Omar noted this was, perhaps, the last time the assembly was paying tributes to such members as Ladakh and Kargil were not part of Jammu and Kashmir anymore after the Aug 2019 abrogation cleaved the erstwhile state into two UTs -- Ladakh and J&K.Meanwhile, BJP’s Udhampur-East MLA RS Pathania referred to Monday’s controversial move by PDP member Waheed Para to move a resolution challenging the abrogation of Article 370, sparking bedlam in the House. Pathania demanded to know how media had covered the row when a “copy of the resolution hadn’t reached the Speaker”. Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather of NC admitted he hadn’t received the document but requested Pathania to stick to obituary references. CM Omar termed Parra’s move an attempt “to play to the gallery”.",Chief minister Omar Abdullah showered fulsome praise on “great visionary’ Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the assembly. He said J&K “would not have been where it is at present had the former PM’s road map’ for the region been followed.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114990647,imgsize-1994630,width-400,resizemode-4/114990647.jpg"

'Crossed Red Line': India Jabs Trudeau After Hindu Devotees Including Kids Attacked In Canada

Thousands take out solidarity rally; cops call gathering 'unlawful'

Peel police officer suspended after participating in protest outside temple

Three arrested for violence

Jaishankar says India deeply concerned

A massive crowd gathered outside Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton, Canada on Monday night in solidarity with the temple and the community after an attack at the same place a day before.On Sunday, an Indian consular camp at the Hindu Sabha Temple witnessed a 'violent disruption' near Toronto. Following the attacks, the Hindu Canadian Foundation, a non-profit organisation working for the Hindu community in Canada, shared a video of the attack on the temple and claimed that pro-Khalistani supporters attacked kids and women.Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau condemned the incident.""I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India's resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,"" PM Modi said on X.Earlier, Trudeau had taken to Twitter and said, ""The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely.""More than a thousand Canadian Hindus assembled outside the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton on Monday evening to protest against the recent attacks. The rally saw organizers urging Canadian politicians and law enforcement agencies to cease support for Khalistanis.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) shared details of the event on social media platform X, stating: ""Over a thousand #CanadianHindus have gathered in Brampton to protest against the increasingly brazen attacks on Hindu Temples. Yesterday, during the sacred #Diwali weekend, Canadian Hindu temples, coast to coast, came under attack. We ask Canada to stop this #Hinduphobia now!""Sikhs for Justice, a pro-Khalistan group with a presence in Canada and the US, said their members were 'peacefully protesting' outside the Hindu temple against the presence of Indian consular officials who they say were inside.The gathering, however, was declared an 'unlawful assembly' by the peel regional police order. The police notice said, ""Peel regional police public order is being deployed at a demonstration on the Gore Road near Tyler Avenue. This is in response to weapons seen within the crowd of demonstators. We are asking the public to avoid the area as officers respond. This is now an unlawful assembly and we will be clearing the area. All individuals are to face arrest.""A peel regional police officer is on suspension after appearing in videos of a protest at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton on Sunday. The officer, Sergeant Harinder Sohi, is an 18-year veteran of the force.Videos circulating on social media show Sohi at the protest. Peel police spokesperson, Richard Chin, stated, “We are aware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show one of our off duty officers participating in a protest.”Although no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against Sohi, he has received death threats on social media following his suspension. The Peel Regional Police Association is providing support and protection to Sohi.Peel regional police said that they made several arrests in connection to the protests in Brampton and Mississauga, Ontario. Four people were arrested, including 43-year-old Dilpreet Singh Bouns, 23-year-old Vikas, and 31-year-old Amritpal Singh.A fourth individual, who was not identified, was arrested on an outstanding unrelated warrant and released.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who is in Australia for the 15th India-Australia Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue, was asked about the attack in Brampton.""What happened yesterday at the Hindu temple in Canada was deeply concerning...you should have seen the statement by our official spokesperson and also the expression of concern by our PM yesterday. That should convey to you how deeply we feel about it,"" Jaishankar said.","A massive crowd gathered outside Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton, Canada on Monday night in solidarity with the temple and the community after an attack at the same place a day before.

Man accused of terror by India is our employee but no evidence to prove allegations: Canada agency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-accused-of-terror-by-india-is-our-employee-but-no-evidence-to-prove-allegations-canada-agency/articleshow/114958546.cms,"NEW DELHI: Canada ’s accusation without “evidentiary proof” that India got designated pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar killed on its soil contrasts with its refusal to acknowledge what New Delhi calls irrefutable evidence about Canadian Border Security Agency harbouring the wanted mastermind of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu’s October 2020 assassination in Punjab’s Tarn Taran.In an emailed response, CBSA confirmed to TOI that Sandeep Singh Sidhu, aka Sunny Toronto, was an employee but denied he was involved in any crime in India.“All CBSA employees are subject to background checks and reviews prior to their employment, periodically all throughout their career and in response to allegations that call into question their reliability. CBSA can confirm we have no evidence to support allegations made against him,” the agency wrote.Intelligence sources said Sidhu, whose extradition India has officially demanded, operates in “close coordination” with Canadian Security Intelligence Service, while officially being part of CBSA.He is a member of banned International Sikh Youth Federation, which is one of the reasons why India has put him on its list of fugitives charged with promoting terrorist activities from Canada.How Sidhu masterminded killing of Sandhu, a teacher who was conferred Shaurya Chakra for his role in fighting militancy, is among the subplots in a larger antiIndia conspiracy involving Pakistan’s ISI, sources said.Multiple agencies, including NIA, found out during the probe into Sandhu’s assassination how Sidhu and his ISI handlers baited Gurjit Singh, a ‘hitman’ obsessed with an underage girl & blackmailed him into agreeing to murder.Gurjot Kaur, the USbased widow of former Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief Harmeet Singh, alias Happy PhD, was another piece on ISI’s chessboard.ISI promised Gurjit and his arrested accomplices — Sukhdeep Singh and Inderjeet Singh — money and shelter in Canada in return for murdering Sandhu. The plot took shape in the spring of 2020. Those tasked with coordinating the hit were Dubai-based gangster Sukh Bhikhariwal and Sidhu.The duo acted on the instructions of ISI henchman and pro-Khalistan terrorist Lakhbir Singh Rode, who died in Pakistan last December.Sidhu had established links with ISI through Gurjot, wanted in India for coordinating terrorist activity from her base in the US.The hired shooters received sophisticated weapons and training in Sept 2020, sources said. On October 16, Gurjit and his accomplices arrived at Sandhu’s residence-cum-school in Bhikhiwind dressed from head to toe in black. The target’s coordinates were given to them through the conduits of two gangsters – Ravinder Singh, alias Gyani, and Sukhraj Sukkha – in Ferozepur Jail.That morning, Sandhu opened the door presuming it was the milkman. The shooters barged in and fired, killing him instantly. They threw their bike in the Sutlej and fled to Ludhiana, where they stayed in a house in Salem Tibri that Sidhu and Bhikhariwal had arranged for them.Prior to Sandhu’s murder, the family had faced 16 attacks in a year. In one of these, Sandhu and his wife fought back a group of terrorists for five hours using weapons provided by the govt. By Dec 2020, Delhi Police’s special cell tracked down Gurjit and Sukhdeep. Bhikhariwal was extradited from Dubai and a manhunt started for Sidhu. The third shooter, Inderjeet, was arrested while trying to flee to Dubai. Inderjeet confessed that two Khalistani terrorists based abroad contacted him in March 2020 after noticing his Facebook posts.He said one of them identified himself as Sidhu aka Sunny, a resident of Canada, and tasked him with doing a recce of Sandhu’s residence. Sidhu later helped him get in touch with Bhikhariwal. Sidhu also sent him a flight ticket and e-visa to Dubai.","Canadian Border Security Agency harbouring wanted mastermind of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu’s October 2020 assassination.

Estimates of all-time high paddy output to take Kharif food-grains production at record level during 2024-25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/estimates-of-all-time-high-paddy-output-to-take-kharif-food-grains-production-at-record-level-during-2024-25/articleshow/114984435.cms,"The record estimate of paddy, the main Kharif crop, comes amid surplus rice stocks in government godowns that led to slow pace of procurement during the current marketing season.

NEW DELHI: Backed by good monsoon rains and higher acreage, output of Kharif food-grains is estimated at record high of around 165 million tonnes (MT) during 2024-25 crop year, over 5% (9 MT) higher than the previous year. The food-grains’ basket includes all-time high production of paddy at around 120 MT which is higher by over 6% (7 MT) than the output in 2023-24 crop year, according to the agriculture ministry’s estimates released on Tuesday.The record estimate of paddy, the main Kharif crop, comes amid surplus rice stocks in government godowns that led to slow pace of procurement during the current marketing season. Harvesting of paddy is expected to be completed by mid-Nov across the country.The ministry, for the first time, used data from the Digital Crop Survey (DCS) which is being conducted under the Digital Agriculture Mission, replacing the manual ‘Girdawari (random estimation based on crop cutting experiments at the time of harvest) system.Use of digital survey is an important step towards arriving at robust crop area estimates. Such estimation has been done for Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Odisha wherein 100% districts are covered under DCS in Kharif 2024. “This has led to substantial rise in area under paddy particularly in UP,” said the ministry while sharing the first advance estimates of production of Kharif crops for the year 2024-25.In the Kharif food-grain basket, maize (24 MT) and jowar (2 MT) also showed record output whereas pulses output is expected to remain almost flat at nearly 7 MT.Among non-foodgrains, oilseeds production is likely to marginally increase to nearly 26 MT while sugarcane production is projected to decline to 440 MT from 453 MT last year. The production of cotton is also estimated to be lower at nearly 30 million bales (170 kg each)."," output of Kharif food-grains is estimated at record high of around 165 million tonnes (MT) during 2024-25 crop year, over 5% (9 MT) higher than the previous year.

"Kodu Crop to blame for elephant deaths in Bandhavgarh, says ICAR toxicology report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kodu-crop-to-blame-for-elephant-deaths-in-bandhavgarh-says-icar-toxicology-report/articleshow/114983728.cms,"BHOPAL: As Congress Demands CBI Inquiry into Alleged Elephant Poisoning, Wildlife Institute Identifies Kodu Crop as the Cause A toxicological examination report from the Center for Wildlife Conservation, Management, and Disease Surveillance, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, has debunked claims of intentional poisoning of elephants in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, Umaria, Madhya Pradesh. The report, which was submitted to the Deputy Director of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, attributes the deaths to contamination from Kodu crop, specifically its fungal toxins.The report followed an investigation based on visceral organ and gastrointestinal contents sent by the Reserve to the institute on November 2. The samples, including liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lung, stomach, and intestinal contents, were analyzed for the presence of various toxic substances. These included cyanide (HCN), nitrate-nitrite, heavy metals, commonly used insecticides, and the active principle of Kodu, cyclopiazonic acid.The analysis found no traces of cyanide, nitrate-nitrite, heavy metals, or any common insecticides such as Organophosphates, Organochlorines, Pyrethroids, or Carbamates. However, cyclopiazonic acid was detected in all pooled samples, with concentrations exceeding 100 ppb. Further screenings are underway to determine the exact levels.“The results suggest that the elephants might have ingested large quantities of Kodu plant or its grains,” the report concludes, indicating that the elephants were likely poisoned by the fungus growing on the Kodu crop.The IVRI has also issued several precautionary measures to combat the spread of fungal infections in the region. According to experts, the contamination of Kodu crops has not only been affecting the local wildlife, including elephants, but is also posing a significant risk to domestic livestock.The research institute has strongly recommended that farmers conduct a survey of affected fields and destroy any fungal-infected Kodu crop residue. It is also critical to prevent both domestic and wild animals from entering these fields, as ingestion of the contaminated crop could lead to serious health complications.Furthermore, the institute stressed the importance of raising awareness among farmers and livestock owners in and around the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) about the dangers posed by fungal-infected crops. It has urged local communities to take necessary precautions, such as keeping livestock away from fields with high fungal contamination.To better understand the environmental factors contributing to these fungal outbreaks, the institute has called for an in-depth study of the cropping patterns and environmental conditions around the BTR. The study is expected to shed light on the conditions that may be fueling the spread of the infection.In addition, the institute has suggested further research into the toxicity of cyclopiazonic acid, particularly its lethal dose (LD50) for both domestic and wild animals. Understanding this threshold is crucial to mitigating the risks associated with the consumption of contaminated crops.This report comes amid ongoing political pressure, as the Congress party has demanded a CBI inquiry into the elephant deaths, alleging that the poisoning was intentional. However, the scientific findings point to the unintentional consequences of consuming contaminated crops, highlighting the urgent need for agricultural and wildlife management interventions in the region.As the investigation continues, local authorities and wildlife experts are urging the immediate implementation of the recommended measures to prevent further harm to both wildlife and livestock in the BTR area.","Toxicological examination report has debunked claims of intentional poisoning of elephants in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, Umaria, Madhya Pradesh.

Bulldozer in J&K? LG warns against sheltering ultras,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-terrorists-killed-in-north-kashmir-as-forces-intensify-crackdown/articleshow/114990690.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: ANI)

SRINAGAR:

Statehood ‘certain’

Security forces killed two terrorists Tuesday in a seek-and-kill operation in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, part of an intensified sweep following a rise in attacks across the valley since an elected govt took office in J&K after six years in mid-Oct.“The slain terrorists’ identities have not yet been confirmed and forces are conducting a mop-up operation in the area,” an official said.Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha vowed that those targeting civilians “won’t go unpunished” and warned that houses of people sheltering terrorists would be demolished.“I have directed the forces not to harm any innocent, but the culprits will not be spared. If anyone provides shelter to terrorists, then his house will be razed to the ground,” he said at a function in Baramulla.As security forces targeted terrorists and their support networks, a man from Sopore, identified as Ashiq Hussain Wani, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of being a “hybrid terrorist” — a term used for radicalised people who conduct attacks and then blend back into everyday life. Police claimed to have seized a pistol and seven rounds of ammunition from him.Recent terrorist attacks have led to multiple casualties. On Oct 14, an ambush near Gulmarg in Baramulla killed two soldiers and two civilian porters. In Shopian, a migrant worker from Bihar was fatally shot on Oct 18, followed by the murder of seven tunnel construction workers in Ganderbal on Oct 20.The security push has led to multiple gunfights, including one on Nov 2 when Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Usman alias Chota Waleed from Pakistan was killed in Srinagar. On the same day, two unidentified terrorists were gunned down in Anantnag. However, terrorists retaliated with a grenade attack the next day, wounding 12 people in a busy Srinagar market.Sources attributed the recent uptick in violence to two factors: the incoming winter, which will limit movement, and frustration among Pakistan-based “handlers” over the peaceful assembly elections in J&K, the first in a decade.LG Sinha said Pakistan continues to push terrorists across the border and emphasised that ending violence requires local cooperation. “It is not just the job of the security forces and the administration but the people as well to identify such people (terrorists),” he said, adding that with civilian support, terrorism could be eradicated from J&K within a year.Restoration of statehood is “as certain as the sun rising from the east”, LG Sinha said Tuesday, echoing the focal point of his speech the day before at the inaugural assembly session of J&K as a Union territory.He was quick to add that no political efforts or promises are required to fulfil this commitment, responding to NC-led governing coalition’s repeated pledges to restore J&K’s statehood.",Security forces kill two terrorists in a seek-and-kill operation in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district.

CJI Chandrachud criticises former Justice Krishna Iyer's 'rigid economic theory' on private property,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-chandrachud-criticises-former-justice-krishna-iyers-rigid-economic-theory-on-private-property/articleshow/114985345.cms,"The CJI said, ""To declare that Article 39(b) includes the distribution of all private resources amounts to endorsing a particular economic ideology and structure for our economy. Justice Krishna Iyer's judgement in Ranganatha Reddy, which was followed inter alia in Sanjeev Coke and Bhim Singhji, was influenced by a particular school of economic thought.""

""For instance, in Ranganatha Reddy, Justice Krishna Iyer observed that Article 39(b) constitutes 'a directive to the State with a deliberate design to dismantle feudal and capitalist citadels of property'. In Bhim Singhji, Justice Krishna Iyer cited Karl Marx in his judgement to observe that taking over large conglomerations of land is necessary to make Article 39 a 'constitutional reality',"" he added.

The Chief Justice of India noted that Justice Iyer, in the same ruling, shared his views on the economic landscape, describing it as being in a transitional phase undergoing gradual transformation.

""Significantly, both Justice Krishna Iyer (in Ranganatha Reddy and Bhimsinghji) and Justice Chinappa Reddy (in Sanjeev Coke) consistently referred to the vision of the framers (of the Constitution) as the basis to advance this economic ideology as the guiding principle of the provision. However, as noted earlier in his judgement, the vision of the framers while drafting the Constitution was not to lay down a particular form of social structure or economic policy for future governments,"" the majority judgement said.

The majority judgment, authored by CJI held that while the phrase ""material resources of the community"" could theoretically include privately owned resources, the broad interpretation offered by Justice Krishna Iyer in his minority judgment in Ranganath Reddy and later relied upon by Justice Chinnappa Reddy in Sanjeev Coke, cannot be accepted.

""The Constitution was framed in broad terms to allow succeeding governments to experiment with and adopt a structure for economic governance which would subserve the policies for which it owes accountability to the electorate,"" the CJI said.

""According to Dr Ambedkar, if the Constitution laid down a particular form of economic and social organisation, it would amount to taking away the liberty of people to decide the social organisation in which they wish to live,"" he added.



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday in its majority judgment regarding private property issues criticised former Justice V R Krishna Iyer for ""postulating a rigid economic theory"" that promoted increased state control over private resources as the sole foundation for constitutional governance.These comments on Justice Iyer's approach were made in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud on behalf of himself and six other justices on the bench.The nine-judge bench, led by the CJI, ruled with a 7:2 majority that not all private properties can be classified as ""material resources of the community"", which would otherwise permit states to acquire them for distribution towards 'common good' under the Constitution.""The doctrinal error in the Krishna Iyer approach was, postulating a rigid economic theory, which advocates for greater state control over private resources, as the exclusive basis for constitutional governance,"" the CJI wrote in the 193-page judgement.In 1977, a seven-judge bench had previously ruled with a 4:3 majority in the state of Karnataka vs Shri Ranganatha Reddy case, that privately owned resources were not within the scope of 'material resources of the community'.Justice Iyer had presented a dissenting opinion, maintaining that the state possessed authority to acquire private resources for distribution to serve common good. He consistently upheld this position in subsequent judgements as well.In his judgement, Justice Chandrachud cited various statements made by Justice Iyer across different verdicts.The majority judgment was authored by CJI Chandrachud, for self and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Rajesh Bindal, SC Sharma and AG Masih, while Justice BV Nagarathna partially concurred and Justice Dhulia dissented.","Chief Justice of India criticises former Justice V R Krishna Iyer for ""postulating a rigid economic theory"" that promoted increased state control over private resources as the sole foundation for constitutional governance.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the validity of Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrassa Education Act, which Allahabad high court had struck down as 'non-secular', ordering closure of madrassas. However, it said that state has a vital interest in regulating madrassas to improve standards of education.The SC clarified that while regulating standards of education in madrassas, state can't violate minority community's right to establish and administer educational institution. The apex court said the HC erred in terming Madrassa Act unconstitutional as it only allowed government to regulate education standard.The SC said madrassas granting certificates beyond Class XII - Kamil and Fazil - cannot be recognised by UP Madrassa Board as these are in conflict with the UGC Act. This means the 13,000-odd madrassas would continue to function in UP with the state regulating the education standards.""The UGC Act governs the standards for higher education and a state legislation cannot seek to regulate higher education, in contravention of the provisions of the UGC Act,"" the court said.A bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra reserved the verdict after hearing arguments from all the concerned parties in the case.Hearing the case, the apex court described India as a ""melting pot of cultures, civilisations and religions"" and stressed taking steps to preserve it.""Ultimately we have to see it through the broad sweep of the country. Religious instructions are there not just for the Muslims. It is there in Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, etc. The country ought to be a melting pot of cultures, civilisations, and religions. Let us preserve it that way. The answer to ghettoization is to allow people to come to the mainstream and to allow them to come together. Otherwise, what we essentially would be doing is to keep them in silos,"" observed the CJI.Justice Pardiwala observed that the teaching of religion has not been prohibited by the Constitution. The bench said that such religious instructions are not unique to the Muslim community and other religions have the same too.Muslim leaders and opposition parties welcomed the apex court's ruling on madrassa law in UP, urging the government to consult stakeholders for any reforms. Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind’s legal advisor, Maulana Kab Rashidi, warned against unconstitutional actions, promising legal challenges if necessary.BSP supremo Mayawati also praised the ruling, expressing hope it would end controversy over madrassa education and bring stability, especially in Uttar Pradesh.Commenting on the top court's decision, former CM and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""It's the UP govt which has been scolded the most by high court and Supreme Court. Time and again, the UP government has done unconstitutional work. It has forced the courts to interfere.

Canadian authorities were intimated about the camp, which was organised for the benefit of local life certificate beneficiaries

NEW DELHI: India condemned violence by proKhalistan separatists at a Hindu temple, and their efforts to disrupt Indian consular activities, in Brampton, Canada , with PM Modi taking to X to assert that the country’s resolve would not be weakened by such acts and sought action against the perpetrators.“I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian govt to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,” Modi said hours after the foreign ministry condemned the incident that took place on Sunday. The ministry said New Delhi remained deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada and asked the Canadian authorities to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks. New Delhi has repeatedly stated in the middle of its ongoing diplomatic spat with Ottawa that its main concern with Canada remains the space given by local authorities to pro-Khalistan separatists, allowing them to target Indian interests.On this occasion, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who has been accused of being sympathetic to the Khalistan cause due to votebank considerations, said on X, “The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practise their faith freely and safely. Thank you to Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident.”Canadian authorities had been intimated about the consular camp being organised in collaboration with the temple for the benefit of local life certificate beneficiaries.Video clips of Sunday’s assault purportedly showed pro-Khalistan demonstrators attacking a crowd of devotees in Hindu Sabha Mandir. One video purportedly showed police pinning down a Hindu youth and handcuffing him, drawing comparisons by commentators with the George Floyd incident in America and leading Canadian MP Chandra Arya to say that his suspicions about Khalistanis infiltrating Canadian law enforcement have been strengthened.Arya said the incident represented a “red line” crossed by Khalistani activists against Hindu devotees. He also referred to the aggressive conduct of Brampton police towards Hindus protesting against the attack.PM Modi’s statement is the second instance in recent months that he has taken up the issue of reported attacks on Hindus outside India. In August this year, he raised with Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of Bangladesh, the alleged targeting of Hindus and other minorities post the regime change in the neighbouring country.In an official statement, the Indian govt said the outreach of Indian consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike would not be deterred by intimidation, harassment and violence.“We condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton city in Ontario, yesterday,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“We call on the govt of Canada to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks. We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted,” Jaiswal said.On Sunday, Peel Regional Police said a protest occurred at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding banners in support of Khalistan, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.The Indian high commission said it was disappointed to see such disruptions being allowed for routine consular work being organised with the fullest cooperation of local co-organisers.“We remain concerned for the safety of applicants, including Indian nationals, on whose demand such events are organised in the first place. Despite these efforts by anti-India elements, our consulate was able to issue more than 1,000 life certificates to Indian and Canadian applicants,” it added.",PM Modi takes to X to assert that the country’s resolve would not be weakened by such acts.

"Farmer claims park with Taj view, raises fences",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmer-claims-park-with-taj-view-raises-fences/articleshow/114957803.cms,"AGRA: Gyarah Sidi Park , an iconic spot across the Yamuna in Agra that provides a picturesque sunset view of Taj Mahal, is at the centre of a land dispute. Local farmer Munna Lal has claimed a chunk of the park as his own. A native of Nagla Devjit, Kachhpura, he insists he has won a “four-decade-long court battle for six bighas of ancestral land within the park”.Lal has ploughed the land with a tractor, raised fences and barricades, and declared it off-limits to public. Lal said his father and uncle were “registered cultivators” of the plot and it was lost to the urban ceiling action in 1976. District court documents from 1998 and 2020 confirm “transfer of ownership” to Lal.Agra divisional commissioner Ritu Maheshwari said the land falls within Agra Development Authority ’s jurisdiction. “Recent developments are being probed,” she said.M y family has fought a 40-year legal battle to secure this land. We’ve court orders and legal papers. In 2020, the office of the sub-divisional magistrate asserted our ownership over the land. This is also registered in revenue records,” Munna Lal told TOIon Monday.The park, managed by ADA and adjacent to the historic Mehtab Bagh, has been the focal point of various proposals, from hosting cultural events and beautification initiatives to plans for a museum. The ADA’s vision for the park was to transform it into a vibrant entertainment zone and cultural hub, providing a unique experience for locals and tourists alike.“Development of a theme park and entertainment zone along with a cultural activity zone at Garah Sidi near the Taj view point will create a lively recreational space that celebrates cultural heritage, offers diverse entertainment options, and enhances the visitor experience, making the area a vibrant and attractive destination for both locals and tourists (sic),” reads aportion in the ADA website.The park hosted the Taj Mahotsav cultural festival in 2023 and a concert by Greek composer Yanni in 1997. It is also home to an ancient observation structure, the Gyarah Sidi, believed to have been used by Mughal emperor Humayun as an observatory. Shakeel Chauhan, national general secretary of Tourist Guides’ Federation of India, said, “The park was a place to witness Taj in its full glory at sunset. This development puts a question mark over its future.”","M y family has fought a 40-year legal battle to secure this land. We’ve court orders and legal papers.

NEW DELHI: All the top 10 most polluted cities of India were from Delhi-National Capital Region in Oct, according to an analysis by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Delhi was the most polluted city in the country in Oct with an average PM2.5 concentration of 111 micrograms per cubic metre, followed by Ghaziabad at 110 and Muzaffarnagar at 103. CREA monitored 263 cities in the country, whose pollution data on continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations was available for 80% of the year's days.According to the analysis, Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar, Hapur, Noida, Meerut, Charkhi Dadri, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Bahadurgarh, all NCR cities, were identified as the second to tenth most polluted cities in India . ""This alarming ranking persists despite the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan , which has been in effect since Oct 15,"" said CREA.""With the exception of Delhi, all other megacities such as Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru managed to maintain PM2.5 values below the national standard in Oct,"" said CREA.CREA added that for the first time this year, Uttar Pradesh dominated the list of India's top 10 most polluted cities, with six cities in the state making the list, followed by three from Haryana. All these 10 cities recorded PM2.5 levels way higher than the daily national ambient air quality standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre and WHO's daily safe guideline of 15 micrograms per cubic metre.Manoj Kumar, analyst, CREA, said, ""According to the Decision Support System for Air Quality Management in Delhi, transboundary sources contributed 60-70% to Delhi's average PM2.5 pollutants in October while less than 10% originated from harvest stubble burning. The elevated PM2.5 concentrations reveal the impact of year-round pollution sources such as transport, industries, and power plants, emphasising the need for comprehensive, long-term strategies.""Apart from occupying the first rank in the list of dirtiest cities in the country, Delhi recorded the highest pollution levels in this Oct compared with Oct of the past four years.

Uptick in man-wildlife conflicts in Ranthambore

JAIPUR: As many as 25 tigers, out of a population of around 75 in the tiger reserve in Ranthambore National Park (RNP) in Rajasthan, have ""disappeared"" within the last year, Rajasthan's chief wildlife warden Pavan Kumar Upadhyay told RNP authorities Monday.This is the first time such a large number of tigers has been reported missing, officially. In 2022, 13 tigers were reported to be missing from Ranthambore National Park. However, this happened over a three-year period, between Jan 2019 and Jan 2022.The high number of missing cats has triggered panic in Rajasthan, with the chief wildlife warden constituting a three-member committee on Monday to investigate the disappearance of the tigers. The committee will review the monitoring reports and recommend action against officials if any negligence by the park administration is found.The department's primary objective is to locate the 14 tigers which went missing in just four months, between May 17 and Sept 30, this year.An official order issued on Nov 4 said that reports of missing tigers have repeatedly emerged from monitoring the assessments within Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR).""Despite several letters sent to RTR field director, no satisfactory changes have been observed. According to a report dated Oct 14, 2024, there has been no concrete evidence of 11 tigers for over a year, and substantial evidence of 14 others has not been obtained for less than a year. Given these circumstances, an inquiry committee has been constituted to investigate the matter of the missing tigers in Ranthambore,"" the order said.Talking to TOI, Upadhyay said, ""The committee will submit its report within two months. There are some monitoring lapses that we aim to address. Recently, I started gathering weekly monitoring reports, which revealed that these tigers were not recorded by the camera traps. Taking this situation seriously, the committee has been formed.""""The state forest department had shortlisted 24 villages in the buffer zone and periphery of RTR for relocation of villagers. The last such relocation took place in 2016, when families from two villages were moved. However, the process has been slow. To mitigate human-animal conflict, new programmes must be designed with the active involvement of local communities,"" said a retired official.Park managers, however, argue that the situation is more complex than it appears, as RTR faces several challenges, including overpopulation of tigers.The reserve, already overcrowded, has seen an increase in human-wildlife conflicts. Tigers, being inherently territorial and migratory, have started dispersing in search of larger, undisturbed areas where they can hunt, rest, and breed. In the congested park, many tigers perished in territorial disputes over access to prey and mates.According to sources, Ranthambore tigers are currently confined to a 900 sq km area. The situation is expected to worsen as both male and female tigers, particularly older ones, struggle to establish their own territories.""A Wildlife Institute of India study, conducted between 2006 and 2014, found that the carrying capacitiy of Ranthambore National Park and Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary is no more than 40 adult tigers. Currently, there are 75 tigers, including subadults and cubs. With more than 10 tigers per 100 sq km, territorial conflicts are forcing weaker animals to leave,"" an official stated.","Uptick in man-wildlife conflicts in Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan.

SC ruling on properties puts wealth distribution debate in focus again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-ruling-on-properties-puts-wealth-distribution-debate-in-focus-again/articleshow/114994353.cms,"NEW DELHI: The verdict by a nine-judge Supreme Court bench on Tuesday where the apex court held that the concept of 'material resources' of the community could not be extend to cover assets of private citizens has once again shone the spotlight on the debate that raged during this year's Lok Sabha elections.The build-up to the campaign saw Congress leader Rahul Gandhi pitching for 'jitni aabadi, utna haq' which envisaged equitable distribution of community assets among different castes based on their respective share in the population to be ascertained by a caste-wise enumeration.His colleague, Sam Pitroda, also spoke approvingly of the 'inheritance tax' in the US where more than half of the wealth of the rich gets transferred to the govt after their death. ""That is an interesting law. It says you in your generation made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair,"" Pitroda had said while noting the absence of a similar law in India.This sparked a fight with BJP, with PM Narendra Modi slamming Congress's advocacy for wealth redistribution. In public meetings, he claimed that the proposal needed to be read along with former PM Manmohan Singh's thesis about minorities, especially Muslims, having the first right on national resources, which he said was a pursuit of vote bank politics in disguise. Congress refuted the charge.The govt's stand in the court was centred on drawing a distinction between a welfare state and the Marxian conception of community having the right to acquire the assets of individual citizens for its version of ""larger interest"".""In essence, the court has held that while Article 39(b) envisages distribution of material resources of the community for the common good, it would be hazardous to assume that such provisions allow commuting the entire national wealth by totalling the wealth of every citizen and distributing it equally among a particular section. The court has accepted the approach put forth by the Union govt and the Maharashtra govt,"" a govt source explained.A wider conception of what constitutes material resources of the community and whether it should extend to limit, even negate, right to private property was the source of many legal battles between the judiciary and an executive influenced by the socialistic pattern of community ownership of resources and the idea of interests of the community getting precedence over those of the individual citizen. The idea lost its sheen after the collapse of the Soviet Union and because of China's embrace of markets and because of economic liberalisation pursued by successive govts in India, beginning the 1990s.It was after a long gap that the issue figured in the political discourse, with Congress espousing it in the run-up to the campaign.",The Supreme Court held that the concept of'material resources' of the community could not be extend to cover assets of private citizens.

Every private property not a community resource: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-private-property-not-a-community-resource-sc/articleshow/114994231.cms,"1978 judgment reiterated by a five-judge bench ruling in 1982

NEW DELHI: A nine-judge Supreme Court bench Tuesday rescinded a 46-year-long socialist interpretation of Article 39(b) of Constitution to authoritatively rule that community resources cannot encompass every private property.By a seven-to-two majority judgment, authored by CJI D Y Chandrachud for himself and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Rajesh Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih, the apex court said it cannot subscribe to an expansion of the definition of community-owned material resources to bring in its ambit privately owned assets. Justice B V Nagarathna partially agreed with the CJI but Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia penned a dissent, adopting a socialist interpretation of Article 39(b).Article 39(b) says the State shall ""direct its policy towards securing that the ownership and control"" of material resources of the community ""are so distributed as best to subserve the common good"".The CJI said theoretically, material resources of the community may include privately owned resources. But he discarded the expansive socialist interpretation of Article 39(b) by Justice Krishna Iyer in the 1978 judgment to mean material resources of the community subsumed all privately owned resources.The 1978 judgment was reiterated by a five-judge bench ruling in 1982. In his 194-page opinion, the CJI said, ""Not every resource owned by an individual can be considered a 'material resource of the community' merely because it meets the qualifier of 'material needs'."" The majority verdict laid down a guideline to inquire whether a private property could be construed as 'material resources of the community' under Article 39(b).It said the inquiry must be context-specific and subject to a non-exhaustive list of factors - nature of the resource and its characteristics, impact of the resource on the well-being of the community, scarcity of the resource, and consequences of such a resource being concentrated in the hands of private players. ""The Public Trust Doctrine evolved by this court may also help identify resources which fall within the ambit of the phrase 'material resource of the community',"" SC said.Discussing the meaning of 'distribution' of material resources of the community so as to subserve common good, as mandated by Article 39(b) in the Directive Principles of State Policy chapter of the Constitution, the bench said though the state can adopt various means, including nationalisation of assets, constitutional courts will determine whether such distribution 'subserves the common good'.Though the concept of community ownership went out of vogue after the pursuit of liberalisation by successive govts, it continues to find adherents and muscled its way into the public discourse in April when Congress's Rahul Gandhi had mooted ""jitni aabadi, utna haq"" principle and explained, ""First, we will conduct a caste census... to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes. After that, financial and institutional survey will begin. Subsequently, we will take up the historic assignment to distribute the wealth of India, jobs and other welfare schemes to these sections based on their population,"" he had said.During the arguments on the issue, Mehta had referred to Rahul's suggestion and told the SC, ""It would be a rustic and juvenile method to propose computing the nation's wealth by totalling the wealth of every citizen and distributing it equally among a particular section. Such ideas reflect a lack of understanding of economic development, governance, social welfare and the nation."" The bench discussed the transition of economic policy in India through the decades. It said the interpretation of Article 39(b) by Justices Iyer (1978) and O C Reddy (1982) were ""rooted in a particular economic ideology and the belief that an economic structure which prioritises acquisition of private property by the state is beneficial to the nation"".Justice Iyer, a known communist, had even cited Karl Marx in his 1980 judgment in Bhim Singhji case to observe that (state) taking over of large conglomerates of the land is necessary to make Article 39(b) a ""constitutional reality"". Referring to the vision of framers of the Constitution on the economic policies to be adopted by the country, the CJI said, ""The Constitution was framed in broad terms to allow succeeding governments to experiment with and adopt a structure for economic governance which would subserve the policies for which it owes accountability to the electorate.""Frowning at the SC adopting a particular economic structure for interpretation of the Constitution, the majority opinion said, ""The role of this court is not to lay down economic policy, but to facilitate this intent of the framers to lay down the foundation for an 'economic democracy'."" The SC said during the nascent years of the nation, there was a mixed economic policy, which in the 1960s and 70s shifted to a socialist pattern. ""Since the decade of the 1990s, or the liberalisation years, there has been a shift towards pursuing a policy of market-based reforms,"" it said. ""Today, the Indian economy has transitioned from the dominance of public investment to the co-existence of public and private investment. The doctrinal error in the Krishna Iyer approach was postulating a rigid economic theory, which advocates for greater state control over private resources, as the exclusive basis for constitutional governance,"" it said.",A nine-judge Supreme Court bench rescinded a 46-year-long socialist interpretation of Article 39(b) of Constitution.

""I must record here my strong disapproval of the remarks made on the Krishna Iyer Doctrine as it is called. This criticism is harsh and could have been avoided,"" he said.The majority opinion of seven judges, authored by CJI Chandrachud, criticised Justice Iyer's minority interpretation of Article 39(b) in 1978 in Ranganatha Reddy case and also faulted the adoption of the minority view in Sanjeev Coke (1982) case judgment by a five-judge bench, which included Justice Nagarathna's father Justice E S Venkataramiah who went on to become CJI in 1989.CJI Chandrachud said, ""The majority judgment in Ranganatha Reddy expressly distanced itself from the observations made by Justice Krishna Iyer (speaking on behalf of the minority of judges) on the interpretation of Article 39(b). Thus, a coequal bench of this court in Sanjeev Coke violated judicial discipline and erred by relying on the minority opinion.""This was not taken kindly by Justice Nagarathna, who said, ""Judgments in Ranganatha Reddy, Sanjeev Coke, Abu Kavur Bai and Basantibai correctly decided the issues that fell for consideration and do not call for any interference on the merits of the matters and as explained above. The observations of the judges in those decisions would not call for any critique in the present times. Neither is it justified nor warranted.""""Can principles of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation adopted in India since 1991, reforms in the economy and structural changes that have been brought about in these last three decades hold a mirror against the socio-economic policies that were followed in the decades immediately after India attained independence?"" she asked. ""Can we castigate former judges... for reaching a particular interpretive outcome?"" she added.""It is a matter of concern as to how the judicial brethren of posterity view the judgments of the brethren of the past, possibly by losing sight of the times in which the latter discharged their duties and the socio-economic policies that were pursued by the state and formed part of the constitutional culture during those times,"" Justice Nagarathna, who will take over as India's first woman CJI in 2027, said.In his judgment, Justice Dhulia said, ""The Krishna Iyer Doctrine, or for that matter the O Chinnappa Reddy Doctrine (in Sanjeev Coke judgment), is familiar to all who have anything to do with law or life. It is based on strong humanist principles of fairness and equity. It is a doctrine which has illuminated our path in dark times.""The long body of their judgment is not just a reflection of their perspicacious intellect but more importantly of their empathy for the people, as human beings were at the centre of their judicial philosophy. In the words of Justice Krishna Iyer himself, 'the courts too have a constituency - the nation - and a manifesto - the Constitution'.""","Justice B V Nagarathna took issue with CJI D Y Chandrachud's comments on the Justice Krishna Iyer Doctrine.

Kesavananda Bharati judgment upheld this part of Art 31C.However, it had struck down the second part of Article 31C, which said no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy.Through the 42nd amendment, Parliament had amended Article 31C to expand its scope much beyond clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39 and in its place incorporated ""all or any principle laid down in Part IV - Directive Principles"". Minerva Mills judgment struck down this amendment restoring the shape of Article 31C to a position existing after the Kesavananda judgment.The question before the nine-judge bench was: ""Whether Article 31C (as upheld in Kesavananda Bharati) survives in the Constitution after the amendment to the provision by the 42nd amendment was struck down by this court in Minerva Mills?""Writing the majority opinion, the CJI said Parliament through 42nd amendment had intended to expand the immunity to laws incorporating provisions of directive principles and that it cannot be suggested that Parliament would have repealed the words ""the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of Article 39"" as originally existed in Article 31C.""After Minerva Mills invalidated Section 4 of the 42nd amendment, the composite legal effect of Section 4 is nullified and the unamended text of Article 31C stands revived,"" the bench said.""The text of the unamended Article 31C was challenged, and the first part of the Article was upheld by 13-judge decision in Kesavananda Bharati while the latter half of the Article was invalidated. Therefore, the first half of unamended Article 31C, which is the subject matter of the present controversy, was undoubtedly constitutional... We conclude that unamended Article 31C continues in force,"" it said.","The Supreme Court's nine-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud ruled that Article 31C of the Constitution continues to hold good.

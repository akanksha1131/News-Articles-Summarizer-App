But selecting 120 advocates on record, a special category of lawyers who pass a tough examination to be entitled to file cases in the SC, for seven teams was not an easy task.SCAORA vice-president Amit Sharma and secretary Nikhil Jai along with Nair knew the difficulties in financing the tournament as well as the seven teams that would participate.

Bangladesh wants fresh joint inspection of standoff fencing points; BSF doesn’t yield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-wants-fresh-joint-inspection-of-standoff-fencing-points-bsf-doesnt-yield/articleshow/118436466.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), at the Director General-level border coordination conference between BSF and BGB here, formally objected to construction of single-row fence (SRF) by the Border Security Force (BSF) within 150 yards of the Indo-Bangladesh border, seeking a fresh joint inspection “where there are issues” and renegotiation of the terms, including how close to the ‘zero line’ can the fence be built.“It has been requested that we do a joint inspection and joint record of discussion on the ground very elaborately so that the fencing or further progress can happen,” the BGB DG told media persons at a joint press conference with BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary after the conclusion of the biannual DG-level border talks here.BSF, however, has not agreed to any renegotiation of terms, which sources said are as per the joint record of discussions (JRD) already finalised in the past between BSF and BGB and duly ratified by the then Bangladesh govt. A senior official said the BSF stance is guided by the principle of continuity, which applies to bilateral pacts irrespective of the government in office in the signatory nations.BSF is erecting SRF at around 90 points along the Indo-Bangladesh border where fencing was found feasible only within 150 yards of the zero line, also known as “no man’s land”. Siddique on Thursday indicated the BGB’s request for a fresh joint inspection and joint record of discussion is based on the assessment that “proper mutual consenting is yet to be done or could be done in a better manner”.“How far back from the zero line the fence should be, was always a matter of discussion,” said the BGB DG.At the press conference, Siddique played down the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh post the regime change in August 2024, saying they were “an exaggeration of the media” and claiming that minorities were safe in his country. This comes days after the Indian ministry of external affairs told the Lok Sabha that there were reports of 23 Hindus having died and 152 incidents of attacks on Hindu temples in Bangladesh since the new regime took over.MEA informed the LS on Feb 7 that Dhaka, in a press release dated December 10, 2024, had announced that 88 cases relating to such attacks were registered, leading to the arrest of 70 people. had said subsequent police investigations verified 1,254 incidents. It also pointed to reports of 76 attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh between Nov 26, 2024 and Jan 25, 2025.The BGB DG, while claiming that “attacks on minorities (in Bangladesh) per se did not happen,” cited the “most peacefully organised” Durga Puja celebrations as proof. He said the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) were strictly tasked by the new regime in Dhaka to ensure that the Hindu community could observe the festival.“BGB jurisdiction is within 8 km of the international boundary, and BGB personally provided security at several puja pandals there,” he said while claiming that the attacks were not directed at minorities but linked to the “political problem” there. He said though there was some fear among minorities on the ground, the Bangladeshi LEAs and BGB could convince them against any need to migrate. He said the minorities were given security as requested in the couple of months following the regime change, and added that the offer of security stands if any threat is perceived in the future.BSF DG Chawdhary shared that cross-border infiltration had substantially reduced after August 5, the day Sheikh Hasina regime was unseated, with both BSF and BGB stepping up operational deployment.On BGB’s objections to killing of Bangladeshi miscreants trying to infiltrate into India under night cover, Chawdhary said the force strictly follows the protocol of graded escalation, using lethal force only as a last resort and with full restraint.","Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) formally objected to construction of single-row fence (SRF) by the Border Security Force (BSF) within 150 yards of the Indo- Bangladesh border.

Meet the Indian world champion who memorised 80 numbers in 13.5 seconds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-the-indian-world-champion-who-memorised-80-numbers-in-13-5-seconds/articleshow/118432579.cms,"How do you prepare for the Memory League World Championship?

What does your memory palace look like?

How much can these rooms hold?

Can you describe one of the challenges in Memory League World Championship?

Do you realise how amazing this is?

What's next?

In early Feb, Vishvaa Rajakumar , a 20-year-old Indian college student, won the Memory League World Championship , an online competition pitting people against one another with challenges like memorising the order of 80 random numbers faster than most people can tie a shoelace.Renowned neuroscientist Eleanor Maguire, who died in Jan, studied mental athletes like Rajakumar and found that many of them used the ancient Roman ""method of loci,"" a memorisation trick also known as the "" memory palace .""The technique takes several forms, but it generally involves visualising a large house and assigning memories to rooms. Mentally walking through the house fires up the hippocampus, the seahorse-shaped engine of memory deep in the brain that consumed Maguire's career.NYT asked Rajakumar about his strategies of memorisation. His answers:Hydration is very important because it helps your brain. When you memorise things, you usually sub-vocalise, and it helps to have a clear throat. Let's say you're reading a book. You're not reading it out loud, but you are vocalising within yourself. If you don't drink a lot of water, your speed will be a bit low. If you drink a lot of water, it will be more and more clear and you can read it faster.Let's say my first location is my room where I sleep. My second location is the kitchen. And the third location is my hall. The fourth location is my veranda. Another location is my bathroom. Let's say I am memorising a list of words. Let's say 10 words. What I do is, I take a pair of words, make a story out of them and place them in a location. And I take the next two words. I make a story out of them. I place them in the second location. The memory palace will help you to remember the sequence.A lot. Let's say I'm memorising 100 words. I'm making a story out of every two words. There will be a set of 50 stories. But I can't remember which one came first or which one came second. That would be a problem, right? So if I use the memory palace, I can remember which came first and which came second. So likewise, I can remember all of the 50 stories.They give you 80 random numbers that they display on a screen. You have to memorise all of those numbers as fast as possible, then click a button and a recall sheet appears. I wrote down all of the 80 digits - and I got them all right. My fastest time to memorise 80 random digits in World Championship was 13.5 seconds, so almost six digits per second.Yes, I do. I was crying.After completion of college, like in two to three months, I'll probably try to be a memory trainer and create a memory institution in India to teach other people these techniques. My goal is to make it big. NYT","Vishvaa Rajakumar, 20, won the Memory League World Championship.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers, sworn in on Thursday at a public function at Ramlila Maidan that was attended by PM Modi , Union ministers and many chief ministers, hit the ground running. Soon after a visit to the secretariat, the cabinet were on the Yamuna banks before convening for a meeting in the evening.The portfolios were announced at night. Among the key departments, Gupta will handle finance and revenue; Parvesh Verma PWD and water; Ashish Sood home, power, urban development and education; Manjinder Singh Sirsa industries and environment; Kapil Mishra law and justice; Dr Pankaj Kumar Singh health and transport; and Ravinder Indraj Singh social welfare.Vijender Gupta is likely to be the new Speaker.A hoarding of the CM and PM, positioned on opposite sides, served as the backdrop of the stage with 'Viksit Dilli Ka Shapath Samaroh' inscribed in the centre as lieutenant governor V K Saxena administered the oath to Gupta and her council of six ministers. She took the oath amid chants of ""Jai Shri Ram"" from a large crowd of party supporters.Sood incorporated his parents' names in the oath while Sirsa, a former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) member, delivered his oath in Punjabi. The audience enthusiastically applauded Kapil Mishra, a Brahmin from Poorvanchal, when he took the oath.The cabinet composition reflects a careful balance of regional and caste representation, including Pankaj Singh, who is a Thakur from Poorvanchal, Indraj, who is a representative of the Scheduled Castes, and the chief minister, who is a Bania.Gupta, Sood, Singh and Indraj are first-time MLAs.The choice of venue was politically significant as it had witnessed the Jan Lokpal protests by anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare which eventually gave birth to AAP. This was the place where Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet had been sworn in on Feb 14, 2015. Kejriwal had promised to rid the city of corruption and warned his party against ""ahankar"" (arrogance).Gupta, who became the fourth woman — and ninth overall — CM of the capital, offered prayers at Marghat Wale Hanuman Temple at Kashmere Gate before reaching the venue. She was followed in the swearing-in ceremony by New Delhi MLA Parvesh Verma who too drew enthusiastic cheers from the audience with some shouting, “Parvesh ji ko Jai Shri Ram”. Newly-elected MLAs Ashish Sood (Janakpuri), Dr Pankaj Singh (Vikaspuri), Manjinder Singh Sirsa (Rajouri Garden), Ravinder Indraj (Bawana) and Kapil Mishra (Karwal Nagar) followed.People had started gathering at the venue since early morning with many showing their support for Prime Minister Modi by wearing his masks and holding up his cutouts. Many were waving the Tricolour and party flags. A band performed patriotic and devotional melodies like ""Ram Aayenge to angna sajaenge"" and ""Aai watan"".Union home minister Amit Shah was among the first senior leaders to reach the venue, followed by BJP national president JP Nadda and Rajasthan chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma. The loudest cheers were, of course, for Modi when he entered the stage with ministers, NDA leaders and others on the stage standing up to greet him. The PM and CM exchanged greetings with Gupta wearing a broad smile. Several women who have worked with Gupta in the party’s women’s wing had turned up in large groups to show their support to the chief minister.The event was also attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The stage was a showcase of NDA unity with Bihar deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha, Rajasthan deputy CM Prem Chand Bairwa, Goa CM Pramod Sawant, Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu, Haryana CM Naib Singh Saini and Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Lal Yadav also present on the stage.Spiritual leaders were also put centre stage at the event that concluded with the national anthem.Rajya Sabha MP from the Aam Aadmi Party, Swati Maliwal, whose relationship with the party turned bitter in recent times, and Congress’s Delhi president Devender Yadav were the only representatives of the Opposition.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi conveyed his best wishes to Rekha Gupta on X. “Congratulations to Smt Rekha Gupta ji on taking oath as Delhi’s chief minister. She rose from the grassroots, being active in campus politics, state organisation, municipal administration, and now MLA as well as chief minister. I am confident she will work for Delhi’s development with full vigour. My best wishes to her for a fruitful tenure.”",Chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers were sworn in on Thursday at a public function at Ramlila Maidan.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday went hammer and tongs at the Congress party after US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"".Hours after Trump criticised the Biden dispensation's decision to disburse $21 million towards "" voter turnout efforts "" in India, the BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.During the poll campaign in the summer elections last year, PM Modi was seen lashing out at the Congress over the ""external influence"".""Nowadays influential people around the world have united to remove Modi but there is the blessing of(women power)(maternal power)... it's yourprotective shield) that Modi keeps working despite facing challenges,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur in April ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In another rally at Chhattisgarh's Sarguja, PM Modi said: ""Congresspeople and some influential people in the world lose their cool...if India grows in power, it would spoil the game of some influential people. Today, if India becomes self-reliant...some influential people would lose their jobs.""""Therefore, they want a weak government of Congress and the INDI alliance. The government with issues of infighting, which practices corruption. The history of Congress suggests that can destroy the nation for the greed of power,"" he added.In a television interview PM Modi said: ""The entire world trying to influence India's election, which they shouldn't do. They aren't giving their opinion or comment but influencing it. But they won't be able to influence it.""Further accusing Rahul Gandhi of ""urging foreign powers to intervene in India’s internal affairs"", BJP shared a clip from his visit to London in 2023 and said: ""He has aligned himself with global networks seeking to undermine India’s strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies.""Earlier, Trump once again questioned the United States' decision to allocate $21 million for voter turnout efforts in India. Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, he said, ""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.""""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also attacked the Congress party for ""resorting to conspiracies"" and ""maligning India's democracy"".""When people don’t vote for them (Congress), they resort to conspiracies, using foreign money to influence India’s elections. They malign India’s democracy, and we strongly condemn this. This blatant attempt at foreign interference in India’s democratic process is a matter of great shame,"" Prasad said.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Trump's statement a ""smoking gun"" which ""exposes"" the dangerous role of a foreign hand.""President Trump's statement is a smoking gun which shockingly exposes the dangerous role of a foreign hand interfering and influencing the outcome of the Indian elections, but the million dollar question, rather the 21 million dollar question, is which were the Indian hands who were at cahoots with the foreign hands, receiving foreign funds to undermine Indian's democracy and destabilise India's statement..."" said BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan.On Wednesday, Trump also questioned the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that New Delhi is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"".This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.","US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"" The BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.

We will promote biodiversity along Yamuna’s banks by creating green corridors, wetlands and riverbank buffer zones

We will ensure zero industrial emissions into the Yamuna

We will organise an annual Yamuna Festival

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers on Thursday hit the ground running with focus on ""Maa Yamuna."" The chief minister attended a grand ""Yamuna Aarti"" on Vasudev ghat before chairing her first cabinet meeting which announced implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme - one of the key poll promises made by BJP to the people of Delhi during elections.That ""clean Yamuna project"" was important for the BJP was evident from the fact that the process to start cleaning the river had started even before the government was formed. ""We want to make Maa Yamuna clean and free-flowing. This marks the beginning of the BJP's commitment,"" party's Delhi unit chief Virendra Sachdeva had said emphasising the government's dedication.Yamuna pollution has been one of the key election issues in Delhi for long. When Arvind Kejriwal became the chief minister in 2015 with a massive mandate, he promised to clean the Yamuna in 5 years. Ironically, ten years into power, he did little and in 2025 the people of Delhi turned to the BJP which promised a slew of measures in its manifesto to restore the lost glory of Yamuna river A month back, when the campaigning for assembly elections was at its peak, Kejriwal, who failed to live up to his promise of cleaning the Yamuna, added a completely new dimension to the Yamuna politics. The AAP chief accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna water that comes to Delhi.""BJP's Haryana government has poisoned the water in Yamuna. If this water would have entered Delhi only to be mixed with the drinking water, many people would have died in Delhi. It would have caused mass genocide,"" the former Delhi chief minister had then alleged.""A few countries use biological weapons to poison river water. But, the same has been done by the BJP government. They have done this to create chaos in Delhi so that the people of Delhi die and the blame comes on AAP. I want to tell BJP to not stoop this low,"" he also added.Clearly, this was an extreme which took everyone, even the people of Delhi, by surprise. BJP leader and former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar claimed that Kejriwal's posioned water statement cost him very dear in elections. ""If he had not made such a statement, his party would have won 5-7 seats more,"" Khattar asserted, adding ""More than 40 per cent of Delhi's residents are from Haryana. This statement insulted people of Haryana and Delhi both.""Well, it would be difficult to quantify the extent of loss that the poison attack caused, one thing is sure that the people of Delhi did not buy the theory as the results showed.Interestingly, Arvind Kejriwal had also performed Yamuna Aarti at Gita ghat in November 2015 after becoming the chief minister to mark the beginning of his promise to clean the river. However, 10 years down the line Yamuna pollution was one of the key factors that led to his defeat. The BJP realises the importance of Yamuna in capital politics and that perhaps explains why Rekha Gupta did not want to miss the opportunity of sending out a strong message to people of Delhi on Day 1.","Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers on Thursday hit the ground running with focus on ""Maa Yamuna"" The chief minister attended a grand ""Yamuna Aarti"" on Vasudev ghat before chairing her first cabinet meeting which announced implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118426791,imgsize-1567485,width-400,resizemode-4/118426791.jpg"

Back to the 60s? Congress mulls making district units great again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/back-to-the-60s-congress-mulls-making-district-units-great-again/articleshow/118430292.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Adopting a back-to-basics approach in the face of prolonged political slump, Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units, the building blocks of the party organisation which have been marginalised in the recent decades.Sources said the idea of reorganising the party around District Congress Committees (DCCs) was discussed in the Wednesday meeting of the party brass, with office-bearers managing state units. While president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi are learnt to have spoken about focusing on district units, ranging from strengthening its structure to promoting loyal workers, sources said the future decision on the issue may revolve around giving greater importance to DCCs.Sources said the party may make district units crucial in selection of candidates for elections. While the present process involves recommendations starting from DCCs and then moving to state units and then to the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the leadership believes there is greater centralisation, with marginalisation of the first recommending authority. Some said the party was organised around the districts in the 1960s, before the shift towards the AICC happened. Also, the leadership of district units may get greater say in strategy and campaign, with the party building on their inputs. While Congress mulls returning the political primacy to districts, the lesson has been learnt at a big cost. As an insider said, the party did not have its DCCs constituted in Haryana for over seven years, a key reason behind the failure to manage better in the recent assembly elections. The same has been true for many other states.""The idea is to give greater responsibility, along with accountability, to DCCs in decision making,"" a party manager said.With the recent assembly defeats providing a reality check to Congress after the euphoria of Lok Sabha results in which the opposition did better than expected, Rahul has urged the states' managers to strategise better to take on the resource-rich BJP. Sources said he warned that the party had become predictable, which was providing an advantage to the rivals. Rahul is said to have stressed the importance of being unpredictable, citing the example of Bharat Jodo Yatra, and urged them to come up with out-of-the-box ideas in states. The importance of unpredictability was likened by a neta to that of Shivaji's guerrilla warfare.",Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units.

In a letter addressed to residents of both the Valley and Hills, Bhalla called for an end to hostilities and a return to normalcy.He appealed particularly to the youth, urging them to voluntarily return looted or illegally possessed weapons to the nearest police station, security outpost, or camp. ""Your single act of returning these weapons can be a powerful gesture towards ensuring peace. I want to assure you that no punitive action would be initiated if such weapons are returned within the stipulated time. Thereafter, strict action will be taken for possession of such weapons,"" he warned.""People of Manipur, both in Valley and Hills, have suffered immense hardship for the last over 20 months due to a series of unfortunate incidents affecting peace and communal harmony. In the greater interest of restoring normalcy, so that people can return to their normal day-to-day activities, all communities in the State must come forward to ensure cessation of hostilities and maintenance of peace & order in the society,"" the governor said.The ultimatum comes amid ongoing violence and security operations in Manipur, where security forces have been conducting widespread crackdowns on militant groups. In recent operations, authorities have arrested multiple militants, including members of the United Kuki National Army and the banned Kangleipak Communist Party.Over the last two days, security forces seized a significant cache of arms and ammunition, including rifles, pistols, grenades, and mortars, from various districts. The rising stockpiling of illegal weapons has been a major concern for authorities, leading to repeated calls for disarmament.The imposition of President’s Rule in Manipur on February 13 has further intensified security measures in the state. The decision came following the resignation of chief minister N Biren Singh, who stepped down amid prolonged ethnic violence that has claimed over 250 lives since May 2023. The state government had earlier withdrawn from the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement with the Kuki National Army and other armed groups, leading to renewed clashes.The Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a Meitei civil society group, criticised the move as ""undemocratic"" and an attempt to destabilise the state further. In contrast, the Kuki Inpi, the apex body of Kuki tribes, welcomed it as a ""necessary intervention"" and reiterated their demand for a separate administration under Article 239(A) of the Constitution."," Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla issued an ultimatum to the people of the state urging them to surrender illegally held weapons.

Why it's good to be a first-time MLA in BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-its-good-to-be-a-first-time-mla-in-bjp/articleshow/118419086.cms,"From left - Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel, Delhi CM Rakhi Gupta and Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on several occasions, has given reasons to believe that it is good to be a first-time MLA in assembly elections. Picking dark horses over front runners has been a consistent strategy by the BJP's top brass while choosing chief ministerial face in states the party has won, particularly after 2014.The BJP's first bet on a first-timer for the chief ministerial post was in 2014 when the party chose Manohar Lal Khattar to serve Haryana as CM.In 2014, Khattar was a first-time MLA, an unknown face in the state's politics who had surprised everyone by being handed the top post after BJP won 47 seats in the assembly election.Associated with the Rashtriya Swamsevak Sangh (RSS) for over four decades and BJP for 20 years, Khattar had worked as the organising secretary of BJP in Haryana and established his reputation as a key strategist for the party in the state.Khattar had worked closely with the PM when the latter was BJP in charge of Haryana in 1996. When Modi was contesting from Varanasi in the 2014 general elections, Khattar was in charge of 50 wards in the constituency.His ability to align and consolidate the non-Jat voters in favour of the BJP endeared him to the party even as the Jat community, which dominated the Haryana politics for a long period, strongly resented the BJP for reasons such as farming issues and Jat quota agitation.Another such surprise move by the party came in 2024 when it picked Bhajan Lal Sharma the chief minister of Rajasthan.Bhajan Lal Sharma, a general secretary in the BJP's state unit and a first-time MLA from Jaipur's Sanganer constituency, kept a low profile in the party before his sudden rise to the top post.Interestingly, when a group photo was taken at the BJP office ahead of the legislature party meeting, the photo showed Bhajan Lal Sharma in the very last row. However, during the Rajasthan legislature party meet Bhajan Lal was announced as the leader.Considered a hardcore RSS man, Sharma was actively involved in the agitation for the Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where the Babri mosque stood. In 1992, he spent time in jail for this. That was around the beginning of his political career. Over the past 30 years, Sharma had held various posts in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) and in the party organisation.The list of first-timers becoming CM only got longer on Wednesday when the BJP's top leadership backed Rekha Gupta for the Delhi CM post over Parvesh Verma who defeated Ex-Delhi CM Kejriwal in assembly elections.Rekha Gupta rose through the ranks of the RSS-affiliated outfit Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. She has held key positions in government and the party.Gupta's political journey began in DUSU, in which she served as secretary in 1995-96, before winning the president's post in 1996-97 as an ABVP candidate. Her trajectory mirrors BJP's strategy of grooming leaders from grassroots movements.In a political purge that was seen as BJP's most audacious experiment, the party in 2021 replaced all 22 ministers from the erstwhile Vijay Rupani cabinet. The tsunami of transformation capped a frenetic six days for the state, starting with Rupani’s sudden resignation as CM. More surprising was the elevation of first-time MLA Bhupendra Patel to the chief ministership.Unanimously elected as the BJP legislature party leader, Bhupendra Patel made his way up in the state politics from the municipality level. His name was floated by outgoing CM Vijay Rupani himself.Fondly called 'Dada' by many, Patel (59) had contested his maiden assembly election from Ghatlodia constituency in Ahmedabad in 2017 and won it by a margin of over 1.17 lakh votes, which was a record during that election.BJP's move to pick CM face is not restricted to only MLAs, the party gave top post responsibility to Yogi Adityanath, who was MP from Gorakhpur, to serve as Uttar Pradesh CM in 2017.When it comes to selecting chief ministers, the BJP's script has been the same - state after state. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana - all these BJP-ruled states have chief ministers who were relatively unknown figures in the party till they were picked to lead the state.The heavyweights and the frontrunners in these states lost the race to the top post. This also helps the BJP in delivering the message that a grassroots leader with an apolitical backdrop can reach the helm of electoral politics.",Picking dark horses over front runners has been a consistent strategy by the BJP's top brass. The BJP's first bet on a first-timer for the chief ministerial post was in 2014 when the party chose Manohar Lal Khattar to serve Haryana as CM. Another such surprise move by the party came in 2024 when it picked Bhajan Lal Sharma the chief minister of Rajasthan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118422608,imgsize-1577912,width-400,resizemode-4/118422608.jpg"

They defame India's democracy, and we strongly condemn it,"" said senior BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad at a press conference.Prasad said Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly called for foreign interference in India's democratic processes. President Trump's confirmation of such funding has validated the assistance Rahul Gandhi was receiving, he said. Prasad condemned Congress's actions as utterly shameful and anti-national.""Donald Trump's public statement clearly established that they used to cry for foreign help in Indian elections because he was not getting votes,"" Prasad said and added, ""Rahul Gandhi has questioned why other democracies were not concerned about so-called attacks on democracy in India.

Mohan Yadav

TOI’s Akhilesh Singh

Prasenjit Mund

PM Narendra Modi has spoken of turning India into a $5 trillion economy. What would be MP’s contribution to it?

Where do you see MP tomorrow in terms of industry?

Investment promises are part of every such summit. How will you ensure that plans turn into reality?

What are your plans to decentralise development and take it to small towns and villages?

What inspired you to personally tour cities and hardsell Madhya Pradesh as an investment destination?

Madhya Pradesh won seven Krishi Karman Awards. Do you see the state winning industry accolades too?

How will you convince industrialists about MP’s ease of doing business?

MP has had political stability for a long time, and this is a major area of operation for BJP and RSS. Do you see this as an opportunity or a challenge?

‘Double-engine govt’ is a much talked about phrase. How has it benefited Madhya Pradesh?

What is the status of MP’s river-linking projects?

Your govt has banned liquor at 19 religious sites and you said this was the first step. Is your govt working towards prohibition, and if so, is there a timeline?

Will you move in the same direction?

If you had to pick the top three industrial sectors as ones with the biggest potential for MP’s growth, which would they be?

Would you be willing to reduce power tariffs for industries?

Congress was once strong here, but has been weakened drastically. Don’t you think a weak opposition is not healthy for a democracy?

Congress is facing consequences of its ‘own karma’, saidin an exclusive interview withand. Criticising the opposition for its devotion to a single family, he suggests it should have democratised its structure instead. Ahead of hosting an investment summit in Bhopal, Yadav exuded confidence in the state’s turnaround■ We are working on PM Modi’s vision and aligning our work in the same direction. We aim to double our economy in 5 years. MP’s success will be counted in India’s growth story. PM Modi has said that India will be the third largest economy in the world. That can be possible only when every state contributes to achieving the vision. Our aim is to exceed expectations. We will keep striving towards this.■ We want to make MP the No. 1 state in the country. Our state has the potential and it has everything going for it. All that we need to do is to make the most of opportunities in the best interests of the state and our people. It’s not a one-day job. We have to persist with long-term vision and long-term goals. By tapping MP’s potential and bringing more investment, we want to stop the brain drain from the state. Bright youngsters from MP are leaving the state to work in other cities or abroad. We will ensure that they get enough opportunities here so that they can contribute to their home state’s growth.■ Earlier, things were limited to speeches and talk. We decided to work. We created new policies, tailormade for specific sectors, and threw open the state to investors. They will come only when they see the state has the wherewithal and the determination to keep its word. We know that it won’t work if we do this once and sit back. We have been at it. We held regional conclaves. I went out and held business meetings in India and abroad. When you do it every month, it becomes a part of work culture and becomes part of a system. It picks up momentum. Since we are present at so many platforms, we keep meeting industrialists. If someone promises an investment, they will keep running into us somewhere or the other and the project will, of course, come alive.■ Every region of Madhya Pradesh must grow and develop, which is why our plans encompass the entire state. Every district is unique, it has its own set of potentials and possibilities. The districts that are rich in minerals, can excel in mining. Where agriculture is bountiful, there can be farmbased growth. Spiritual sites have their inherent, almost autonomous economy of religious tourism. This, too, will grow in a big way. MP has tremendous potential in forests and wildlife tourism. We will augment infrastructure to make it even bigger. After all, we have cheetahs and the brand of ‘Tiger State’. Where roads and railway tracks are needed, we are taking care of it. We look at the needs of today and tomorrow, and are flexible in our approach. For instance, BRTS was adversely affecting Bhopal traffic, so we had it removed. What was yesterday’s need is past. We are planning for the future. And we are taking decisions swiftly. There is a big advantage in that.■ I learnt from PM Modi that when you sit in a position of responsibility, if you don’t project your vision and immerse yourself entirely in the effort to achieve it, you will not succeed. When I was chairman of tourism corporation, I followed this rule for myself. Until the seed ends its own existence, no new plant can grow. If one has a vision, one has to also lead the way. My presence makes a difference at such meets. I believe it imbibes faith and trust in the minds of investors. Besides, God’s blessings also come my way for the hard work.■ We are already winning awards. We have got a wards in mining, tourism and education. We are one of the fastest growing economies in the country. Our GDP in the 2023- 24 fiscal grew by nearly 9.4%. We have even been awarded for good governance. Our revenue reforms have been well appreciated. We are No. 1 in agriculture, and we will soon be known as an industry powerhouse.■ We have simplified the application and approval process. What took 28 permissions earlier, now requires only 10. Our intention is that when an investor thinks of coming to MP, they will have already made up their minds because of the environment they will get here. When an investor comes to us with a proposal, our aim is to give him all the clearances in 28 days, maximum. Earlier, it used to stretch on for six months to even a year. They would grow frustrated from the uncertainty. We have made things simpler.■ We gain a lot from the strength of our organisation. We work like a family. Our work happens not because of someone’s post or designation but from a meeting of minds. It’s an administrative necessity that I am chief minister, otherwise there are so many veteran leaders, more senior to me, who we respect and work with perfect understanding.■ Oh, we benefit greatly from it. We don’t have to even think twice on so many issues. Take GST. We get around Rs 1.25 lakh crore from the Centre on this account. If it wasn’t PM Modi’s sarkar, we couldn’t even think of so much funds, that too on time. In Ken-Betwa river-linking project — the first of its kind in the world — or the project to link Parbati, Kalisindh and Chambal (PKC) rivers, we are getting Rs 75,000 crore. We only have to pitch in with 10% of the project cost, 90% comes from the Centre. This is the power of ‘double engine’.■ Projects dragged on for 20 years but now Bhoomi-pujan has been performed and tenders have been issued. There’s a new culture that has developed under PM Modi. States used to fight with each other earlier whereas there should be solidarity. After all, we are part of the same country. Now we are working closely with Uttar Pradesh not only on this but also sharing solar energy. In PKC river-linking, 13 districts each in Rajasthan and MP will benefit. Our relations with Rajasthan are great. We have another major project on Tapti river with Maharashtra. The aim should be to find common ground and a way to work in tandem for the betterment of people. All this is possible because of double-engine sarkar.■ At many places in MP, we had haphazard liquor bans. I said liquor should be banned completely in religious places. No half measures. Like Ujjain, liquor was prohibited in only 1km periphery. I extended it to the entire corporation area. So too with Omkareshwar, Datia, Orchha, Panna… If it’s a panchayat, nagar parishad or municipality, the entire area will be freed of liquor.■ Who has seen the future?■ I can name 13. We are very strong in energy sector, in all three forms – thermal, pump-storage hydroelectricity, which is big these days, and renewable energy. We are doing a lot of good work in solar and wind energy. Electricity from MP is powering the Delhi Metro. We sell power at the cheapest rates — solar at just Rs 2.10 per unit, where the rest of the country is selling it for Rs 4. We are doing a service to the nation. Similarly, mining sector is huge for us. We have diamonds. And now even gold mines. We are a mineral-rich state. Agriculture has tremendous potential, of course. We aim to turn into a powerhouse in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Pharma firms are lining up to come to MP. Our policies for start-ups and semiconductors are proving to be very attractive. Tourism is one of our strengths. We will do even better in this sector. We are the first in the country to launch air ambulance.■ We are giving industries so much benefit here, too. We encourage them to set up captive power plants.■ For that, Congress has to first believe in ‘lok-tantra’ (democracy). Congress believes in ‘parivar-tantra’ (dynastic politics). Four generations ruled after Independence, like Raja-Maharaja. Congress should think about it. BJP believes in a strong democracy. This is why no one from PM Narendra Modi’s family is no CM. No one from my family has ever been an MLA, minister or CM. It’s the same with Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal and Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi. There is a long line of such leaders. We are flag-bearers of lok-tantra. Congress is paying a heavy price for it. It cannot shake off ‘parivarwaad’, which is why people are distancing themselves from it.",Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav speaks to TOI's Akhilesh Singh and Prasenjit Mund.

Obviously, after the amended regulations came into effect, if any candidate chose to obtain admission in a foreign institution for pursuing a course leading to a primary medical qualification, they cannot seek for an exemption from the regulations.. This does not restrict their right to practice anywhere outside India.""""The regulations, especially additional mandate to satisfy the eligibility criteria, is not ultra vires the Constitution and neither is it in conflict with any provisions of the Act (Indian Medical Council Act) nor arbitrary or unreasonable.

HC upholds life term for 4 tied to Maoist ambush,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-upholds-life-term-for-4-tied-to-maoist-ambush/articleshow/118430172.cms,"RAIPUR: Maoists ambushes are a grave threat to national security , Chhattisgarh HC has said, and upheld the life imprisonment of four men convicted for a 2014 ambush that resulted in the deaths of 15 security personnel and four civilians.The ambush occurred on March 11, 2014, near Tahakwara village, barely 4km from Tongpal police station in Bastar and 390km from Raipur. A road opening party (ROP) of CRPF and state police was targeted by 150-200 Maoists of Darbha Division led by Surendra, Deva, Vinod. The insurgents inflicted heavy casualties and looted six AK-47 rifles, an Insas LMG, eight Insas rifles, and two SLRs.Some suspects were arrested during probe and four of them - Kawasi Joga alias Pada, Dayaram Baghel alias Ramesh Anna, Maniram Korram alias Boti and Mahadev Nag - were sentenced to life imprisonment by an NIA court on Feb 12, 2024. They filed an appeal in HC.A division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Ravindra Kumar Agrawal said that these attacks are ""not isolated criminal acts but part of a larger, well-orchestrated insurgency aimed at destabilising the state and undermining democratic institutions"".The court highlighted the pre-planned nature of the ambush, the use of sophisticated tactics and weaponry, and the intent to inflict maximum casualties. ""These attacks are pre-planned, highly organised, and politically motivated, making them far more dangerous than common crimes,"" the court observed.Such cases are difficult to prosecute due to challenges in identifying and apprehending naxalites, and the reluctance of villagers to testify due to fear of reprisal, HC noted, adding that circumstantial evidence, coupled with witness testimonies and recovery of arms and explosives, can be sufficient for conviction.In this case, the court relied on testimonies of several witnesses, including some former Maoists, to establish the presence and involvement of the accused at meetings where the ambush was planned. The court also considered disclosure statements of the accused and recovery of incriminating materials. The court dismissed the appeals of the Maoists and confirmed the order of the NIA court.","The ambush occurred on March 11, 2014, near Tahakwara village, barely 4km from Tongpal police station in Bastar.

The need, therefore, is a judicious use of taking action under the (Prevention of Corruption) Act. Care should be taken that honest and fearless judges are not harassed.

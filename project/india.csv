India opposes EU plan for border tax on carbon-intensive goods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-opposes-eu-plan-for-border-tax-on-carbon-intensive-goods/articleshow/115433158.cms,"BAKU: With COP29 negotiations entering second week, India Monday opposed any unilateral trade barrier and pitched for “four important aspects of global climate action”, saying the ambitious, action-oriented approach hinges on bold actions from countries (developed nations whose high historical emissions led to climate change) obligated to lead economy-wide emission reductions.In a clear reference to EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), New Delhi pointed out how some countries are shifting to “unilateral measures” resulting in shifting of financial burden of mitigation actions to developing nations. CBAM is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on carbon intensive goods, like iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that are entering EU. Once it is implemented from 2026, it will put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries, including India and China, and impact their trade.“There is a need to recognise the negative impacts on developing nations due to such unilateral trade measures in the context of climate change,” said India’s environment secretary and deputy leader of the country’s delegation, Leena Nandan, while intervening during the high-level ministerial roundtable on pre-2030 ambition.The four aspects of global climate action highlighted by India include the need for scaling up innovative actions through “barrier and restrictions free” technology transfer; climate finance for enabling and implementing climate actions; enhancing international cooperation; and mutual trust.India also underlined that the developing nations should not be burdened with the rich nations’ failures on their pre-2020 mitigation targets, and developed countries should not put Intellectual Property Rights barriers to scal ing and transfer of technologies to the developing nations.“New technologies and solutions are needed to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, innovation in areas like clean energy, carbon removal, etc, is still in early stages and there are barriers to scaling and transfer to the developing nations,” said the environment secretary.Putting the responsibility of making COP29 a success on rich nations, Nandan said it is an opportunity for the developed countries to foster trust and realise important milestones in climate ambitions by 2030. “Achieving net-zero by the developed countries would set the foundation for a more sustainable and resilient world in this critical decade and the decades to come,” she said.On a critical issue of finance which is considered as the core of the ongoing negotiation process, the secretary said, “COP29 is a milestone COP for climate finance. It should ensure the long pending commitments from developed nations for providing substantial financial resources are made and that such climate finance is equitable and accessible.”",India opposed any unilateral trade barrier and pitched for ‘four important aspects of global climate action’ New Delhi pointed out how some countries are shifting to ‘unilateral measures’ resulting in shifting of financial burden of mitigation actions to developing nations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115433155,imgsize-1018580,width-400,resizemode-4/115433155.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In its first action of this kind against a social media platform, Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday ordered WhatsApp to stop sharing user data with other companies within the fold of its parent Meta, which has been slapped a fine of Rs 213 crore for abusing its “dominant position” following changes to the messaging platform's privacy policy in 2021.WhatsApp, which can challenge the order, has been directed to change its policies and ensure users are given the choice to opt out of the datasharing arrangement. It has also been asked to give users an option — through a prominent tab — to review and modify their choice.“The commission has concluded the 2021 policy update by WhatsApp on a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ basis constitutes an imposition of unfair condition under the (Competition) Act, as it compels all users to accept expanded data collection terms & sharing of data within Meta Group without any opt out,” CCI said in a statement.Three years ago, WhatsApp, the dominant player among over-the-top (OTT) messaging platforms in the country, changed its 2016 policy on sharing data with Facebook, and removed the earlier option to opt out.CCI said that the updated privacy policy was an abuse of dominant position by Meta, given its network effects, and lack of effective alternatives.It also said that sharing of WhatsApp user data by the social media giant — whose offerings include the hugely popular Facebook and Instagram — for purposes other than providing the messaging platform’s services created an entry barrier for rivals, denying them access to the market for display advertisements.Over the years, WhatsApp has argued that messages on its platform were encrypted and it denied access to govts even in cases of crises or law and order situations, but the CCI probe indicates that certain user information was being used to throw up ads while using Facebook.The watchdog concluded further violations of the Competition Act as Meta was leveraging its dominant position among OTT messaging apps through smartphones to protect its hold over the online display advertising market.Earlier, CCI imposed penalty on Google in two cases, Rs 1,300 crore related to anti-competitive practices related to Android phones & Rs 936 crore for Play Store-related policies.",Competition Commission of India (CCI) orders WhatsApp to stop sharing user data with other companies within the fold of its parent Meta.

Severe Air Quality Alert in Punjab: Visibility Drops to Zero Amid Smog and Fog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/severe-air-quality-alert-in-punjab-visibility-drops-to-zero-amid-smog-and-fog/articleshow/115346589.cms,"We also published the following articles recently

Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers as smog reduces visibility

Despite Delhi's air quality index (AQI) hitting a severe level of 428, Delhi Airport assures passengers that flight operations remain normal. Low visibility procedures are in effect, and travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight updates. The India Meteorological Department predicts stronger winds will improve air quality to a 'very poor' level.

Watch: Ghazipur landfill vanishes! Season's first fog deepens smog in Delhi, lowering visibility

Delhi woke to its first thick fog of the season, reducing visibility to zero in some areas and shrouding landmarks like the Ghazipur landfill. This severely impacted air travel, with flights diverted from Delhi Airport due to near-zero visibility. The fog also aggravated respiratory issues for residents already grappling with 'severe' air quality, as reported by the IMD and CPCB.

BATHINDA: There was little respite in air quality in Punjab on Friday as compared to the previous day — amid visibility at the lowest ebb — even as smog and fog remained comparatively for less time in the morning.The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for fog on Saturday.Though it was less hazy than Thursday, the sun was not visible throughout the day.For most part of the day, the AQI stayed under the ‘poor’ category and ‘moderate’ at times.Zero visibility was recorded at Amritsar and Chandigarh airports till 8.30 am.The visibility was recorded at 10 metres in Patiala, 50 metres in Halwara and Faridkot, 100 metres in Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Ludhiana.The worsening air quality is forcing people to remain indoors which is also impacting the election campaigning in Barnala and Gidderbaha.A number of functionaries, belonging to different political parties, said they had to reach out to people at their doorsteps or business establishments with very few people attending public meetings amid worsening air quality.The activity time in the day has shortened as the day starts after 9am and thick smog or fog starts descending early in the evening especially in the rural and outer areas.Advisories have been issued asking older people to avoid venturing out.Commuters have been asked to travel during the day and reach their destinations early in the evening.","Air quality index (AQI) hits a severe level of 428 in Delhi.

Why some families are returning adopted kids in Tamil Nadu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/why-some-families-are-returning-adopted-kids-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/115363248.cms,"As soon as they heard from the nursing home that their surrogate had delivered a healthy baby, the adoptive parents (name withheld) informed the adoption agency of their decision to return the 8and 10-year-old siblings they had adopted a few months earlier. The children, who are now back in the adoption home, will be counselled for foster care or placement in a govt home where they may grow up as orphans.Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies for different reasons. Four parents quoted “adjustment issues” as a reason for returning children. While one parent thought the toddler did not make enough eye contact during conversation another felt the child had anger issues. Some parents quoted marital or financial problems within the family, and others cited the child’s poor health. In one case it was the death of a parent. Officials confirmed that while three of them have been re-adopted, one is in foster care and the remaining still in govt homes.The social welfare department has recorded three dissolutions of adoption in 2020, four in 2021 and five in 2023. Protocols , however, are now being implemented to ensure they don’t happen again. “We counsel parents at least twice to see if we can help them retain the child. In some cases, we know parents may not have a choice. The adoption process is then dissolved to declare the adoption void,” says social welfare secretary Jayashree Muralidharan .An authorised agency applies for dissolution to the district magistrate through the district child protection unit. Once the process is completed, the child is back on the list of those “legally free” for adoption. “Considering the long wait list, most children get another chance quickly,” says Muralidharan . “In general, most adoptions are successful. Dissolutions, however, have become unavoidable due to various reasons in some cases.”Psychiatrists say parents who surrender adopted children cannot be villainised as they are seeing a rise in “adaptive challenges” for different reasons. First, as adopted children identified with early stressful childhood, many parents seek consultations for “behaviour issues” after complaints from siblings, neighbours and schools. “It’s tough on the child as well as the parent. Until some years ago, most adoptions happened within the family. A couple who do not have children will adopt their nephews or nieces, or from families known to them. The joint family system monitored the upbringing of the adopted child,” says child psychiatrist Dr V Jayanthini.Today, information about biological parents is unknown in most cases, she says. “Mothers may not have had a happy pregnancy period. They may have neglected their diet and medical care, resulting in little bonding between the mother and the child after birth. All this can be stressful for the child. When they come to new homes the process of adapting themselves may add to this stress. While in many cases they tend to settle in with love and care, some children and parents just don’t get along.”In such cases, children show pat terns of uncooperative and defiant behaviour (disruptive disorder), or they are always angry, irritable, argumentative or defiant (oppositional defiant disorder) or may express disregard for others (conduct disorders). In some cases, children may be diagnosed with neurodevelopment disorders such as autism. “I have seen such children in my clinics. They show less interest in education, pick up habits such as use of tobacco and alcohol in early teens. Some are at risk of self-harm too,” she says.Genetics also plays a role. Studies have shown adoptees have a small but known risk for depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, says psychiatrist Dr R Thara, vice-chairman of Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF). “It is not easy for parents to return the child too. We have seen cases where they do after making several attempts to build the family,” she says.The social welfare department says it ensures all adoptive parents return the child without legal battles. “Our focus is on the child. The child should not feel unwanted or grow up in a place where he or she is not loved enough,” says Muralidharan.Every year, about 400 children are adopted from nearly 4,000 waiting at homes authorised by Child Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) in Tamil Nadu. “The average waiting time for parents is three to five years,” says a caretaker at an adoption home. Every resident Indian prospective adoptive parent (PAP), who intends to adopt a child must register online in the Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System by applying in a prescribed format with relevant documents. “It is an intensive process. There is a home study report to evaluate parents,” says a govt social worker.The physical and mental health conditions of the parents are evaluated as a part of the pre-adoption checklist. The govt also ensures adoptive parents are financially capable and have not been convicted in criminal cases. “There are stringent age regulations,” says the social worker. While couples must be married at least for two years, single men are allowed to adopt only boys. The age of the child allotted to a parent depends on the composite age of the parent. For instance, to adopt a child less than two years of age, the composite age of the parent must be 85 years and for children between two and four composite ages of parents must be 90 years.Parents also get to see three children before they make a choice. “They may reject children who are unhealthy or disabled. Sometimes parents feel the child does not resemble them. If they don’t choose to be shown three options, they may go behind in the waiting list,” says a social welfare official.Experts feel the state must consider introducing changes to bring down cases of dissolution. For instance, Dr Thara says it is important to screen children before giving them up for adoption. “Screening should include a detailed history such as heart disease, epilepsy and diabetes in the family so that they can be detected early and treated. A proper history of mental health conditions such as alcoholism, personality issues, and schizophrenia in the family is equally critical for the new families to be vigilant about symptoms. Disparity in educational and socio-economic status can also make the child uneasy and maladjusted,” she says. This may be difficult to do as the state may often have very little family history about abandoned or surrendered children. “So, those sent for read option must have details of the problems faced by the first adoptive parents. This is to ensure children do go through trauma again and parents know what they are going to face,” says Dr Thara.","Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies.

The commission has now withdrawn exemptions for construction activities in public infrastructure projects. The restrictions include prohibiting non-emergency trucks and non-BS 6 compliant light commercial vehicles from entering Delhi, alongside BS-4 and older diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles.Authorities predict continued poor air quality due to heavy fog and unfavourable weather conditions. CAQM indicates the likelihood of AQI remaining in the severe/severe+ category. CAQM has advised governments to consider 50% office attendance and implement work-from-home policies.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, “This is happening because of the combined impact of the deepening of winter inversion and trapping of high local and regional pollution. We need urgent measures to slow down further loading of pollution from the key sources.”The Decision Support System indicated that stubble burning activities contributed to 25.2% of Delhi's PM2.5 levels on that particular day.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has imposed GRAP Stage 4 in Delhi NCR from 8 am today, after the Air Quality Index (AQI) reached to ‘severe plus’ category.

NEW DELHI: After a 15-year gap, India has reclaimed its position as the leading source of international students in the United States for the 2023-24 academic year, surpassing China. According to the Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange 2024 report released on Monday, India registered a 23% year-over-year increase, sending over 3.3 lakh students to the US.The development mirrors India's performance in UK, where it became the top source of non-European Union students in 2022-23, with a 39% increase to 1.7 lakh students, surpassing China. The growth in Indian students in the US is most notable in graduate programmes, which saw a 19% increase to almost two lakh students, and in optional practical training participation, which surged by 41% to over 97,000.Most Indian students (64.5%) enrolled in public institutions, while the remaining 35.5% attended private universities.As per the global trends in international enrolment, US hosted an all-time high of over 11 lakh international students in 2023-24, a seven percent increase from the previous year.India and China together accounted for over half (54%) of this total. However, while India's numbers surged, China's enrolment declined by four percent to 2.7 lakh students.Indian students' contribution to the US economy in 2023 was significant, generating $11.8 billion, as per the International Student Economic Impact 2023.The percentage of Indian students pursuing mathematics/computer science as per the latest report is 42.9%, followed by 24.5% studying engineering, and 11.2% studying business/management.There are 5.4% of Indian students pursuing physical/life science programmes.Across all international students in the US, 56% pursued STEM fields, with mathematics and computer science (25%) and engineering (19%) being the most popular disciplines. Business and management (14%) and physical and life sciences (8%) follow.International students were distributed across 44 states, with the largest populations in California, New York and Texas. States like Missouri (+35%), Michigan (+14%), and Illinois (+13%) saw the highest growth in student numbers. For Indian students, Texas, New York, California, Massachusetts and Illinois were the top destinations.In 2023, international students made up six percent of the total US higher education population and contributed over $50 billion to the US economy.Sub-Saharan Africa recorded the highest growth rate among all regions, increasing by 13% for the second consecutive year. Among the top 25 countries sending students to US, eight reached record highs - Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Italy, Nepal, Pakistan and Spain.Scott Weinhold, senior bureau official for the US state department's bureau of educational and cultural affairs, emphasised the broader impact of international education: ""The experience of studying in the United States not only shapes the lives of individuals but also the future of our interconnected world.""""The ties formed between the US and international students today are the basis for future business, trade, science, innovation and govt relations.""In 2023-24, over half a million graduate students (5,02,291) studied in the US, marking an eight percent increase.

There were other bidders too. This marks a new beginning as we launch on a US rocket from their soil. The present agreement is only for this launch and we will look at future requirements as and when we need.”This is the first time that NSIL used a US launcher. The PSU has earlier made use of the services of France’s Arianespace. NSIL looks for services abroad when the weight of the satellite is higher than the capacity of Indian launch vehicles.As part of the Indian govt’s space sector reforms announced in 2020, NSIL is mandated to build, launch, own and operate satellites that address service needs on demand.In June 2022, NSIL successfully launched its first demand-driven satellite mission, GSAT-24 (now called GSAT-N1), which is fully leased by TataPlay. “While this is also a dedicated satellite, it is not meant for a single company. There are multiple players in the fray,” an official told TOI.","SpaceX’s Falcon-9 rocket early Tuesday lifted off smoothly from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

"Delhi's 2nd-worst air day on record, SC says Grap-4 to go on till further orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citys-2nd-worst-air-day-on-record-sc-says-grap-4-to-go-on-till-further-orders/articleshow/115430775.cms,"'Provide for more stringent actions under

GRAP III

, IV'

New Delhi: With air pollution in Delhi reaching life-threatening 'severe plus' levels, Supreme Court on Monday directed Delhi and NCR states - UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab - to strictly enforce stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and immediately take a call on measures such as closing schools for all classes, allowing govt and private employees to work from home and shutting industries.It also ordered that these restrictions would continue till further orders from the court, even if AQI drops below 401, the 'severe' category threshold.The judicial crackdown came on a day when Delhi suffered a dystopian nightmare with a thick layer of pungent smoke filling the air. The day's average AQI was 494 at the highest end of 'severe-plus', the worst in eight years and the second-worst on record. The 24-hour average AQI maxed out at 500 at 15 stations at 5pm and citizens were left coughing and teary-eyed even on short exposures to the toxic fumes.The bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih slammed the ""wait and watch"" approach of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in enforcing Grap measures. Noting that grade III measures were enforced 48 hours after AQI level crossed 400 level, it directed that commensurate measures must be enforced immediately after the AQI level crosses the threshold and the commission should not wait for improvement in quality of air on the basis of the met department's forecast. SC administration also issued a circular in the evening advising all, including lawyers and judges to wear masks.Pleading for closure of all classes in schools, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan brought to court's notice that Delhi govt was allowing physical classes for classes 10 and 12, and contended that same number of school buses were running on roads to ferry them. The court, thereafter, ordered, ""States should take an immediate call to stop physical classes of all standards up to class 12.""Meanwhile, UP govt told the SC that it had invoked Grap-4 measures from 8am onwards on Monday.We direct all govts of NCR to strictly implement stage 4 of Grap. All states will immediately constitute teams for monitoring implementations of actions required under stage 4. NCR governments and the Centre will have to immediately take a call on actions provided in clauses 6 (allowing public, municipal and private offices to work on 50% strength and the rest to work from home), 7 (decision on permitting Central govt employee work from home) and 8 (closure of educational institutions, non-emergency commercial activities and plying of vehicles on odd-even basis etc) of stage 4 and place the decision taken on the record before the next date,"" the bench said.The bench also directed CAQM to incorporate more stringent actions in stages 3 and 4 of Grap, and not leave its implementation to the discretion of the government or local authorities. SC said that CAQM's should be preemptive and it should not wait to enforce measures, after senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, said that AQI had breached 400 in November 12 itself but Grap 3 measures were enforced after 48 hours.""From the submissions made across the bar and from minutes of the meeting dated November 13, 2024, we find that the approach adopted by the sub-committee of the commission is contrary to what is observed in paragraph three of this court's order dated October 29, 2018. The direction was to EPCA to take preemptive steps under Grap. The approach adopted by the commission seems to be that they have decided to wait for improvement of AQI and therefore implementation of stage 3 and stage 4 was delayed. This is completely a wrong approach,"" the court said.It also directed the states to create grievance redressal mechanisms to enable the citizens to lodge complaints of violation of actions under stage 4 and ordered them to file an affidavit on compliance of all its directions by Thursday and posted the case for further hearing on November 22.","Air pollution in Delhi reaches life-threatening'severe plus' levels.

Sources said the move will affect about 300 of the board's 7,000 permanent employees. TTD also employs around 14,000 contract workers.The decision has drawn support from various employee unions, which have stated that it aligns with the Andhra Pradesh Endowments Act and TTD Act . ""This should be enforced in totality,"" a union representative said. Upon his appointment as TTD chairman on October 31, Naidu had expressed his stand that only Hindus should run the temple.Over the years, the TTD Act has been amended three times to stipulate that only Hindus should be employed by the temple board and its affiliated institutions. A government order issued in 1989 also mandated that appointments to TTD-administered posts would be restricted to Hindus.Despite these provisions, sources claimed that non-Hindus have continued to work within the organisation. Since the Chandrababu Naidu-led government assumed office in June, complaints were reportedly received from Hindu employees identifying their colleagues from other faiths.TTD's decision comes shortly after Naidu's government alleged that the previous YSRCP administration had permitted the use of ghee with animal fat in the preparation of the temple's iconic Tirupati laddu, sparking a major controversy.The decision is supported by Article 16(5) of the Constitution, which allows institutions of a religious or denominational nature to employ members of their own religion. Similarly, Rule 3 of the AP Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Subordinate Service Rules states that employees of religious institutions must profess the Hindu faith.This legal backing was reinforced in November 2023 by Andhra Pradesh high court when it upheld Rule 3, confirming that trust boards are empowered to mandate service conditions, including the requirement that employees follow the Hindu religion.","TTD chairman BR Naidu confirmed the decision but declined to reveal the exact number of non-Hindu employees.

Agnipath shadow over Army chief's visit to Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-shadow-over-army-chiefs-visit-to-nepal/articleshow/115428469.cms,"NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week to reinforce the deep-rooted bilateral military ties, which have come under a cloud after Kathmandu refused to allow its youth to join the Indian armed forces under the Agnipath scheme , even as China assiduously continues to make deep strategic inroads into the landlocked Himalayan country.Gen Dwivedi, during his visit from Nov 20 to 24, will focus on further cranking up the long-standing close military collaboration between the two armies, ranging from combat exercises and training programmes to modernization and capacity-building.This year alone, for instance, over 300 Nepal Army personnel have been trained in Indian military establishments, while New Delhi has also been supporting Kathmandu in its military modernization by supplying hardware and software, including small arms, vehicles, and advanced training simulators.The scope and complexity of the annual Surya Kiran joint military exercise, the 18th edition of which will be held in Nepal next month, is also being expanded to enhance the interoperability and synergy between the two armies.Gen Dwivedi will also be conferred with the honorary rank of General of Nepal Army during the visit, as per a long-standing tradition. The elephant in the room, however, will be the intractable differences over the recruitment of soldiers for just four years, without pension or ex-servicemen benefits, under the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022.“Taking the Covid-19 pandemic also into account, Nepal-domicile Gorkhas have not been recruited into the Indian Army, including the seven illustrious regiments of the Gorkha Rifles, for almost five years now. This does not augur well for bilateral relations. The two govts must work out a mutually acceptable solution,” a senior officer told TOI.This becomes especially important given China’s fast-expanding arc of influence in Nepal, which has also hopped onto the former’s Belt and Road Initiative. Moreover, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli is slated to head for China early next month on his first bilateral foreign visit, in yet another break from long-standing tradition of visiting India first.It was in 1947 that the Indian Army began recruiting Nepalese Gorkhas under the Tripartite Agreement signed with Nepal and the UK. There are currently around 30,000 Nepali citizens serving in the Indian Army, with another 90,000 ex-servicemen also drawing their pensions from the force.The Gorkha Rifles are now trying to step-up recruitment of Indian-domicile Gorkhas from Darjeeling, Dehradun, Dharamshala and other places, who are supposed to constitute 40% of the troops, as well as some Garhwalis and Kumaonis but are finding it extremely difficult to meet the shortfall.“The future looks bleak. In another 10-11 years, the last of the Nepali Gorkhas will retire from our Army,” another officer said. That will end the rich legacy and strong ties that originally began when Maharaja Ranjit Singh first raised a battalion of Gorkhas to serve in his Army around 1809-1814, with the British Army following suit soon after.","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week.

Today, data is everything... call it a goldmine. Through the caste census, our idea is to conduct an X-ray of all those inhabiting the country to work towards their better inclusion in all streams and not just restrict the country's resources to a few capitalists, which is happening currently under the NDA regime.""

It was indeed a mistake on our part then.""He added, ""BJP is propagating a wrong narrative against me and Congress, but when we say we would end the 50% ceiling of quota, we mean to re-evaluate the quota based on the representation of that particular caste. This can only happen when we conduct a caste census, which is a beautiful idea for the country.""Rahul said they are committed to breaking the 50% reservation ceiling based on caste census data while BJP is trying to end reservation.Gandhi also said two Congress-governed states - Telangana and Karnataka - have already started work in this regard.

Anmol had left the country on a forged passport in April, 2022, a month before the singer was targeted. He had since been living in California along with his associates Goldy Brar and others.National Investigation Agency (NIA) had in Oct announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh on Anmol, shortly after his alleged role emerged in Baba Siddique's murder. Mumbai police has approached the court to initiate the process for Anmol's extradition and also sent a communication to ministry of external affairs through MHA.Anmol's notoriety extends to a litany of crimes, with a staggering 18 cases registered against him for a range of offenses, including extortion - the long sheet underscoring his reputation as a formidable figure in the underworld.Anmol aka Bhanu, a resident of Fazilka in Punjab, is named in two chargesheets filed by NIA in cases registered in 2022. Last year, NIA had filed a chargesheet against almost a dozen individuals, including Lawrence and Anmol. The chargesheet had alleged that the accused were part of a larger criminal conspiracy aimed at unleashing a reign of terror and carrying out targeted assassinations of prominent social and religious heads, film personalities, singers and businessmen.","The FBI is learnt to be in the process of verifying his identity, possibly through a voice sample or a DNA match. Anmol, who has a red notice issued against him by Interpol, is accused in several high-profile cases, including the recent murder of Baba Siddique and the firing outside Salman Khan's residence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115430523,imgsize-380140,width-400,resizemode-4/115430523.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhi NCR on Monday continued to grapple with alarmingly high pollution levels, worsened by stubble burning in the neighbouring states. The AQI level in the city remained dangerously high. Notable readings included 919 in Mundka, 762 in ITI Jahangirpuri, and 624 in Anand Vihar, placing these areas in the 'severe-plus' category.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) imposed the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage 4 in Delhi NCR from Monday after the city's daily average AQI rose sharply to 441 by 4 PM on Sunday, and further escalated to 457 by 7 PM, prompting an emergency meeting of the GRAP Sub-Committee.The Stage-IV response encompasses an 8-point action plan designed to mitigate the pollution crisis. Key measures include banning the entry of trucks into Delhi, except for those carrying essential commodities or providing essential services.A bench comprising Justices Abhay S. Oka and Augustine George Masih, in its order, said, ""We direct all governments of the NCR area to strictly implement Stage 4 of GRAP. All states will immediately constitute teams for monitoring the implementation of actions required under Stage 4.""""The NCR state governments and the central government will have to immediately take a call on actions provided in clauses 6, 7, and 8 of Stage 4 and place the decision taken on record before the next date,"" the top court added.The top court also directed the Delhi government as well as other NCR governments to create a grievance redressal mechanism to enable citizens to lodge complaints about violations of actions under Stage 4.""We direct the Delhi government and other governments to create grievance redressal mechanisms to enable citizens to lodge complaints of violations under Stage 4.

The deceased have been identified as Keerthana N, 21, Nishitha M D, 21, and Parvathi S, 20.Police commissioner Anupam Agrawal said it is suspected one of the women ventured into the pool's deep end and began to drown. To rescue her, the other two entered the area but were unable to stay afloat. The women, perhaps, did not know how to swim, police said. The pool is 4ft deep at its shallow end and 5.5ft at the deep end. Inflated rubber tubes were also seen nearby.The police commissioner said resorts with pools are required to adhere to strict safety protocols, including provision of life-saving equipment, deployment of lifeguards and clear signage indicating the pool's depth. But no lifeguard was present, and the pool's depth was not clearly marked.The resort claimed there were seven employees on duty when the accident occurred.But CCTV footage shows no staff member present on the pool premises, a senior officer said.

"Farmers in distress, allow them to survive, SC tells Karnataka",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmers-in-distress-allow-them-to-survive-sc-tells-karnataka/articleshow/115428420.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday reprimanded Karnataka govt for challenging a high court decision to enhance the rate compensation for acquisition of farmers' lands, dismissed its appeal and said the state, where thousands of farmers die by suicide annually, must allow the distressed community to survive.The case related to the acquisition of lands of farmers in October 2005 for construction of Hipparagi major irrigation project on Krishna River. The Special Land Acquisition Officer determined the compensation at the rate of Rs 59,000 per acre of irrigated land and Rs 24,557 per acre of dry land.The reference court enhanced it to Rs 1,70,00 per acre in Aug 2009. When the appeal against the determination was pending before the Karnataka HC, the irrigation department decided to settle the pending cases by awarding compensation at the rate of Rs 3,69,000 per acre for acquisition of land in the year 2004-05, with 5% escalation for subsequent year acquisitions.But the HC enhanced it to Rs 5 lakh per acre in March 2021 and in December 2022, and later extended the enhanced rate of compensation to other farmers whose lands were acquired saying they all fall in the same category of persons whose lands were acquired for the Hipparagi project.Finding that the state was ready to argue despite the SC expressing its disinclination to entertain the appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan said, ""You (the state) acquire their lands but are not ready to pay them a fair compensation. The farmers are a distressed lot.""""If you do not want to pay the enhanced compensation, why don't you return the lands to them in exercise of your eminent domain powers,"" the bench said before dismissing the state's appeal.The SC's observation that the farmers in the state are a distressed lot is borne out from the state revenue department's statistics, which recently said that between April 1, 2023, and August 4, 2024, as many as 1,216 farmers have died by suicide.Statistics also reveal that between 2013 and 2022 as many as 8,245 farmers have died by suicide, worst hit districts being Belagavi, Haveri, Dharwad, Chikkamagaluru and Kalaburgi. The reasons behind the farmers distress are drought, crop damage and the menace of debt. The state had argued before the SC that the HC erred in condoning a delay of 11 years in filing of the petition seeking parity and entitlement to enhanced compensation, without the petitioners showing sufficient cause for delay in approaching the HC.The state had also said that the petitioners before HC had already received enhanced compensation as decided by the reference court and could not be entitled to the rate of compensation which was fixed after passage of almost a decade.""Judgments of this nature (from the HC) would entitle parties a right to approach the court at any point of time to seek enhanced compensation. Such an exercise would set at naught the principle that there must be quietus to litigation,"" the state had said arguing that such entitlement to enhanced compensation would cast a huge financial liability on the project proponent.",The Supreme Court reprimanded Karnataka govt for challenging a high court decision to enhance the rate compensation for acquisition of farmers' lands.

, MP from Mumbai and a key BJP functionary, is confident of the

Mahayuti

alliance winning the Maharashtra polls, arguing people will vote for a coalition that has delivered. Excerpts:

How do you see the prospects in the election? Given the churn isn't the voter confused between

MVA

and Mahayuti and their candidates?

There is a feeling among voters that a local party which was in power was ousted.

Given the stand taken by Ajit Pawar on some of the issues, including the ""batenge to kitenge"" slogan, doesn't that make him sound like not such a reliable partner?

So the statements, including the one on the meeting between Sharad Pawar and Amit Shah in 2019...

There is a controversy over the meeting at Adani's place...

Ladli Bahin allowance will be increased to Rs 2,100. How feasible is it to sustain this expense without impacting other development expenditure and isn't this dole or a revadi?

Who will be your CM face after the election should Mahayuti emerge victorious?

There is a feeling that a lot of projects which would have come to Maharashtra have gone to Gujarat.

The writing on the wall is very clear, voters have made up their mind for continuity, whether it is in Marathwada, western Maharashtra, Mumbai. The mood is for a govt that delivers. They recognise that they want to have a govt that works closely in alignment with the central govt. They have experienced two and a half years of a non-performing govt under Mr Uddhav Thackeray ... the CM didn't even go to office. They have seen the way PM Modi, in the first term Fadnavis govt, and then the Shinde-Fadnavis-Ajit Dada govt delivered on infrastructure, slum rehabilitation, and on providing a better quality of life.That was the problem of Congress and not of BJP or Mahayuti. Mahayuti is united very strongly, we had no issues with seat transfer, save a few minor issues. But MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) seems to be a pretty discontent grouping, with no ideological moorings. Mr. Uddhav Thackeray, who once stood for Hindutva, has completely given up the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray and gone and sat in the lap of of Sharad Pawar and Congress. Here, we see the pitiable state in which Mr. Uddhav Thackeray is in, having to even accept in writing conditionalities of support demanded by the Ulemas. The shameful demands have been accepted even by Sharad Pawar and Congress, which has hurt the people of Maharashtra, and they have made up their mind to teach a lesson to MVA.Not at all, the understanding among coalition partners is very strong. His line is no different from the line of all the partners. We may have differences on one or two candidates.I don't think so. The PM is on record to say that ""hum ek hain to safe hain"". He has given a strong message that Congress and MVA, which is trying to divide society on the basis of religion, caste, language has to be defeated, otherwise neither is Maharashtra safe, nor is the country.It's a non-issue. Location hardly matters, substance is important. Mr Sharad Pawar, who is today opposing Mr Ajit Pawar and Mahayuti, himself was desirous and all MLAs were desirous of joining Mahayuti.It's a recognition of the wonderful work our sisters and daughters are doing. It is in the interest of making them self-reliant, empowering them and making sure they don't have to depend on someone for their small day to day needs. This is an empowerment tool and not a dole.It has already been clarified by Amit Shah. Today, the CM is Mr Eknath Shinde and after the election as is the normal process, all three parties will sit down and decide.It is a completely unfounded allegation, and baseless. Maharashtra is number 1 in FDI, infrastructure investments and will continue to be number 1. Toyota is investing in a township... India's largest port is coming up at Wadhawan, a new airport is coming up in Mumbai. We are working in all areas.","Union commerce & industry minister is confident of Mahayuti winning the Maharashtra polls. He argues people will vote for a coalition that has delivered.

NEW DELHI: Campaigning came to a halt on Monday for high-stakes assembly polls in Maharashtra and the second phase in Jharkhand on November 20, the two states being more than just electoral battles for BJP and Congress, leaders of their respective alliances, with results poised to shape their political narrative and future trajectory. The match-up follows BJP's stunning come-from-behind victory in Haryana and has increased the stake for Congress and its allies to win the two battles in order to regain the momentum they seemed to have after paring down BJP's Lok Sabha tally.BJP obviously wants to build on the advantage it grabbed in Haryana.In Maharashtra, BJP, through its Mahayuti alliance with Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) and NCP (Ajit Pawar faction), is aiming to hold on to the state. The state had witnessed significant political realignments, with splits within its major political entities, creating a complex chessboard for parties to manoeuvre.BJP has highlighted its governance through development projects and economic policies. The 'Ladki Bahin' scheme was a centrepiece, promising financial assistance to women, aiming to capture the support of this significant voter demographic.Urban areas like Mumbai saw BJP campaign on law enforcement and anti-terrorism, while also subtly promoting its cultural nationalist agenda to consolidate Hindu votes with slogans like 'ek hain to safe hain' and 'batenge to katenge'. BJP has positioned itself as the stable anchor of Mahayuti, promising governance free from the turbulence of internal party disputes.BJP on Monday launched a new ad campaign attacking the opposition MVA and urging people to 'say no to Congress'. The campaign highlighted various incidents from the past, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, and the lynching of sadhus in Palghar when Maha Vikas Aghadi was in office. BJP is contesting 149 seats, Shiv Sena 81 and Ajit Pawar-led NC for the 288-member House.MVA was well ahead of the Mahayuti in Lok Sabha polls and the alliance is hoping that the momentum is carried forward into these elections.The polls, moreover, will determine which is the real Shiv Sena and the real NCP, so a lot is at stake for Eknath Shinde, Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar. It is because of the decisive nature of this poll that Uddhav has been harping on the 'gaddar' (betrayer) line to draw the sympathy vote, while Pawar Sr has been urging voters not just to defeat his nephew's NCP but to defeat it big.",Campaigning came to a halt on Monday for high-stakes assembly polls in Maharashtra and the second phase in Jharkhand.

It remains to be seen if EC will deem the violations serious enough to warrant an FIR.The Congress had complained against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for allegedly labelling Congress as anti-SC/ST/OBC, and sought a ban on campaigning by the two for the remainder of the campaign period. The BJP on the other hand complained to EC about Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's remarks during campaign alleging that BJP was promoting RSS, letting Gujarat take away key investment projects from other states and also compromising the independence of Constitutional and statutory bodies like EC, CBI, ED etc. It had sought a restraint on Rahul ""handing out"" such ""lies"" and demanded an FIR against Rahul and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge in this regard.","The Election Commission has granted the BJP and Congress an additional week to submit their respective comments on complaints filed against one another.

The term ""50 khoke"" (cash boxes) was used after Chief Minister Eknath Shinde defected from the undivided Shiv Sena to form a government with the BJP in 2022.Speaking at a rally for candidates of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Vasai near Mumbai, Kharge, without taking names of MLAs who supported Shinde, claimed each person was offered Rs 50 crore to switch allegiance and urged voters to send a clear message in the November 20 elections .Polling will take place on November 20 in 288 assembly constituencies in Maharashtra, and votes will be counted on November 23.He criticised the BJP-led Mahayuti for indulging in divisive politics through its slogans ""batenge toh katenge"" (divided, we shall perish) and ""ek hain toh safe hai"" (we are safe if we are one).Invoking Maharashtra's legacy of legendary personalities such as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Shahu Maharaj, Jyotirao Phule, and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, the Congress leader warned that some factions are attempting to fragment the society along caste and religious lines.""The Congress and MVA stand for unity and the principles of Dr Ambedkar's Constitution, while the BJP seeks to create divisions,"" he asserted.Kharge denounced the government's economic policies, claiming that the BJP-led coalition has severely impacted the lives of farmers, workers, women, and youth.""Under this government, inflation and unemployment are at an all-time high, and farmers are struggling to get fair prices for their produce,"" he said.He accused the BJP of corruption, alleging Maharashtra faced significant financial wrongdoing in the last two-and-a-half years.He said the MVA would deliver on its promises through its ""5 Guarantees"" and ""Maharashtra Nama"" initiatives and predicted the Mahayuti's end on November 20.Echoing Kharge's sentiments, Congress leader Anant Gadgil criticised the Narendra Modi government for neglecting Maharashtra's needs.Despite Maharashtra being the largest contributor to the national exchequer, it received only Rs 8,000 crore. At the same time, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh were allotted much more, he said, questioning the ruling Mahayuti's silence on this disparity.Gadgil also criticised the government's approach to drug control, pointing out that there has been a significant rise in drug seizures while PM Modi promised a ""drug-free India"" by 2047.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge urged voters in Maharashtra to defeat leaders who he alleged had accepted substantial bribes to change allegiance.
